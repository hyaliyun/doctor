In the case of the coronavirus epidemic, quarantine was also recommended and implemented as a significant guideline to prevent the disease. However, despite the benefits of quarantine, there are also complications and problems. Objective: The present study aimed to investigate the health effects of quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This study was conducted as a literature review through searching the databases Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct for papers published before July 2020. The research was conducted based on the keywords \\"Coronavirus,\\" \\"COVID-19,\\" and \\"quarantine.\\" The references of the papers were also reviewed to find the ones not found in the databases. The guidelines published by reputable organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were used in this study. Results: Although quarantine is applied as an important and primary solution in the outbreak of epidemics, in cases of pandemics, it may not be free of negative effects on individuals and public health. However, because of the need to reopen and restart social and economic activities, some changes should be made in lifestyles and work activities. Using cyberspace and telework can be helpful. As the findings showed, COVID-19 bubbles can be used to restore social communications. Conclusion: Using masks, avoiding unnecessary gatherings, complying with personal and social hygiene, and respecting social distancing can be valuable solutions that, if implemented properly, can decrease the rate of the disease significantly. It is also emphasized that quarantine is still necessary and important as the best solution for sick people and individuals who are suspected carriers of the disease.

Many isolates of the predominant Asian community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) lineage ST59 harbor seb, implying a significant role of SEB in the observed hypervirulence of this lineage. We created an isogenic seb mutant in a representative ST59 isolate and assessed its virulence potential in mouse infection models. We detected a significant contribution of seb to systemic ST59 infection that was associated with a cytokine storm. Our results directly demonstrate that seb contributes to S. aureus pathogenesis, suggesting value of including SEB as a target in multi-pronged anti-staphylococcal drug development strategies.

Despite this, the basis for the disease progression is incompletely understood. To investigate the effect of co-infection on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) we analysed the expression of clinically important pro-inflammatory and immune-modulatory cytokines. IAV infection or treatment with supernatants from IAV-infected cell cultures resulted in priming of the DCs which subsequently influenced the production of IL-12p70, as well as IL-6, following SP infection. Co-infection of the same cell was not required but this effect was dependent on the time, dose and duration of the infections, as well as pathogen viability, bacterial uptake and endosome acidification. Bacterially infected cells were characterized as the main producers of IL-12p70. Finally, we showed that type I interferons were primarily responsible for the priming of IL-12p70 that was observed by infection with IAV.

Ensuring procedures are efficient and self-explanatory is the key to optimising recruitment. Trial recruitment software that integrates with the electronic health record to support and partially automate procedures is becoming more common. If it works well, such software can support greater participation and more efficient trial designs. An innovative electronic trial recruitment and outcomes software was designed to support recruitment to the Runny Ear randomised controlled trial, comparing topical, oral and delayed antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media with discharge in children. A qualitative evaluation investigated the views and experiences of primary care staff using this trial software. METHODS: Staff were purposively sampled in relation to site, role and whether the practice successfully recruited patients. In-depth interviews were conducted using a flexible topic guide, audio recorded and transcribed. Data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Sixteen staff were interviewed, including GPs, practice managers, information technology (IT) leads and research staff. GPs wanted trial software that automatically captures patient data. However, the experience of getting the software to work within the limited and complex IT infrastructure of primary care was frustrating and time consuming. Installation was reliant on practice level IT expertise, which varied between practices. Although most had external IT support, this rarely included supported for research IT. Arrangements for approving new software varied across practices and often, but not always, required authorisation from Clinical Commissioning Groups. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care IT systems are not solely under the control of individual practices or CCGs or the National Health Service. Rather they are part of a complex system that spans all three and is influenced by semi-autonomous stakeholders operating at different levels. This led to time consuming and sometimes insurmountable barriers to installation at the practice level. These need to be addressed if software supporting efficient research in primary care is to become a reality.

This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal specimens of these patients according to their clinical characteristics. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and three Chinese biomedical databases were searched up to 25 March 2020 with no language restriction. We included original observational studies that reported the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal specimens of COVID-19 patients. Two separate reviewers conducted the review. Metaprop was adopted to conduct a meta-analysis of prevalence with variances stabilized by Freeman-Tukey Double Arcsine Transformation. A random-effects model was used. Heterogeneity across different studies was computed using Cochran's Q test and chi square statistics. RESULTS: From 17 studies, the pooled detection rate of fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 43.7% (95% CI 32.6%-55.0%) and 33.7% (95% C.I. 33.7%, 95% C.I. 20.1%-48.8%) by patient and number of specimens as a unit count, respectively. Female individuals (59.6% vs. 53.5%), those who presented with gastrointestinal symptoms (77.1% vs. 57.7%), and patients with more severe disease (68.3% vs. 34.6%) tended to have a higher detection rate. DISCUSSION: A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients carry SARS-CoV-2 in their intestinal tract. Feces being a self-collected specimen bears a potential to improve case identification in community, especially for young children where proper respiratory sampling at home is difficult. Specific infection control strategies focusing on spread via fecal contamination and faulty toilet drainage are urgently needed.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal specimens of patients with confirmed COVID-19: A meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Companies have shown social responsibility towards their stakeholders through corporate philanthropic efforts, known as Corporate Social Responsibility (?CSR?). These efforts aim to maximise the welfare of the stakeholders and take care of the needs of society.

Across all vaccine platforms, adjuvant formulations have been shown to enhance desirable immune responses such as higher antibody titers and increased functional activity. Although no vaccine formulation has yet succeeded in eliciting broad neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1, the ability of adjuvants to direct the immune response to immunogens suggests they will be critically important in any successful HIV-1 vaccine.

Plans are now being formulated for restarting bariatric surgery. The aim of this survey is to capture the practice during the pandemic and the readiness to restart to provide a framework to deal with the backlog of bariatric cases. METHOD: A survey was delivered to consultant surgeon members of the British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society and non-bariatric surgery consultant members of the Association of Upper GI Surgeons. RESULTS: The survey elicited a response rate of 40% (n = 66) among bariatric surgeons and 15.5% (n = 34) between non-bariatric surgeons. The average question response rate was 93% (88-100%). Most of the elective bariatric surgeries and clinics were cancelled early after declaration of the pandemic. Remote technologies for patient education evolved and were used heavily during the pandemic. The average cancelled elective bariatric surgery operations per week was 9. Nearly a quarter of responders reported performing emergency bariatric surgery during the pandemic. Most of the bariatric surgeons reported being ready to restart the service within 1-2 months. Responders recommended using private sector beds to increase NHS capacity and using the link between obesity and poor COVID-19 outcomes to push for prioritisation of bariatric patients.

The only approved diagnostic test to accompany radiographic evaluation is reverse transcription PCR. However, the applicability of this test in diagnosis and surveillance is challenged by a global shortage of reagents and the lack of well-equipped laboratories with specialized staff in several low- and middle-income countries. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification and CRISPR-based diagnostic assays have developed and expected to play a role however, their accuracy is still inferior to the recommended PCR approach. The need for the development of accurate and rapid diagnostic assays became apparent. Immunodiagnostic tests and other molecular approaches were developed and tested. Other recently developed point-of-care molecular tests are expected to be helpful in pandemic management as no particular skills are required from the operator. Fortunately, a number of serological tests have been granted authorization for use under the emergency situation by the US FDA for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.

In the present study, we conducted an in depth analysis of the SARS-COV-2 nucleocapsid to identify potential targets that may allow identification of therapeutic targets. METHODS: The SARS-COV-2 N protein subcellular localization and physicochemical property was analyzed by PSORT II Prediction and ProtParam tool. Then SOPMA tool and swiss-model was applied to analyze the structure of N protein. Next, the biological function was explored by mass spectrometry analysis and flow cytometry. At last, its potential phosphorylation sites were analyzed by NetPhos3.1 Server and PROVEAN PROTEIN. RESULTS: SARS-COV-2 N protein composed of 419 aa, is a 45.6 kDa positively charged unstable hydrophobic protein. It has 91 and 49% similarity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and is predicted to be predominantly a nuclear protein. It mainly contains random coil (55.13%) of which the tertiary structure was further determined with high reliability (95.76%).

However, little has been done to account for the potential confounding effects of these factors. Using a large multivariate analysis, this study illuminates modulators of COVID-19 incidence and mortality in U.S. counties while controlling for risk factors across multiple domains. Methods: Data on COVID-19 and various risk factors in all U.S. counties was collected from publicly available data sources through April 14, 2020. Counties with at least 50 COVID-19 cases were included in case analyses and those with at least 10 deaths were included in mortality models. The 661 counties meeting inclusion criteria for number of cases were grouped into quartiles and comparisons of risk factors were made using t-tests between the highest and lowest quartiles. Similar comparisons for 217 counties were made for above average and below average deaths/100,000. Adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent effects of factors that significantly impacted cases and deaths. Results: Univariate analyses demonstrated numerous significant differences between cohorts for both cases and deaths. Risk factors associated with increased cases and/or deaths per 100,000 included increased GDP per capita, decreased social distancing, increased age, increased percent Black, decreased percent Hispanic, decreased percent Asian, decreased health, increased poverty, increased diabetes, increased coronary heart disease, increased physical inactivity, increased alcohol consumption, increased tobacco use, and decreased access to primary care. Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated Black race is a risk factor for worse COVID-19 outcome independent of comorbidities, poverty, access to health care, and other mitigating factors. Lower daily temperatures was also an independent risk factor in case load but not deaths. Conclusions: U.S. counties with a higher proportion of Black residents are associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. However, the various suggested mechanisms, such as socioeconomic and healthcare predispositions, did not appear to drive the effect of race in our model. Counties with higher average daily temperatures are also associated with decreased COVID-19 cases but not deaths. Several theories are posited to explain these findings, including prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.

Brazil is the main exporter of chicken meat in the world and is also responsible for large waste of poultry litter. The country, likewise, figures as top 5 producers of green coconut, which results in considerable volumes of waste, since 80%-85% of the fruit is unusable. This work analyzes the ammonia concentration profile of two bedding substrates for raising broiler, to know, coir-husk fiber and a commonly used pine wood shavings in a Brazilian climate. A differential home-made photoacoustic cell combined with a diode laser was employed for sensing ammonia at trace levels. Such combination confers selectivity as well as lower limits of detection to the system. The chemical compositions pH, N, C, Ca, Mg, P[Formula: see text] O[Formula: see text] and K[Formula: see text] O were also determined, in addition to the moisture, dry matter and mineral content of substrates and litters. NH[Formula: see text] concentrations varied from (0.9  0.3) ppmv to (19  3) ppmv and from (2.1  0.5) ppmv to (21  3) ppmv for the coir-husk fiber and wood shavings substrates, respectively. Results showed the feasibility of using coconut fiber as poultry litter in regions where this material is a common waste. Moreover, as NH[Formula: see text] concentrations were lower for coconut fiber bedding compared to shavings, this coir-husk fiber is a potential residue to guarantee the environmental sustainability by Brazilian poultry farming. Coir-husk fibers presented significantly higher amounts of P and K in comparison to pine wood. NH[Formula: see text] profiles revealed that coir-husk fiber emitted lower quantities than wood shavings. Besides, a delay on the NH[Formula: see text] emission pattern was clearly seen when the coconut waste was the bedding material. Such a tendency was confirmed by the logistic model. Our findings, in turn, make the coir-husk an environmentally friendly alternative low-cost product for poultry litter as well as its potential use as natural fertilizer. The later deserves attention since there is a need to accurately assess the emissions of methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide during the composting process.

The N501Y, 69-70del, K417N, and E484K SARS-CoV-2 mutations have been documented among the most relevant due to their potential pathogenic biological effects. This study aimed to design, validate, and propose a fast real-time RT-qPCR assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 mutations with possible clinical and epidemiological relevance in the Mexican population. Methods: Targeting spike (S) gene mutations of SARS-CoV-2 (N501Y, 69-70del, K417N, and E484K), specific primers, and probes for three specific quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assays were designed, and validated using Sanger sequencing. These assays were applied in clinical samples of 1060 COVID-19 patients from Jalisco Mexico. Results: In silico analyzes showed high specificity of the three assays. Amplicons of samples were confirmed through sequencing. The screening of samples of COVID-19 patients allowed the identification of the E484K mutation in nine individuals and the identification of P.2 Brazilian variant in Mexico. Conclusion: This work provides low-cost RT-qPCR assays for rapid screening and molecular surveillance of mutations with potential clinical impact.

Our aim was to determine the sensitivity of saliva versus swabs collected by healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients themselves to assess whether saliva detection can be offered as a cost-effective, risk-free method of SARS-CoV-2 detection. METHODS: This study was conducted in a hospital involving outpatients and hospitalized patients. A total of 3018 outpatients were tested. Of these, 200 qRT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were recruited for further study. In addition, 101 SARS-CoV-2-positive hospitalized patients with symptoms were also enrolled in the study. From outpatients, HCWs collected nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), saliva were obtained. From inpatients, HCWs collected swabs, patient-collected swabs, and saliva were obtained. qRT-PCR was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 by TAQPATH assay to determine the sensitivity of saliva detection. Sensitivity, specificity and positive/negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of detecting SARS-CoV-2 were calculated using MedCalc. RESULTS: Of 3018 outpatients (asymptomatic: 2683, symptomatic: 335) tested by qRT-PCR, 200 were positive (males: 140, females: 60; aged 37.9  12.8 years; (81 asymptomatic, 119 symptomatic). Of these, saliva was positive in 128 (64%); 39 of 81 asymptomatic (47%),89 of 119 symptomatic patients (74.8%). Sensitivity of detection was 60.9% (55.4C66.3%, CI 95%), with a negative predictive value of 36%(32.9C39.2%, CI 95%).Among 101 hospitalized patients (males:65, females: 36; aged 53.48  15.6 years), with HCW collected NPS as comparator, sensitivity of saliva was 56.1% (47.5C64.5, CI 95%), specificity 63.5%(50.4C75.3, CI95%) with PPV of 77.2% and NPV of 39.6% and that of self-swab was 52.3%(44C60.5%, CI95%), specificity 56.6% (42.3C70.2%, CI95%) with PPV 77.2% and NPV29.7%. Comparison of positivity with the onset of symptoms revealed highest detection in saliva on day 3 after onset of symptoms. Additionally, only saliva was positive in 13 (12.8%) hospitalized patients. CONCLUSION: Saliva which is easier to collect than nasopharyngeal swab is a viable alternate to detect SARS-COV-2 in symptomatic patients in the early stage of onset of symptoms. Although saliva is currently not recommended for screening asymptomatic patients, optimization of collection and uniform timing of sampling might improve the sensitivity enabling its use as a screening tool at community level.","output":"Comparison of saliva with healthcare workers- and patient-collected swabs in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a large cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is little research on how nationalism is adopted and deployed to foster but also to challenge sex-, gender- and HIV-related stigma in Thailand and other nation states across Southeast Asia.

IoT-based wearable body sensor can be used widely to control and track patient conditions in both towns and cities using an internal network, thus minimize pressure and tension on healthcare professionals, eliminating medical faults, reducing workload and medical staff productivity, reducing long-term healthcare costs, and enhancing patient satisfaction during COVID-19 pandemic. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"IoT-Based Wearable Body Sensor Network for COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Undoubtedly, the construction of the biomechanical geometry systems with the help of computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has made a significant advancement in studying in vitro numerical models as accurately as possible. However, some simplifying assumptions in the computational studies of the respiratory system have caused errors and deviations from the in vivo actual state. The most important of these hypotheses is how to generate volume from the point cloud exported from CT or MRI images, not paying attention to the wall thickness and its effect in computational fluid dynamic method, statistical logic of aerosol trap in software; and most importantly, the viscoelastic effect of respiratory tract wall in living tissue pointed in the fluidCstructure interaction method. So that applying the viscoelastic dynamic mesh effect in the form of the moving deforming mesh can be very effective in achieving more appropriate response quality. Also, changing the volume fraction of the pulmonary extracellular matrix constituents leads to changes in elastic modulus (storage modulus) and the viscous modulus (loss modulus) of lung tissue.

The answer needs to be determined separately for each surgical and procedure suite because those variables vary both among facilities and among operating rooms or procedure rooms within facilities. In this study, we consider statistical designs to assess how many rooms a facility can reliably (90% chance) disinfect overnight using an ultraviolet light disinfection robot system. Methods We used 133,927 observed disinfection times from 700 rooms as a population from which repeated samples were drawn with replacement in Monte-Carlo simulations. We used eight-hour and 10-hour shift lengths being multiples of 40 hours for full-time hourly employees. Results One possible strategy that we examined was to estimate total disinfection times by estimating the mean for each room and then summing up the means. However, that did not correctly answer the question of how many rooms can reliably be available for the next days first case. Summing up a percentile (e.g., 90%) instead also was inaccurate, because the proper percentile depended on the number of rooms. A suitable strategy is a brief trial (e.g., nine nights or 19 nights) with the endpoint being the daily number of rooms disinfected. Empirically, the smallest count of rooms disinfected among nine nights or the second smallest count among 19 nights are 10(th )percentiles (i.e., 90% probability that at least that number of rooms can be disinfected in the future). The drawback is that while this approach gives the probability of a night with fewer rooms disinfected, it does not give information as to how many fewer rooms may either skip ultraviolet decontamination or start late the next workday because disinfection was not completed. Our simulations showed that there is a substantial probability (95%) of at most two rooms fewer or one room greater than the 10(th) percentile with a nine-night trial and one room fewer or greater with a 19-night trial. Conclusions Because probability distributions of disinfection times are heterogeneous both among rooms and among treatments for the same room, each facility should plan to perform its own trial of nine nights or 19 nights. This will provide results that are within two rooms or one room of the correct answer in the long term. This information can be used when planning purchasing decisions, leasing, and technician staffing decisions.","output":"Statistical Design of Overnight Trials for the Evaluation of the Number of Operating Rooms That Can Be Disinfected by an Ultraviolet Light Disinfection Robotic System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"University life has changed profoundly due to social distancing measures to control the spread of COVID-19.

Moreover, they experienced negative emotions, mostly concern and anger, during the lockdown. T-test showed that female respondents experienced strong negative emotions like fear, panic and despair to a higher degree than male students who were more optimistic about the pandemic. Surprisingly, the students did not exercise outdoors every day even though it was allowed during the 42-day quarantine. In addition, they used mostly television and scientific articles to obtain information about COVID-19. The results presented in this study offer insights into university students experience with the pandemic and reveal their reaction to remote education.

Efficient diagnosis and treatment are crucial to combat the disease. Computer-interpretable guidelines (CIGs) can aid the broad global adoption of evidence-based diagnosis and treatment knowledge. However, currently, no internationally shareable CIG exists. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to establish a rapid CIG development and dissemination approach and apply it to develop a shareable CIG for COVID-19. METHODS: A 6-step rapid CIG development and dissemination approach was designed and applied. Processes, roles, and deliverable artifacts were specified in this approach to eliminate ambiguities during development of the CIG. The Guideline Definition Language (GDL) was used to capture the clinical rules. A CIG for COVID-19 was developed by translating, interpreting, annotating, extracting, and formalizing the Chinese COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guideline. A prototype application was implemented to validate the CIG. RESULTS: We used 27 archetypes for the COVID-19 guideline. We developed 18 GDL rules to cover the diagnosis and treatment suggestion algorithms in the narrative guideline. The CIG was further translated to object data model and Drools rules to facilitate its use by people who do not employ the non-openEHR archetype. The prototype application validated the correctness of the CIG with a public data set. Both the GDL rules and Drools rules have been disseminated on GitHub.

To start with antiviral assessment, we first selected and deeply analyzed four different SARS-CoV-2 genotypes, common in most countries and carrying the wild type or mutated spike protein. When inhibition of the viral infection was tested in vitro with four viral clades, Ti3C2T x in particular, was able to significantly reduce infection only in SARS-CoV-2/clade GR infected Vero E6 cells. This difference in the antiviral activity, among the four viral particles tested, highlights the importance of considering the viral genotypes and mutations while testing antiviral activity of potential drugs and nanomaterials. Among the other MXenes tested, Mo2Ti2C3T x also showed antiviral properties. Proteomic, functional annotation analysis and comparison to the already published SARS-CoV-2 protein interaction map revealed that MXene-treatment exerts specific inhibitory mechanisms. Envisaging future antiviral MXene-based drug nano-formulations and considering the central importance of the immune response to viral infections, the immune impact of MXenes was evaluated on human primary immune cells by flow cytometry and single-cell mass cytometry on 17 distinct immune subpopulations. Moreover, 40 secreted cytokines were analyzed by Luminex technology. MXene immune profiling revealed i) the excellent bio and immune compatibility of the material, as well as the ability of MXene ii) to inhibit monocytes and iii) to reduce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect elicited by MXene.

We analyzed inpatient data on Influenza-associated hospitalizations (IAH), selected complications and risk factors, and their related direct costs for Germany during ten consecutive years. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cost-of-illness study on patients with laboratory-confirmed IAH (ICD-10-GM code J09/J10 as primary diagnosis) by ICD-10-GM-based remote data query using the Hospital Statistics database of the German Federal Statistical Office. Clinical data and associated direct costs of hospital treatment are presented stratified by demographic and clinical variables. RESULTS: Between January 2010 to December 2019, 156,097 persons were hospitalized due to laboratory-confirmed Influenza (J09/J10 primary diagnosis). The annual cumulative incidence was low in 2010, 2012 and 2014 (1.3 to 3.1 hospitalizations per 100,000 persons) and high in 2013 and 2015-2019 (12.6 to 60.3). Overall direct per patient hospitalization costs were mean (SD) 3521 EUR ( 8896) and median (IQR) 1805 EUR (1502; 2694), with the highest mean costs in 2010 (mean 8965 EUR  26,538) and the lowest costs in 2012 (mean 2588 EUR  6153). Mean costs were highest in 60-69 year olds, and in 50-59, 70-79 and 40-49 year olds; they were lowest in 10-19 year olds. Increased costs were associated with conditions such as diabetes (frequency 15.0%; 3.45-fold increase compared to those without diabetes), adiposity (3.3%; 2.09-fold increase) or immune disorders (5.6%; 1.88-fold increase) and with Influenza-associated complications such as Influenza pneumonia (24.3%; 1.95-fold), bacterial pneumonia (6.3%; 3.86-fold), ARDS (1.2%; 10.90-fold increase) or sepsis (2.3%; 8.30-fold). Estimated overall costs reported for the 10-year period were 549.6 Million euros (95% CI 542.7-556.4 million euros). CONCLUSION: We found that the economic burden of IAH in Germany is substantial, even when considering solely laboratory-confirmed IAH reported as primary diagnosis. The highest costs were found in the elderly, patients with certain underlying risk factors and patients who required advanced life support treatment, and median and mean costs showed considerable variations between single years.

The aim of this study was to determine levels of IL-6 and assess its usefulness as indicator of mortality among COVID-19 patients from Mexico. METHODS: A cohort study among 38 adults (28 men, 10 women) was carried out in the Regional High Specialty Hospital of the Yucatan Peninsula in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. Demographic and clinical biochemistry data were collected. The serum levels of IL-6 were measured in each patient by specific immunoassays. RESULTS: High frequency of mortality (36.84%) was found in the sample. The average age of individuals that non-survive was significantly higher (59.71  13.83 years) than the survival group (43.29  11.80 years). Serum levels of IL-6 were significantly higher in patients that did not survive. A correlation between IL-6 levels with lymphocyte count, LDH, CRP and procaciltonin was found. The optimal cutoff value of IL-6 was 30.95 pg/mL with high sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that level of IL-6 is an indicator of mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Mexico.","output":"Serum IL-6: A potential biomarker of mortality among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current global systemic crisis reveals how globalised societies are unprepared to face a pandemic. Beyond the dramatic loss of human life, the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered widespread disturbances in health, social, economic, environmental and governance systems in many countries across the world. Resilience describes the capacities of natural and human systems to prevent, react to and recover from shocks. Societal resilience to the current COVID-19 pandemic relates to the ability of societies in maintaining their core functions while minimising the impact of the pandemic and other societal effects. Drawing on the emerging evidence about resilience in health, social, economic, environmental and governance systems, this paper delineates a multisystemic understanding of societal resilience to COVID-19. Such an understanding provides the foundation for an integrated approach to build societal resilience to current and future pandemics.","output":"Building a multisystemic understanding of societal resilience to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES A remote quality assurance and improvement protocol for point-of-care obstetric ultrasound in low-resource areas was validated against the standard of care for obstetric ultrasound in the United States. METHODS Compressed movie clip ultrasound images (obstetric sweep protocol) obtained by minimally trained personnel were read and interpreted by physicians with training in obstetric ultrasound. Observed findings were compared among readers and between each reader and the gold standard ultrasound scan report. Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis. RESULTS The agreements among readers and between readers and the gold standard, for the anterior and posterior variables of the placental location were excellent, with Cohen  values of 0.81 to 0.88 and 0.77 to 0.9, respectively. Cohen  values were slight or slight/fair for other placental locations (left, right, fundal, and low), and the sensitivity and specificity ranged widely. The agreement among readers and between readers and the gold standard for fetal number comparisons was also excellent, with Cohen  values ranging from 0.82 to 1, sensitivity from 0.83 to 1, and specificity from 0.99 to 1. The agreement among readers for fetal presentation comparisons, according to the Cohen , ranged from 0.79 to 0.85 and between readers and the gold standard had values of 0.43 to 0.49. For biometric parameters and estimated gestational age calculations based on these parameters, inter-reader reliability ranged from 0.79 to 0.85 for all parameters except femur length. Greater than 94% of obstetric sweep protocol ultrasound ages were within 7 days of the corresponding gold standard age. CONCLUSIONS Movie clip ultrasound images provided adequate information for remote readers to reliably determine the placental location, fetal number, fetal presentation, and pregnancy dating.","output":"Validation of a Telemedicine Quality Assurance Method for Point-of-Care Obstetric Ultrasound Used in Low-Resource Settings."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this commentary, written in two bursts-the first completed in April 2020, and the second at the end of July-we explore how media metaphors of COVID-19 constitute the pandemic in Australia and New Zealand.

Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the safety of vaccines recommended for children, adults, and pregnant women in the United States. METHODS We searched the literature in November 2020 to update a 2014 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality review by integrating newly available data. Studies of vaccines that used a comparator and reported the presence or absence of key adverse events were eligible. Adhering to Evidence-based Practice Center methodology, we assessed the strength of evidence (SoE) for all evidence statements. The systematic review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020180089). RESULTS Of 56,603 reviewed citations, 338 studies reported in 518 publications met inclusion criteria. For children, SoE was high for no increased risk of autism following measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. SoE was high for increased risk of febrile seizures with MMR. There was no evidence of increased risk of intussusception with rotavirus vaccine at the latest follow-up (moderate SoE), nor of diabetes (high SoE). There was no evidence of increased risk or insufficient evidence for key adverse events for newer vaccines such as 9-valent human papillomavirus and meningococcal B vaccines. For adults, there was no evidence of increased risk (varied SoE) or insufficient evidence for key adverse events for the new adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine and recombinant adjuvanted zoster vaccine. We found no evidence of increased risk (varied SoE) for key adverse events among pregnant women following tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine, including stillbirth (moderate SoE). CONCLUSIONS Across a large body of research we found few associations of vaccines and serious key adverse events; however, rare events are challenging to study. Any adverse events should be weighed against the protective benefits that vaccines provide.","output":"Safety of vaccines used for routine immunization in the United States: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper critically examines epistemological, ontological, and axiological tensions of activism in three related contexts.

Second, the paper considers and critiques local norms (e.g., widespread homophobia) and materials (e.g., the use of short-handled agricultural hoes) that may be discursively constructed as resistance to western imperialism. Finally, the critique turns back on the researcher gaze itself, problematizing the notion of academic activism in spaces, like these, where criticality itself is an importedarguably luxuriousfolly. Local people, it is apparent, do not want convoluted theorizing or Western hand-wringing; they want proper medical care.

The new behavior of industrial and non-commercial consumers changes the energy consumption model. In addition, the constraints associated with the coronavirus crisis have led to environmental effects from declining economic activity. The research is based on evidence from around the world showing significant reductions in emissions and improved air quality. This situation requires rethinking the energy development strategy, particularly the construction of smart grids as a leading direction of energy development. Evaluating the efficiency of smart grids is a vital tool for disseminating successful experience in improving their management. This paper proposes an approach to a comprehensive assessment of smart grids based on a comparative analysis of existing methods, taking into account the changes that need to be considered after the experience gained from the COVID-19 pandemic.

When CBM9, the family 9 cellulose binding module from Thermotoga maritima, serves as the affinity tag, the overall efficiency of tag removal is a function of the choice of processing enzyme and the local structure of the cleavage site, most notably the linker sequence flanking the bioprocessing recognition site on the tag side. A novel spectroscopic method is reported and used to rapidly and accurately measure CBM9 fusion-tag bioprocessing kinetics and their dependence on the choice of linker sequence. The assay monitors energy transfer between a lanthanide-based donor bound to the CBM9 tag and an acceptor fluorophore presented on the target protein or peptide. Enzyme-catalyzed cleavage of the fusion tag terminates this resonance energy transfer, resulting in a change in fluorescence intensity that can be monitored to quantify substrate concentration over time. The assay is simple, fast and accurate, providing k(cat)/K(M) values that contain standard errors of less than 3%. As a result, both substantial and subtle differences in bioprocessing kinetics can be measured and used to guide bioproduct design.","output":"Direct measurement of the kinetics of CBM9 fusion-tag bioprocessing using luminescence resonance energy transfer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Draw on the protection motivation theory, this study investigated the impacts of intolerance of uncertainty on untact buying behavior, and examined the sequential mediating role of the perceived risk of COVID-19 variants and protection motivation.

Intelligence analysis of communications data in investigative journalism, criminal intelligence, and law present particularly interesting cases, as they must take into account the often highly sensitive properties of the underlying operations and data. At the same time, these are areas where increasingly automated, sophisticated approaches systems can be particularly relevant, especially in terms of Big Data manageability. However, by the shifting of responsibilities, this also poses dangers. In addition to privacy concerns, these dangers relate to uncertain or poor data quality, leading to discrimination and potentially misleading insights. Visual analytics combines machine learning methods with interactive visual interfaces to enable human sense- and decision-making. This technique can be key for designing and operating meaningful interactive communication analysis systems that consider these ethical challenges.

However, the literature on sexual behavior in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic is sparse. AIM: This study surveyed sexual risk behavior among youth in Soweto, South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic national lockdown in 2020. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional telephonic survey on socio-demographics and HIV risk behaviors among youth aged 18C24 years during level 3 of the lockdown. Frequencies and their respective percentages were determined for categorical variables and stratified by biological sex. Chi-square analysis was used to compare categorical variables. All data were analyzed using SAS software. OUTCOMES: A risk assessment for HIV questionnaire was used to assess sexual risk behaviors. Also, substance use was assessed through a developed yes/no questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 129 participants, 83.0% (n = 107) had a sexual partner; 52% of those who had a sexual partner were females, 60.7% (65/107) had one current sexual partner and 39.2% (42/107) had more than 1 sexual partner. Most reported sex within 1 week (54.2%, n = 58/107) and 30.8% within a month (30.8%, n = 33/107). Sex was with a dating partner (86.0%, n = 92/107) and 63% used a condom during last sexual contact. Males were more likely than females to have one-night stand sexual partners (23.5% vs 7.1%; P = .0176), make weekly changes in partners (17.7% vs 5.4%; P = .0442) and used condoms with their partners (92.2% vs 53.6%; P < .0001) during last sexual contact. The majority reported alcohol use (69.0%, n = 89/129). Males were more likely than females to use alcohol on a weekly basis (21.4% vs 6.4%; P = .0380). About 55.9% had penetrative sex under the influence of substances.

STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: This was the first study investigating sexual behavior in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main limitations of this study relate to the sample size and sampling strategy. As the sample was not representative of the population of young people in Soweto and South Africa, the results cannot be generalized.

This combination can be considered as a bioreactor that is produced by introducing foreign genes into plants that elicit special immunogenicity when introduced into animals or human beings. In comparison with traditional vaccines, plant vaccines have some significant advantages, such as low cost, greater safety, and greater effectiveness. In a number of recent studies, antigen-specific proteins have been successfully expressed in various plant tissues and have even been tested in animals and human beings. Therefore, edible vaccines of transgenic plants have a bright future. This review begins with a discussion of the immune mechanism and expression systems for transgenic plant vaccines. Then, current advances in different transgenic plant vaccines will be analyzed, including vaccines against pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotic parasites. In view of the low expression levels for antigens in plants, high-level expression strategies of foreign protein in transgenic plants are recommended. Finally, the existing safety problems in transgenic plant vaccines were put forward will be discussed along with a number of appropriate solutions that will hopefully lead to future clinical application of edible plant vaccines.","output":"Recent advances and safety issues of transgenic plant-derived vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from different traditional dairy products.

Our aim in this study was to evaluate death and intubation outcomes and risk factors associated with COVID-19, and treatment options focusing on diabetes patients and the use of metformin pre-admission and during hospitalization. METHODS: In this Brazilian single-center study we evaluated 1170 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Diabetes patients (n = 188) were divided based on their use of pre-hospital and in-hospital metformin (non-met-group and met-group). RESULTS: In the total cohort most comorbidities were risk factors for orotracheal intubation and death. The use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine was significantly associated with increased death and intubation risk in uni- and multivariate analysis. Diabetes patients showed worst clinical feature compared with non-diabetes patients. In-hospital non-met-group had increased mortality (20.5%) compared to met-group (3.5%) (p = 0.0002) and univariable cox proportion hazard regression indicated in-hospital metformin reduced mortality (HR = 0.325, p = 0.035). Patients that used pre-hospital metformin showed lower severity parameters at hospital admission. (met-group: 2.45  2.5; non-met-group: 4.25  3.4). In all the groups older patients showed more severe clinical conditions and high risk of death and intubation.

However, the challenge remains on how to map occupational exposures during the entire career and link exposures with health outcomes. In this context, the EU EPHOR project aims to characterize the internal exposome, by characterizing exposure biomarkers and biological pathways to link external exposure and health effects. While there is a range of strategies available to monitor the internal exposome, these conventional methods often require invasive collection of biological samples and/or high volumes. However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic forces us to look also at other approaches to obtain biological samples.ObjectiveWe aimed to explore the use of self-sampling techniques in an occupational exposome context.MethodsWe have conducted a semi-systematic literature review to identify self-sampling techniques used to generate high quality data on several biomarkers of exposure and effect. We are exploring the possibility of using these self-sampling techniques through a pilot study. A tiered analytical approach along with a biological sequence will be followed to efficiently analyze the samples (i.e. blood, urine, saliva, exhaled breath, exhaled breath aerosols and exhaled breath condensate) for a broad spectrum of biomarkers and omics. Additionally, non-invasive targeted and non-targeted exposome markers of acute lung function decline and inflammation will be developed through proteomic analysis of exhaled breath condensate (EBC), and exhaled breath VOCs using the ReCIVA Breath Sampler. These data will be integrated to generate signatures or fingerprints of exposomes, at individual and group levels.Results and ConclusionThe developed methodology will be applied in 2 cohorts within the EPHOR project: shift-workers and workers with asthma or allergic rhinitis to assess the internal exposure and elucidate biological pathways in disease development.","output":"Strategies for monitoring of the internal exposome using self-sampling methods in the context of EU EPHOR project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a novel mathematical formalism to predict the kinetics of DNA damage repair after exposure to both low- and high-LET radiation (X rays; 350 MeV/n 40Ar; 600 MeV/n 56Fe).

We previously reported strong evidence for clustering of nearby DSB into single repair units as opposed to the classic \\"contact-first\\" model where DSB are considered immobile. Here we apply this clustering model to evaluate the number of remaining RIF over time. We also show that the newly introduced kinetic metrics can be used as surrogate biomarkers for in vivo radiation toxicity, with potential applications in radiotherapy and human space exploration. In particular, we observed an association between the characteristic time constant of RIF repair measured in vitro and survival levels of immune cells collected from irradiated mice. Moreover, the speed of DNA damage repair correlated not only with radiation-induced cellular survival in vivo, but also with spontaneous cancer incidence data collected from the Mouse Tumor Biology database, suggesting a relationship between the efficiency of DSB repair after irradiation and cancer risk.","output":"53BP1 Repair Kinetics for Prediction of In Vivo Radiation Susceptibility in 15 Mouse Strains."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, with 10%-20% of severe cases and over 508 000 deaths worldwide. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to address the risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 patients and the mortality of severe patients. METHODS: 289 hospitalized laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Electronic medical records, including patient demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory tests results, and radiological materials, were collected and analyzed. According to the severity and outcomes of the patients, they were divided into three groups: nonsurvived (n = 49), survived severe (n = 78), and nonsevere (n = 162) groups. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were compared among these groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality and visualize the patients on a low-dimensional space. Correlations between clinical, radiological, and laboratory parameters were investigated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to determine the risk factors associated with mortality in severe patients. Longitudinal changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and nonsurvived cases during hospital stay were also collected. RESULTS: Of the 289 patients, the median age was 57 years (range, 22-88) and 155 (53.4%) patients were male. As of the final follow-up date of this study, 240 (83.0%) patients were discharged from the hospital and 49 (17.0%) patients died. Elder age, underlying comorbidities, and increased laboratory variables, such as leukocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) on admission, were found in survived severe cases compared to nonsevere cases. According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, elder age, a higher number of affected lobes, elevated CRP levels on admission, increased prevalence of chest tightness/dyspnea, and smoking history were independent risk factors for death of severe patients. A trajectory in PCA was observed from \\"nonsevere\\" toward \\"nonsurvived\\" via \\"severe and survived\\" patients. Strong correlations between the age of patients, the affected lobe numbers, and laboratory variables were identified. Dynamic changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and nonsurvived cases during hospital stay showed that continuing increase of leukocytes and neutrophil count, sustained lymphopenia and eosinopenia, progressing decrease in platelet count, as well as high levels of NLR, CRP, PCT, AST, BUN, and serum creatinine were associated with in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: Survived severe and nonsurvived COVID-19 patients had distinct clinical and laboratory characteristics, which were separated by principle component analysis. Elder age, increased number of affected lobes, higher levels of serum CRP, chest tightness/dyspnea, and smoking history were risk factors for mortality of severe COVID-19 patients.

Swedish health care is obliged to give care on equal conditions for the entire population. The person with the greatest need should be given the most care, and the health care system should strive to be cost-efficient. Medical and technical advances have been significant during the last decades and the recent Covid-19 pandemic has caused a shift in health care, from in-person visits to virtual visits. The majority of pregnant women with a low risk assessment have an uncomplicated antenatal course without adverse events. These women probably receive excessive and unnecessary antenatal care. This study will investigate if an antenatal care program for healthy pregnant women with a low risk for adverse outcomes could be safely monitored with fewer in-person visits to a midwife, and with some of them replaced by virtual visits. METHODS: This is a non-inferiority trial where a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled design will be used. Data collection includes register data and questionnaires that concern antenatal, obstetric and neonatal outcomes, patient- and caregiver-reported experiences, healthcare-economy, and implementation aspects. The modified antenatal care (MAC) study is performed in parts of the southeast of Sweden, which has approximately 8200 childbirths annually. At the start of the study, all antenatal care centers included in the study will use the same standard antenatal care (SAC) program. In the MAC program the in-person visits to a midwife will be reduced to four instead of eight, with two additional virtual meetings compared with the SAC program. DISCUSSION: This presented study protocol is informed by research knowledge. The protocol is expected to provide a good structure for future studies on changed antenatal care programs that introduce virtual visits for healthy pregnant women with a low risk for adverse outcomes, without risking quality, safety, and increased costs.

The differences in viral infectivity, replication efficiency, and genome sequences between TW2575/98w and TW2575/98vac were determined and compared. TW2575/98vac caused earlier death of chicken embryos and had higher viral replication efficiency. Thirty amino acid substitutions resulting from 44 mutated nucleotides in the viral genome were found in TW2575/98vac.

We sought to study the impact of the surge period on patients with cancer prescribed radiation treatment (RT). METHODS We reviewed our secure departmental quality assurance database for all patients who underwent RT planning simulations from March 6, 2020, through April 30, 2020. A priority level between 1 and 3 was prospectively assigned to each case based on faculty consensus to determine which patients required immediate RT. In May 2020, each faculty physician again retrospectively reviewed their patients from the database and provided additional commentary on how the COVID-19 pandemic had affected each patient's care. All statistics are descriptive. RESULTS A total of 412 RT courses in 406 unique patients were simulated for linear accelerator-based external beam RT. The median age was 66 years. Treatment intent was curative in 70.6% and palliative in 29.4%. Of the 412 cases, 66.7% were priority 1, 25% priority 2, and 7.8% priority 3. Two hundred thirty-nine cases (58%) underwent standard-of-care diagnosis, workup, and treatment plan. Seventeen patients (4.1%) electively canceled their RT, and 17 others (4.1%) electively delayed RT start. Thirty-four (8.3%) were prescribed hypofractionation to shorten their RT course, and 22 (5.3%) had a change in modality. Incomplete or delayed workup was identified in 19 cases (4.6%). CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic surge resulted in 42% of our patients having a non-standard-of-care pathway.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A sample of 446 frontline nurses participated from March 8 to 19, 2020. A latent profile analysis was performed to identify clusters based on the six subscales of the Chinese version of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index. The differences among the classes and the variables including sociodemographic characteristics, psychological capital and coping style were explored. RESULTS: The level of mental workload indicates that the nurses had high self-evaluations of their performance while under extremely intensive task loads. The following three latent subtypes were identified: 'low workload & low self-evaluation' (8.6%); 'medium workload & medium self-evaluation' (35.3%) and 'high workload & high self-evaluation' (56.1%) (Classes 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Nurses with shared accommodations, fewer years of practice, junior professional titles, lower incomes, nonmanagement working positions, lower psychological capital levels and negative coping styles had a higher likelihood of belonging to Class 1. In contrast, senior nurses with higher psychological capital and positive coping styles were more likely to belong to Classes 2 and 3. CONCLUSION: The characteristics of the 'low workload & low self-evaluation' subtype suggest that attention should be paid to the work pressure and psychological well-being of junior nurses. Further research on regular training program of public health emergency especially for novices is needed. Personnel management during public health events should be focused on the allocation between novice and senior frontline nurses.

Physician perspectives on practical considerations surrounding telehealth adoption, motivations of use, and reasons for nonuse are necessary to inform the future of healthcare delivery. The objective is to understand the experiences of physicians using telemedicine for older patients. METHODS: From September to November 2020, we conducted 30\\\\min semi\\\\structured interviews using purposeful sampling to identify and enroll participants from diverse settings.

Audio\\\\recorded interviews were professionally transcribed and analyzed using framework analysis. Major themes and subthemes were identified. RESULTS: Participants had a median (interquartile range) age of 37.5 (34C44.5), 27 (56%) were women. Five major themes emerged: (1) telehealth uptake was rapid and iterative, (2) telehealth improved the safety of medical care, (3) use cases were specialty\\\\specific (for geriatricians and primary care physicians telehealth substituted for in\\\\person visits; for emergency physicians it primarily supplemented in\\\\person visits), (4) physicians altered clinical care to overcome older patient barriers to telehealth use, and (5) telehealth use among physicians declined in mid\\\\April 2020, due primarily to patient needs and administrator preferences, not physician factors.

Measures have ranged from quarantines when entering a country to outright travel bans. Yet more widespread travel restrictions in the form of country vaccine entry requirements have been in place for a long time for another disease - yellow fever. We track the historical underpinnings and policy developments that have led to stringent vaccine entry requirements today. We also discuss the political issues raised by health measures imposed on borders and discuss the reasons behind some clear regional differences. Almost no European countries currently have vaccine entry requirements, while at the other end of the spectrum, the majority of countries in the African region do, making vaccine entry requirements a global south phenomenon. We argue that vaccine entry requirements should be reassessed in the future as an underused public health tool, likely to become increasingly common. Vaccine entry requirements have proved effective in controlling the international spread of yellow fever but more can be done to ensure better use of this measure.

Faecal samples of 78 dogs that have been vaccinated against CPV and later presented with clinical signs suspected of parvovirus infection were used. Fifty (64.1 per cent) samples tested positive by PCR for CPV. No CPV vaccine type was detected. The disease by CPV-2b occurred in older and female dogs when compared with that by CPV-2c. The clinical signs presented by infected dogs were similar when any of both variants were involved. In most cases of disease, the resulting infection by field variants occurred shortly after CPV vaccination. Two dogs that had been subjected to a complete vaccination schedule and presented with clinical signs after 10 days of vaccination, had the CPV-2c variant associated. The phylogenetic studies showed a close relationship of the isolates in vaccinated dogs to European field strains. Despite the limited sample size in this study, the findings point to the significance of the continuous molecular typing of the virus as a tool to monitor the prevalent circulating CPV strains and access the efficacy of current vaccines.

The different approaches of Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Gibraltar, Ireland, Israel, Malta, Nederland, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom (Scotland and Wales) were investigated. Dementia has a significant social, psychological and economic impact on the individual, family and society. As the disease progresses dementia sufferers become increasingly dependent. As many dementia sufferers are at home during the initial stages, the physical, emotional, and social demands of the dementia sufferers are often covered by informal caregivers. This study, therefore, aims to investigate the integration of psychosocial interventions for comprehensive care pertaining to informal caregivers of people with dementia in Europe. Furthermore, the study will highlight how implementation of technologies might enable psychosocial support of informal caregivers. The data is based on 15 national dementia strategies from various European countries. Data was based on preexisting coding systems with the predefined keywords and analyzed by qualitative content analysis by four of the authors. Our results show that psychosocial support is provided in various modalities and that informal caregivers need to be supported by a psychosocial approach. Due to this need the national dementia strategies should include measures to reduce the emotional burden of informal caregivers. Psychosocial support provided to informal caregivers in a comprehensive and systematic way is likely to enable informal caregivers to handle the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral consequences of the disease and its treatment, while helping to maintain their work-life balance.","output":"Informal caregivers and psychosocial support: Analysis of European Dementia Policy documents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, chemical investigation of methanol extract of the air-dried fruits of Luffa cylindrica led to the identification of a new ĩ\\\\valerolactone (1), along with sixteen known compounds (2C17).

Disruptive change is needed to improve the inefficiencies in current selection processes. OBJECTIVE: To determine interest in an early result acceptance program (ERAP) among stakeholders in obstetrics and gynecology (OBGYN), and to estimate its outcome in future application cycles. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Surveys of stakeholders in March 2021 queried interest in ERAP across the US. Respondents included OBGYN residency applicants, members of the Association of American Medical Colleges Group on Student Affairs, OBGYN clerkship directors, and residency program directors. Statistical analysis was performed from March to April 2021. EXPOSURES: Respondents completed surveys sent by email from the Association of American Medical Colleges (to OBGYN applicants and members of the Group on Student Affairs), the Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics (to clerkship directors), and the Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology (to program directors). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Applicants and program directors indicated their interest in participating in ERAP, and clerkship directors and members of the Group on Student Affairs indicated their likelihood of recommending ERAP using a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS: Respondents included 879 (34.0%) of 2579 applicants to OBGYN, 143 (50.3%) of 284 residency program directors, 94 (41.8%) of 225 clerkship directors, and 51 (32.9%) of 155 student affairs deans. The majority of respondents reported being either somewhat or extremely likely to participate in ERAP, including 622 applicants (70.7%) and 87 program directors (60.8%). Interest in ERAP was independent of an applicants reported board scores, medical school type, race, number of applications submitted, or number of interviews completed. Among program directors, those at university programs were more likely to participate. Stakeholders supported a limit of 3 applications for ERAP, to fill 25% to 50% of residency positions. Estimating the outcome of ERAP using these data suggests 26 280 to 52 560 fewer applications could be submitted in the regular match cycle. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Stakeholders in the OBGYN application process expressed broad support for the concept of ERAP. The majority of applicants and programs indicated that they would participate, with potentially substantial positive impact on the application process.

Since intact (socio-)psychological functioning and mental health are protective factors contributing to the immune system and preventing diseases, it is crucial to identify individuals with increased vulnerability. Methods: We conducted a German online survey from April until August 2020 investigating health-related, social, behavioral, and psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. One hundred and seventy three adults participating in the survey were analyzed (39.9% male, age: M = 44.8113.31). We explored effects on mental health by (a) clustering participants in two clusters and (b) analyzing the clusters using correlations and regression models. Results: Participants belonged either to a cluster characterized by higher general well-being or to a more concerned cluster depending on their responses. The correlation analysis revealed a significant negative relation between age and well-being with younger participants revealing higher depression scores in the concerned cluster. Furthermore, multiple regression models revealed that the number of risk factors only has a significant influence on psychological well-being in the concerned but not in the comfortable cluster. Conclusion: We found that especially participants at (a) younger age and (b) greater risk of a severe course of disease reported reduced mental well-being and seemed to be weakened in their psychological protective factors in our sample.

Interventional pain fellows must develop a minimum number of skills during their training in order to achieve the competences without neglecting radiological safety. However, medical training in fluoroscopic-guided interventions is being affected by the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation. METHODS: The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of a phantom model for lumbar injection as a training strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic in fellows of interventional pain. The study was divided into theoretical and practical modules. The hands-on practice was performed in a lumbar model phantom where fellows were evaluated in four fluoroscopically guided approaches: intra-articular facet block (IAFB), medial branch block (MBB), transforaminal block (TFB), and interlaminar block (ILB) divided in 5 sessions. The aim was to make as many punctures as possible in every session. We measured total procedural performance (TPP), total needle hand time (TNH), and total radiation dose generated by the fluoroscopic machine (TRD) during each procedure. Additionally, a survey was applied to evaluate confidence and satisfaction before and after training. RESULTS: A total of 320 lumbar punctures were completed. The results were statistically significant in all approaches attempted (p < 0.01). The fellow's survey for satisfaction and confidence demonstrated a significant difference between pre and post-test (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study highlight the importance of adaptations and adoption of new educational models. The use of the phantom model for simulation could be a strategy for other emerging situations, like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cases are most often nosocomial and associated with high mortality We report the first documented case of fungal empyema associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure and type-2 diabetes, presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with respiratory failure and septic shock, about one week after he was diagnosed with atypical pneumonia His nasopharyngeal wash for SARS-CoV-19 returned positive several days after first ED visit The patient was intubated and started on antibiotics and hydroxychloroquine He was extubated after 4 days of low-tidal volume ventilation per ARDSNet protocol He had a prolonged hospital stay complicated by Moraxella bacteremia and was discharged after 21 days He was readmitted with a chest CT notable for bilateral pulmonary emboli, extensive bilateral pneumonia, and a loculated pleural effusion He was started on heparin and antibiotics A chest tube was placed, and pleural fluid studies were notable for an exudative effusion Pleural cultures obtained grew Candida albicans, which was initially thought to be a possible contaminant;however repeat pleural cultures continued to exhibit C albicans as did a sputum culture His WBC count and CRP continued to elevate despite pleural drainage and antibiotics, and he was transferred for a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) evaluation Fluconazole was initiated Patient had clinical improvement with fluconazole and continued chest tube drainage, so he did not undergo VATS He was discharged on oral antimicrobials and apixaban DISCUSSION: This is the first described case of fungal empyema secondary to COVID-19 Fungal empyema represents less than &lt;1% pleural infections with C albicans being the most common pathogen Overall mortality is as high as 73%, and most patients are critically ill Patients should have prompt chest tube drainage, and in cases of failure with rising CRP or persistent sepsis, early thoracic surgery consultation is appropriate as evidenced by two small studies (n=20 and 70) where early VATS vs chest tube resulted in decreased hospital stay and rates of treatment failure CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should consider fungal empyema in recovered COVID-19 patients presenting with a complicated pleural space Chest tube drainage and IV antifungal coverage are effective initial

(COVID-19) seems to involve different organs, including the cardiovascular system. We systematically reviewed COVID-19 cardiac complications and calculated their pooled incidences. Secondarily, we compared the cardiac troponin I (cTnI) level between the surviving and expired patients. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted for manuscripts published from December 1, 2019 to April 16, 2020. Cardiovascular complications, along with the levels of cTnI, creatine kinase (CK), and creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) in hospitalized PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were extracted. The pooled incidences of the extracted data were calculated, and the unadjusted cTnI level was compared between the surviving and expired patients. RESULTS: Out of 1094 obtained records, 22 studies on a total of 4,157 patients were included. The pooled incidence rate of arrhythmia was 10.11%. Furthermore, myocardial injury had a pooled incidence of 17.85%, and finally, the pooled incidence for heart failure was 22.34%. The pooled incidence rates of cTnI, CK-MB, and CK elevations were also reported at 15.16%, 10.92%, and 12.99%, respectively. Moreover, the pooled level of unadjusted cTnI was significantly higher in expired cases compared with the surviving (mean difference = 31.818, 95% CI = 17.923-45.713, P value <0.001).

The aim of this study was to investigate the DNA vaccine-encoded Sars-cov-2 soluble spike protein (SP). as a potential trigger of platelet activation in VITT. Methods. We studied three VITT patients and seven healthy controls (HCs) within 3 weeks from the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and one non vaccinated HC. Serum levels of SP and soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (sACE2), ACE2 expression in platelets and platelet response to VITT serum stimulation were studied. A thrombus retrieved during mechanical thrombectomy from one VITT patients, was analysed by immunohistochemistry for SP and ACE2. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) markers and coagulation parameters were also measured. Results. We detected serum SP (up to 35 days post-vaccination) and sACE2 in all VITT patients, and respectively in two and three out of 7 vaccinated HCs. Only platelets from one non-vaccinated HC expressed ACE2. VITT sera markedly activated platelets and this activation was inhibited by both anti-SP and anti-FcRIIA blocking antibodies. The thrombus showed positive immunohistochemical labelling of platelets using an anti-SP antibody with reduced ACE2 expression, compared to a thrombus from a pre-pandemic stroke patient. Markers of endothelial dysfunction, NETs and hypercoagulability state were present in all VITT sera. Conclusions. The present data provides first evidence that DNA vaccine-encoded Sars-cov-2 SP is detectable in VITT sera (several weeks post-vaccination) and in a platelet-rich thrombus, and that may contribute to the initial platelet stimulation in VITT patients.","output":"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia and spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid generation of biomedical waste (BMW) due to covid-19 pandemic has created burden on the existing municipal solid waste management (MSWM) system in both developed and developing countries.

Capillary and gravitational forces across the modified henequen fibers control the flow rate, eliminating the need for external pumps. This technique requires low reagent consumption and allows portability for in situ measurements. The flow system is described, and the operational variables were studied and optimized using a Taguchi parameters design to increase analytical sensitivity. Under optimal conditions a limit of detection of 1.16 g kg-1 was achieved with adequate repeatability and reproducibility (expressed as %RSD <5.0%, n = 3, n = 9 respectively) in all cases.

In recent years image guided ablation has seen increased use in the treatment of thoracic malignancies. The objective of this study was to evaluate oncological outcomes following percutaneous ablation (PA) of pulmonary metastasis. METHODS: A comprehensive search of the PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from January 2000 to August 2021 was performed to identify studies evaluating patient survival following ablation of lung metastasis. Pooled outcomes have been presented with a random effects model to assess primary outcomes of overall survival, progression free survival and 1-year local control. Secondary outcomes included procedural mortality, major complications, and the incidence of pneumothorax. RESULTS: A total of 24 studies were identified. The pooled median overall survival was 5.13 [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.37-6.84] years, and the 1-, 3-, 5-year progression free survival rates were 53%, 26% and 20% respectively. The 1-year local control rate was 91% (95%CI: 86-95%). Periprocedural mortality was rare (0%; 95%CI: 0-1%), as were major complications excluding pneumothorax (1%; 95%CI: 1-2%). Pneumothorax developed in 44% of ablation sessions, although only half of these required chest tube placement. Most patients were able to be discharged day one post-procedurally. CONCLUSION: PA demonstrates high overall, progression free and local tumour survival in patients with lung metastasis. Complications and mortality are also rare. Consideration of its use should be made in a tumour board meeting in conjunction with surgical and radiotherapy perspectives for targeted local control of metastases.","output":"A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Patient Survival and Disease Recurrence Following Percutaneous Ablation of Pulmonary Metastasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper considers the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model with an underlying network structure among subpopulations and focuses on the effect of social distancing to regulate the epidemic level.

To this end, we first modify the basic SIS model by introducing a state dependent parameter representing the frequency of interactions between subpopulations. Thereafter, we show that for this modified SIS model, the spectral radius of a suitably-defined matrix being not greater than one causes all the agents, regardless of their initial sickness levels, to converge to the healthy state; assuming non-trivial disease spread, the spectral radius being greater than one leads to the existence of a unique endemic equilibrium, which is also asymptotically stable.

Currently, limited data are available that link underlying liver injury with the severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review summarizes the available data on liver test abnormalities in COVID-19 patients; critically evaluates the possible causes of liver injury and provides recommendations for clinicians. In laboratory tests, serum levels of liver test markers notably transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transferase and total bilirubin were significantly higher in severe patients with COVID-19 infection. The use of certain drugs especially lopinavir and ritonavir showed an association with the progression of liver damage in severe cases. Available data suggest that liver injury in COVID-19 patients may result from direct effect by the virus, immune-mediated inflammation or drug-induced toxicity. Some studies demonstrated that COVID-19 patients with pre-existing liver disease are at higher risk for hospitalizations and mortality. Therefore, the impact of pre-existing liver disease on treatment and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 should be determined.

Data from 3399 persons were used (81.08% females; aged 34.02 9.72 and 18.27 % males; aged 36.3810.33). Distress and clinical depression were identified with the use of cut-off and a previously developed algorithm respectively. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A post-stratification method was used; descriptive statistics were calculated. Chi-square tests, multiple forward stepwise linear regression analyses and Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tested relations among variables. RESULTS: Clinical depression was present in 9.31% of the stratified sample, while 8.5% had severe distress; increased anxiety was present in more than 45%. Suicidal thoughts increased in 10.40% and decreased in 4.42%. Beliefs in conspiracy theories were widely prevalent; at least half of cases were following various misconceptions. A model for the development of depression was created with general health status, previous history of depression, self-harm and suicidal attempts, family responsibility, economic change, and age acting as risk factors, while keeping a daily routine, pursuing religiousness/spirituality, and believing in conspiracy theories acting as protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: The model developed here revealed multiple vulnerabilities and an interplay leading from simple anxiety to clinical depression and suicidality through distress.

There are two main reasons behind this perception of the disease. First, a gradual but exponential growth in the disease prevalence has been witnessed irrespective of age groups, geography or gender. Second, the disease dynamics are very complex in terms of multifactorial risks involved, initial asymptomatic period, different short-term and long-term complications posing serious health threat and related co-morbidities. Majority of its risk factors are lifestyle habits like physical inactivity, lack of exercise, high body mass index (BMI), poor diet, smoking except some inevitable ones like family history of diabetes, ethnic predisposition, ageing etc. Nowadays, machine learning (ML) is increasingly being applied for alleviation of diabetes health burden and many research works have been proposed in the literature to offer clinical decision support in different application areas as well.

RESULTS Children presenting with moderate-severe COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease shock-like syndrome exhibit peripheral blood picture analogous to HLH. HScore, a validated tool to diagnose HLH, has been suggested to screen severe COVID-19 patients for cytokine storm. However, HScore faces certain limitations in this scenario. It may be more pragmatic to use 'high D-dimer' (> 3 g/mL) instead of 'low fibrinogen' to facilitate early detection of cytokine storm. COVID-19 associated coagulopathy resembles hypercoagulable form of DIC with bleeding being rarely reported. Although the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) interim guidance recommends low molecular weight heparin in all hospitalized patients, data is lacking in population below 14 years of age. However, in the presence of life-threatening thromboembolic event or symptomatic acro-ischemia, unfractionated heparin (UFH) should be used with caution. CONCLUSION HScore can be used as a complement to clinical decision for initiating immunosuppression. Children with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, especially those with documented thrombocytopenia or chilblains, should be regularly monitored for coagulopathy.","output":"COVID-19-associated Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis and Coagulopathy: Targeting the Duumvirate."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is induced by SARS-CoV-2 and may arise as a variety of clinical manifestations, ranging from an asymptomatic condition to a life-threatening disease associated with cytokine storm, multiorgan and respiratory failure.

S protein could also be precipitated from MHV-infected cells by a monoclonal antibody directed against the murine Fc  receptor (FcR). To prove definitively that the S protein mediates Fc-binding activity, we have expressed the MHV S protein utilizing recombinant vaccinia viruses. The anti-FcR monoclonal antibody, 2.4G2, precipitated recombinant S protein in cells of murine, human, and rabbit origin. Since the anti-Fc receptor monoclonal antibody does not react with human and rabbit Fc receptors these results demonstrate that the epitope recognized by this antibody is carried on the MHV S protein and is not murine in origin. Examination of various MHV isolates and escape mutants failed to identify the precise sequences in S responsible for the molecular mimicry of the murine FcR. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a previously identified region of similarity between the S protein and the FcR mediates this activity. The Fc binding activity of S was expressed on the cell surface, since MHV-JHM-infected cells, but not uninfected cells, formed rosettes with anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) antibody-coated SRBC.

Camera data from 1692 pigs in 41 production batches of 42.4 (16.6) days in length over 17 months at seven diverse grower/finisher commercial pig farms, was validated by visiting farms every 14(10) days to score injury and ill health. Linear modelling of tail posture found considerable farm and batch effects. The percentage of tails held low (0) or mid (1C45) decreased over time from 54.9% and 23.8% respectively by -0.16 and -0.05%/day, while tails high (45C90) increased from 21.5% by 0.20%/day. Although 22% of scored pigs had scratched tails, severe tail biting was rare; only 6% had tail wounds and 5% partial tail loss. Adding tail injury to models showed associations with tail posture: overall tail injury, worsening tail injury, and tail loss were associated with more pigs detected with low tail posture and fewer with high tails. Minor tail injuries and tail swelling were also associated with altered tail posture. Unexpectedly, other health and injury scores had a larger effect on tail posture- more low tails were observed when a greater proportion of pigs in a pen were scored with lameness or lesions caused by social aggression. Ear injuries were linked with reduced high tails. These findings are consistent with the idea that low tail posture could be a general indicator of poor welfare. However, effects of flank biting and ocular discharge on tail posture were not consistent with this. Our results show for the first time that perturbations in the normal time trends of tail posture are associated with tail biting and other signs of adverse health/welfare at diverse commercial farms, forming the basis for a decision support system.","output":"Changes in tail posture detected by a 3D machine vision system are associated with injury from damaging behaviours and ill health on commercial pig farms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Different additive manufacturing technologies have proven effective and useful in remote medicine and emergency or disaster situations. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, has had a huge impact on our society, including in relation to the continuous supply of personal protective equipment (PPE). The aim of the study is to give a detailed overview of 3D-printed PPE devices and provide practical information regarding the manufacturing and further design process, as well as describing the potential risks of using them. Open-source models of a half-face mask, safety goggles, and a face-protecting shield are evaluated, considering production time, material usage, and cost. Estimations have been performed with fused filament fabrication (FFF) and selective laser sintering (SLS) technology, highlighting the material characteristics of polylactic acid (PLA), polyamide, and a two-compound silicone. Spectrophotometry measurements of transparent PMMA samples were performed to determine their functionality as goggles or face mask parts. All the tests were carried out before and after the tetra-acetyl-ethylene-diamine (TAED)-based disinfection process. The results show that the disinfection has no significant effect on the mechanical and structural stability of the used polymers; therefore, 3D-printed PPE is reusable. For each device, recommendations and possible means of development are explained. The files of the modified models are provided.

This trope of thinking runs through all the contributions in this book;it seems clearer today than ever that theories in the social sciences cannot be discussed without also engaging with their political embeddedness. It appears that psychology has, since its inception as a discipline, always been on the margins and in between opposing interests. Taken together, this volume speaks to the epistemic shifts psychology currently undergoes. Stemming from a crisis-driven reconfiguration of the social world, the authors inquire about and envision new theoretical pathways for psychology to take in order to be more just, more apt, and inclusive beyond the traditional scope of the discipline. Specific crises such as mass unemployment, dismantling of democratic institutions, globalization, and climate change tend to overwhelm people in their meaning-making efforts. Concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors argue that we can only show responsibility for the future by realizing inevitable and irreparable change and loss to how we lived our lives in the past. Bearing this examination of lessons we can learn from past developments in our discipline and theoretical advances needed to move beyond the current state in mind, Part II of this volume inquires about the role of crises from a relational point of view. Can crises function as cathartic moments and produce new and improved ways of understanding the individual in relation to the social world?

This study analyzes the money supply reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic using a cross-sectional panel of 115 countries. The study used robust least square regression and innovation accounting techniques to get sound parameter estimates. The results show that COVID-19 infected cases are the main contributing factor that obstructs financial activities and decrease money supply. In contrast, an increasing number of recovered cases and COVID-19 testing capabilities gave investors confidence to increase stock trade across countries. The overall forecast trend shows that COVID-19 infected cases and recovered cases followed the U-shaped trend, while COVID-19 critical cases and reported deaths showed a decreasing trend.

We evaluate them in different forms to understand how they affect infection rates and disease severity. In determining how they affect disease outcome, we evaluated target tissue vulnerability, functional role, defense mechanisms, viral concentration, infection vicinity to target vital tissue, and host factors. We found that direct lung infection is the most lethal transmission route followed by bronchi infection. Transmissions by physical contacts, foods, and blood by low viral concentration (as expected in normal human activities) pose lower or much lower risks unless the infection is followed by subsequent lung exposures. After adding transmission route, treatment timings, and improper treatments into the list of known risk factors, we found that death rate and disability rate for young or healthy persons are nearly zero. We show that population based medical model improperly shifts nominal death rate from few vulnerable people to the population resulting in unnecessary population panic, and such panic is responsible for shutting down human activities and the world economy. Finally, we examined limitations in population-based mitigating measures and proposed for governmental and private adoption community guidelines, which are mainly to enable vulnerable people avoid exposures, prevent non-vulnerable people from serving as viral transmitters, get rid of high-risk exposure modes in working environment, improve safety for people in buses, ships and planes, and reduce death and disability rates for infected people.","output":"Association of COVID-19 Disease Severity with Transmission Routes and Suggested Changes to Community Guidelines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, a hesitant fuzzy AHP method is presented to help decision makers (DMs), especially policymakers, governors, and physicians, evaluate the importance of intervention strategy alternatives applied by various countries for the COVID-19 pandemic.

Publicly available documents were consulted. CATWOE (Customers, Actors, Transformation, Worldview, Owners, Environment) was used as an analytic framework to explore the relationship between stakeholders in the pathway. SETTING: Five major trauma networks across the UK.

INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Mapping of rehabilitation pathways identified several issues: (1) lack of vocational/psychological support particularly for musculoskeletal injuries; (2) inconsistent service provision in areas located further from major trauma centres; (3) lack of communication between acute and community care; (4) long waiting lists (up to 12 months) for community rehabilitation; (5) most well-established pathways were neurologically focused.

Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and climate-related disasters and often lack adequate mental healthcare infrastructure. We used the scoping review methodology to determine how exposure to climate change and climate-related disasters influences the presence of mental disorders among those living in LMICs. We also aimed to recognise existing gaps in this area of literature. METHODS This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. To identify relevant studies, we searched five electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, APA PsycInfo and Sociological Abstracts) from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2019. We also searched the grey literature. Included studies had an adult-focused LMIC population, a climate change or climate-related disaster exposure and a mental disorder outcome. Relevant study information was extracted and synthesised. RESULTS Fifty-eight studies were identified, most of which (n=48) employed a cross-sectional design. The most commonly studied exposure-outcome combinations were flood-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (n=28), flood-related depression (n=15) and storm-related PTSD (n=13). The majority of studies identified a positive exposure-outcome association. However, few studies included a baseline or comparator (ie, unexposed) group, thereby limiting our understanding of the magnitude or nature of this association. There was also great heterogeneity in this literature, making studies difficult to pool or compare. Several research gaps were identified including the lack of longitudinal studies and non-uniformity of geographic coverage. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, this was the first scoping review to investigate the relationship between climate change and climate-related disaster exposures and mental disorder outcomes in LMICs.

In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccination program and predicted the path to herd immunity in the U.S. Using data from 12 October 2020 to 7 March 2021, we estimated that vaccination reduced the total number of new cases by 4.4 million (from 33.0 to 28.6 million), prevented approximately 0.12 million hospitalizations (from 0.89 to 0.78 million), and decreased the population infection rate by 1.34 percentage points (from 10.10% to 8.76%). We then built a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with vaccination to predict herd immunity. Our model predicts that if the average vaccination pace between January and early March 2021 (2.08 doses per 100 people per week) is maintained, the U.S. can achieve herd immunity by the last week of July 2021, with a cumulative vaccination coverage of 60.2%.

Through a review of existing literature at the nexus of urbanisation and infectious disease, we consider how this (potential) increased vulnerability to infectious diseases in peri- or suburban areas is in fact dialectically related to socio-material transformations on the metropolitan edge. In particular, we highlight three key factors influencing the spread of infectious disease that have been identified in the literature: demographic change, infrastructure and governance. These have been chosen given both the prominence of these themes and their role in shaping the spread of disease on the urban edge. Further, we suggest how a landscape political ecology framework can be useful for examining the role of socio-ecological transformations in generating increased risk of infectious disease in peri- and suburban areas. To illustrate our arguments we will draw upon examples from various re-emerging infectious disease events and outbreaks around the world to reveal how extended urbanisation in the broadest sense has amplified the conditions necessary for the spread of infectious diseases. We thus call for future research on the spatialities of health and disease to pay attention to how variegated patterns of extended urbanisation may influence possible outbreaks and the mechanisms through which such risks can be alleviated.","output":"Extended urbanisation and the spatialities of infectious disease: Demographic change, infrastructure and governance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to mutate, and the COVID-19 pandemic remains a global health crisis.

We categorized countries as collectivist or individualistic based on Hofstedes (1980) cut-offs. As predicted, rates were significantly lower in collectivist than individualistic countries. Furthermore, an analysis of covariance controlling for median age showed that the observed differences could not be accounted for by the lower average age of citizens of collectivist countries. Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of the elderly population resided in nursing homes in individualistic than collectivist countries, and nursing home residency proportion was significantly related to death rates.

RESULTS A total of 39 patients with type 2 diabetes (screening HbA1c 9.5% [80 mmol/mol]; BMI 31 kg/m2) were treated and included in the interim efficacy analysis: 28 had a long duodenal segment ablated (LS; 9.3 cm treated) and 11 had a short segment ablated (SS; 3.4 cm treated). Overall, DMR was well tolerated with minimal gastrointestinal symptoms postprocedure. Three patients experienced duodenal stenosis treated successfully by balloon dilation. HbA1c was reduced by 1.2% at 6 months in the full cohort (P < 0.001). More potent glycemic effects were observed among the LS cohort, who experienced a 2.5% reduction in mean HbA1c at 3 months postprocedure vs. 1.2% in the SS group (P < 0.05) and a 1.4% reduction at 6 months vs. 0.7% in the SS group (P = 0.3). This occurred despite net medication reductions in the LS cohort between 0 and 6 months. Among LS patients with a screening HbA1c of 7.5-10% (58-86 mmol/mol) and on stable antidiabetic medications postprocedure, HbA1c was reduced by 1.8% at 6 months (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Single-procedure DMR elicits a clinically significant improvement in hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes in the short-term, with acceptable safety and tolerability. Long-term safety, efficacy, and durability and possible mechanisms of action require further investigation.","output":"Endoscopic Duodenal Mucosal Resurfacing for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes: 6-Month Interim Analysis From the First-in-Human Proof-of-Concept Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recognize which are the elements that predict why a person is aging faster or slower and which intervention we can arrange to slow down the process, which permits to prevent or delay the progression of multimorbidity and disability. RECENT FINDINGS: Aging is a complex process that leads to changes in all the systems of the body and all the functions of the person; however, aging develops at different rates in different people, and chronological age is not always consistent with biological age. SUMMARY: Gerontologists are focused not only on finding the best theory able to explain aging but also on identifying one or more markers, which are able to describe aging processes. These biomarkers are necessary to better define the aging-related pathologies, manage multimorbidity, and improve the quality of life. The aim of this paper is to review the most recent evidence on aging biomarkers and the clusters related to them for personalization of treatments.","output":"Biological and Functional Biomarkers of Aging: Definition, Characteristics, and How They Can Impact Everyday Cancer Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We feel that the current COVID-19 crisis has created great uncertainty and anxiety among medical students With medical school classes initially being conducted on the web and the approaching season of the Match (a uniform system by which residency candidates and residency programs in the United States simultaneously match with the aid of a computer algorithm to fill first-year and second-year postgraduate training positions accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education), the situation did not seem to be improving The National Resident Matching Program made an official announcement on May 26, 2020, that candidates would not be required to take or pass the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 2 Clinical Skills (CS) examination to participate in the Match On January 26, 2021, formal discontinuation of Step 2 CS was announced;for this reason, we have provided our perspective of possible alternative solutions to the Step 2 CS examination A successful alternative model can be implemented in future residency match seasons as well","output":"The United States Medical Licensing Exam Step 2 Clinical Skills Examination: Potential Alternatives During and After the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous studies have attempted to model the effect of mass media on the transmission of diseases such as influenza; however, quantitative data on media engagement has until recently been difficult to obtain.

HPAI H5N1 is now reported as the most widespread and expensive zoonotic disease recorded and continues to pose a global health threat. The aim of this research was to assess the potential of utilising Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP) assessments in providing a framework for a rapid response to emerging infectious disease outbreaks. This novel approach applies a scientific process, widely used in food production systems, to assess risks related to a specific emerging health threat within a known zoonotic disease hotspot. We conducted a HACCP assessment for HPAI viruses within Vietnams domestic poultry trade and relate our findings to the existing literature. Our HACCP assessment identified poultry flock isolation, transportation, slaughter, preparation and consumption as critical control points for Vietnams domestic poultry trade. Introduction of the preventative measures highlighted through this HACCP evaluation would reduce the risks posed by HPAI viruses and pressure on the national economy. We conclude that this HACCP assessment provides compelling evidence for the future potential that HACCP analyses could play in initiating a rapid response to emerging infectious diseases.","output":"Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points Assessment as a Tool to Respond to Emerging Infectious Disease Outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The research field of glucose biosensing has shown remarkable growth and development since the first reported enzyme electrode in 1962.

STUDY DESIGN Descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Department of Thoracic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Bal?kesir University, Turkey, between May 2015 and March 2020. METHODOLOGY Patients who underwent surgery for pulmonary hydatid cysts were evaluated retrospectively, for the age, gender, symptoms, cyst size and localisation, preferred surgery, duration of surgery, the extent of the intraoperative bleeding, duration of the chest drainage, hospitalisation time, and postoperative complications. The relationship between the categorical variables was examined with the Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests and the relationship between the non-parametric data and continuous variables with the Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS A total of 60 patients included in the study; 23 underwent videothoracoscopic surgery and 37 had thoracotomy. There were no statistically significant differences between groups as gender, age, location and size of cyst. The videothoracoscopic surgery has superiority to thoracotomy group in terms of lower duration of operation, less perioperative bleeding (p = 0.005), early chest tube removal and lower hospitalisation time (both p <0.001). But there were no statistical difference between groups in complication rates (p = 0.340).

Thirteen clinicians delivered home- and school-based Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) via videoconferencing on tablets and computers to 60 child patients (71.7% Latinx, 18.3% Black, and 10.0% non-Hispanic White). Patients and caregivers completed the TSQ at treatment discharge via telephone, videoconferencing, or in-person interviews. There was a high level of satisfaction among patients and caregivers receiving TF-CBT via telemental health. Furthermore, most youth and caregivers felt comfortable using the telehealth equipment from the outset of therapy, and all participants who were not initially comfortable using the equipment reported feeling more comfortable over time. The most common barriers to traditional office-based services were caregiver work schedule (57.7%), distance to mental health clinic (55.8%), and lack of transportation (44.2%). Patients and caregivers expressed a preference for telemental health services if given the option between receiving therapy via videoconferencing versus going to an office-based clinic. Findings indicated telemental health treatment addressed barriers that would have otherwise prevented families from accessing office-based services.

OBJECTIVE: To overcome this issue, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model of COVID-19, named EDRnet (ensemble learning model based on deep neural network and random forest models), to predict in-hospital mortality using a routine blood sample at the time of hospital admission. METHODS: We selected 28 blood biomarkers and used the age and gender information of patients as model inputs. To improve the mortality prediction, we adopted an ensemble approach combining deep neural network and random forest models. We trained our model with a database of blood samples from 361 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, and applied it to 106 COVID-19 patients in three Korean medical institutions. RESULTS: In the testing data sets, EDRnet provided high sensitivity (100%), specificity (91%), and accuracy (92%). To extend the number of patient data points, we developed a web application (BeatCOVID19) where anyone can access the model to predict mortality and can register his or her own blood laboratory results.

STUDY DESIGN Randomized controlled trial. ANIMALS 30 adult female dogs. METHODS Dogs were randomly assigned to ST or DS procedures. Measures of nociception were assessed through measurements of preoperative and intraoperative heart rate during manipulation of the suspensory ligament. Measures of pain were assessed through preoperative and postoperative pain scores by using the short form Glasgow Composite Pain Scale. Time efficiency was measured through total surgical time and the time to release each suspensory ligament. RESULTS After body weight was accounted for, the total surgical time was 1.1 minutes (P = .06) faster for ST than for DS, and each additional kilogram of body weight increased total surgical time by 0.1 minutes (P = .02). Digital strumming had 30.6-fold greater odds of taking greater than 1 minute compared with ST (P = .001). The heart rate from baseline to peak was 7.4 beats per minute lower in the ST group than in the DS group (P = .06). No complications were observed, and there was no difference in postoperative pain scores between treatments. CONCLUSION Sharp transection was faster and generated less intraoperative acceleration in heart rate but did not differ in postoperative outcomes compared with DS.

While a relatively rare phenomenon, early identification and discontinuation of the offending agent is pivotal to patient management. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of probable atorvastatin induced DRESS syndrome without rash. CASE PRESENTATION: An adult female presented with 4 days of persistent fevers, abdominal and flank pain, malaise, and generalized muscle weakness without any cutaneous reaction following 20 days of therapy with atorvastatin. She was febrile (38.5 C), at presentation with a heart rate of 72, and blood pressure of 93/51 mmHg. Her laboratory investigations at their peak demonstrated an Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) of 792 U/L, Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 265 U/L, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) of 236 U/L, total bilirubin at 21 mg/dL, eosinophils 3100 cells/L, leukocytes 20.2 K/L, hemoglobin of 12.5 gm/dL. During her admission she had normal creatinine and troponin. Her serology for Hepatitis A, B and C were negative. Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr viral serologies were negative. Antinuclear Antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), mitochondrial antibody, and smooth muscle antibody were negative. The patient was initially diagnosed as having pyelonephritis due to nonspecific bilateral flank pain but given ongoing fevers and lack of clinical and laboratory improvement with antibiotics, a diagnosis of atorvastatin induced DRESS syndrome was considered probable, and atorvastatin was discontinued. The patients clinical status improved gradually without any further therapy and her liver enzymes and eosinophils normalized over the course of a month. CONCLUSION: In patients who present with systemic organ involvement and eosinophilia, even without cutaneous manifestations, clinicians should apply the RegiSCAR criteria for DRESS syndrome. This can then help guide treatment with discontinuation of offending agent, or treatment with systemic corticosteroids.","output":"Liver enzyme elevation and eosinophilia with atorvastatin: a case of probable DRESS without cutaneous symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A bibliometric analysis of the Annals of Laboratory Medicine (ALM) was performed to understand its position in the medical laboratory technology category and to suggest a developmental strategy.

However, this overwhelming toll has not been distributed equally, with geographic, race-ethnic, age, and socioeconomic disparities in exposure and mortality defining features of the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We used individual-level COVID-19 incidence and mortality data from the U.S. state of Michigan to estimate age-specific incidence and mortality rates by race/ethnic group. Data were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian regression models, and model results were validated using posterior predictive checks. RESULTS: In crude and age-standardized analyses we found rates of incidence and mortality more than twice as high than Whites for all groups except Native Americans. Blacks experienced the greatest burden of confirmed and probable COVID-19 infection (Age-standardized incidence = 1,626/100,000 population) and mortality (age-standardized mortality rate 244/100,000). These rates reflect large disparities, as Blacks experienced age-standardized incidence and mortality rates 5.5 (95% Posterior Credible Interval [CrI] = 5.4, 5.6) and 6.7 (95% CrI = 6.4, 7.1) times higher than Whites, respectively. We found that the bulk of the disparity in mortality between Blacks and Whites is driven by dramatically higher rates of COVID-19 infection across all age groups, particularly among older adults, rather than age-specific variation in case-fatality rates. CONCLUSIONS: This work suggests that well-documented racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality in hard-hit settings, such as the U.S. state of Michigan, are driven primarily by variation in household, community and workplace exposure rather than case-fatality rates.","output":"Racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality are driven by unequal infection risks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate predictions of motor impairment after stroke are of cardinal importance for the patient, clinician, and healthcare system. More than 10 years ago, the proportional recovery rule was introduced by promising that high-fidelity predictions of recovery following stroke were based only on the initially lost motor function, at least for a specific fraction of patients. However, emerging evidence suggests that this recovery rule is subject to various confounds and may apply less universally than previously assumed. Here, we systematically revisited stroke outcome predictions by applying strategies to avoid confounds and fitting hierarchical Bayesian models. We jointly analysed 385 post-stroke trajectories from six separate studies-one of the largest overall datasets of upper limb motor recovery. We addressed confounding ceiling effects by introducing a subset approach and ensured correct model estimation through synthetic data simulations. Subsequently, we used model comparisons to assess the underlying nature of recovery within our empirical recovery data. The first model comparison, relying on the conventional fraction of patients called 'fitters', pointed to a combination of proportional to lost function and constant recovery. 'Proportional to lost' here describes the original notion of proportionality, indicating greater recovery in case of a more severe initial impairment. This combination explained only 32% of the variance in recovery, which is in stark contrast to previous reports of >80%. When instead analysing the complete spectrum of subjects, 'fitters' and 'non-fitters', a combination of proportional to spared function and constant recovery was favoured, implying a more significant improvement in case of more preserved function. Explained variance was at 53%. Therefore, our quantitative findings suggest that motor recovery post-stroke may exhibit some characteristics of proportionality. However, the variance explained was substantially reduced compared to what has previously been reported. This finding motivates future research moving beyond solely behaviour scores to explain stroke recovery and establish robust and discriminating single-subject predictions.","output":"Bringing proportional recovery into proportion: Bayesian modelling of post-stroke motor impairment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We often see an upsurge of humor inspired by tragic circumstances: this happened also during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak. However, little is known about the emotional response to tragedy-triggered humor, let alone Covid-19 humor. With a large-scale survey completed during the early stages of Italys lockdown, we studied the appreciation (funniness and aversiveness) of different formats of Covid-19 humor shared on social media. Results of an analysis of the role of demographic, personality, and psychological distance factors with linear mixed models showed that Covid-19 humor lacks a signature of funniness, but displays a mark of aversiveness. Among demographics, age and gender were key factors: with increasing age and in women, Covid-19 humor was judged as more aversive. Individuals using humor to cope with uneasy circumstances judged Covid-19 humor as funnier and less aversive. Furthermore, the perceived risk of infection amplified Covid-19 humor aversiveness, while kilometrical distance from the first Italian contagion hotspot raised the amusement in global terms. These findings expand our knowledge about dark humor and should raise awareness of the great variation in the emotional impact of Covid-19 humor and of the need to ponder where and with whom to share the laugh about the pandemic.","output":"Funny but aversive: A large-scale survey of the emotional response to Covid-19 humor in the Italian population during the lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of novel coronavirus in 2019 has shaken the whole world and it quickly evolved as a global pandemic, placing everyone in a panic situation. Considering its long-term effects on day to day lives, the necessity of wearing face mask and social distancing brings in picture the requirement of a contact less biometric system for all future authentication systems. One of the solutions is to use periocular biometric as it does not need physical contact like fingerprint biometric and is able to identify even people wearing face masks. Since, the periocular region is a small area as compared to face, extraction of required number of features from that small region is the major concern to make the system highly robust.

The proposed feature fusion approach is evaluated using multiclass SVM classifier with three different benchmark databases, UBIPr, Color FERET and Ethnic Ocular as well as for three non-ideal scenarios i.e. the effect of eyeglasses, effect of eye occlusion and pose variations.

METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed all CT angiograms of the pulmonary arteries done in patients with suspected pulmonary embolisms between March 15 and April 30, 2020 and compared them with studies done in the same period one year earlier. RESULTS: We included 492 pulmonary CT angiograms (342 (69.9%) in patients with COVID-19 and 147 (30.1%) in patients without COVID-19). The prevalence of pulmonary embolisms was higher in patients with COVID-19 (26% vs. 16.3% in patients without COVID-19, p=0.0197; relative risk=1.6). The prevalence of pulmonary embolisms in the same period in 2019 was 13.2%, similar to that of the group of COVID-19-negative patients in 2020 (p=0.43). There were no significant differences in D-dimer levels or the location of pulmonary embolisms between the two groups. CT showed moderate or severe pulmonary involvement in 78.7% of the patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 have an increased prevalence of pulmonary embolisms (26%), and most (78.7%) have moderate or severe lung involvement on CT studies.

Our objectives were to measure adjustments to standard IRB review processes, IRB turnaround time and document and any novel ethical issues encountered. METHODS: Structured data requests were sent to members of the Consortium to Advance Effective Research Ethics Oversight directing Human Research Protection Programs (HRPP). RESULTS: Fourteen of the 32 HRPP director members responded to a questionnaire about their approach to review and oversight during COVID-19. Eleven of the 14 provided summary data on COVID-19-specific protocols and six of the 11 provided protocol-related documents for our review. All respondents adopted at least one additional COVID-19-specific step to their usual review process. The average turnaround time for convened and expedited IRB reviews was 15 calendar days. In our review of the documents from 194 COVID-19-specific protocols (n = 302 documents), we identified only a single review that raised ethical concerns unique to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide a snapshot of how HRPPs approached the review of COVID-19-specific protocols at the start of the pandemic in the USA.

However, whether the students are prepared for such an occupation remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate medical students preparedness for a commitment in the pandemic and to assess the impact on their skills and attitudes. Methods: In April 2020, the CoronaPreventMainz (CPM) study was initiated to test 3300 employees with direct patient contact at the University Medical Center Mainz. To accomplish the huge logistic effort, medical students were recruited as support staff.Using a web-based questionnaire, the participating students were asked 27 questions covering six different topics. Results: Of the 75 recruited students, 63 (84.0%) participated in this survey. The median age was 24 years, and 66.6% (n = 42) were female. The vast majority agreed that students should be used as voluntary helpers during this crisis (87.3%) and had the feeling of contributing in the fight against the pandemic (90.5%). Most of the students (80.6%) even reported an improvement in their practical skills. Fear of self-infection was low (7.9%), and overextending situations occurred for just 3.2%. However, less than one-fifth (19.4%) of the students felt prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by medical school, and two-thirds (67.7%) demanded special preparation. Conclusion: Through their commitment, the medical students felt that they were taking part in the fight against the pandemic. However, only a few felt well-prepared by medical school and the students need for special preparation courses is huge. Therefore, single-center initiatives can only be the beginning.

Stringent physical distancing recommendations and shelter-in-place were first introduced in the hardest-hit provinces, and by March, these recommendations were uniform throughout the country. In the presence of an evolving and deadly pandemic, we sought to investigate the impact of this pandemic on individual well-being and prevention practices among Chinese urban residents. From March 2C11, 2020, 4607 individuals were recruited from 11 provinces with varying numbers of COVID-19 cases using the social networking app WeChat to complete a brief, anonymous, online survey. The analytical sample was restricted to 2551 urban residents. Standardized scales measured generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), the primary outcome. Multiple logistic regression was conducted to identify correlates of GAD alongside assessment of community practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the recommended public health practices significantly (p < 0.001) increased, including wearing facial mask, practicing physical distancing, handwashing, decreased public spitting, and going outside in urban communities. Overall, 40.3% of participants met screening criteria for GAD and 49.3%, 62.6%, and 55.4% reported that their work, social life, and family life were interrupted by anxious feelings, respectively. Independent correlates of having anxiety symptoms included being a healthcare provider (aOR = 1.58, p < 0.01), living in regions with a higher density of COVID-19 cases (aOR = 2.13, p < 0.01), having completed college (aOR = 1.38, p = 0.03), meeting screening criteria for depression (aOR = 6.03, p < 0.01), and poorer perceived health status (aOR = 1.54, p < 0.01). COVID-19 had a profound impact on the health of urban dwellers throughout China. Not only did they markedly increase their self- and community-protective behaviors, but they also experienced high levels of anxiety associated with a heightened vulnerability like depression, having poor perceived health, and the potential of increased exposure to COVID-19 such as living closer to the epicenter of the pandemic.

It is associated with high mortality in those who develop respiratory complications and require admission to intensive care. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a supportive therapy option for selected severely ill patients who deteriorate despite the best supportive care. During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, extra demand led to staff reorganization; hence, cardiac surgery consultants joined the ECMO retrieval team. This article describes how we increased service provisions to adapt to the changes in activity and staffing. METHODS: The data were collected from 16 March 2020 to 8 May 2020. The patients were referred through a dedicated Web-based referral portal to cope with increasing demand. The retrieval team attended the referring hospital, reviewed the patients and made the final decision to proceed with ECMO. RESULTS: We reported 41 ECMO retrieval runs during this study period. Apart from staffing changes, other retrieval protocols were maintained. The preferred cannulation method for veno-venous ECMO was drainage via the femoral vein and return to the right internal jugular vein. There were no complications reported during cannulation or transport. CONCLUSIONS: Staff reorganization in a crisis is of paramount importance. For those with precise transferrable skills, experience can be gained quickly with appropriate supervision. Therefore, the team members were selected based on skill mix rather than on roles that are more traditional. We have demonstrated that an ECMO retrieval service can be reorganized swiftly and successfully to cope with the sudden increase in demand by spending cardiac surgeons services to supplement the anaesthetic-intensivist roles.","output":"Regional extracorporeal membrane oxygenation retrieval service during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic: an interdisciplinary team approach to maintain service provision despite increased demand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to move and maintain posture is critically dependent on motion and orientation information provided by the vestibular system. When this system delivers noisy or erred information it can, in some cases, be attenuated through habituation. Here we investigate whether multiple mechanisms of attenuation act to decrease vestibular gain due to noise added using supra-threshold random-waveform galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS). Forty-five participants completed one of three conditions. Each condition consisted of two 4-min standing periods with stimulation surrounding a 1-h period of either walking with stimulation, walking without stimulation, or sitting quietly. An instrumented treadmill recorded horizontal forces at the feet during standing and walking. We quantified response attenuation to GVS by comparing vestibular stimulus-horizontal force gain between conditions. First stimulus exposure caused an 18% decrease in gain during the first 40 s of standing. Attenuation recommenced only when subjects walked with stimulation, resulting in a 38% decrease in gain over 60 min that did not transfer to standing following walking. The disparity in attenuation dynamics and absent carry over between standing and walking suggests that two mechanisms of attenuation, one associated with first exposure to the stimulus and another that is task specific, may act to decrease vestibulomotor gain.","output":"Vestibular attenuation to random-waveform galvanic vestibular stimulation during standing and treadmill walking."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a mobility futurist and automotive-safety expert, Reimer has the industry's ear on emerging car technologies","output":"ID Asks/Bryan Reimer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) This study aims to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients admitted to Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan (HTAA), Pahang, Malaysia and to identify the clinical and laboratory markers for severe disease, complications and virologic clearance according to clinical staging","output":"Clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) patients in Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread and have grave health and socioeconomic consequences worldwide.

The aim of this study was to examine the well-being of older Faroese by conducting a direct comparison of well-being indicators on the same group of elderly people before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data were collected from 227 home-dwelling adults aged 82-86 years from the Faroese Septuagenarians cohort. The pre-COVID-19 period was from December 2017 to January 2019, and the COVID-19 period was from 8 June to 15 July 2020. Three aspects of well-being were assessed: loneliness, self-rated health and quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF). RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were significant increases in loneliness (21.8% vs. 6.8%; p<0.001) and in worse self-rated health compared to the previous year (37.2% vs. 19.0%; p<0.001). In terms of quality of life, the domains of overall quality of life (74.3314.96 vs. 71.8815.21; p=0.04) and physical health (73.8117.11 vs. 71.6617.37; p=0.03) deteriorated.

Furthermore, all deceased patients were severe/critical cases. The main reasons for the high mortality of severe/critical patients are advanced age (>60 years old) and combined underlying diseases. Elderly patients with comorbidities show decreased organ function and low compensation for damage such as hypoxia and inflammation, which accelerates disease progression. The lung is the main target organ attacked by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) while immune organs, liver, blood vessels and other organs are damaged to varying degrees. Liver volume is increased, and mild active inflammation and focal necrosis are observed in the portal area. Virus particles have also been detected in liver cells. Therefore, multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) and individualized treatment plans, accurate prediction of disease progression and timely interventions are vital to effectively reduce mortality. Specifically, a \\"multidisciplinary three-dimensional management, individualized comprehensive plan\\" should be implemented. The treatment plan complies with three principles, namely, multidisciplinary management of patients, individualized diagnosis and treatment plans, and timely monitoring and intervention of disease. MDT members are mainly physicians from critical medicine, infection and respiratory disciplines, but also include cardiovascular, kidney, endocrine, digestion, nerve, nutrition, rehabilitation, psychology and specialty care. According to a patient's specific disease condition, an individualized diagnosis and treatment plan is formulated (one plan for one patient). While selecting individualized antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory treatment, we also strengthen nutritional support, psychological intervention, comprehensive rehabilitation and timely and full-course intervention to develop overall and special nursing plans. In response to the rapid progression of severe/critical patients, MDT members need to establish a three-dimensional management model with close observation and timely evaluation. The MDT should make rounds of the quarantine wards both morning and night, and of critical patient wards nightly, to implement \\"round-the-clock rounds management\\", to accurately predict disease progression, perform the quick intervention and prevent rapid deterioration of the patient. Our MDT has cumulatively treated 77 severe/critical COVID-19 cases, including 62 (80.5%) severe cases and 15 (19.5%) critical cases, with an average age of 63.8 years. Fifty-three (68.8%) cases presented with more than one underlying disease and 65 (84.4%) severe cases recovered from COVID-19. The average hospital stay of severe/critical cases was 22 days, and the mortality rate was 2.6%, both of which were significantly lower than the 30-40 days and 49.0-61.5%, respectively, reported in the literature. Therefore, a multidisciplinary, three-dimensional and individualized comprehensive treatment plan can effectively reduce the mortality rate of severe/critical COVID-19 and improve the cure rate.","output":"Multidisciplinary, three-dimensional and individualized comprehensive treatment for severe/critical COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer have a higher risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) than noncancer patients.

Clinical parameters relating to cancer history (type and treatment) and COVID\\\\19 were collected. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary analyses were the association between clinical factors and severe COVID\\\\19 and OS. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients with cancer were diagnosed with COVID\\\\19, with a median age of 66 years (range, 37\\\\98 years). Lung (21 patients; 19.6%), gastrointestinal (20 patients; 18.7%), and genitourinary (20 patients; 18.7%) cancers were the most common cancer diagnoses. A total of 37 patients (34.6%) were receiving active anticancer treatment when diagnosed with COVID\\\\19, whereas 70 patients (65.4%) were on follow\\\\up. Overall, 52.3% of patients (56 patients) developed severe COVID\\\\19; this rate was found to be higher among patients receiving anticancer treatment than those on follow\\\\up (64.9% vs 45.7%), which corresponded to an inferior OS in the former subgroup of patients (hazard ratio, 3.365; 95% CI, 1.455\\\\7.782 [P = .005]). The detrimental effect of anticancer treatment on OS was found to be independent of exposure to systemic therapy (case fatality rate of 33.3% [systemic therapy] vs 43.8% [nonsystemic therapy]).

Furthermore, the subclassification of achalasia as used in the Chicago classification has prognostic value and can be used to direct treatment. Diagnosis of esophageal spasm has been improved by using the distal latency as diagnostic criterion. Recently, criteria for minor disorders of peristalsis have been sharpened, leading to a lower rate of patients with abnormal results, thereby increasing the relevance of a diagnosis. High-resolution manometry is now considered the gold standard for diagnosis of esophageal motility disorders.

One such collaboration is the Southern African Development Community (SADC) medicines registration collaborative initiative, ZaZiBoNa. Countries participate in the initiative by contributing to regulatory reviews and good manufacturing practices inspections. The aim of this study was to review and compare the registration processes of regulatory authorities of Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe to identify strategies for better alignment. Methods: A senior member of the division responsible for issuing marketing authorisations completed an established and validated questionnaire, which standardises the review process, allowing key milestones, activities and practices of the six regulatory authorities to be identified and compared. The completed questionnaires were validated by the heads of the respective agencies. Results: The six countries vary in population and in the size of their respective regulatory agency and the resources allocated to regulatory reviews. The review processes of the six agencies were similar; however, differences were noted in the milestones recorded; for example, two of the countries did not record the start of the scientific assessment. Additionally, decisions for marketing authorisation were made by an expert committee in four of the countries and by the head of the agency and the Minister of Health in two countries. All six agencies implemented the majority of good review practices; however, the need for improvement in the areas of transparency and communication and quality decision making practices was a common finding for all six countries. Conclusions: Participation in the ZaZiBoNa initiative has improved the way in which the six agencies perform regulatory reviews in their countries, highlighting the realisation of one of the key objectives of the initiative, which was building the expert capacity of member countries.

Among patients receiving glucocorticoids, early interferon therapy was associated with earlier hospital discharge (adjusted HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.19-2.37) and symptom relief (adjusted HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06-2.08), while these associations were insignificant among glucocorticoids nonusers. Early interferon therapy was also associated with lower prevalence of prolonged viral shedding (adjusted OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10-0.57) only among glucocorticoids users. Additionally, these associations were glucocorticoid cumulative dose- and timing-dependent. These findings reveal potential therapeutic synergy between interferons and glucocorticoids in COVID-19 that warrants further investigation.","output":"Clinical evidence of an interferon-glucocorticoid therapeutic synergy in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Probiotic bacteria are widely accepted as therapeutic agents against inflammatory bowel diseases for their immunostimulating effects.

Because of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, our institution noted a significant decline in the number of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage presenting to the hospital. We report one such example of a patient who developed new-onset severe headache and vomiting and did not seek medical attention because of COVID-19. Two months later, she was noted to have ptosis during a routine follow-up and was found to have a complete, pupil-involving third nerve palsy. Computed tomography angiography was performed and revealed an irregular bilobed saccular aneurysm (7  9  5 mm) of the right posterior communicating (PComm) artery, but no acute hemorrhage was visible on CT. On MRI, immediately adjacent to the aneurysm, there was a small subacute hematoma in the right medial temporal lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema. This case had a fortunate and unique outcome as she had a contained hematoma adjacent to the ruptured PComm aneurysm and did not experience severe morbidity from the subarachnoid hemorrhage nor did she rebleed in the interval in which she did not seek care.

Bioactive lipids play a major role in the fine-tuning of this dynamic process in a timely manner. During inflammation and its resolution, polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and macrophages switch from producing pro-inflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes to specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), namely, lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins, which are operative at the local level to limit further inflammation and tissue injury and restore homeostasis. Accumulating evidences expand now the role and actions of these lipid mediators from innate to adaptive immunity. In particular, SPMs have been shown to contribute to the control of chronic inflammation, and alterations in their production and/or function have been associated with the persistence of several pathological conditions, including autoimmunity, in human and experimental models. In this review, we focus on the impact of pro-resolving lipids on T cells through their ability to modulate T-cell responses. In particular, the effects of the different families of SPMs to restrain effector T-cell functions while promoting regulatory T cells will be reviewed, along with the underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, the emerging concept of SPMs as new biological markers for disease diagnostic and progression and as putative therapeutic tools to regulate the development and magnitude of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases is discussed.","output":"Regulation of T-Cell Immune Responses by Pro-Resolving Lipid Mediators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In times of crisis in public health where the resources available in the hospital network are scarce and these must be used to the fullest, innovative ideas arise, which allow multiplying the use of existing resources, as artificial mechanical ventilators can be.

It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries and is responsible for several outbreaks in developed countries. Studying certain parameters of the pathogen, such as the incubation period, provides a better understanding of its pathophysiology and its characteristics within a population. Outbreak investigations and human experimental studies provide an avenue to study these relevant parameters. METHODS In this study, the authors have undertaken a systematic review of outbreak investigation reports and experimental studies, extracted reported data, tested for heterogeneity, identified subgroups of studies with limited evidence of heterogeneity between them and identified factors that may contribute to the distribution of incubation period. Following identification of relevant studies, we extracted both raw and summary incubation data. We tested for heterogeneity by deriving the value of I2 and conducting a KS-test to compare the distribution between studies. We performed a linear regression analysis to identify the factors associated with incubation period and using the resulting p-values from the KS-test, we conducted a hierarchical cluster analysis to classify studies with limited evidence of heterogeneity into subgroups. RESULTS We identified thirteen studies to be included in the review and extracted raw incubation period data from eleven. The value of I2 was 84% and the proportion of KS test p-values that were less than 0.05 was 63.6% indicating high heterogeneity not due to chance. We identified vaccine history and attack rates as factors that may be associated with incubation period, although these were not significant in the multivariable analysis (p-value: 0.1). From the hierarchical clustering analysis, we classified the studies into five subgroups. The mean incubation period of the subgroups ranged from 9.7 days to 21.2 days. Outbreaks reporting cases with previous vaccination history were clustered in a single subgroup and reported the longest incubation period. CONCLUSIONS We identified attack rate and previous vaccination as possible associating factors, however further work involving analyses of individual patient data and developing mathematical models is needed to confirm these as well as examine additional factors that have not been included in our study.","output":"Incubation period of typhoidal salmonellosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of outbreaks and experimental studies occurring over the last century."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Earlier definitions of status epilepticus (SE) were based on the duration of seizures, but newer definitions rely more on a pragmatic staging based on treatment failures (Table 23.1).

However, towards the end of 2020, a remarkable exponential growth was observed and the TETRIS strategy was lost. Here, we aimed to understand the factors that fueled SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics during the first epidemic wave in the country. We recovered 84 whole viral genomes from patients diagnosed between November, 2020 and February, 2021 in Rocha, a sentinel eastern Uruguayan department bordering Brazil. The lineage B.1.1.28 was the most prevalent in Rocha during November-December 2020, P.2 became the dominant one during January-February 2021, while the first P.1 sequences corresponds to February, 2021. The lineage replacement process agrees with that observed in several Brazilian states, including Rio Grande do Sul (RS). We observed a one to three month delay between the appearance of P.2 and P.1 in RS and their subsequent detection in Rocha. The phylogenetic analysis detected two B.1.1.28 and one P.2 main Uruguayan SARS-CoV-2 clades, introduced from the southern and southeastern Brazilian regions into Rocha between early November and mid December, 2020. One synonymous mutation distinguishes the sequences of the main B.1.1.28 clade in Rocha from those widely distributed in RS. The minor B.1.1.28 cluster, distinguished by several mutations, harbours non-synonymous changes in the Spike protein: Q675H and Q677H, so far not concurrently reported. The convergent appearance of S:Q677H in different viral lineages and its proximity to the S1/S2 cleavage site raise concerns about its functional relevance. The observed S:E484K-VOI P.2 partial replacement of previously circulating lineages in Rocha might have increased transmissibility as suggested by the significant decrease in Ct values. Our study emphasizes the impact of Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in Uruguay and the need of reinforcing real-time genomic surveillance on specific Uruguayan border locations, as one of the key elements for achieving long-term COVID-19 epidemic control.","output":"Spatiotemporal dissemination pattern of SARS-CoV-2 B1.1.28-derived lineages introduced into Uruguay across its southeastern border with Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNase L is an ankyrin repeat domain containing dual endoribonuclease-pseudokinase that is activated by unusual 2,5-oligoadenylate (2-5A) second messengers and which impedes viral infections in higher vertebrates.

Less is known about how an MDS affects how staff assess, provide and review residents everyday care. The review aimed to develop a theory-driven understanding of how care home staff can effectively implement and use MDS to plan and deliver care for residents. METHODS: The realist review was organised according to RAMESES (Realist And Meta-narrative Evidence Synthesis: and Evolving Standards) guidelines. There were three overlapping stages: 1) defining the scope of the review and theory development on the use of minimum data set 2) testing and refining candidate programme theories through iterative literature searches and stakeholders consultations as well as discussion among the research team; and 3) data synthesis from stages 1 and 2. The following databases were used MEDLINE via OVID, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), ASSIA [Applied Social Sciences Citation Index and Abstracts]) and sources of grey literature. RESULTS: Fifty-one papers informed the development of three key interlinked theoretical propositions: motivation (mandates and incentives for Minimum Data Set completion); frontline staff monitoring (when Minimum Data Set completion is built into the working practices of the care home); and embedded recording systems (Minimum Data Set recording system is integral to collecting residents data).

METHODS: A total of 602 COVID-19 patients who were brought to the emergency department within the period from March to September 2020 were included in the study. The BUN level, albumin level, BAR, age, gender, and in-hospital mortality status of the patients were recorded. The patients were grouped by in-hospital mortality. Statistical comparison was conducted between the groups. RESULTS: Of the patients who were included in the study, 312(51.8%) were male, and their median age was 63 years (49C73). There was in-hospital mortality in 96(15.9%) patients. The median BUN and BAR values of the patients in the non-survivor group were significantly higher than those in the survivor group (BUN: 24.76 [17.38C38.31] and 14.43 [10.84C20.42], respectively [p < 0.001]; BAR: 6.7 [4.7C10.1] and 3.4 [2.5C5.2], respectively [p < 0.001]). The mean albumin value in the non-survivor group was significantly lower than that in the survivor group (3.60  0.58 and 4.13  0.51, respectively; p < 0.001).

Along with protecting lives, management of contaminated covid wastes is very essential to reduce environmental and human health risks. Inappropriate management of covid wastes can cause serious possibilities of disease transmission to health workers, waste pickers, patients, and the community in general through spreading of Corona virus. Poor management of these infected wastes has created huge problems in healthcare waste handling as the amount of waste generated due to pandemic is excessively large. In this paper, we have presented an Internet of Things(IoT)-based smart framework for covid waste management. We have proposed two types of smart covid waste bins here, one for collecting covid wastes for home isolated patients and other for covid medical wastes, generated from hospitals/nursing homes, etc. These intelligent bins can capture waste information automatically by attached sensors, and the collected data is sent wirelessly to remote municipality server for further analysis. Municipality officials can take decisions such as number of bins to be deployed, at which time intervals wastes are to be cleared, etc., based on those information. The proposed framework minimizes the human interaction with the covid waste and restricts the spreading of virus. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"Covid Waste Management Using IoT: A Smart Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most prominent strand of moral thought in the African philosophical tradition is relational and cohesive, roughly demanding that we enter into community with each other. Familiar is the view that being a real person means sharing a way of life with others, perhaps even in their fate. What does such a communal ethic prescribe for the coronavirus pandemic? Might it forbid one from social distancing, at least away from intimates? Or would it entail that social distancing is wrong to some degree, although morally permissible on balance? Or could it mean that social distancing is not wrong to any degree and could, under certain circumstances, be the right way to commune? In this article, I defend the latter view. I argue that, given an independently attractive understanding of how to value communal relationship, distancing oneself from others when necessary to protect them from serious incapacitation or harm can come at no cost to right action. However, I also discuss cases in which social distancing would evince a lack of good character, despite being the right thing to do.","output":"What does an African ethic of social cohesion entail for social distancing?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Registered nurses are an essential workforce group across the globe.

Wet markets are critical for food security and sustainable development in their respective regions. Due to their cultural significance, they attract numerous visitors and consequently generate tourist-geared information on the Web (ie, on social networks such as TripAdvisor). These data can be used to create a novel, international wet market inventory to support epidemiological surveillance and control in such settings, which are often associated with negative health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Using social network data, we aimed to assess the level of wet markets touristic importance on the Web, produce the first distribution map of wet markets of touristic interest, and identify common diseases facing visitors in these settings. METHODS: A Google search was performed on 31 food marketCrelated keywords, with the first 150 results for each keyword evaluated based on their relevance to tourism. Of all these queries, wet market had the highest number of tourism-related Google Search results; among these, TripAdvisor was the most frequently-occurring travel information aggregator, prompting its selection as the data source for this study. A Web scraping tool (ParseHub) was used to extract wet market names, locations, and reviews from TripAdvisor. The latter were searched for disease-related content, which enabled assignment of GeoSentinel diagnosis codes to each. This syndromic categorization was overlaid onto a mapping of wet market locations. Regional prevalence of the most commonly occurring symptom group - food poisoning - was then determined (ie, by dividing the number of wet markets per continent with more than or equal to 1 review containing this syndrome by the total number of wet markets on that continent with syndromic information). RESULTS: Of the 1090 hits on TripAdvisor for wet market, 36.06% (393/1090) conformed to the querys definition; wet markets were heterogeneously distributed: Asia concentrated 62.6% (246/393) of them, Europe 19.3% (76/393), North America 7.9% (31/393), Oceania 5.1% (20/393), Africa 3.1% (12/393), and South America 2.0% (8/393). Syndromic information was available for 14.5% (57/393) of wet markets. The most frequently occurring syndrome among visitors to these wet markets was food poisoning, accounting for 54% (51/95) of diagnoses. Cases of this syndrome were identified in 56% (22/39) of wet markets with syndromic information in Asia, 71% (5/7) in Europe, and 71% (5/7) in North America. All wet markets in South America and Oceania reported food poisoning cases, but the number of reviews with syndromic information was very limited in these regions (n=2). CONCLUSIONS: The map produced illustrates the potential role of touristically relevant social network data to support global epidemiological surveillance. This includes the possibility to approximate the global distribution of wet markets and to identify diseases (ie, food poisoning) that are most prevalent in such settings.","output":"Wet Markets and Food Safety: TripAdvisor for Improved Global Digital Surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[2] Kutter JS et al reviewed evidence of virus transmission routes predating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [9] Buonanno G et al looked at Quantitative assessment of the risk of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection through prospective and retrospective applications Buonanno G, Morawska L, Stabile L Quantitative assessment of the risk of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection: Prospective and retrospective applications 83 ? 2021 Saudi Journal of Anesthesia ;Published by Wolters Kluwer- Medknow The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has infected over 82 8 million people worldwide, causing unprecedented morbidity and mortality rate amongst those affected, in particular within the healthcare worker population [Extracted from the article] Copyright of Saudi Journal of Anaesthesia is the property of Wolters Kluwer India Pvt Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Barrier devices during COVID-19 pandemic ?

The disease progression associated with the proinflammatory host response prompted us to examine the role of early corticosteroid therapy in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a single pretest, single posttest quasi-experiment in a multicenter health system in Michigan from 12 March to 27 March 2020. Adult patients with confirmed moderate to severe COVID were included. A protocol was implemented on 20 March 2020 using early, short-course, methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day divided in 2 intravenous doses for 3 days. Outcomes of standard of care (SOC) and early corticosteroid groups were evaluated, with a primary composite endpoint of escalation of care from ward to intensive care unit (ICU), new requirement for mechanical ventilation, and mortality. All patients had at least 14 days of follow-up. RESULTS: We analyzed 213 eligible subjects, 81 (38%) and 132 (62%) in SOC and early corticosteroid groups, respectively. The composite endpoint occurred at a significantly lower rate in the early corticosteroid group (34.9% vs 54.3%, P = .005). This treatment effect was observed within each individual component of the composite endpoint. Significant reduction in median hospital length of stay was also observed in the early corticosteroid group (5 vs 8 days, P < .001).

Nevertheless, the most widely used biologic material - acellular dermal matrix (ADM) - exhibits slow repopulation and remodeling, which prevents integration. Additionally, engineering control of these materials is limited because they require a natural source for their production. In the current report, we demonstrate the feasibility of using genetically engineered animals to create decellularized biologic scaffolds with favorable extracellular matrix (ECM) properties. Specifically, we utilized skin from thrombospondin (TSP)-2 KO mice to derive various decellularized products. Scanning electron microscopy and mechanical testing showed that TSP-2 KO ADM exhibited an altered structure and a reduction in elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength, respectively. When a powdered form of KO ADM was implanted subcutaneously, it was able to promote enhanced vascularization over WT. Additionally, when implanted subcutaneously, intact slabs of KO ADM were populated by higher number of host cells when compared to WT. In vitro studies confirmed the promigratory properties of KO ADM. Specifically, degradation products released by pepsin digestion of KO ADM induced greater cell migration than WT. Moreover, cell-derived ECM from TSP-2 null fibroblasts was more permissive to fibroblast migration. Finally, ADMs were implanted in a diabetic wound model to examine their ability to accelerate wound healing. KO ADM exhibited enhanced remodeling and vascular maturation, indicative of efficient integration. Overall, we demonstrate that genetic manipulation enables engineered ECM-based materials with increased regenerative potential.","output":"Decellularized materials derived from TSP2-KO mice promote enhanced neovascularization and integration in diabetic wounds."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the four standardized categories for CT reporting proposed by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) to support a faster triage compared with real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is the reference standard for suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but has long reporting time (6-48 hours) MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 569 thin-section CT examinations performed for patients suspected of having COVID-19 from February 27 to March 27, 2020 (peak of infection in Italy) was conducted The imaging pattern was classified according to the statement by the RSNA as \\"typical,\\" \\"indeterminate,\\" \\"atypical,\\" and \\"negative\\" and compared with RT-PCR for 460 patients Interobserver variability in reporting between a senior and a junior radiologist was evaluated Use of the vascular enlargement sign in indeterminate cases was also assessed RESULTS: The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made in 45 9% (211/460) of patients The \\"typical\\" pattern (n = 172) showed a sensitivity of 71 6%, a specificity of 91 6%, and a positive predictive value of 87 8% for COVID-19 The \\"atypical\\" (n = 67) and \\"negative\\" (n = 123) pattern demonstrated a positive predictive value of 89 6% and 86 2% for non-COVID-19, respectively The \\"indeterminate\\" (n = 98) pattern was nonspecific, but vascular enlargement was most frequently found in patients with COVID-19 (86 1%;P &lt; 001) Interobserver agreement was good for the \\"typical\\" and \\"negative\\" pattern and fair for \\"indeterminate\\" and \\"atypical\\" ( = 0 5;P = 002) CONCLUSION: In an epidemic setting, the application of the four categories proposed by the RSNA provides a standardized diagnostic hypothesis, strongly linked to the RT-PCR results for the \\"typical,\\" \\"atypical,\\" and \\"negative\\" pattern In the \\"indeterminate\\" pattern, the analysis of the vascular enlargement sign could facilitate the interpretation of imaging features ?

SETTING: Focus groups took place via online videoconferencing. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (n=27) were all UK residents aged 18 years and older, representing a range of gender, ethnic, age and occupational backgrounds. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis revealed four main themes: (1) lossparticipants loss of (in-person) social interaction, loss of income and loss of structure and routine led to psychological and emotional losses such as loss of motivation, loss of meaning and loss of self-worth; (2) criticisms of government communicationparticipants reported a lack of trust in government and a lack of clarity in the guidelines around social distancing and isolation; (3) adherenceparticipants reported high self-adherence to social distancing guidelines but reported seeing or hearing of non-adherence in others; (4) uncertainty around social reintegration and the futuresome participants felt they would have lingering concerns over social contact while others were eager to return to high levels of social activity.

In particular, lockdown and related social distancing policies are motivated in some countries by the need to slow virus propagation down, so that the primary wave of patients suffering from severe forms of COVID infection do not exceed the capacity of intensive care units. But unlocking poses a critical issue because relaxing social distancing may, in principle, generate secondary waves. Ironically however, the dynamic repertoire of established epidemiological models that support this kind of reasoning is limited to single epidemic outbreaks. In turn, predictions regarding secondary waves are tautologically derived from imposing assumptions about changes in the so-called \\"effective reproduction number\\". In this work, we depart from this approach and extend the LIST (Location-Infection-Symptom-Testing) model of the COVID pandemic with realistic nonlinear feedback mechanisms that under certain conditions, cause lockdown-induced secondary outbreaks. The original LIST model captures adaptive social distancing, i.e. the transient reduction of the number of person-to-person contacts (and hence the rate of virus transmission), as a societal response to salient public health risks. Here, we consider the possibility that such pruning of socio-geographical networks may also temporarily isolate subsets of local populations from the virus. Crucially however, such unreachable people will become susceptible again when adaptive social distancing relaxes and the density of contacts within socio-geographical networks increases again. Taken together, adaptive social distancing and network unreachability thus close a nonlinear feedback loop that endows the LIST model with a mechanism that can generate autonomous (lockdown-induced) secondary waves. However, whether and how secondary waves arise depend upon the interaction with other nonlinear mechanisms that capture other forms of transmission heterogeneity. We apply the ensuing LIST model to numerical simulations and exhaustive analyses of regional French epidemiological data. In brief, we find evidence for this kind of nonlinear feedback mechanism in the empirical dynamics of the pandemic in France. However, rather than generating catastrophic secondary outbreaks (as is typically assumed), the model predicts that the impact of lockdown-induced variations in population susceptibility and transmission may eventually reduce to a steady-state endemic equilibrium with a low but stable infection rate.","output":"Modelling lockdown-induced 2nd COVID waves in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To gain insight into epilepsy care during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, we analyzed prescription data of a large cohort of persons with epilepsy (PWE) during lockdown in Germany. METHODS: Information was obtained from the Disease Analyzer database, which collects anonymous demographic and medical data from practice computer systems of general practitioners (GP) and neurologists (NL) throughout Germany. We retrospectively compared prescription data for anti-seizure medication (ASM) and physicians notes of known and new PWE from January 2020 until May 2020 with the corresponding months in the three preceding years 2017C2019. Adherence was estimated by calculating the proportion of patients with follow-up prescriptions within 90 days after initial prescriptions in January or February. We additionally analyzed hospital referrals of PWE. The significance level was set to 0.01 to adjust for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: A total of 52,844 PWE were included. Anti-seizure medication prescriptions for known PWE increased in March 2020 (GP + 36%, NL + 29%; P < 0.01). By contrast, a decrease in prescriptions to known and new PWE was observed in April and significantly in May 2020 ranging from ?16% to ?29% (P < 0.01). The proportion of PWE receiving follow-up prescriptions was slightly higher in 2020 (73.5%) than in 2017C2019 (70.7%, P = 0.001). General practitioners and NL referred fewer PWE to hospitals in March 2020 (GP: ?30%, P < 0.01; NL: ?12%), April 2020 (GP: ?29%, P < 0.01; NL: ?37%), and May 2020 (GP: ?24%, P < 0.01; NL: ?16%). CONCLUSION: Adherence of known PWE to ASM treatment appeared to remain stable during lockdown in Germany. However, this study revealed findings which point to reduced care for newly diagnosed PWE as well as fewer hospital admissions.

In retrospect, the classification of injury as a public health issue in the mid-20th century triggered complex societal responses which generated unintended consequences affecting healthful activities. Responses generally aim to reduce or minimize the risk of injury and come in different forms, including formal and informal codes of practice, standards, management systems and regulation. Well-intentioned as these interventions may have been, the new emphasis on harm shifted attention away from what causes health and resulted in increasing control over activities, including those taking place outdoors.

It targets children at risk and is a school-based child and youth health care intervention. The present study is a process evaluation of the intervention. MASS-PS was implemented and evaluated in 29 schools in the West-Brabant region of the Netherlands, during three school years (2017C2020). Attendance coordinators (ACs) from the different schools were interviewed in six focus group interviews as well as in over 200 individual conversations, of which logbooks were kept. Content analysis was used based on a framework of implementation elements. During the first year of the study, the uptake was low. Changes were made by the project group to improve the uptake. The ACs generally considered the MASS-PS as compatible and relevant, but suggested improvements by adding a medical consultation function with a child and youth healthcare physician and increasing the threshold for selecting children at risk. They saw several personal benefits, although time was necessary to learn to use the intervention. An organisational barrier was the lack of teaching staff. A strength in the organisational structure was the appointment of ACs. A major event in the sociological structure was the COVID-19 pandemic.

Non-negative matrix factorization revealed the muscle synergies utilized by each experimental group on the dominant and non-dominant limbs, and the normalized similarity index assessed group differences in overall synergy structure. Bilateral subpectoral implant patients exhibited similar shoulder strength to healthy controls on the dominant and non-dominant arms. Our results suggest that 3D shoulder torque is driven by three shoulder muscle synergies in both healthy participants and subpectoral implant patients. Two out of three synergies were more similar than is expected by chance between the groups on the non-dominant arm, whereas only one synergy is more similar than is expected by chance on the dominant arm. While bilateral shoulder strength is maintained following bilateral subpectoral implant breast reconstruction, a closer analysis of the muscle synergy patterns underlying 3D shoulder torque generation reveals that subpectoral implant patients adopt compensatory neuromuscular strategies only with the dominant arm.","output":"Neuromuscular compensation strategies adopted at the shoulder following bilateral subpectoral implant breast reconstruction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We develop two new classes of tests for the Weibull distribution based on Stein's method. The proposed tests are applied in the full sample case as well as in the framework of random right censoring. We investigate the finite sample performance of the new tests using a comprehensive Monte Carlo study. In both the absence and presence of censoring, it is found that the newly proposed classes of tests outperform competing tests against the majority of the distributions considered. In the cases where censoring is present we consider various censoring distributions. Some remarks on the asymptotic properties of the proposed tests are included. The paper presents another result of independent interest; the test initially proposed in Krit (2014) for use with full samples is amended to allow for testing for the Weibull distribution in the presence of censoring. The techniques developed in the paper are illustrated using two practical examples. In the first, we consider the survival times of patients with a certain type of leukemia. The second example is concerned with the initial remission times of leukemia patients, where the observed remission times are subject to random right censoring. We further include some concluding remarks along with avenues for future research.","output":"New classes of tests for the Weibull distribution using Stein's method in the presence of random right censoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is evidence of higher tobacco use among lesbian or gay and bisexual (LGB) populations. However, a limited number of studies have examined whether there are differences in potential indicators of future tobacco cessation behaviors between LGB and non-LGB populations. This study examined whether sexual identity is associated with craving, nicotine dependence, and quit intentions among high school students. Data were drawn from the 2020 National Youth Tobacco Survey (n = 1642). A propensity score matching (PSM) technique was used to address covariate imbalance among sexual identity groups. Additionally, subgroup analyses were performed for both males and females.

In the sex-based subgroup analyses, we found that gay or lesbian (aOR, 1.92; 95% CI = 1.10C3.34) and bisexual (aOR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.46C6.66) male students had significantly higher odds of craving when compared to heterosexual/straight male adolescents. However, the association was not significant in female students. Additionally, female bisexuals had significantly lower odds for quit intention (aOR, 0.48; 95% CI = 0.29C0.81) when compared to heterosexual/straight female adolescents. Results also showed no significant differences between LGB and non-LGB students for nicotine dependence. Sexual minority adolescents, especially male adolescents, were more likely to have tobacco cravings and bisexual females had lower odds of quit intention than heterosexual peers.

Here we discuss the hypothesis that patients who survive severe COVID-19 and who experience significant activation of the immune system, are at greater risk of developing depression. We posit that a phenomenon known as cytokine storm dramatically activates the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1), resulting in the increase in kynurenine metabolites. Kynurenine is metabolized by IDO-1 in the brain, producing chemokines, in which a prolonged exposure may result long-term brain impairment. In this article, we also propose the possibility that a SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion increases the local levels of angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 down-regulation. Thereby, angiotensin II could increase kynurenine metabolites producing pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory effects, resulting in impairment of cognitive function, enhanced oxidative stress and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor. It is our premise that patients who experience such a cytokine storm may be at increased risk of long-term mental illness, such as depression.","output":"Why Severe COVID-19 Patients Are at Greater Risk of Developing Depression: A Molecular Perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: There is an understandable concern that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may worsen during the COVID-19 pandemic, but there are little empirical data.

Typical coping strategies, endorsed by the general population and media, are represented by technology-based communication, reading, humor, and entertainment, such as watching TV or listening to music. However, not everyone disposes of the resources to cope with their own emotions using these strategies or may not perceive any real benefit.

The aim of our study was to investigate the presence and prevalence of oral manifestations in COVID-19 survivors. We profiled the oral involvement in 122 COVID-19 survivors that were hospitalized and followed up at a single-referral university hospital in Milan, Italy, between July 23, 2020 and September 7, 2020, after a median (interquartile range) time from hospital discharge of 104 (95 to 132) d. We found that oral manifestations, specifically salivary gland ectasia, were unexpectedly common, with oral manifestations being detected in 83.9% while salivary gland ectasia in 43% of COVID-19 survivors. Salivary gland ectasia reflected the hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated by the significant relationship with C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels at hospital admission, and with the use of antibiotics during acute disease. Both LDH levels and antibiotic administration survived as independent predictors of salivary gland ectasia at multivariable analysis. Temporomandibular joint abnormalities, facial pain, and masticatory muscle weakness were also common. Overall, this retrospective and prospective cohort study of COVID-19 survivors revealed that residual damage of the oral cavity persists in the vast majority of patients far beyond clinical recovery, and suggests that the oral cavity represents a preferential target for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We evaluated four categories of predictor variables: (1) demographic data; (2) comorbidities and conditions at admission; (3) laboratory exams within 24 h; and (4) the need for mechanical ventilation at any time during hospitalization. Variable selection was performed using generalized additive models (GAM) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used for score derivation. The accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Risk groups were proposed based on predicted probabilities: non-high (up to 14.9%), high (15.0 - 49.9%), and very high risk ([] 50.0%). ResultsThe median age of the model-derivation cohort was 59 (IQR 47-70) years, 54.5% were men, 34.3% required ICU admission, 20.9% evolved with AKI, 9.3% required KRT, and 15.1% died during hospitalization. The validation cohort had similar age, sex, ICU admission, AKI, required KRT distribution and in-hospital mortality. Thirty-two variables were tested and four important predictors of the need for KRT during hospitalization were identified using GAM: need for mechanical ventilation, male gender, higher creatinine at admission, and diabetes. The MMCD score had excellent discrimination in derivation (AUROC = 0.929; 95% CI 0.918-0.939) and validation (AUROC = 0.927; 95% CI 0.911-0.941) cohorts an good overall performance in both cohorts (Brier score: 0.057 and 0.056, respectively).

Out of 193 patients who were seronegative at baseline, 76 became seropositive after vaccination, corresponding to a 39.4% (95% CI, 32.8%-46.4%) seroconversion rate. Transplant patients had the highest seroconversion rate (58.3% [95% CI, 44.3%-71.2%]), followed by rheumatologic patients (44.1% [95% CI, 28.9%-60.5%]), and haemato-oncology patients (29.7% [95% CI, 22%-38.8%]; (2)=11.87; P=0.003).

Such measures could have negative effects on the mental health of the population. The aims of this study are to (1) track the impact of COVID-19 on self-reported mood, self-rated health, other health and psychosocial indicators, and health services utilization of people who have an interRAI assessment during the first year of COVID-19; (2) compare these indicators with the same indicators in people who had an interRAI assessment in the year before COVID-19; and (3) report these indicators publicly as soon as data analysis is completed every 3 months. METHODS: interRAI COVID-19 Study (iCoS) is an observational study on routinely collected national data using the interRAI Home Care and Contact Assessment, which are standardized geriatric assessment tools mandated for all people assessed for publicly funded home support services and aged residential care in New Zealand. Based on the 2018/19 figures, we estimated there are 36,000 interRAI assessments per annum. We will compare the four post-lockdown quarters (from 25th March 2020) with the respective pre-lockdown quarters. The primary outcomes are self-reported mood (feeling sad, depressed or hopeless: 0 = no, 1 = yes) and self-rated health (0 = excellent, 1 = good, 2 = fair, 3 = poor). We will also analyze sociodemographics, other secondary health and psychosocial indicators, and health services utilization. Descriptive statistics will be conducted for primary outcomes and other indicators for each of the eight quarters. We will compare the quarters using regression models adjusted for demographic characteristics using weights or additional variables. Key health and psychosocial indicators will be reported publicly as soon as data analysis is completed for each quarter in the 12-month post-lockdown period by using a data visualization tool. DISCUSSION: This rapid translation of routinely collected national interRAI data will provide a means to monitor the health and psychosocial well-being of vulnerable older New Zealanders. Insights from this study can be shared with other countries that use interRAI and prepare health and social services for similar epidemics/pandemics in the future.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on the health and psychosocial status of vulnerable older adults: study protocol for an observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several current publications have considered persons with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) as particularly vulnerable during the COVID-19 period, and to require more frequent symptom monitoring. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether OCD exacerbated during the first wave of COVID-19 in children and adolescents. Twenty-nine children and adolescents with OCD were evaluated in the midst of the first outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel (April-May 2020). Obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) were assessed using the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), by means of a functional questionnaire and by the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-child version (OCI-CV) questionnaires. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms were not found to have exacerbated during the period investigated, as evident by a lack of change in CGI- severity scores and by improvement rather than deterioration among more participants, based on the CGI improvement scores. Additionally, the children and adolescents reported better general functioning during the COVID-19 period and had relatively low scores on the OCI-CV scale. Our findings indicate that Israeli children and adolescents with OCD coped well with COVID-19 during the first two months of the pandemic and mostly did not experience exacerbation of OCS. However, due to the short duration of exposure to the pandemic at the time of the study, social isolation and lockdown might have masked OCS; thus, further longitudinal studies are needed.","output":"Obsessive compulsive symptoms severity among children and adolescents during COVID-19 first wave in Israel?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food loss and waste are associated with an unnecessary consumption of natural resources and avoidable greenhouse gas emissions. The United Nations have thus set the reduction of food loss and waste on the political agenda by means of the Sustainable Development Goal Target 12.3. The German Federal Government committed itself to this goal by implementing the National Strategy for Food Waste Reduction in 2019. However, this policy approach relies heavily on voluntary action by involved actors and neglects the possible role of power imbalances along the food supply chain. While current research on food loss and waste in industrialised countries predominantly focuses on the consumer level, this study puts emphasis on the under-researched early stages of the food supply chain from the field to retailers warehouses. Based on 22 expert interviews with producers, producer organisations and retailers, this article identifies major inter-stage drivers of food loss in the supply chains for fresh fruit and vegetables in Germany. Its main novelty is to demonstrate how market power imbalances and risk shifting between powerful and subordinate actors can reinforce the tendency of food loss on the part of producers further up the supply chain. Results indicate that prevalent institutional settings, such as contractual terms and conditions, trading practices, ordering processes, product specifications, and communication privilege retailers and encourage food loss. The mechanisms in which these imbalances manifest, go beyond the European Commissions current legislation on Unfair Trading Practices. This study suggests a research agenda that might help to formulate adjusted policy instruments for re-structuring the German fruit and vegetable markets so that less food is wasted.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the effect of foot reflexology applied before coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty on the anxiety, stress, and cortisol levels of individuals. METHODS A simple randomized trial design was used. The patients who met the inclusion criteria were divided into 4 groups including experimental and control groups of coronary angiography patients (30 patients in each group) and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (26 patients in each group) by randomization method. Data were collected with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Distress Thermometer 90 minutes before coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and the laboratory samples were taken. After these procedures, foot reflexology was applied to both feet of the patients in the experimental group for 30 minutes, and the control group received only standard care. The inventories were reapplied 30 minutes after the reflexology application and after coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. RESULTS Whereas there was no statistically significant difference (P > .05) between the coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty experimental and control groups in Anxiety Inventory and stress median scores before reflexology, a significant difference was found (P < .001) 30 minutes after reflexology application and after coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. After the reflexology, anxiety and stress scores were significantly lower in the experimental group compared with the control group (P < .001). Whereas there was a significant difference (P < .001) in the within-group cortisol values of both reflexology groups, no significant difference was found in the control groups (P > .05).

However, comprehensive studies on analgesics use in this age group from Germany are scarce. This study aims to give a comprehensive overview on the use of the most common therapeutic groups of analgesics in community-dwelling older adults from Germany. METHODS A cross-sectional study was carried out using data from a German cohort of 2038 community-dwelling adults aged 63-89 years. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were applied to assess the utilization of analgesics by age, sex, pain severity, pain duration, and locations. RESULTS One out of four study participants was suffering from high-intensity or disabling pain. Approximately half of those taking analgesics still reported to suffer from high-intensity or disabling pain. Among analgesics users, occasional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use was the most frequent pain therapy (in 43.6% of users), followed by metamizole (dipyrone) use (16.1%), regular NSAIDs use (12.9%), strong opioids use (12.7%), and weak opioids use (12.0%). In multivariate logistic regression models, higher age, higher pain severity, longer pain duration, abdominal pain, and back pain were statistically significantly associated with opioids use. Metamizole use was also statistically significantly associated with higher pain severity but inversely associated with pain duration. CONCLUSIONS A significant number of older German adults are affected by high-intensity and disabling chronic pain despite receiving analgesics.

SLE patients suffer from CVD 3.5 times more often than healthy people. Cytokine-mediated inflammation is actively involved in the development of cardiovascular pathology. OBJECTIVE Here, we analyzed serum levels of nine cytokines of steroids treated SLE patients depending on the presence of concomitant CVD. METHODS The levels of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-21, tumor necrosis factor  (TNF), B-cell activating factor (BAFF), and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) were analyzed using multiplex immunoassay. RESULTS In the total group of SLE patients (n=29), the concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10 were higher, and the APRIL level decreased compared with healthy donors (n=39, p<0.05). The same changes were observed in the group of patients without CVD (n=15): the levels of IL-6 and IL-10 increased, and the level of APRIL was lower than in healthy individuals (p<0.05). In the group of SLE patients with CVD (n=14), the concentrations of IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF increased (p<0.05). Interestingly, the levels of TNF and BAFF in SLE patients with CVD were higher than in patients without cardiovascular pathology. Thus, TNF and BAFF levels were significantly altered in SLE with concomitant CVD compared to SLE without CVD. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that cytokine profiles in SLE with concomitant CVD and SLE without CVD are different, which should be considered in further research with large samples.","output":"Serum cytokine levels of systemic lupus erythematosus patients in the presence of concomitant cardiovascular diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing, a non-pharmaceutical tactic aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19, can arise because individuals voluntarily distance from others to avoid contracting the disease. Alternatively, it can arise because of jurisdictional restrictions imposed by local authorities. We run reduced form models of social distancing as a function of county-level exogenous demographic variables and jurisdictional fixed effects for 49 states to assess the relative contributions of demographic and jurisdictional effects in explaining social distancing behavior. To allow for possible spatial aspects of a contagious disease, we also model the spillovers associated with demographic variables in surrounding counties as well as allow for disturbances that depend upon those in surrounding counties. We run our models weekly and examine the evolution of the estimated coefficients over time since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. These estimated coefficients express the revealed preferences of individuals who were able to and chose to stay at home to avoid the disease. Stay-at-home behavior measured using cell phone tracking data exhibits considerable cross-sectional variation, increasing over nine-fold from the end of January 2020 to the end of March 2020, and then decreasing by about 50% through mid-June 2020. Our estimation results show that demographic exogenous variables explain substantially more of this variation than predictions from jurisdictional fixed effects. Moreover, the explanations from demographic exogenous variables and jurisdictional fixed effects show an evolving correlation over the sample period, initially partially offsetting, and eventually reinforcing each other. Furthermore, the predicted social distance from demographic exogenous variables shows substantial spatial autoregressive dependence, indicating clustering in social distancing behavior. The increased variance of stay-at-home behavior coupled with the high level of spatial dependence can result in relatively intense hotspots and coldspots of social distance, which has implications for disease spread and mitigation.","output":"Demographic, jurisdictional, and spatial effects on social distancing in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study aimed to compare the cut scores obtained by the Extended Angoff and Contrasting Groups methods for an achievement test consisting of constructed-response items Research Methods: This study was based on survey research design In the collection of data, the study group of the research consisted of eight mathematics teachers for the Extended Angoff method, 75 eighth grade students, and a mathematics teacher for the Contrasting Groups method Data were collected through math achievement test consisting of constructed-response items, scoring rubrics, expert opinion form for Extended Angoff method and student classification form for Contrasting Groups method Findings: Cut score was determined to be 13,38 by the Extended Angoff method and 12,50 by the Contrasting Groups method It has been determined that the two standard-setting methods do not make significant difference between the master accepted student ratios It has been found that there is a high level of harmony between the methods in terms of classifying the students as qualified and unqualified Implications for Research and Practice: This study was restricted to test consisting of constructed-response items and two standard-setting methods It is suggested that future research tests should include different types of items and compare different methods In the Covid-19 pandemic process, judge panel discussions can be made online in the Extended Angoff method Online meetings can allow the creation of a heterogeneous judge group Therefore, both methods can be used in the Covid-19 process ? 2020 Ani Publishing Ltd All rights reserved","output":"A comparison of two standard-setting methods for tests consisting of constructed-response items"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Narendra Modis visit to Australia in November 2014 was the first for an Indian Prime Minister in almost three decades and promised much.

Saliva and self-administered nasal (SN) swabs can be collected safely without trained staff. We aimed to test the sensitivity of naso-oropharyngeal saliva and SN swabs compared to NP swabs in a large cohort of migrant workers in Singapore. Methods We recruited 200 male adult subjects: 45 with acute respiratory infection, 104 asymptomatic close contacts, and 51 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Each subject underwent NP swab, SN swab and saliva collection for RT-PCR testing at 1 to 3 timepoints. We additionally used a direct-from-sample amplicon-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) workflow to establish phylogeny. Results Of 200 subjects, 91 and 46 completed second and third rounds of testing, respectively. Of 337 sets of tests, there were 150 (44.5%) positive NP swabs, 127 (37.7%) positive SN swabs, and 209 (62.0%) positive saliva. Test concordance between different sample sites was good, with a kappa statistic of 0.616 for NP and SN swabs, and 0.537 for NP and saliva. In confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 subjects, the likelihood of a positive test from any sample fell beyond 14 days of symptom onset. NGS was conducted on 18 SN and saliva samples, with phylogenetic analyses demonstrating lineages for all samples tested were Clade O (GISAID nomenclature) and lineage B.6 (PANGOLIN nomenclature). Conclusion This study supports saliva as a sensitive and less intrusive sample for COVID-19 diagnosis and further delineates the role of oropharyngeal secretions in increasing the sensitivity of testing.

This study examined 2908 calls made to a national mental health helpline over a 10 month period, 2 months prior to (Pre-COVID) and 8 months during the pandemic phase, that incorporated the imposition of a partial lockdown, followed by the removal and reintroduction of restrictive measures locally. Data collected included reason/s for call assistance, gender, age and number of daily diagnosed cases and deaths due to COVID-19. In the Pre-COVID phase, calls for assistance were related to information needs and depression. With the imposition of a partial lockdown, coupled with the first local deaths and spikes in number of diagnosed cases, a significant increase in number of calls targeting mental health, medication management and physical and financial issues were identified. Following the removal of local restrictions, the number of calls decreased significantly; however, with the subsequent reintroduction of restrictions, coupled with the rise in cases and deaths, assistance requested significantly targeted informational needs. Hence, whilst calls in the initial phase of the pandemic mainly targeted mental health issues, over time this shifted towards information seeking requests, even within a context where the number of deaths and cases had significantly risen.","output":"Reaching out for Help: Calls to a Mental Health Helpline Prior to and during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Adverse local tissue reactions (ALTRs) were initially reported as complications associated with metal-on-metal (MoM) bearings; however, there is increasing concern regarding the occurrence of adverse local tissue reactions from mechanically assisted crevice corrosion (MACC) at the femoral head-neck junction or between other modular junctions of the implant containing cobalt chromium parts in patients with metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) bearings. ALTR due to MACC at the head-neck junction has primarily been reported in association with cobalt chromium alloy femoral heads. As pain following total hip arthroplasty may have various intrinsic and extrinsic causes, a systematic approach to evaluation (risk stratification algorithm) based on the currently available data is recommended to optimize patient management. Evaluation should begin by ruling out common causes of pain, including component loosening and periprosthetic joint infection. While specialized tests such as blood metal analysis and metal artifact reduction sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MARS MRI) are useful modalities in evaluating for ALTRs, over-reliance on any single investigative tool in the clinical decision-making process should be avoided. There should be a low threshold to perform a systematic evaluation for ALTR due to MACC in patients with metal-on-polyethylene total hip arthroplasty as early recognition and diagnosis is critical, as delays in appropriate treatment initiation may result in soft-tissue damage, which complicates surgical treatment and is associated with a higher risk of complications and poorer patient outcomes.","output":"Risk Stratification Algorithm for Management of Head-Neck Taper Tribocorrosion in Patients with Metal-on-Polyethylene Total Hip Arthroplasty: Consensus Statement of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, and The Hip Society"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to explore the challenges, opportunities and implications of COVID-19 pandemic in the UAE higher education context It uses the qualitative study approach and websites methodologies to enrich the aims and results of the study It focuses on the influence of COVID-19 pandemic on higher education institutions and their progressions respectively As higher education institutions not only provide knowledge but also develop interpersonal skills and help mold an individual in all aspects to face real-world challenges Institutions should, therefore, get back to traditional teaching methods as soon as possible by incorporating the benefits of virtual learning into traditional learning methods, as virtual learning cannot replace traditional methods Consequently, over some time as the crisis continues globally, the higher educational institutions worldwide can take into development better modes of communication and continue to provide various forms of delivering their services, and as the COVID-19 with progress in medical fields can fade to a disease of history we can improve what was once traditional learning with the online learning experience from this time As the COVID-19 crisis continues globally, the higher education institutions can develop better modes of communication and forms of providing their services and as the COVID 19 fades to a disease of history, so it can improve what was known as traditional learning into the online learning over the time After substantiating the multiple benefits and consequences of having virtual learning in the higher education system, it is clear that there is a lot of room for improvement over the time This study contributes to the COVID 19 concept and higher education tools as it introduces you to the various impacts of online educational tools used by higher education universities in the UAE during the spread of COVID-19 It can be considered as a pioneer study in UAE in exploration the relationship between COVID-19 and higher education field ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"From Offline to Online Learning: A Qualitative Study of Challenges and Opportunities as a Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic in the UAE Higher Education Context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In children, the infection with SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, tends to be clinically inapparent more often or less severe than in adults.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can support gas exchange in patients failing conventional mechanical ventilation, but its role is still controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on ECMO for H1N1-associated ALI. METHODS: CENTRAL, Google Scholar, MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus (updated 2 January 2012) were systematically searched. Studies reporting on 10 or more patients with H1N1 infection treated with ECMO were included. Baseline, procedural, outcome and validity data were systematically appraised and pooled, when appropriate, with random-effect methods. RESULTS: From 1,196 initial citations, 8 studies were selected, including 1,357 patients with confirmed/suspected H1N1 infection requiring intensive care unit admission, 266 (20%) of whom were treated with ECMO. Patients had a median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 9, and had received mechanical ventilation before ECMO implementation for a median of two days. ECMO was implanted before inter-hospital patient transfer in 72% of cases and in most patients (94%) the veno-venous configuration was used. ECMO was maintained for a median of 10 days. Outcomes were highly variable among the included studies, with in-hospital or short-term mortality ranging between 8% and 65%, mainly depending on baseline patient features. Random-effect pooled estimates suggested an overall in-hospital mortality of 28% (95% confidence interval 18% to 37%; I(2 )= 64%). CONCLUSIONS: ECMO is feasible and effective in patients with ALI due to H1N1 infection. Despite this, prolonged support (more than one week) is required in most cases, and subjects with severe comorbidities or multiorgan failure remain at high risk of in-hospital death.","output":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients with H1N1 influenza infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis including 8 studies and 266 patients receiving ECMO"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous research indicates that employees mental health might be influenced by their satisfaction with physical office characteristics, such as noise, daylight, and ventilation.

This article evaluated the impact of hematologic involvement of different blood cell line parameters of white blood cells including absolute neutrophil count (ANC), hemoglobin, and platelets in COVID-19 patients and their association with hospital mortality and length of stay (LOS). METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 475 patients with confirmed positive COVID-19 infection and hematologic abnormalities in the metropolitan New York City area. RESULTS: Elevated absolute neutrophil count (OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.02C1.42; p < 0.05) increased days of hematologic involvement (OR: 4.44; 95% CI: 1.42C13.90; p < 0.05), and persistence of hematologic involvement at discharge (OR: 2.87; 95% CI: 1.20C6.90; p < 0.05) was associated with higher mortality. Higher hemoglobin at admission (OR: 0.77; 95% CI:0.60C0.98; p < 0.001) and platelets peak (OR: 0.995; 95% CI: 0.992C0.997; p < 0.001) were associated with decreased mortality. Patients with higher white blood cell peak (B = 0.46; SE = 0.07; p < 0.001) and higher hemoglobin at admission (B = 0.05; SE = 0.01; p < 0.001) were associated with higher LOS.

Key questions include when, why, how, in which contexts, for which behaviours, in what combinations, compared with what, and for whom behaviour change techniques are typically effective. The aims of the present paper are to: (1) articulate the scope of the challenge in understanding the properties of behaviour change techniques, (2) propose means by which to tackle this problem, and (3) call scientists to action. METHODS Iterative consensus (O'Connor et al., 2020, Br. J. Psychol., e12468) was used to elicit and distil the judgements of experts on how best to tackle the problem of understanding the nature and operation of behaviour change techniques. RESULTS We propose a worldwide network of 'Centres for Understanding Behaviour Change' (CUBiC) simultaneously undertaking research to establish what are the single and combined properties of behaviour change techniques across multiple behaviours and populations. We additionally provide a first attempt to systematize an approach that CUBiC could use to understand behaviour change techniques and to begin to harness the efforts of researchers worldwide. CONCLUSION Better understanding of behaviour change techniques is vital for improving behaviour change interventions to tackle global problems such as obesity and recovery from COVID-19. The CUBiC proposal is just one of many possible solutions to the problems that the world faces and is a call to action for scientists to work collaboratively to gain deeper understanding of the underpinnings of behaviour change interventions.","output":"Investigating which behaviour change techniques work for whom in which contexts delivered by what means: Proposal for an international collaboratory of Centres for Understanding Behaviour Change (CUBiC)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemiological surveillance and the tracking are essential to control the COVID-19 crisis The people who have to run these tasks, the duty to collaborate with them, the guarantees that must be respected and the use of mobile phones apps are legal questions to solve, taking into account the international organizations recommendations and best comparative practices ? 2020, Iustel All rights reserved","output":"Rastreadores y radar covid: Obligaciones de colaborar y garantas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patellofemoral pain (PFP) affects one-third of adolescents and can persist into adulthood, negatively impacting health and quality of life. Foot orthoses are a recommended treatment for adults with PFP, but have not been evaluated in adolescents. The primary objective was to determine the feasibility of conducting a full-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating effects of contoured, prefabricated foot orthoses on knee pain severity and patient-perceived global change, compared to flat insoles. The secondary objective was to describe outcomes on a range of patient-reported outcome measures. METHODS: We recruited adolescents aged 12C18 years with PFP of 2 months duration into a double-blind, randomised, parallel-group feasibility trial. Participants were randomised to receive prefabricated contoured foot orthoses or flat shoe insoles, and followed for 3 months. Participants and outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation. Primary outcomes were feasibility of a full-scale RCT (number of eligible/enrolled volunteers; recruitment rate; adherence with the intervention and logbook completion; adverse effects; success of blinding; drop-out rate), and credibility and expectancy of interventions. Secondary outcomes were patient-reported measures of pain, symptoms, function, quality of life, global rating of change, patient acceptable symptom state, and use of co-interventions. RESULTS: 36 out of 279 (12.9%) volunteers (27 female, mean (SD) age 15 (2) years, body mass 60 (13) kg) were eligible and enrolled, at a recruitment rate of 1.2 participants/week. 17 participants were randomised to receive foot orthoses, and 19 to flat insoles. 15 participants returned logbooks; 7/15 (47%) adhered to the intervention. No serious adverse events were reported. 28% (10/36, 4 pandemic-related) of participants dropped out before 3 months. Blinding was successful. Both groups found the inserts to be credible. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a priori criteria for feasibility, findings suggest that a full-scale RCT comparing contoured foot orthoses to flat insoles in adolescents with PFP would not be feasible using the current protocol. Prior to conducting a full-scale RCT, feasibility issues should be addressed, with protocol modifications to facilitate participant retention, logbook completion and shoe insert wear.

AIM In this study we performed an extensive characterization of the hemostatic alterations by both global and specific assays in a cohort of 78 patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The aims were to: 1) clarify mechanisms underlying the coagulopathy, and 2) identify predictive factors of disease severity and thrombotic events (i.e. deep vein thrombosis [DVT], pulmonary embolism [PE] or arterial thromboembolism [ATE]). METHODS COVID-19 patients admitted to the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII in Bergamo, Italy, from March 23 to May 30, 2020, were enrolled prospectively, providing informed consent. As a global assay, thromboelastometry (ROTEM) was performed in whole blood by EXTEM, INTEM, and FIBTEM tests. Specific assays included plasma levels of intrinsic and extrinsic pathway coagulation factors, von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen and activity, anticoagulant proteins (i.e. protein C [PC], free-protein S [PS], and antithrombin [AT]), fibrinolytic proteins (i.e. tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA], and inhibitor [PAI-1]), and hypercoagulation biomarkers (i.e. prothrombin fragment 1+2 [F1+2], and D-dimer). In addition, biomarkers of immunoinflammation (i.e. neutrophil extracellular traps [NETs], CRP and procalcitonin) were measured. Occurrence of thrombotic events and death were monitored during follow up. RESULTS 78 patients (56M/22F), median age 62.7 years (25-87), were analyzed. According to disease severity, 45 were ICU, and 33 non-ICU patients. Sixty-three of them were on thromboprophylaxis. Global hemostasis analysis by ROTEM showed a prothrombotic profile in patients compared to controls, with a significantly shorter clot formation time (CFT), and increased maximum clot firmness (MCF), which were significantly greater in the ICU vs non-ICU patients. The occurrence of an in vivo hypercoagulable state was confirmed by increased plasma levels of F1+2 and D-dimer, with the highest values of D-dimer in the ICU subjects. Hypercoagulability, rather than factors consumption, was also shown by the findings of significantly higher plasma procoagulant factors V, VIII, IX and fibrinogen in ICU compared to non-ICU patients (p<0.001). Endothelium activation was shown by extremely elevated vWF antigen and activity levels in all patients (highest values in ICU subjects). Moreover, the concentrations of fibrinolytic proteins, t-PA, and its inhibitor PAI-1, were elevated (p<0.01) in patients compared to normal controls, without difference between ICU and non-ICU subjects. Finally, the inflammatory parameters analysis in the ICU group demonstrated significantly increased plasma levels of NETs, CRP, and procalcitonin, compared to non-ICU patients. Of note, NETs levels significantly (p<0.02) correlated with vWF, D-dimer and t-PA, while CRP and procalcitonin inversely correlated with anticoagulant PC. After a median time of 8.8 days, 19 (24%) patients experienced thrombosis (3 DVT, 8 PE, 8 ATE). Thirteen (17%) patients from total population died after a median time of 33 days of hospitalization. Baseline D-dimer and t-PA levels were significantly higher in patients developing VTE, while baseline FVIII, vWF and D-dimer levels were greater in subjects who died during follow-up. By Cox analysis, high D-dimer and younger age were significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS Our study provides for the first time an extensive overview of the hypercoagulable state induced by SARSCoV-2 infection, demonstrating alterations in all of the different hemostatic compartments analyzed. The viral infection-induced hemostatic abnormalities are exacerbated by the severity of the disease and strongly correlate with the proinflammatory status, demonstrating the link between coagulation and inflammation. This link is further supported by the clear correlation found between NETosis and markers of endothelial and blood clotting activation. Finally, these data add evidence to the role of D-dimer as a significant predictor of intra-hospital mortality.

Most participants (60.1%, n = 670) had satisfactory knowledge on the use of face masks and participants at a tertiary education level [AOR 2.6 (95% CI: 1.42-4.67; p = 0.002)] were likely to have satisfactory knowledge than participants who had not education. On attitude, most respondents (69.4%) were confident enough to correctly put on a face mask; 83.4% believed that a face mask can protect against COVID-19 and 75.9% of respondents had never shared their face mask. The majority of respondents (95.2%) agreed wearing face masks in public places was important to protect themselves against COVID-19; 60.3% reported washing their hands before wearing and after removing the face mask. Unfortunately, 51.5% reported removing the face mask if they needed to talk to someone. CONCLUSION: Despite the satisfactory knowledge, good attitude and practices, there is still much more to be done in terms of knowledge, attitude and practices among participants. Government, non-governmental organizations and civil society should improve sensitization of populations on how to behave with face masks while talking to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 among western Ugandans.","output":"Use of face masks to limit the spread of the COVID-19 among western Ugandans: Knowledge, attitude and practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using first-principles calculation based on density-functional theory, the electronic properties of monolayer black phosphorus nanoribbons (PNRs) with and without punched nanoholes (PNRPNHs) and their mechanical stability are studied systematically.

We found also that nanoholes have little influence on the structural stability of PNRs; but the applied external transverse electric field and strain can be more effective in modulating the bandgaps in the PNRPNHs.

The impact of abbreviated treatment courses on outcomes in the setting of COVID-19 is unknown. We incorporated COVID-19-associated risks in re-analysis of practice-defining randomized trials in oncology that compared different radiation therapy (RT) regimens. Methods: We extracted individual patient level data (IPLD) from published survival curves from randomized trials in rectal cancer (Dutch TME, TROG 01.04), early stage breast cancer (CALGB 9343, OCOG hypofractionation trial, FAST-Forward, NSABP B-39), and localized prostate cancer (CHHiP, HYPO-RT-PC). Trials were simulated with incorporation of varying risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality associated with receipt of therapy. Results: IPLD from 14,170 patients were re-analyzed. In scenarios with low COVID-19-associated risks (0.5% infection risk per fraction [IRF], 5% case fatality rate [CFR]), fractionation did not significantly affect outcomes. In locally advanced rectal cancer, short-course RT appeared preferable to long-course chemoradiation (TROG 01.04) or RT omission (Dutch TME) in most settings. While moderate hypofractionation in early stage breast cancer (OCOG hypofractionation trial) and prostate cancer (CHHiP) was not associated with survival benefits in the setting of COVID-19, more aggressive hypofractionation (FAST-Forward, HYPO-RT-PC) and accelerated partial breast irradiation (NSABP B-39) were associated with improved survival in higher risk scenarios (5% IRF; 20% CFR). In settings where RT can be omitted, such as favorable early stage breast cancer in the elderly (CALGB 9343), RT was associated with worse survival in higher risk pandemic scenarios (5% IRF,  20% CFR). Conclusions: Our framework, which can be adapted to dynamic changes in COVID-19 risk, provides a flexible, quantitative approach to assess the impact of treatment recommendations across oncology. The magnitude of potential benefit from abbreviated RT courses depends on the degree of hypofractionation and local COVID-19-associated risk. Abbreviated RT courses should be prioritized when possible and are increasingly beneficial in higher risk pandemic settings. With increased understanding and precautions against COVID-19 that can minimize risks for patients, our results support the continued use of evidence-based treatments for cancer patients in the COVID-19 era.","output":"Re-analyzing randomized trials with incorporation of COVID-19 risk associated with cancer therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2019, in the city of Wuhan, China, patients were diagnosed with a novel coronavirus originally named 2019-nCoV, currently known as SARS-CoV-2 The alarming expansion of this pandemic makes it necessary to find out and implement reliable diagnostic methods in order to properly detect and treat patients, thus contributing to slowing down the spread of the disease It is extremely important to have trained professionals in sample collection, good clinical laboratory practices, and molecular and hematological techniques to adequately detect any cases of infection with this virus Moreover, standardized protocols are essential for obtaining, transferring and storing samples to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2","output":"Diagnostic tests for COVID-19: The importance of the before and the after"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To understand the clinical characteristics, change of liver function, influencing factors and prognosis in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) combined with liver injury. Methods: The general conditions, biochemical indicators of liver, blood clotting mechanism, routine blood test, UGT1A1 * 28 gene polymorphism and other data of 40 cases with COVID-19 admitted to the isolation ward of Tangdu Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical characteristics, influencing factors and prognosis of liver injury in patients with liver injury group and those with normal liver function group were compared. The mean of two samples in univariate analysis was compared by t-test and analysis of variance. The counting data was measured by (2) tests. The non-normal distribution measurement data were described by the median, and the non-parametric test was used. Statistically significant influencing factors were used as the independent variables in univariate analysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the main influencing factors of liver injury. Results: Of the 40 cases, 25 were male (62.5%) and 15 were female (37.5%), aged 22 to 83 (53.87  15.84) years. Liver injury was occurred in 22 cases (55%) during the course of the disease. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was initially increased (4.4 to 3.5 times of the normal value) along with decrease of albumin in the second week, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Ten cases (43.5%) had highest abnormal total blood bilirubin (54.1 mol/ L). There was no correlation between the increase in transaminase and the increase in total blood bilirubin (R = -0.006, P = 0.972). Three cases had prothrombin activity (PTA) of  50%, 10 cases had elevated FDP, and 13 cases had elevated D-dimer, all of whom were severe or critically ill. Liver function injury was more likely to occur in patients who used many types of drugs and large amounts of hormones (P = 0.002, P = 0.031), and there was no correlation with the TA6TA7 mutation in the UGT1A1 * 28 gene locus. Multiple regression analysis showed that the occurrence of liver injury was only related to critical illness. The liver function of all patients had recovered within one week after conventional liver protection treatment. Conclusion: COVID-19 combined with liver function injury may be due to the slight elevation of transaminase, mostly around the second week of the disease course. Severe patients have a higher proportion of liver injury, and critical type is an independent risk factor for liver injury.","output":"[Clinical characteristics and influencing factors of patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia combined with liver injury in Shaanxi region]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 19 April 2020: notifications = 6,606; deaths = 69.

Bacterial superinfections seem to be associated with higher mortality in COVID-19 patients in intensive care units (ICUs). However, details on the prevalence and species distribution of secondary infections are limited. Moreover, the increasing use of dexamethasone may pose an additional risk of superinfections. METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective study of the clinical and microbiological characteristics of 154 COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU between March 2020 and January 2021, focusing on bacterial infections, use of antimicrobial agents and dexamethasone therapy. RESULTS: The median age was 68 years; 67.5% of the patients were men. Critically ill COVID-19 patients were treated with dexamethasone since July 2020 (second wave), which was not common during the first wave of the pandemic. In the dexamethasone group (n=90, 58.4%), respiratory pathogens were detected more frequently, as were multidrugresistant pathogens. The number of patients with polymicrobial detection of respiratory pathogens was significantly increased (p=0.013). The most frequently detected species were Enterobacterales, Staphylococcus aureus, and Aspergillus fumigatus. The rates of bloodstream infections did not differ between the groups. The use of dexamethasone in ICU COVID-19 patients was associated with higher rates of respiratory infectious complications. CONCLUSIONS: Secondary infections are present in a substantial fraction of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Respiratory pathogens were detectable in the majority of COVID-19 ICU patients. The use of dexamethasone poses a potential risk of secondary pulmonary infections.

The main methods used are bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review. Evaluating the number of assets which lead to optimal diversification is not an easy task as it is impacted by a huge number of different factors: the way systematic risk is measured, the investment universe (size, asset classes and features of the asset classes), the investors characteristics, the change over time of the asset features, the model adopted to measure diversification (i.e., equally weighted versus optimal allocation), the frequency of the data that is being used, together with the time horizon, conditions in the market that the study refers to, etc. Our paper provides additional support for the fact that (1) a generalized optimal number of stocks that constitute a well-diversified portfolio does not exist for whichever market, period or investor. Recent studies further suggest that (2) the size of a well-diversified portfolio is larger today than in the past, (3) this number is lower in emerging markets compared to developed financial markets, (4) the higher the stock correlations with the market, the lower the number of stocks required for a well-diversified portfolio for individual investors, and (5) machine learning methods could potentially improve the investment decision process.

This study focused on the analysis of the hydraulic system integrity of the complete subsoilCgroutCpipe system as well as possible thermally induced changes. For this purpose, a pilot-scale experiment was built to test a 1-m section of a typical BHE under in situ pressure, hydraulic and temperature conditions. During the tests the hydraulic system permeability of the soil and the BHE was measured continuously and separately from each other.

Hsa_circ_0077837 was inversely correlated with PTEN across cancer tissues. In NSCLC cells, hsa_circ_0077837 overexpression decreased PTEN expression, increased PTEN gene methylation, and reduced HCC827 cell apoptosis via PTEN. Overall, hsa_circ_0077837 is upregulated in NSCLC and downregulates PTEN by increasing its gene methylation to suppress cell apoptosis.List of abbreviations:Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); circRNAs (circular RNAs); methylation-specific PCR (MSP).","output":"Circular RNA hsa_circ_0077837 is upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer to downregulate phosphatase and tensin homolog through methylation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has exposed health care disparities in minority groups including Hispanics/Latinxs (HL).

The concept of aging at work comes from the urgent requirement to help the aging workforce of the contemporary industries to maintain productivity while achieving a work and private life balance. While there is plenty of research focusing on the aging population, current research activities on policies covering the concept of aging at work are limited and conceptually different. This paper aims to review publications on aging at work, which could lead to the creation of a framework that targets governmental decision-makers, the non-governmental sector, the private sector, and all of those who are responsible for the formulation of policies on aging at work.

Weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random or fixed-effects models. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies comprising 3962 patients with COVID-19 were included in our analysis. Random-effect results demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 in the nonsevere group had lower levels for CRP (WMD = -41.78 mg/l, 95% CI = [-52.43, -31.13], P < 0.001), PCT (WMD = -0.13 ng/ml, 95% CI = [-0.20, -0.05], P < 0.001), IL-6 (WMD = -21.32 ng/l, 95% CI = [-28.34, -14.31], P < 0.001), ESR (WMD = -8 mm/h, 95% CI = [-14, -2], P = 0.005), SAA (WMD = -43.35 g/ml, 95% CI = [-80.85, -5.85], P = 0.020) and serum ferritin (WMD = -398.80 mg/l, 95% CI = [-625.89, -171.71], P < 0.001), compared with those in the severe group.

To ensure that schools and preschools are kept open safely, the identification of factors influencing the extent of outbreaks is of importance. Aim: To monitor dynamics of COVID-19 infections in schools and preschools and identify factors influencing the extent of outbreaks. Methods: In this prospective observational study we analyzed routine surveillance data of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany, from calendar week (CW) 32, 2020 to CW19, 2021 regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection events in schools and preschools considering changes in infection control measures over time. A multivariate linear regression model was fitted to evaluate factors influencing the number of students, teachers and staff tested positive following index cases in schools and preschools. Due to an existing multicollinearity in the common multivariate regression model between the variables face mask obligation for children and face mask obligation for adults, two further separate regression models were set up (Multivariate Model Adults and Multivariate Model Children). Results: We observed a significant increase in secondary cases in preschools in the first quarter of 2021 (CW8 to CW15, 2021), and simultaneously a decrease in secondary cases in schools. In multivariate regression analysis, the strongest predictor of the extent of the outbreaks was the teacher/ caregiver mask obligation (B = ?1.9; 95% CI: ?2.9 to ?1.0; p < 0.001). Furthermore, adult index cases (adult only or child+adult combinations) increased the likelihood of secondary cases (B = 1.3; 95% CI: 0.9 to 1.8; p < 0.001). The face mask obligation for children also showed a significant reduction in the number of secondary cases (B = ?0.6; 95% CI: ?0.9 to ?0.2; p = 0.004. Conclusion: The present study indicates that outbreak events at schools and preschools are effectively contained by an obligation for adults and children to wear face masks.","output":"Impact of Changes in Infection Control Measures on the Dynamics of COVID-19 Infections in Schools and Pre-schools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Swabs for SARS-CoV-2 are routinely collected by health care workers, putting them at risk of infection and requiring use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Self-collected swabs offer many advantages provided detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses is not compromised. METHODS In a prospective study, patients attending dedicated COVID-19 collection clinics were offered the option to first self-collect (SC) nasal and throat swabs prior to health worker collection (HC). Two different laboratory services participated, with HC at Site 1 collecting nasal and throat swabs and at Site 2 nasopharyngeal (NP) and throat swabs. Samples were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 as well as common respiratory viruses. Concordance of results between methods was assessed using Cohens kappa (). RESULTS Of 236 patients sampled by HC and SC, 25 had COVID-19 (24 by HC and 25 by SC) and 63 had other respiratory viruses (56 by HC and 58 by SC). SC was highly concordant with HC ( = 0.890) for all viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and more concordant than HC to positive results by any method ( = 0.959 vs 0.933). CONCLUSIONS Self-collection of throat and nasal swabs offers a reliable alternative to health worker collection for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses. High viral load of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the respiratory tract and sensitive molecular methods may explain these findings.

It is worth noting that many of the affected COVID-19 patients have malignant tumors. In addition, cancer has been identified as a personal risk factor for COVID-19. Transmembrane proteaseserine-2 (TMPRSS2) is a crucial host protease that mediates S protein activation and initially promotes virus entry into host cells. Moreover, it is abnormally expressed in a variety of tumors. However, the systematic analysis of TMPRSS2 aberrations in human cancer remains to be elucidated. Here, we analyzed the genetic changes, RNA expression, and DNA methylation of TMPRSS2 in more than 30 tumors. It has been reported that TMPRSS2 is overexpressed in tumors such as prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), and in contrast, the expression of TMPRSS2 is decreased in tumors such as head and neck cancer (HNSC). In addition, TMPRSS2 low DNA methylation was also found in most of these TMPRSS2 high-expressing tumors in this study. Clinical studies have found that there is a significant correlation between the expression of TMPRSS2 and the prognosis of some tumor patients. The expression of TMPRSS2 is also related to the infiltration of cancer-related fibroblasts, and the potential pathways and functional mechanisms were analyzed through KEGG/GO enrichment. In the end, our study planned the genetic and epigenetic variation of TMPRSS2 in human malignant tumors for the first time and provided a relatively comprehensive understanding of the carcinogenic effects of TMPRSS2.","output":"A Pan-Cancer In Silico Analysis of the COVID-19 Internalization Protease: Transmembrane Proteaseserine-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The detection of viruses using imaging techniques is challenging because of the weak scattering of light generated by the targets of sizes in the nanometer range.

For the management of severe ARDS ventilator settings, positioning therapy, infection control, and supportive measures are essential to improve survival. METHODS AND RESULTS: A precise definition of life-threating hypoxemia is not identified. Typical clinical determinations are: arterial partial pressure of oxygen < 60 mmHg and/or arterial oxygenation < 88 % and/or the ratio of PaO(2)/FIO(2) < 100. For mechanical ventilation specific settings are recommended: limitation of tidal volume (6 ml/kg predicted body weight), adequate high PEEP (>12 cmH(2)O), a recruitment manoeuvre in special situations, and a balanced respiratory rate (20-30/min). Individual bedside methods to guide PEEP/recruitment (e.g., transpulmonary pressure) are not (yet) available. Prone positioning [early ( 48 hrs after onset of severe ARDS) and prolonged (repetition of 16-hr-sessions)] improves survival. An advanced infection management/control includes early diagnosis of bacterial, atypical, viral and fungal specimen (blood culture, bronchoalveolar lavage), and of infection sources by CT scan, followed by administration of broad-spectrum anti-infectives. Neuromuscular blockage (Cisatracurium  48 hrs after onset of ARDS), as well as an adequate sedation strategy (score guided) is an important supportive therapy.

The risk genotype impaired the expression of PFKFB3 by human macrophages in response to fungal infection, which was correlated with a defective activation of glycolysis and the ensuing antifungal effector functions. In patients with IPA, the risk genotype was associated with lower concentrations of cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples.

This article examines an unlikely victim of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global regime for the governance of international trade, and does so from an African perspective. Following the proliferation of national measures restricting the export of COVID-19-essential personal protective equipment and other medical products at a time when trade literally can mean saving lives, this article asks whether import-dependent countries such as most states in Africa can rely on the multilateral trading system to secure access to these life-saving equipment and supplies. Answering this question in the negative, the article argues that those African countries that lack domestic manufacturing capacitywhich make up the majority on the Continentneed to rethink their commodity-export-dependent development strategy and refocus on industrialisation backed up with adequate research and development capacity. Finally, the article also suggests that States Parties to the AfCFTA Agreement should use this period as a window of opportunity to revisit the text of the Agreement so a revised AfCFTA has a better chance of coping with the next pandemic or emergency.","output":"Rules-Based International Cooperation During a Global Pandemic: The COVID-19 Crisis and Trade Law Lessons for Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Most patients with COVID-19 do not require hospitalization but may need close monitoring, which can strain primary care practices. Our objective was to describe the implementation of a mobile web application to monitor COVID-19 signs and symptoms among nonhospitalized primary care patients and to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the application. Study Design: Retrospective analysis of (1) mobile web application data from March through December 2020 and (2) cross-sectional surveys administered in June 2020. Materials and Methods: We enrolled nonhospitalized patients and staff from nine New England primary care practices across 29 sites. Outcomes included feasibility and acceptability of the application as measured by the proportion of texts that resulted in a response, proportion of patients who agreed using the application was easy, and proportion of practice staff who agreed the application reduced outreach burden and that they would recommend use. Results: Five thousand five hundred thirty-two patients used the mobile web application, with 26,466 total responses. Overall, 78% of the daily texts resulted in a response from patients. Most patients agreed that responding to texts was easy (95%) and that they would be willing to participate in other texting programs (78%). Most staff agreed that the program reduced burden of outreach (94%) and that they would recommend use to other practices (100%). Conclusions: Use of a COVID-19 symptom tracking application was feasible and acceptable to patients and primary care practice staff.

Design: We used a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model to create multiple simulations of possible epidemic trajectories that could eventuate over a five-week period following prolonged low levels of community transmission. Setting: We calibrated the model to the epidemiological and policy environment in New South Wales, Australia, at the end of August 2020. Participants: None Intervention: From September 1, 2020, we ran the stochastic model with the same initial conditions (i.e., those prevailing at August 31, 2020), and analyzed the outputs of the model to determine the probability of exceeding a given number of new diagnoses and active cases within five weeks, under three assumptions about future mask usage: a baseline scenario of 30% uptake, a scenario assuming no mask usage, and a scenario assuming mandatory mask usage with near-universal uptake (95%). Main outcome measure: Probability of exceeding a given number of new diagnoses and active cases within five weeks. Results: The policy environment at the end of August is sufficient to slow the rate of epidemic growth, but may not stop the epidemic from growing: we estimate a 20% chance that NSW will be diagnosing at least 50 new cases per day within five weeks from the date of this analysis. Mandatory mask usage would reduce this to 6-9%.

We hoped to find if patient compliance could be maintained and to determine the anatomical and functional consequences of consistent mask wear. While this study was ongoing, COVID-19 impacted on normal eye clinic practice, allowing an unexpected analysis of the effects of this disruption to the clinical system on mask wear and disease progress. Throughout the whole study, outcomes were positive, with a high level of consistent patient use of the mask, above 74% up to and beyond 1 year. Even during the COVID-19 1st lockdown in England, the patients maintained a 65% nightly light mask compliance. Statistically significant improvements in maculopathy, including cyst reduction (56.4% of eyes with cysts exhibited cyst shrinkage), and visual acuity (VA) improvement (42/48 eyes gained 5 letters or more) were observed and maintained to the end of the study. Anatomical improvement or stability was recorded in all but one study eye. This investigation shows that given that there is appropriate interaction with patients who are self-treating in home environment, a high level of patient compliance can be maintained, even while there are disruptions to the normal hospital clinic setup.

METHODS: This study comprised 580 women aged between 18 and 65 years old, who completed self-report measures, during the mandatory confinement in Portugal due to COVID-19. The total sample was divided into four groups, according to their BMI. RESULTS: Results revealed that overall, there were no significant differences between the groups regarding the eating and exercise routine changes introduced during quarantine. However, significant differences between the four groups were found in the reported body and eating-related difficulties (shape concern, weight concern, and binge eating behaviours), with the pre-obesity and obesity groups presenting significant higher levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that, even though the changes introduced to the eating and exercise routine are independent of BMI, the pre-obesity and obesity group represent a major vulnerability group for the development of eating disorders. We hope this study allows professionals to understand the need to develop different guidelines and strategies for the pre-obesity and obesity female population during the deconfinement period.

A series of RM26 analogs N-terminally conjugated with NOTA, NODAGA, DOTA and DOTAGA via a PEG2 spacer were radiolabeled with 111In and evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The conjugates were successfully labeled with 111In with 100% purity and retained binding specificity to GRPR and high stability. The cellular processing of all compounds was characterized by slow internalization. The IC50 values were in the low nanomolar range, with lower IC50 values for positively charged natIn-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 (2.6  0.1 nM) and higher values for negatively charged natIn-DOTAGA-PEG2-RM26 (4.8  0.5 nM). The kinetic binding studies showed KD values in the picomolar range that followed the same pattern as the IC50 data. The biodistribution of all compounds was studied in BALB/c nu/nu mice bearing PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts. Tumor targeting and biodistribution studies displayed rapid clearance of radioactivity from the blood and normal organs via kidney excretion. All conjugates showed similar uptake in tumors at 4 h p.i. The radioactivity accumulation in GRPR-expressing organs was significantly lower for DOTA- and DOTAGA-containing constructs compared to those containing NOTA and NODAGA. 111In-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 with a positively charged complex showed the highest initial uptake and the slowest clearance of radioactivity from the liver. At 4 h p.i., DOTA- and DOTAGA-coupled analogs showed significantly higher tumor-to-organ ratios compared to NOTA- and NODAGA-containing variants.

These comparisons were evaluated by Bland-Altman Plot, repeatability, Passing-Bablok regression and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was done to describe the discrimination accuracy of a diagnostic test. The study adhered to STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies. RESULTS: A Bland-Altman plot indicated that the limits of agreement between the forehead and tympanic temperature were -0.259 to +0.19C. Passing-Bablok regression analysis illustrated that the infrared forehead was not linearly related to tympanic temperatures (reference method), with a slope estimate that was significantly different from 1.00. The infrared forehead thermometer showed poor precision and lower accuracy than the tympanic.

Primary research papers, published from 1 January to 30 June 2020, reporting patients' data, with no limits of study design were included. Studies were categorized for study design, research question, COVID-19 phase, limitations of functioning (disability) of rehabilitation interest and type of rehabilitation service involved. Methodological quality assessment was based on the Cochrane Risk of Bias tools, and the level of evidence table (OCEBM 2011) for all the other studies.

First COVID-19 case was identified in December, 2019 and within three months, more than one million affected cases and over 65,000 deaths have been reported. SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also known as 2019-nCoV is a causative agent of COVID-19 disease and belongs to the SARS CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome corona virus) family. The SARS-CoV-2 enters the human body by binding its viral surface spike protein with the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and cause infection. To prevent the virus entry and its transmission in the human body, we focused on the two domains of ACE2: i) the N-terminal extracellular binding domain (18-740 residues) reported for coronavirus spike interaction, and ii) the C-terminal cytoplasmic region (762-805 residues) to prevent the virus transmission. Therefore, we proposed: i) inhibition of receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and human ACE2 protein may prevent the virus entry to the host and ii) inhibition of phosphorylation at Ser-787 of ACE2 protein may prevent the transmission of the virus in the COVID-19 patients. In the past, the critical role of Ser 787 in human ACE2 protein has been experimentally verified in SARS-CoV transmission, that upon binding to the receptor, SARS- CoV induces CKII- mediated phosphorylation of ACE2 at Ser-787 that in-turn facilitate virus entry to host cells, followed by replication and activation of ACE2, initiates downstream signaling leading to lung fibrosis. Therefore, in this study, we have suggested post-translational modification (PTM) O--GlcNAcylation, and two compounds Chloroquine and 2-hydroxybenzohydrazine might share the common pathways to prevent the COVID-19 infection in human. The addition of O--GlcNAcylation at same or neighboring Ser/ Thr residues results in phosphorylation inhibition and a change in protein structural and functional confirmations. Thereby, using neural networking methods, we have identified Ser/ Thr residues in ACE2 that are potential sites for phosphorylation and / or O--GlcNAcylation. Molecular docking showed that UDP-GlcNAc has more binding affinity with Ser-787 than the phosphoryl group. Moreover, chloroquine and 2-hydroxybenzohydrazine also showed great potential to bind at Ser-787 that may result in inhibition of Ser-787 phosphorylation and downstream signaling. Furthermore, O--GlcNAcylation, chloroquine and 2-hydroxybenzohydrazine showed their high affinity at ACE2-SARS-CoV-2receptor binding domain that may prevent the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human body. In conclusion, inhibition of human ACE2 phosphorylation at Ser-787 and ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 binding domain could be promising targets against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"O--GlcNAcylation, Chloroquine and 2-Hydroxybenzohydrazine May Hamper SARS-CoV-2 entry to Human via Inhibition of ACE2 Phosphorylation at Ser787 but Also Induce Disruption of Virus-ACE2 Binding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To examine the associations of maternal virus infection in early pregnancy with risk of offspring congenital heart disease (CHD) and its seven common subtypes including atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, Tetralogy of Tallot, pulmonary stenosis, and transposition of the great arteries. Patients and Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in Central China. A total of 44,048 pregnant women with singleton pregnancies at 8-14 gestational weeks were finally included and followed to 3 months postpartum. Serum was tested for virus infection including hepatitis B virus (HBV), coxsackievirus-B, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and rubella virus. Multivariable modified Poisson regression models were used to estimate the relative risks (RRs) of all CHDs as well as seven common subtypes of CHD in offspring of pregnant women with different types of virus infection in early pregnancy, adjusting for confounders identified by directed acyclic graphs. Results: At the end of follow-up, 564 births were diagnosed with CHD. Multivariable analyses showed that the presence of maternal viral infection in early pregnancy was independently associated with increased risks of CHD in offspring, with an adjusted relative risk of 2.21 (95% CI: 1.66-2.95) for HBV infection, 2.21 (95% CI: 1.63-3.00) for coxsackievirus-B infection, 3.12 (95% CI: 2.44-3.98) for HCMV infection, and 2.62 (95% CI: 1.95-3.51) for rubella virus infection. More specifically, the offspring of pregnant women with HCMV infection had the highest increased risk of patent ductus arteriosus (RR=10.50, 95% CI: 6.24-17.66). These findings persisted in analyses that were further adjusted for the other virus of interest in this study.

In China, the SMV strains SC and N are used simultaneously in SMV resistance assessments of soybean cultivars, but the pathogenic relationship between them is unclear. In this study, SMV strains N1 and N3 were found to be the most closely related to SC18. Moreover, N3 was found to be more virulent than N1. A global pathotype classification revealed the highest level of genetic diversity in China. The N3 type was the most frequent and widespread worldwide, implying that SMV possibly originated in China and spread across continents through the dissemination of infected soybean. It also suggests that the enhanced virulence of N3 facilitated its spread and adaptability in diverse geographical and ecological regions worldwide. Phylogenetic analysis revealed prominent geographical associations among SMV strains/isolates, and genomic nucleotide diversity analysis and neutrality tests demonstrated that the whole SMV genome is under negative selection, with the P1 gene being under the greatest selection pressure. The results of this study will facilitate the nationwide use of SMV-resistant soybean germplasm and could provide useful insights into the molecular variability, geographical distribution, phylogenetic relationships, and evolutionary history of SMV around the world.

To date, there is no pharmaceutical intervention to delay or treat cognitive decline or dementia. As an estimated one-third of dementia cases might be attributable to modifiable lifestyle factors (such as cognitive and physical activity), multidomain lifestyle interventions are a promising way to maintain or improve brain health. Offering programs online would enable large-scale implementation. An overview of multidomain Web-based lifestyle programs for brain health would facilitate comparison and improvement of such programs to develop effective and sustainable interventions. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to (1) provide a comprehensive overview of Web-based multidomain lifestyle programs aimed at optimizing brain health in healthy adult populations and (2) describe the programs and targeted lifestyle factors, availability, and evaluation of adherence and user experience. In addition, a meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of these programs. METHODS Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) were searched for Web-based lifestyle programs that were included when the program (1) aimed to optimize brain health, (2) focused on multiple lifestyle factors, (3) was completely Web-based (website, Web application or mobile app), (4) consisted of multiple sessions, and (5) focused on a healthy adult population. Program characteristics (target population, duration, frequency, tailoring, platform, and availability) and results of program evaluations (effectiveness, user evaluations, and adherence) were extracted and compared. Studies using a controlled design were included in a random-effects meta-analysis on the effectiveness on brain health outcomes. Study quality was assessed using the physiotherapy evidence database (PEDro) scale. RESULTS The electronic searches yielded 44 documents describing 14 Web-based lifestyle programs; physical and cognitive activities were targeted in all programs. Four programs (4/14, 29%) were publicly available and free of charge, whereas others were restricted to research settings (5/14, 36%), available after payment (1/14, 7%), or not available at all (2/14, 14%). User evaluations were reported for 8 (57%) of the 14 programs. Reported dropout of the intervention groups ranged from 2% to 52%. Overall, 3 studies evaluated the effectiveness of a program using a controlled design and were included in the meta-analysis (moderate-to-high quality). Pooled results showed a significant small-to-medium effect of the Web-based multidomain lifestyle interventions on outcome measures for brain health (global cognition score, subjective cognitive score, and lifestyle risk score; standard mean difference=0.45; 95% CI 0.12-0.78), with a high degree heterogeneity across studies (I2=75%; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS In total, 14 Web-based multidomain lifestyle programs aimed at optimizing brain health were found. The programs showed heterogeneity in both characteristics and effectiveness evaluation. Despite this heterogeneity, this meta-analysis suggests that Web-based lifestyle programs can positively influence brain health outcomes and have the potential to contribute to the prevention of dementia.","output":"Web-Based Multidomain Lifestyle Programs for Brain Health: Comprehensive Overview and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) has developed into a global pandemic It is essential to investigate the clinical characteristics","output":"Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Is a High Risk of Mortality in Critical COVID-19 Patients Receiving Heparin-Involved Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Mouse Genome Database (MGD; http://www.informatics.jax.org) is the community model organism knowledgebase for the laboratory mouse, a widely used animal model for comparative studies of the genetic and genomic basis for human health and disease.

This condition, since defined as the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), is assumed to be a delayed immune response to COVID-19, and there are frequently cardiac manifestations of ventricular dysfunction and/or coronary artery dilation. Methods: We surveyed the inpatient MIS-C management approaches of the members of the International Kawasaki Disease Registry across 38 institutions and 11 countries. Results: Among the respondents, 56% reported using immunomodulatory treatment for all MIS-C patients, regardless of presentation. Every respondent reported use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), including 53% administering IVIG in all patients. Steroids were most often used for patients with severe clinical presentation or lack of response to IVIG, and only a minority used steroids in all patients (14%). ASA was frequently used among respondents (91%), including anti-inflammatory and/or anti-platelet dosing. Respondents reported use of prophylactic anticoagulation, especially in patients at higher risk for venous thromboembolism, and therapeutic anticoagulation, particularly for patients with giant coronary artery aneurysms. Conclusions: There is variation in management of MIS-C patients with suboptimal evidence to assess superiority of the various treatments; evidence-based gaps in knowledge should be addressed through worldwide collaboration to optimize treatment strategies.","output":"Management of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated with COVID-19: A Survey from the International Kawasaki Disease Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Septoplasty is one of the most frequently performed operations in patients with septal deviation of the nose. The aim of this surgical intervention is to reduce nasal obstruction and to achieve a physiological nasal breathing. The nasal cycle plays a crucial role in this. The aim of this study was to investigate nasal breathing and the nasal cycle after septoplasty over a long period of time and under everyday conditions. METHODS: We examined 22 healthy subjects and 19 patients with nasal septal deviation. They participated in two sessions separated by an interval of three months. Shortly after the first session patients received nasal septoplasty. Testing included multiple questionnaires regarding nasal breathing and olfactory function, anterior rhinoscopy, rhinomanometry, acoustic rhinometry, and long-term rhinoflowmetry over 24 h. RESULTS: Nasal septoplasty was associated with subjectively improved nasal breathing and nasal patency comparable to that in healthy subjects. The severity of nasal obstruction was reduced. Nasal airflow and the hydraulic diameter increased on the deviated side of the nose while the inspiratory resistance did not significantly change. In addition, the number of phases of the nasal cycle decreased on the nondeviated side. Hence, the surgery was associated with a more even distribution of phases on both sides of the nose. CONCLUSION: Nasal septoplasty leads to a subjectively satisfactory result in patients with pathological septal deviation of the nose. In particular, septoplasty appears to be accompanied by a more even distribution of the nasal cycle across the two nasal cavities.","output":"The nasal cycle before and after nasal septoplasty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on the reported data from February 16, 2020 to March 9, 2020 in South Korea including confirmed cases, death cases and recovery cases, the control reproduction number was estimated respectively at different control measure phases using Markov chain Monte Carlo method and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CrI).

Nutrition is a key factor related to this disease, and nutritional status may determine the risk and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Selenium is one of the major trace elements required for redox functions and has significant roles in viral infections. The purpose of this review was to examine the current evidence on the role of selenium in COVID-19. We reviewed studies on selenium and COVID-19, and other relevant studies to understand how selenium status can modify the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how selenium status might affect a person post-infection. RECENT FINDINGS: We found that oxidative stress is a characteristic feature of COVID-19 disease, which is linked with the immunopathological disorder observed in individuals with severe COVID-19. Selenium plays a key role in strengthening immunity, reducing oxidative stress, preventing viral infections and supporting critical illness. Moreover, selenium deficiency is related to oxidative stress and hyperinflammation seen in critical illness, and selenium deficiency is found to be associated with the severity of COVID-19 disease. Selenium supplementation at an appropriate dose may act as supportive therapy in COVID-19. Future studies in large cohorts of COVID-19 are warranted to verify the benefits of selenium supplementation for reducing risk and severity of COVID-19.","output":"A Mechanistic Link Between Selenium and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although severe mobility restrictions are recognized as the key enabler to contain COVID-19, there has been few scientific studies to validate such approach, especially in urban context.

Organic solvents such as alcohols and acetone remove lipids and dehydrate the cells, precipitating the proteins on the cellular architecture. Cross-linking reagents such as paraformaldehyde form intermolecular bridges, normally through free amino groups, thus creating a network of linked antigens. Choosing between fixation in organic solvents or cross-linking agents is empirical. There are no general rules to decide between the two and both procedures are described here. Both methods may denature protein antigens, and for this reason, antibodies prepared against denatured proteins may be more useful for cell staining. In some instances, anti-denatured-protein antibodies are the only ones that can work. Fixation in protein cross-linking reagents such as paraformaldehyde or glutaraldehyde preserves cell structure better than organic solvents but may reduce the antigenicity of some cell components. Simple fixation with paraformaldehyde or glutaraldehyde does not allow the antibody to access the specimen and therefore is followed by a permeabilization step using an organic solvent or nonionic detergent. Using the organic solvent is easy, but it can destroy certain elements of the cell architecture, although prior fixation with paraformaldehyde does help to preserve the cellular structure.

Research Question For COVID-19 patients requiring emergency endotracheal intubation, how do the procedural techniques, the incidence of first pass success and the complications associated with the procedure compare with intubations on critically ill patients prior to the COVID-19 pandemic? Study Design and Methods We conducted a retrospective study of adult COVID-19 patients at Montefiore Medical Center who underwent first-time endotracheal intubation by critical care physicians between July 19, 2019 and May 1, 2020. The first COVID-19 patient was admitted to our institution on March 11, 2020, before which patients were designated as the pre-pandemic cohort. Descriptive statistics was used to compare groups. A Fischers exact test was used to compare categorical variables. A two-tailed Students t-test for parametric variables or a Wilcoxon rank sum test for nonparametric variables were utilized for continuous variables. Results 1,260 intubations met inclusion criteria (782 pre-pandemic, 478 pandemic). Patients during the pandemic were more likely to be intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure (72.6% vs 28.1%; P<0.01). During the pandemic, operators were more likely to use video laryngoscopy (89.4% vs 53.3%, P<0.01) and neuromuscular blocking agents (86.0% vs 46.2%; P<0.01).

We analyzed in this study the impact of Tregs on the development of acute viral encephalomyelitis, T cell-mediated antiviral protection, and prevention of CNS autoimmunity following intranasal infection with the gliatropic mouse hepatitis virus strain A59. To assess the contribution of Tregs in vivo, we specifically depleted CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T cells in a diphtheria toxin-dependent manner. We found that depletion of Tregs had no impact on viral distribution and clearance and did not significantly alter virus-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses. However, Treg depletion led to a more severe CNS inflammation associated with neuronal damage. Dissection of the underlying immunopathological mechanisms revealed the elaborate Treg-dependent regulation of self-reactive CD4(+) T cell proliferation within the CNS-draining lymph node and downtuning of CXCR3 expression on T cells. Taken together, these results suggest that Tregs preserve CNS immune privilege through selective control of CNS-specific Th cells while keeping protective antiviral immunity fully operative.","output":"Regulatory T cells selectively preserve immune privilege of self-antigens during viral central nervous system infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Indonesian government's measures to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can be characterized by late response due to initial de-securitization of the issue, and later securitization that limits its very efficacy in restricting the spread of the pandemic This article uses securitization theory to analyze the government's measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic and discusses how the government's increasing reliance on military figures and national security agencies influences the measures used to control the COVID-19 pandemic This study finds that initially, the government seemed to be trying to de-securitize the issue, denying warnings that the virus might have existed undetected in Indonesia Then, after the first cases were confirmed in March 2020, the government responded by securitizing the issue The delay in the government's response to COVID-19 caused the audience to not fully accept the government's securitization efforts because public trust in the government's measures was already low, while the means of emergency action taken by the government against the threat of COVID-19 are also limited The government has also been overly reliant on influential military figures and national security agencies The government also tended to downgrade the threats, lack transparency, and even use the pandemic to crack down on anti-government smears This article concludes that the government needs to change their approach to COVID-19 measures and prioritize the human security dimension by not downgrading the threats and upholding transparency ? 2021 Jurnal Ilmu Sosial dan Ilmu Politik All rights reserved","output":"Indonesian government's COVID-19 measures, january-may 2020: Late response and public health securitization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic a decline in mental health has been reported.

After the Colombian government declared a lockdown due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Raquel, a Black woman working as a maid in the city of California, had tried to negotiate a release to see her children. To protect the white/mestizo family who feared she would infect them if she went home and returned, Raquel ultimately stayed confined in their house, leaving her own children alone for two months. They depended on the care of other Black women from the community who were perhaps fired for the choice imposed on them.

Among seven Eimeria species infecting chickens, E. acervulina is a highly prevalent, moderately pathogenic species. Thus, it is valuable for the study of transfection and for use as a potential as vaccine vector. In this study, a plasmid containing expression cassette with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP), red fluorescent protein (RFP) and 12 copies of extracellular domain of H9N2 avian influenza virus M2 (M2e) protein was used for the transfection. Nucleofected sporozoites were inoculated into birds through wing vein. Recombinant E. acervulina oocysts with 0.1% EYFP+ and RFP+ populations were collected from the feces of the inoculated birds. The fluorescent rate of transgenic parasites reached over 95% after nine successive propagations with a pyrimethamine selection in vivo and fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) of progeny oocysts. The expression of M2e in the transgenic parasites (EaM2e) was confirmed by Western blot and its cytoplasm localization in sporozoites was displayed by an indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA). Meanwhile, we found that the fecundity of EaM2e was equivalent to that of wild type E. acervulina (EaWT). Taken together, the stable transfection of E. acervulina was successfully established.

Favipiravir (FAV) is an antiviral drug that is currently in clinical trials for use against COVID-19. However, the delivery of FAV is challenging because of its limited solubility, and its formulation is difficult with common organic solvents and water. To address these issues, four FAV ionic liquids (FAV-ILs) were synthesized as potent antiviral prodrugs and were fully characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), derivative thermogravimetry (DTG), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The aqueous solubility and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties of the FAV-ILs were also evaluated. The FAV-ILs exhibited improved aqueous solubility by 78 to 125 orders of magnitude when compared with that of free FAV. Upon oral dosing in mice, the absolute bioavailability of the -alanine ethyl ester FAV formulation was increased 1.9-fold compared with that of the control FAV formulation. The peak blood concentration, elimination half-life, and mean absorption time of FAV were also increased by 1.5-, 2.0-, and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared with the control. Furthermore, the FAV in the FAV-ILs exhibited significantly different biodistribution compared with the control FAV formulation. Interestingly, drug accumulation in the lungs and liver was improved 1.5-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively, compared with the control FAV formulation. These results indicate that the use of ILs exhibits potential as a simple, scalable strategy to improve the solubility and oral absorption of hydrophobic drugs, such as FAV.","output":"Favipiravir-Based Ionic Liquids as Potent Antiviral Drugs for Oral Delivery: Synthesis, Solubility, and Pharmacokinetic Evaluation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyze the impact of total population containment on the evolution of the growth rate of confirmed cases of covid-19 by controlling the results by the situation observed in a country that has not applied this measure.

Most cerebrovascular events described have been ischemic strokes, but both intracerebral hemorrhage and rarely cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) have also been reported. The diagnosis of CVST can be elusive, with wide-ranging and nonspecific presenting symptoms that can include headache or altered sensorium alone. OBJECTIVE: To describe the presentation, barriers to diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of CVST in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We abstracted data on all patients diagnosed with CVST and COVID-19 from March 1 to August 9, 2020 at Boston Medical Center. Subsequently, we reviewed the literature and extracted all published cases of CVST in patients with COVID-19 from January 1, 2020 through August 9, 2020 and included all studies with case descriptions. RESULTS: We describe the clinical features and management of CVST in 3 women with COVID-19 who developed CVST days to months after initial COVID-19 symptoms. Two patients presented with encephalopathy and without focal neurologic deficits, while one presented with visual symptoms. All patients were treated with intravenous hydration and anticoagulation. None suffered hemorrhagic complications, and all were discharged home. We identified 12 other patients with CVST in the setting of COVID-19 via literature search. There was a female predominance (54.5%), most patients presented with altered sensorium (54.5%), and there was a high mortality rate (36.4%). CONCLUSIONS: During this pandemic, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for CVST in patients with a recent history of COVID-19 presenting with non-specific neurological symptoms such as headache to provide expedient management and prevent complications. The limited data suggests that CVST in COVID-19 is more prevalent in females and may be associated with high mortality.","output":"Cerebral Venous Sinus Thromboses in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Three Cases and a Review of the Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes respiratory infection in annual epidemics, with infants and the elderly at particular risk of developing severe disease and death. However, despite its importance, no vaccine exists. The chimpanzee adenovirus, PanAd3-RSV, and modified vaccinia virus Ankara, MVA-RSV, are replication-defective viral vectors encoding the RSV fusion (F), nucleocapsid (N), and matrix (M2-1) proteins for the induction of humoral and cellular responses. We performed an open-label, dose escalation, phase 1 clinical trial in 42 healthy adults in which four different combinations of prime/boost vaccinations were investigated for safety and immunogenicity, including both intramuscular (IM) and intranasal (IN) administration of the adenovirus-vectored vaccine. The vaccines were safe and well tolerated, with the most common reported adverse events being mild injection site reactions. No vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred. RSV neutralizing antibody titers rose in response to IM prime with PanAd3-RSV and after IM boost for individuals primed by the IN route. Circulating anti-F immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) were observed after the IM prime and IM boost. RSV-specific T cell responses were increased after the IM PanAd3-RSV prime and were most efficiently boosted by IM MVA-RSV. Interferon- (IFN-) secretion after boost was from both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, without detectable T helper cell 2 (TH2) cytokines that have been previously associated with immune pathogenesis following exposure to RSV after the formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine. In conclusion, PanAd3-RSV and MVA-RSV are safe and immunogenic in healthy adults.

The complement system is an important component of the innate immune system that is involved in the opsonization of viruses but also in triggering further immune cell responses. Complement activation was seen in plasma adsorber material that clogged during the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Apart from the lung, the kidney is the second most common organ affected by COVID-19. Using immunohistochemistry for complement factors C1q, MASP-2, C3c, C3d, C4d, and C5b-9 we investigated the involvement of the complement system in six kidney biopsies with acute kidney failure in different clinical settings and three kidneys from autopsy material of patients with COVID-19. Renal tissue was analyzed for signs of renal injury by detection of thrombus formation using CD61, endothelial cell rarefaction using the marker E-26 transformation specific-related gene (ERG-) and proliferation using proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-staining. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Biopsies from patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS, n = 5), severe acute tubular injury (ATI, n = 7), zero biopsies with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC, n = 7) and 1 year protocol biopsies from renal transplants (Ctrl, n = 7) served as controls. In the material clogging plasma adsorbers used for extracorporeal therapy of patients with COVID-19 C3 was the dominant protein but collectin 11 and MASP-2 were also identified. SARS-CoV-2 was sporadically present in varying numbers in some biopsies from patients with COVID-19. The highest frequency of CD61-positive platelets was found in peritubular capillaries and arteries of COVID-19 infected renal specimens as compared to all controls. Apart from COVID-19 specimens, MASP-2 was detected in glomeruli with DIC and ATI. In contrast, the classical pathway (i.e. C1q) was hardly seen in COVID-19 biopsies. Both C3 cleavage products C3c and C3d were strongly detected in renal arteries but also occurs in glomerular capillaries of COVID-19 biopsies, while tubular C3d was stronger than C3c in biopsies from COVID-19 patients. The membrane attack complex C5b-9, demonstrating terminal pathway activation, was predominantly deposited in COVID-19 biopsies in peritubular capillaries, renal arterioles, and tubular basement membrane with similar or even higher frequency compared to controls. In conclusion, various complement pathways were activated in COVID-19 kidneys, the lectin pathway mainly in peritubular capillaries and in part the classical pathway in renal arteries whereas the alternative pathway seem to be crucial for tubular complement activation. Therefore, activation of the complement system might be involved in the worsening of renal injury. Complement inhibition might thus be a promising treatment option to prevent deregulated activation and subsequent collateral tissue injury.","output":"Complement Activation in Kidneys of Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mandatory and punitive vaccination policies, such as requiring vaccination certificates for public activities and firing employees who refuse vaccination, have raised considerable objections.

Thus, many cases of large-scale finite-element analysis is required, and the computational cost incurred is expected to become a bottleneck. As a basic study towards data assimilation of internal magma state considering change in material properties of the crust, we demonstrated that many case analyses of volcano deformation problems can be conducted in a reasonable time frame by development of a crustal deformation analysis method accelerated by GPUs. For verification of the data assimilation method, we estimated the magma trend in an actual three-dimensional heterogeneous crust structure without temporal change in material properties. We confirmed that the magma movement trend can be reproduced using the model considering crust heterogeneity, while models disregarding three-dimensional crust structure resulted in wrong estimations.

METHODS: Observational study in a 185-bed NH with two consecutive testing strategies: testing of symptomatic cases only, followed by weekly facility-wide testing of staff and residents regardless of symptoms. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing with RT-PCR for SARs-CoV-2, including sequencing of positive samples, was conducted with a standardized symptom assessment. RESULTS: 185 residents and 244 staff participated. Sequencing identified one cluster. In the symptom-based test strategy period 3/39 residents were presymptomatic versus 38/74 residents in the period of weekly facility-wide testing (p-value<0.001). In total, 51/59 (91.1%) of SARS-CoV-2 positive staff was symptomatic, with no difference between both testing strategies (p-value 0.763).

During thrombolytic therapy, she developed vaginal bleeding followed by uterine inversion secondary to uterine rhabdomyosarcoma. The inverted uterus was mistaken for a cervical tumour and was removed vaginally. The patients disease progressed despite chemotherapy with vincristine, actinomycin D and cyclophosphamide and she died within 6 months. To our knowledge, this is the first case of uterine rhabdomyosarcoma complicated with cerebral venous thrombosis.

A total of 1935 infertile women aged 20-46 years were included in the cross-sectional study and divided into four quartile groups (Q1 to Q4) based on serum T levels. Compared to the subjects in the highest T quartile (Q4), those in the lowest T quartile (Q1) showed significantly lower AMH levels. After adjustment for age, body weight, body mass index and FSH, increasing T quartile categories were associated with higher AMH levels. Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that the odds for the risk of diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) were 11.44-fold higher in Q1 than in Q4 and the odds for the risk of excess ovarian reserve (EOR) were 10.41-fold higher in Q4 than in Q1.

We conducted two quasi-experiments with pre- and post-COVID-19 (Study 1, n = 97) and Wave 1-Wave 3 pandemic study designs (Study 2, n = 94), respectively, and found that supervisor-directed deviance triggered felt leader identity threat, consequently leading to retaliation against subordinates;this indirect effect strengthened as the pandemic progressed. We replicated these findings using a field study during the third wave of the pandemic (Study 3, n = 190), which established external validity by expanding the types of deviant and retaliatory behaviours examined. The results further showed that low COVID-19-induced empathic concern strengthened the effect of felt leader identity threat on retaliatory responses.

Further, protection and hygiene measures like fixed children-staff groups, ventilation and surface disinfection were introduced in ECEC centres. To inform or modify public health measures in ECEC, we investigate the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infections among children and staff in ECEC centres in light of social determinants (i.e. the socioeconomic status of the children) and recommended structural and hygiene measures. We focus on the question if the relevant factors differ between the 2nd (when no variant of concern (VOC) circulated) and the 3rd wave (when VOC B.1.1.7 (Alpha) predominated). METHODS: Based on panel data from a weekly online survey of ECEC centre managers (calendar week 36/2020 to 22/2021, ongoing) including approx. 8500 centres, we estimate the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children and staff using random-effect-within-between (REWB) panel models for count data in the 2nd and 3rd wave. RESULTS: ECEC centres with a high proportion of children with low socioeconomic status (SES) have a higher risk of infections in staff and children. Strict contact restrictions between groups like fixed group assignments for children and fixed staff assignments to groups prevent infections. Both effects tend to be stronger in the 3rd wave. CONCLUSION: ECEC centres with a large proportion of children with a low SES background and lack of using fixed child/staff cohorts experience higher COVID-19 rates. Over the long run, centres should be supported in maintaining recommended measures. Preventive measures such as the vaccination of staff should be prioritised in centres with large proportions of low SES children.","output":"COVID-19 infections in day care centres in Germany: social and organisational determinants of infections in children and staff in the second and third wave of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNC-93 homolog B1 (UNC93B1) is a key regulator of toll-like receptors (TLRs), pattern recognition receptors that sense invading pathogens and manage the innate immune response and deliver them from the endoplasmic reticulum to their respective endosomal signaling compartments.

Type of program or service: Public health outbreak response. METHODS Narrative with epidemiological linking and genomic testing. RESULTS Epidemiological linking and genomic testing found that during the first wave of COVID-19 in NSW, a large number of community transmissions went undetected because of limited testing for the virus and limited contact tracing of cases. The second wave of COVID-19 in NSW emerged following reintroduction from the second wave in Victoria, Australia in July 2020, and the third wave followed undetected introduction from overseas. By the second and third waves, cases could be more effectively detected and isolated through an increased ability to test and contact trace, and to rapidly genomic sequence severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolates, allowing most cases to be identified and epidemiologically linked. This greater certainty in understanding chains of transmission resulted in control of the outbreaks despite less stringent restrictions on the community, by using a refined strategy of targeted shutdown, restrictions on cases, their close contacts, identified hotspots and venues of concern rather than a whole of community lockdown. Risk assessments of potential transmission sites were constantly updated through our evolving experience with transmission events. However, this refined strategy did leave the potential for large point source outbreaks should any cases go undetected.

They create an acidic, hypoxic, and nutrient-depleted TME that makes it difficult for the cytotoxic immune cells to adapt to the metabolically hostile environment. Since a robust metabolism in immune cells is required for optimal anti-tumor effector functions, the challenges caused by the TME result in severe defects in the invasion and destruction of the established tumors. There have been many recent developments in NK and T cell-mediated immunotherapy, such as engineering them to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to enhance tumor-recognition and infiltration. However, to defeat the tumor and overcome the limitations of the TME, it is essential to fortify these novel therapies by improving the metabolism of the immune cells. One potential strategy to enhance the metabolic fitness of immune cells is to upregulate the expression of nutrient transporters, specifically glucose and amino acid transporters. In particular, the amino acid transporters SLC1A5 and SLC7A5 as well as the ancillary subunit SLC3A2, which are required for efficient uptake of glutamine and leucine respectively, could strengthen the metabolic capabilities and effector functions of tumor-directed CAR-NK and T cells. In addition to enabling the influx and efflux of essential amino acids through the plasma membrane and within subcellular compartments such as the lysosome and the mitochondria, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the amino acid transporters participate in sensing amino acid levels and thereby activate mTORC1, a master metabolic regulator that promotes cell metabolism, and induce the expression of c-Myc, a transcription factor essential for cell growth and proliferation. In this review, we discuss the regulatory pathways of these amino acid transporters and how we can take advantage of these processes to strengthen immunotherapy against cancer.","output":"Targeting SLC1A5 and SLC3A2/SLC7A5 as a Potential Strategy to Strengthen Anti-Tumor Immunity in the Tumor Microenvironment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a potentially fatal multisystemic infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Currently, viable therapeutic options that are cost effective, safe and readily available are desired, but lacking Nevertheless, the pandemic is noticeably of lesser burden in African and Asian regions, where the use of traditional herbs predominates, with such relationship warranting a closer look at ethnomedicine From a molecular viewpoint, the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the crucial first phase of COVID-19 pathogenesis Here, we review plants with medicinal properties which may be implicated in mitigation of viral invasion either via direct or indirect modulation of ACE2 activity to ameliorate COVID-19 Selected ethnomedicinal plants containing bioactive compounds which may prevent and mitigate the fusion and entry of the SARS-CoV-2 by modulating ACE2-associated up and downstream events are highlighted Through further experimentation, these plants could be supported for ethnobotanical use and the phytomedicinal ligands could be potentially developed into single or combined preventive therapeutics for COVID-19 This will benefit researchers actively looking for solutions from plant bioresources and help lessen the burden of COVID-19 across the globe","output":"Natural Products Modulating Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) as Potential COVID-19 Therapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A major focus of debate about rationing guidelines for COVID-19 vaccines is whether and how to prioritize access for minority populations that have been particularly affected by the pandemic, and been the subject of historical and structural disadvantage, particularly Black and Indigenous individuals.

We filtered the return residuals using the stochastic volatility and GJR-GARCH (1,1) models with different distributions, and we selected the best-fitted model in the GARCH framework. We applied the peaks-over-threshold (POT) method to the filtered residuals to fit it by the generalised Pareto distribution (GPD), and we used the vine copula to model the co-movement between foreign exchange rates and equity indices and value at risk (VaR) for risk quantification. We used three exchange rates (USD, GDP, and EUR) against the South African rand (ZAR) and six industry indices (banking, life insurance, non-life insurance, leisure, telecommunications, and mining). Our empirical findings show that the GJR-GARCH with Student's t-distribution, combined with a regular (R)-vine copula, outperforms the alternatives models. Dependence structure analysis reveals a strong co-dependency between the stock from the financial industry and foreign exchange rates. The results also show that VaR-based R-vine copula outperforms the model compared to VaR-based D-vine and C-vine before the COVID-19 outbreak, while the D-vine copula produced appears to be the most suitable risk model specification for quantifying risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, VaR-based R-vine copula is suitable for risk quantification, while GJR-GARCH with Student's t-distribution produces better results in the GARCH framework. Further, we find that equity indices and foreign exchange rates exhibit higher tail risk contagion during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the non-life-insurance and telecommunications sectors appearing to be the investor's safe haven among the listed sectors of the JSE. Our results will help South African investors seek risk-adjusted returns to substantially reduce the hedging cost of potential loss due to the misspecification of a risk model and make an investment decision during the global health crisis.","output":"Quantifying Foreign Exchange Risk in the Selected Listed Sectors of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange: An SV-EVT Pairwise Copula Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Family caregivers often manage complex medical and nursing tasks (MNTs) for older adults transitioning from hospital to home.

In this work, the catalytic mechanism of M(pro) was studied using the full model of the enzyme and a computational QM/MM methodology with a 69/72-atoms QM region treated at DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS//B3LYP/6-31G(d,p):AMBER level and including the catalytic important oxyanion-hole residues. The transition state of each step was fully characterized and described together with the related reactants and products. The rate-limiting step of the catalytic process is the hydrolysis of the thioester-enzyme adduct, and the calculated barrier closely agrees with the available kinetic data. The calculated Gibbs free energy profile, together with the full atomistic detail of the structures involved in catalysis, can now serve as valuable models for the rational drug design of transition state analogs as new inhibitors targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Interventions included combinations of high-volume intraoral suction (HVS[IO]), high-volume extraoral suction (HVS[EO]) and an air cleaning system (ACS).Method A sequence of six AGPs were performed on a phantom head. Real-time aerosol measurements (particle size range 0.0062-9.6 m) were acquired from six locations within a typical dental treatment room (35 m3).Results The majority (>99%) of AGP particles were <0.3 m diameter and remained at elevated levels around the dental team during the AGPs. With no active aerosol-management interventions, AGP particles were estimated to remain above the baseline range for up to 30 minutes from the end of the sequence of procedures.Conclusions The results emphasise the importance of personal protection equipment, particularly respiratory protection. Use of HVS(IO), either alone or in combination with the ACS, reduced particle concentrations to baseline levels on completion of AGPs. These data indicate potential to eliminate fallow time.

Despite good clinical success of FDs, complications like incomplete occlusion and post-treatment rupture leading to subarachnoid hemorrhage have been reported. In silico computational fluid dynamic analysis of the pre- and post-treated geometries of IA patients can shed light on the contrasting blood hemodynamics associated with different clinical outcomes. In this study, we analyzed hemodynamic modifications in 15 IA patients treated using a single FD; 10 IAs were completely occluded (successful) and 5 were partially occluded (unsuccessful) at 12-month follow-up. An in-house virtual stenting workflow was used to recapitulate the clinical intervention on these cases, followed by CFD to obtain pre- and post-treatment hemodynamics. Bulk hemodynamic parameters showed comparable reductions in both groups with average inflow rate and aneurysmal velocity reduction of 40.3% and 52.4% in successful cases, and 34.4% and 49.2% in unsuccessful cases. There was a substantial reduction in localized parameter like vortex coreline length and Energy Loss for successful cases, 38.2% and 42.9% compared to 10.1% and 10.5% for unsuccessful cases. This suggest that for successfully treated IAs, the localized complex blood flow is disrupted more prominently by the FD as compared to unsuccessful cases.

Reduction of male fertility is also observed with other viral infections, but the global pandemic of COVID-19 makes demographic and public health implications of reduced male fertility of major concern, especially if it occurs in the absence of serious symptoms that would otherwise encourage vaccination. Clinical documentation of COVID-19-associated male subfertility is now warranted to obtain quantitative relationships between infection severity and subfertility; mechanistic studies using animal models may reveal ways to mitigate the problem.

Despite the identification of neural circuits and circulating hormones in olfactory regulation, the peripheral targets for olfactory modulation remain relatively unexplored. In analyzing the single-cell RNA sequencing data from mouse and human olfactory mucosa (OM), we found that the mature olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) express high levels of dopamine D2 receptor (Drd2) rather than other dopamine receptor subtypes. The DRD2 receptor is expressed in the cilia and somata of mature OSNs, while nasal dopamine is mainly released from the sympathetic nerve terminals, which innervate the mouse OM. Intriguingly, genetic ablation of Drd2 in mature OSNs or intranasal application with DRD2 antagonist significantly increased the OSN response to odorants and enhanced the olfactory sensitivity in mice. Mechanistic studies indicated that dopamine, acting through DRD2 receptor, could inhibit odor-induced cAMP signaling of olfactory receptors. Interestingly, the local dopamine synthesis in mouse OM is down-regulated during starvation, which leads to hunger-induced olfactory enhancement. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of local dopamine synthesis in mouse OM is sufficient to enhance olfactory abilities. Altogether, these results reveal nasal dopamine and DRD2 receptor as the potential peripheral targets for olfactory modulation.","output":"Olfactory regulation by dopamine and DRD2 receptor in the nose"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Post-term pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of maternal complications, respiratory distress and trauma to the neonate. Amniotic membrane sweeping has been recommended as a simple procedure to promote the spontaneous onset of labour. However, despite its widespread use, there is an absence of evidence on (a) its effectiveness and (b) its optimal timing and frequency. The primary aim of the MILO Study is to inform the optimal design of a future definitive randomised trial to evaluate the effectiveness (including optimal timing and frequency) of membrane sweeping to prevent post-term pregnancy. We will also assess the acceptability and feasibility of the proposed trial interventions to clinicians and women (through focus group interviews). METHODS/DESIGN: Multicentre, pragmatic, parallel-group, pilot randomised controlled trial with an embedded factorial design. Pregnant women with a live, singleton foetus  38 weeks gestation; cephalic presentation; longitudinal lie; intact membranes; English speaking and  18 years of age will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to membrane sweep versus no membrane sweep. Women allocated randomly to a sweep will then be randomised further (factorial component) to early (from 39 weeks) versus late (from 40 weeks) sweep commencement and a single versus weekly sweep. The proposed feasibility study consists of four work packages, i.e. (1) a multicentre, pilot randomised trial; (2) a health economic analysis; (3) a qualitative study; and (4) a study within the host trial (a SWAT). Outcomes to be collected include recruitment and retention rates, compliance with protocol, randomisation and allocation processes, attrition rates and cost-effectiveness. Focus groups will be held with women and clinicians to explore the acceptability and feasibility of the proposed intervention, study procedures and perceived barriers and enablers to recruitment.

We sought to determine the differences between rural and academic hospitals in VTE management and disposition of patients during the COVID pandemic. Methods: This retrospective study used data from a quality improvement database to evaluate the management and treatment of patients diagnosed with VTE in our emergency departments during the COVID pandemic between 9/1/2020 and 2/28/2021 in any one of our 6 network locations across NE PA. Three of these sites have affiliations and are considered teaching/academic hospitals, while the other 3 are located in rural settings. Results: Of 454 patients diagnosed with VTE, 291 patients were at our academic hospitals and 163 in our rural hospitals. Data include 235 males and 219 females, with an average age of 58 and 61, respectively. Patients treated for VTE in the rural hospitals had an on average shorter length of stay (LOS) prior to disposition (372 min. rural vs. 404 min. academic, p= 0.204). Further, patients seen in rural settings were less likely to be admitted than in academic settings (45.4% (N=74) rural vs. 59.8% (N=174) academic admit rate). The 30-day return rate for all causes following an ED visit was almost 2x greater in the rural setting vs. academic (30.7% (N=50) vs. 17.5% (N=51), respectively). Despite this, the 30-day return rates attributable to VTE were similar (24% (N=12) rural, 23.5% (N=12) academic). At the 6-month mark, return rates attributable to VTE at rural locations were low but had an almost 1.6x higher rate of return (7.7% (N=2) rural vs 4.8% (N=3) academic). Rural locations utilized different rates of DOACs, with rural hospitals using rivaroxaban at a 2x higher rate than academic settings (45.3% (N=34) rural vs 20.2% (N=36) academic). Apixaban was more frequently used at academic vs rural settings (64.0% (N=114) academic vs. 41.3% (N=31) rural). Rural vs academic settings had similar rates of PCP follow-up (89.7% (N=261) vs 81.6% (N=133), respectively). Academic settings had an almost 2x higher rate of coagulation clinic follow up vs. rural settings (6.9% (N=20) vs 3.7% (N=6), respectively). Conclusions: The findings in this single network study show substantial differences in the management of VTE during the COVID pandemic in rural versus academic settings. Future research involving a more detailed understanding of these differences between rural vs. academic hospital settings is indicated.","output":"48 Management and Disposition of Patients with Venous Thromboembolism In Academic Vs.

Abiotic variables (such as temperature, ammonia, and nitrite) and contaminants (e.g. pesticides) can potentially interact, increasing metabolism and the absorption of toxic substances, which can alter the ability of organisms to establish adequate stress responses. This study aimed to verify which pesticides were most frequently found and in the greatest quantities in low-order streams, and whether the combination of these pesticides with the abiotic variables altered the biological metabolism of aeglids. These freshwater crustaceans are important shredders that inhabit low-order streams and are sensitive to disturbances and/or abrupt environmental variations. The animals were exposed in situ in four streams (reference site and sites 1, 2, and 3). The reference site is a preserved stream with no apparent anthropogenic interference where aeglids still occur, while the other sites no longer exhibit populations of these animals and are influenced by agricultural activities. The exposure was performed bimonthly from November 2017 to September 2018 and lasted 96 h. Measured abiotic data and water samples were collected through all days of exposure. The analyzed biochemical parameters were acetylcholinesterase activity in muscle; and glutathione S-transferase, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, non-protein thiols, antioxidant capacity against peroxides, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in muscle, gills, and hepatopancreas. We found 24 active principles of pesticides, the most frequently being clomazone, atrazine, and propoxur. Bentazone was present at the highest amounts. The parameters evaluated in this study, including biochemical biomarkers and abiotic factors measured from the water, provided a separation of the months as a function of environmental conditions. There was a difference in activity and biomarker levels throughout the year within the same site and in some months between sites. The greater concentration or variety of pesticides associated with extreme abiotic (very high temperatures) data generated increased oxidative stress, with high levels of protein damage and considerable lipid damage in all tissues, as well as elevation in ROS, even with high levels of antioxidant capacity and non-protein thiols. With these data, we intend to warn about the risks of exposure to these environmental conditions by trying to contribute to the preservation of limnic fauna, especially aeglid crabs, because most species are under some degree of threat.","output":"Influence of pesticides and abiotic conditions on biochemical biomarkers in Aegla aff. longirostri (crustacea, anomura): Implications for conservation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Following the development of the COVID-19 pandemic, a rigid public health strategy of reduced social contact and shelter-in-place has been adopted by the Italian Government to reduce the spread of the virus In this paper, we aim at evaluating the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the relative containment measures, have had on a real-life sample of patients suffering from substance use disorders (SUDs) and/or behavioral addictions Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was filled out by 153 addicted patients, both outpatients and residential inpatients, recruited across Italy and highly representative of the current Italian population suffering from addictions Psychopathological burden (anxiety and depressive symptomatology, somatization, irritability, and post-traumatic symptoms), quality of life, and craving changes in daily habits were assessed Results: In our sample, we found moderate rates of depression (22 9%), anxiety (30 1%), irritability (31 6%), and post-traumatic stress (5 4%) symptoms Psychopathological burden was globally higher among residential patients Reported levels of craving were generally low Discussion: This study is the first attempt to collect Italian data regarding the effects of the rigid quarantine period, during the COVID-19 pandemic, on patients suffering from a SUD and/or behavioral addictions The presence of a moderate psychopathological burden correlated to poor quality of life and low craving scores represented the main outcomes Long-term studies, with follow-up after the end of the restrictive measures, should be considered to implement our findings","output":"Psychopathological Burden and Quality of Life in Substance Users During the COVID-19 Lockdown Period in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Transplant patients are a vulnerable group due to their immunocompromised status.

Lacking medical prophylactic measures to combat disease spread, many nations have adopted social distancing policies in order to mitigate transmission of CoV-2. While mathematical models have suggested the efficacy of social distancing to curb the spread of CoV-2, there is a lack of systematic studies to quantify the real-world efficacy of these approaches. Here, we first demonstrate that implementation of social distancing policies in US states corresponded with a reduction in COVID19 spread rates, and that the reduction in spread rate is proportional to the average change in mobility. We validate this observation on a worldwide scale by analyzing COVID19 spread rate in 134 nations with varying social distancing policies. Globally, we find that social distancing policies significantly reduced the COVID19 spread rate, with resulting in an estimated 65% reduction (95% CI = 39C80%) in new COVID19 cases over a two week time period. These data suggest that social distancing policies may be a powerful tool to prevent spread of COVID19 in real-world scenarios.","output":"Enacting national social distancing policies corresponds with dramatic reduction in COVID19 infection rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to public health and supply chain systems around the globe.

This review discusses racial-ethnic differences in COVID-19 related outcomes with an emphasis on the social determinants of health that are responsible for these disparities. RECENT FINDINGS Higher hospitalizations and deaths have been reported amongst minority individuals after a COVID-19 infection. Cardiovascular disease and its risk factors are also more common in minority populations and negatively impact clinical outcomes after a COVID-19 illness. The racial disparities seen after COVID-19 infections appear to be driven by multiple preexisting comorbidities, adverse socioeconomic conditions, and lack of access to healthcare. These disadvantages were present before the COVID-19 pandemic. To effectively reduce disparities in outcomes of COVID-19 and the impact of the virus on minority communities, a multifaceted approach will be needed.

While studies have demonstrated a low risk of serious adverse events, the comprehensive incidence and nature of the spectrum of transfusion reactions to CP is unknown. We retrospectively examined 427 adult inpatient CP transfusions to determine incidence and types of reactions, as well as clinical parameters and risk factors associated with transfusion reactions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed for 427 transfusions to 215 adult patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) within the Mount Sinai Health System, through the US Food and Drug Administration emergency investigational new drug and the Mayo Clinic Expanded Access Protocol to Convalescent Plasma approval pathways. Transfusions were blindly evaluated by two reviewers and adjudicated by a third reviewer in discordant cases. Patient demographics and clinical and laboratory parameters were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty-five reactions from 427 transfusions were identified (12.9% incidence), and 13 were attributed to transfusion (3.1% incidence). Reactions were classified as underlying COVID-19 (76%), febrile nonhemolytic (10.9%), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (9.1%), and allergic (1.8%) and hypotensive (1.8%) reactions. Statistical analysis identified increased transfusion reaction risk for ABO blood group B or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores of 12 to 13, and decreased risk within the age group of 80 to 89 years. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the use of CP as a safe, therapeutic option from a transfusion reaction perspective, in the setting of COVID-19. Further studies are needed to confirm the clinical significance of ABO group B, age, and predisposing disease severity in the incidence of transfusion reaction events.","output":"Transfusion reactions associated with COVID-19 convalescent plasma therapy for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bisexual people demonstrate higher rates of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) in comparison to other groups.

Fifteen bisexual people (16C25 years old) with experience of NSSI participated in online qualitative interviews. Thematic analysis was used. Preliminary findings were shared with a subset of participants for member-checking. Participants described experiences of falling between the binary worlds of heterosexuality and homosexuality and described discrimination and invalidation related to this. Lack of access to positive bisexual representation contributed to feelings of self-loathing, with NSSI used to manage emotions or self-punish. The effect of lockdown was not clear cut, depending on personal circumstances and meanings of social interaction for participants. There is a need for greater recognition of significant societal narratives around bisexuality within clinical formulations of mental health difficulties and NSSI within this population.

The main purpose of this study was to determine how the pandemic training restrictions affected training volume and performance in one collegiate swim team. Cumulative training volume data across a 28-week season were compared between a pandemic (2020C2021) versus non-pandemic (2019C2020) season. The swimmers were categorized into three groups (sprinters, mid-distance, and long-distance) based on their training group. The performance times of 25 swimmers who competed in the regional championships, during both the non-pandemic and pandemic year, were compared via one-way ANOVA. Twenty-six male and 22 female swimmers commenced the 2020C2021 (pandemic) season, with 23% of the swimmers voluntarily opting out. Three COVID-19 cases were confirmed (2%) by the medical staff, with no long-term effects. Significant reductions in the average swim volume were verified in sprinters (32,867  10,135 vs. 14,800  7995 yards; p < 0.001), mid-distance (26,457  10,692 vs. 17,054  9.923 yards; p < 0.001), and long-distance (37,600  14,430 vs. 22,254  14,418 yards; p < 0.001) swimmers (non-pandemic vs. pandemic season, respectively). In the regional performance analyses, the sprinters swam faster (n = 8; ?0.5  0.6 s), while the mid-distance (n = 10; 0.17  2.1 s) and long-distance (n = 7; 6.0  4.9 s) swimmers swam slower (F = 11.76; p = 0.0003; r(2) = 0.52).

Toll-like receptor 4 is implicated as a key upstream driver of a controlled inflammatory response, elicited by signals in male partner seminal fluid, to initiate expansion of the maternal Treg cell pool after mating. Here, we report that mice with null mutation in Tlr4 (Tlr4-/-) exhibit impaired reproductive outcomes after allogeneic mating, with reduced pregnancy rate, elevated mid-gestation fetal loss, and fetal growth restriction, compared to Tlr4+/+ wild-type controls. To investigate the effects of TLR4 deficiency on early events of maternal immune adaptation, TLR4-regulated cytokines and immune regulatory microRNAs were measured in the uterus at 8 h post-mating by qPCR, and Treg cells in uterus-draining lymph nodes were evaluated by flow cytometry on day 3.5 post-coitum. Ptgs2 encoding prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, cytokines Csf2, Il6, Lif, and Tnf, chemokines Ccl2, Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Cxcl10, and microRNAs miR-155, miR-146a, and miR-223 were induced by mating in wild-type mice, but not, or to a lesser extent, in Tlr4-/- mice. CD4+ T cells were expanded after mating in Tlr4+/+ but not Tlr4-/- mice, with failure to expand peripheral CD25+FOXP3+ NRP1- or thymic CD25+FOXP3+ NRP1+ Treg cell populations, and fewer Treg cells expressed Ki67 proliferation marker and suppressive function marker CTLA4. We conclude that TLR4 is an essential mediator of the inflammation-like response in the pre-implantation uterus that induces generation of Treg cells to support robust pregnancy tolerance and ensure optimal fetal growth and survival.","output":"Toll-like receptor-4 null mutation causes fetal loss and fetal growth restriction associated with impaired maternal immune tolerance in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To identify the clinical findings and outcomes of children with COVID\\\\19 and factors predicting RT\\\\PCR positivity.

Although it is common to talk about the violence against trans people, little is still known about mental health outcomes and experiences of suicidality among trans women, particularly in developing countries. This study aims to investigate risk factors and associations with mental health, suicide ideation and suicide attempts among trans women in the largest metropolitan area in Brazil. METHODS: Trans women living in S?o Paulo were recruited between May 2017 and July 2019 using the long-chain peer referral method Respondent-Driven Sampling. Multivariate regression models were used to investigate the associations with K10 score classification (logistic) and suicidal ideation/suicide attempt (ordinal logistic). RESULTS: A total of 763 trans women were included in the study. Over one quarter (26.5%) of trans women had been diagnosed with anxiety in the past, and close to one in five (19.1%) trans women had received a diagnosis of depression. More than two in five (41.9%) trans women had moderate to severe psychological distress. More than half of all participating trans women reported having previously either experienced suicidal ideation or attempted to take their own lives (25.0 and 31.2% respectively). In multivariate regression, moderate to severe psychological distress was associated with homelessness, income, current sex work, use of stimulant drugs, history of physical abuse, depression diagnosis and access to mental health treatment. Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts were associated with race/skin color, living arrangements, marital status, current sex work, history of sexual violence, depression and PTSD diagnoses, access to mental health treatment and psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that there is a significant association between mental health conditions, lack of treatment for these conditions and suicidality among trans gender women.

The effect of APOL1 risk variants on kidney disease in continental Africans is understudied. Objectives of this study were to determine APOL1 risk allele prevalence and associations between APOL1 genotypes and kidney disease in West, East, and South Africa. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS This cross-sectional population-based study in four African countries included 10,769 participants largely aged 40-60 years with sociodemographic and health information, anthropometry data, and blood and urine tests for biomarkers of kidney disease. APOL1 risk alleles were imputed from the H3Africa genotyping array, APOL1 risk allele and genotype frequencies were determined, and genetic associations were assessed for kidney disease. Kidney disease was defined as the presence of eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, albuminuria, or a composite end point including eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and/or albuminuria. RESULTS High G1 allele frequencies occurred in South and West Africa (approximately 7%-13%). G2 allele frequencies were highest in South Africa (15%-24%), followed by West Africa (9%-12%). Associations between APOL1 risk variants and albuminuria were significant for recessive (odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 2.12) and additive (odds ratio, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.76) models. Associations were stronger for APOL1 G1/G1 genotypes versus G0/G0 (odds ratio, 3.87; 95% confidence interval, 2.16 to 6.93) compared with either G2/G2 (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 2.51) or G1/G2 (odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.87). No association between APOL1 risk variants and eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 was observed. CONCLUSIONS APOL1 G1 and G2 alleles and high-risk genotype frequencies differed between and within West and South Africa and were almost absent from East Africa. APOL1 risk variants were associated with albuminuria but not eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. There may be differential effects of homozygous G1 and G2 genotypes on albuminuria that require further investigation.

RECENT FINDINGS: For the last few years, progress in research and management of essential hypertension has been stagnating while at the same time, the sequencing of the human genome has been generating many new research tools and opportunities to investigate the biology of hypertension. Cancer research has applied modern tools derived from DNA and RNA sequencing on a large scale, enabling the improved understanding of cancer biology and leading to many clinical applications. Compared with cancer, studies in hypertension, using whole genome, exome, or RNA sequencing tools, total less than 2% of the number cancer studies. While true, sequencing the genome of cancer tissue has provided cancer research an advantage, DNA and RNA sequencing derived tools can also be used in hypertension to generate new understanding how complex protein network, in non-cancer tissue, adapts and learns to be effective when for example, somatic mutations or environmental inputs change the gene expression profiles at different network nodes. The amount of data and differences in clinical condition classification at the individual sample level might be of such magnitude to overwhelm and stretch comprehension. Here is the opportunity to use AI tools for the analysis of data streams derived from DNA and RNA sequencing tools combined with clinical data to generate new hypotheses leading to the discovery of mechanisms and potential target molecules from which drugs or treatments can be developed and tested. Basic and clinical research taking advantage of new gene sequencing-based tools, to uncover mechanisms how complex protein networks regulate blood pressure in health and disease, will be critical to lift hypertension research and management from its stagnation. The use of AI analytic tools will help leverage such insights. However, applying AI tools to vast amounts of data that certainly exist in hypertension, without taking advantage of new gene sequencing-based research tools, will generate questionable results and will miss many new potential molecular targets and possibly treatments. Without such approaches, the vision of precision medicine for hypertension will be hard to accomplish and most likely not occur in the near future.","output":"AI (Artificial Intelligence) and Hypertension Research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New SARS-CoV-2 variants are continuously emerging with critical implications for therapies or vaccinations. All 22 N-glycan sites of SARS-CoV-2 Spike remain highly conserved among the variants B.1.1.7, 501Y.V2 and P.1, opening an avenue for robust therapeutic intervention. Here we used a comprehensive library of mammalian carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) to probe critical sugar residues on the full-length trimeric Spike and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Two lectins, Clec4g and CD209c, were identified to strongly bind to Spike. Clec4g and CD209c binding to Spike was dissected and visualized in real time and at single molecule resolution using atomic force microscopy. 3D modelling showed that both lectins can bind to a glycan within the RBD-ACE2 interface and thus interferes with Spike binding to cell surfaces. Importantly, Clec4g and CD209c significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 infections. These data report the first extensive map and 3D structural modelling of lectin-Spike interactions and uncovers candidate receptors involved in Spike binding and SARS-CoV-2 infections.

While it has been extensively studied in mental health care, there is little evidence for how to use it in primary care settings for patients with chronic physical conditions. Considering that DIALOG+ is used in existing routine patient-clinician meetings and is very low cost, it may have the potential to help large numbers of patients with chronic physical conditions, mental distress and poor quality of life who are treated in primary care. This is particularly relevant in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where resources for specialised services for such patients are scarce or non-existent. METHODS: An exploratory non-controlled trial will be conducted to primarily assess the feasibility and acceptability and, secondarily, outcomes of delivering DIALOG+ to patients with chronic physical conditions and poor quality of life in primary care settings in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia and Uganda. Thirty patients in each country will receive DIALOG+ up to three times in monthly meetings over a 3-month period. Feasibility will be assessed by determining the extent to which the intervention is implemented as planned. Experiences will be captured in interviews and focus groups with care providers and participants to understand acceptability. Quality of life, symptoms of anxiety and depression, objective social situation and health status will be assessed at baseline and again after the three-session intervention. DISCUSSION: This study will inform our understanding of the extent to which DIALOG+ may be used in the routine care of patients with chronic physical conditions in different primary care settings. The findings of this exploratory trial can inform the design of future full randomised controlled trials of DIALOG+ in primary care settings in LMICs.

A total of 73 moderate patients (38 men, 35 women) were included, with median age of 47.0 (38.5C57.5) years. Among them, only one patient (1.4%) died using active treatment to improve symptoms. The median duration of the four main symptoms cough, fever, chest tightness, and fatigue were 11.0, 8.0, 11.0, and 7.0 days, respectively; the median duration of the positive nucleic acid test (NAT) results for SARS-CoV-2 was 16.5 days; the median hospitalization time was 25.0 days in 72 moderate survivors. The duration of cough and fever was positively correlated with the duration of the positive NAT results. On admission, 50% had lymphopenia; less than 30% had abnormal blood biochemistry findings involving hyperglycemia, liver function and myocardial enzymes. At discharge, the laboratory indexes were substantially improved. Two weeks after discharge, 5.6% survivors experienced a recurrence of the positive NAT results. Moderate SARS-CoV-2 patients have a good prognosis by the active treatment.

Therefore, there is a high demand for vaccines with enhanced efficacy, high thermostability, superior design flexibility, and fast manufacturing speed. Here, we report a circular RNA (circRNA) vaccine that encodes the trimeric RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Without the need of nucleotide modification, 5-capping or 3-polyadenylation, circRNA could be rapidly produced via in vitro transcription and is highly thermostable whether stored in naked or lipid-nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated format. LNP-encapsulated circRNARBD elicited potent neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses, providing robust protection against Beta (B.1.351) and native viruses in mice and rhesus macaques, respectively. Notably, circRNA vaccine enabled higher and more durable antigen production than 1m-modified mRNA vaccine, eliciting a higher proportion of neutralizing antibodies and stronger Th1-biased immune responses. Importantly, we found that circRNARBD-Omicron vaccine induced effective neutralizing antibodies against only Omicron but not Delta variant. By contrast, circRNARBD-Delta could elicit high level of neutralizing antibodies against both Delta and Omicron. Following two doses of either native- or Delta-specific vaccination, circRNARBD-Delta, but not Omicron or Beta vaccines, could effectively boost the neutralizing antibodies against both Delta and Omicron variants. These results suggest that circRNARBD-Delta is a favorable choice for vaccination to provide a broad-spectrum protection against the current variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Circular RNA Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and Emerging Variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Paediatric Early Warning Systems (PEWSs) improve identification of deterioration, however, their sustainability has not been studied. Sustainability is critical to maximise impact of interventions like PEWS, particularly in low-resource settings. This study establishes the reliability and validity of a Spanish-language Clinical Sustainability Assessment Tool (CSAT) to assess clinical capacity to sustain interventions in resource-limited hospitals. METHODS: Participants included PEWS implementation leadership teams of 29 paediatric cancer centres in Latin America involved in a collaborative to implement PEWS. The CSAT, a sustainability assessment tool validated in high-resource settings, was translated into Spanish and distributed to participants as an anonymous electronic survey. Psychometric, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and multivariate analyses were preformed to assess reliability, structure and initial validity. Focus groups were conducted after participants reviewed CSAT reports to assess their interpretation and utility. RESULTS: The CSAT survey achieved an 80% response rate (n=169) with a mean score of 4.4 (of 5; 3.8C4.8 among centres). The CSAT had good reliability with an average internal consistency of 0.77 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.81); and CFAs supported the seven-domain structure. CSAT results were associated with respondents perceptions of the evidence for PEWS, its implementation and use in their centre, and their assessment of the hospital culture and implementation climate. The mean CSAT score was higher among respondents at centres with longer time using PEWS (p<0.001). Focus group participants noted the CSAT report helped assess their centres clinical capacity to sustain PEWS and provided constructive feedback for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: We present information supporting the reliability and validity of the CSAT tool, the first Spanish-language instrument to assess clinical capacity to sustain evidence-based interventions in hospitals of variable resource levels. This assessment demonstrates a high capacity to sustain PEWS in these resource-limited centres with improvement over time from PEWS implementation.","output":"Reliability and validity of a Spanish-language measure assessing clinical capacity to sustain Paediatric Early Warning Systems (PEWS) in resource-limited hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To report the peculiarity of spinal epidural abscess in COVID-19 patients, as we have observed an unusually high number of these patients following the outbreak of SARS-Corona Virus-2. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical documentation of six consecutive COVID-19 patients with primary spinal epidural abscess that we surgically managed over a 2-month period. These cases were analyzed for what concerns both the viral infection and the spinal abscess. RESULTS: The abscesses were primary in all cases indicating that no evident infective source was found. A primary abscess represents the rarest form of spinal epidural abscess, which is usually secondary to invasive procedures or spread from adjacent infective sites, such as spondylodiscitis, generally occurring in patients with diabetes, obesity, cancer, or other chronic diseases. In all cases, there was mild lymphopenia but the spinal abscess occurred regardless of the severity of the viral disease, immunologic state, or presence of bacteremia. Obesity was the only risk factor and was reported in two patients. All patients but one were hypertensive. The preferred localizations were cervical and thoracic, whereas classic abscess generally occur at the lumbar level. No patient had a history of pyogenic infection, even though previous asymptomatic bacterial contaminations were reported in three cases. CONCLUSION: We wonder about the concentration of this uncommon disease in such a short period. To our knowledge, cases of spinal epidural abscess in COVID-19 patients have not been reported to date. We hypothesize that, in our patients, the spinal infection could have depended on the coexistence of an initially asymptomatic bacterial contamination. The well-known COVID-19-related endotheliitis might have created the conditions for retrograde bacterial invasion to the correspondent spinal epidural space. Furthermore, spinal epidural abscess carries a significantly high morbidity and mortality. It is difficult to diagnose, especially in compromised COVID-19 patients but should be kept in mind as early diagnosis and treatment are crucial.","output":"Spinal epidural abscess in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spot patterns on bananas are a striking case of biological pattern formation and-as a qualitative ripeness indicator-linked to 50 million tons of wasted food per year.

This unique 3' end distinguishes replication-dependent histone mRNAs from all other eukaryotic mRNAs, which end with a poly(A) tail produced by the canonical 3'-end processing mechanism of cleavage and polyadenylation. The pioneering studies of Max Birnstiel's group demonstrated nearly 40 years ago that the unique 3' end of animal replication-dependent histone mRNAs is generated by a distinct processing mechanism, whereby histone mRNA precursors are cleaved downstream of the stem-loop, but this cleavage is not followed by polyadenylation. The key role is played by the U7 snRNP, a complex of a 60 nucleotide U7 snRNA and many proteins. Some of these proteins, including the enzymatic component CPSF73, are shared with the canonical cleavage and polyadenylation machinery, justifying the view that the two metazoan pre-mRNA 3'-end processing mechanisms have a common evolutionary origin. The studies on U7 snRNP culminated in the recent breakthrough of reconstituting an entirely recombinant human machinery that is capable of accurately cleaving histone pre-mRNAs, and determining its structure in complex with a pre-mRNA substrate (with 13 proteins and two RNAs) that is poised for the cleavage reaction. The structure uncovered an unanticipated network of interactions within the U7 snRNP and a remarkable mechanism of activating catalytically dormant CPSF73 for the cleavage. This work provides a conceptual framework for understanding other eukaryotic 3'-end processing machineries.","output":"U7 deciphered: the mechanism that forms the unusual 3' end of metazoan replication-dependent histone mRNAs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Disparate racial/ethnic burdens of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may be attributable to higher susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or to factors such as differences in hospitalization and care provision.

The applications of virus inactivation technologies are mainly based on the knowledge of virus characteristics, its persistence on material surfaces and environmental factors impairing its structure. Current virus inactivation methods are mostly employing chemicals and physical treatments such as hydrogen peroxide hypochlorite solutions and UV light. In this paper we discuss three current virus inactivation technologies for reducing the spread of COVID-19 i.e., room disinfection surface disinfection and personal protective equipment (PPE) decontamination technology. Room disinfection technology particularly rooms with poor ventilation or closed air circulation employs the combination of UV light treatment with filters. Surface disinfection technologies utilize the spraying or fogging of disinfectant solutions and PPE decontamination technologies utilize UV light or chemical treatments to inactivate the virus. Further development and application of these technologies will help the national effort in controlling the spread of COVID-19.

One of the key issues has been the very high volume of patients presenting to health centres or hospitals during the outbreak. It clearly overwhelms the human and mechanistic capacities available. Therefore, early and effective predictors of clinical outcomes are required for risk stratification. MATERIAL This is hospital based retrospective study on patients who were admitted in Covid wards/ICU at IGGMC. Patients were divided into 3 groups- mild-moderate; severe; and critical based on their clinical presentation on admission. Several biomarkers like WBC, platelets, N/L, CRP, LDH, S. ferritin, d-dimer, CPK-MB, Serum creatinine, BUL, SGOT, SGPT, Serum albumin were analysed before and after treatment. OBSERVATION 110 patients were enrolled in this study, 36 were classified into mild-moderate, 56 into severe and 18 into critical. As all of mild-moderate patients were discharged and majority of critical patients expired, biomarkers were compared between severe patients who were discharged vs severe patients who died. Out of these biomarkers, CRP was significantly decreased during course of treatment in severe patients who were discharged (p = 0.004) in comparison to severe patients who died where CRP was significantly increased (p = 0.001) (p value of difference being 0.00001). There was also significant change in ferritin levels (p = 0.006), while other biomarkers like WBC (p = 0.07), platelets (p = 0.066), N/L (p = 0.3), LDH (p = 0.06), d-dimer (p = 0.1), CPK-MB (p = 0.49), serum creatinine (p = 0.05), urea (p = 0.06), S. albumin (p= 0.3), SGOT (p =0.07), SGPT (p=0.25) did not show promising results. In addition, various treatment protocols were analysed by comparing CRP before and after treatment. Severe patients were divided into 2 groups, who took injection Remdesivir along with antibiotics, LMWH, systemic steroids vs who didn't, and CRP level were compared, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.06). Pre and post treatment CRP was also compared for Tocilizumab, Fevipiravir, Hydroxychloroquine, Doxycyline, but none of them were able to decrease CRP significantly (p > 0.05) in the severe or critical group but these drugs were effective in reducing CRP significantly (p<0.05) when given in mild-moderate group or if the treatment was started early.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics of children hospitalized with an asthma exacerbation during the pandemic as compared with those hospitalized during the same months in the year prior. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was conducted at the Children's National Hospital, Washington, DC, comparing demographic and clinical characteristics of all children, 2 to 18 years old, hospitalized for an asthma exacerbation between April to September 2020 (cases) and April to September 2019 (controls). RESULTS: We identified 50 cases and 243 controls. Cases were significantly older than controls (9.8  4.3 years vs 6.7  3.8 years; P < .001), had significantly less eczema (16% vs 32.1%; P = .02) and food allergies (6% vs 18.5%; P = .03), and were more noncompliant with controller medications (46% vs 24.7%; P = .002) than controls.

Here, we report the activation of sphingomyelinase-ceramide pathway in 23 intensive care patients with severe COVID-19. We observed an increase of circulating activity of sphingomyelinase with subsequent derangement of sphingolipids in serum lipoproteins and from red blood cells (RBC). Consistent with increased ceramide levels derived from the inert membrane constituent sphingomyelin, increased activity of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) accurately distinguished the patient cohort undergoing intensive care from healthy controls. Positive correlational analyses with biomarkers of severe clinical phenotype support the concept of an essential pathophysiological role of ASM in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as of a promising role for functional inhibition with anti-inflammatory agents in SARS-CoV-2 infection as also proposed in independent observational studies.

From a prospectively acquired database, all consecutive invasively ventilated COVID-19 ARDS patients who underwent at least one baseline chest CT scan during the study time period (February 25th, 2020CDecember 31st, 2020) were identified; those who had tracheal lesion or already had PMD/PNX at the time of the first available chest imaging were excluded. RESULTS: 37/173 (21.4%) patients enrolled had PMD/PNX; specifically, 20 (11.5%) had PMD, 10 (5.8%) PNX, 7 (4%) both. 33/37 patients with subsequent PMD/PNX had Macklin effect on baseline CT (89.2%, true positives) 8.5 days [range, 1C18] before the first actual radiological evidence of PMD/PNX. Conversely, 6/136 patients without PMD/PNX (4.4%, false positives) demonstrated Macklin effect (p < 0.001).

On the other hand, there has been an increasing number of reports on the role of oxytocin in allostasis and resilience. It has been shown that oxytocin maintains homeostasis, shifts the set point for adaptation to a changing environment (allostasis) and contributes to recovery from the shifted set point by inducing active coping responses to stressful stimuli (resilience). Recent studies have suggested that oxytocin is also involved in stress-related disorders, and it has been shown in clinical trials that oxytocin provides therapeutic benefits for patients diagnosed with stress-related disorders. This review includes the latest information on the role of oxytocin in stress responses and adaptation.","output":"Roles of Oxytocin in Stress Responses, Allostasis and Resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In view of the need to manage and forecast the number of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds for critically ill COVID-19 patients, the Forecast UTI open access application was developed to enable hospital indicator monitoring based on past health data and the temporal dynamics of the Coronavirus epidemic.

A histological examination of the palatine tonsils of 22 children aged 5 to 14 years old who had a paratonsillar abscess and 18 children suffering from chronic tonsillitis was carried out. Fragments of small salivary glands, located both superficially, in the mucous membrane between the stratified squamous non-keratinizing epithelium and the lymphoid tissue of the palatine tonsils, and between the muscles of the amygdala were found in 42 of the 80 (52.5%) tonsils studied. Along with the unchanged glandular structure, 26 (61.9%) samples revealed areas of destruction foci in small salivary glands with signs of inflammatory and compensatory regenerative activity. The presence of separate interlobular ducts of the salivary glands with pronounced periductal lymph - macrophage infiltration was noted. The subepithelial lymph-macrophage infiltrates found in the lamina propria are associated with the exit of the excretory ducts of the salivary glands to the surface of the mucous membrane. Many thin-walled veins are surrounded by perivascular lymphocellular infiltrates. The inflammatory and post-inflammatory changes in the small salivary glands revealed by us in children with chronic tonsillitis do not exclude their participation in the pathogenesis of paratonsillitis. At the same time, inflammation in the salivary gland can be both primary, as a result of its infection with live microorganisms from the tissues of the tonsil, and secondary, due to the compression of the excretory ducts by the edematous tissue of the tonsil in acute tonsillitis.","output":"[Small salivary glands in the paratonsillar space in children]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spinal aneurysms are rare lesions, and their natural history is not well known.

The first two indicate that North Koreas economy is poor and that serious food shortages can occur. The latter two tell us that there is an economic crisis in North Korea, but no one is dying of starvation yet. First, in the case of imports and exports, both fell sharply due to the sanctions and COVID19, and in particular, COVID19 played a decisive role in reducing North Koreas imports.

We determined the toxicity of binary mixtures for five different mixture ratios to adult mussels. We compared our observations to predictions made with concentration addition and independent action paradigms, as based on the dose-response relationships of each individual toxicant. We calculated the model deviation ratio for each combination at the LC50 and LC90 and identified three possible interactions: synergy, antagonism, and additivity. We found that mixtures of niclosamide and Clam-Trol CT-2 were the most synergistic while mixtures that included potassium chloride were largely additive to antagonistic.

Moreover, illuminated by the social learning mechanism of PSO and CSO algorithm, the paper incorporates cooperative communication with the current global best individual and competitive learning into the original BFO algorithm.

For each patient, the risk of contracting COVID-19 during the perioperative period, with the potential for life-threatening sequelae (1), has to be weighed against the risk of delaying treatment. We assessed the response and short-term outcomes from elective colorectal cancer surgery during the pandemic at our institution. METHOD: We report a prospective cohort study of all elective colorectal surgery cases performed at our Trust during the 11 weeks following the national UK lockdown on 23rd March 2020, compared with the same time period in 2019. RESULTS: Eighty-five colorectal operations were performed during the 2020 (COVID) time period, and 179 performed in the 2019 (non-COVID) time period. A significantly higher proportion of cases during the COVID period were cancer-related (66% vs 26%, p < 0.00001). There was no difference in length of hospital stay, complications or readmissions. There were no mortalities in either cohort. Among the cancer patients, there were no differences in TMN staging, R1 resection rate or lymph node yields. No elective patient tested positive for COVID-19 during the perioperative period. CONCLUSION: At the height of the COVID pandemic, we maintained delivery the of high-quality elective colorectal cancer surgery, with no worsening of short-term outcomes and no compromise in the quality of cancer resections. Ongoing monitoring of this cohort is essential. The risks associated with COVID-19 will continue for some time, necessitating adaptive responses to maintain high-quality cancer services.","output":"Maintaining Standards in Colorectal Cancer Surgery During the Global Pandemic: A Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In infectious disease epidemiology, the instantaneous reproduction number R(t) is a time-varying metric defined as the average number of secondary infections generated by individuals who are infectious at time t. It is therefore a crucial epidemiological parameter that assists public health decision makers in the management of an epidemic. We present a new Bayesian tool for robust estimation of the time-varying reproduction number. The proposed methodology smooths the epidemic curve and allows to obtain (approximate) point estimates and credible envelopes of R(t) by employing the renewal equation, using Bayesian P-splines coupled with Laplace approximations of the conditional posterior of the spline vector. Two alternative approaches for inference are presented: (1) an approach based on a maximum a posteriori argument for the model hyperparameters, delivering estimates of R(t) in only a few seconds; and (2) an approach based on a MCMC scheme with underlying Langevin dynamics for efficient sampling of the posterior target distribution. Case counts per unit of time are assumed to follow a Negative Binomial distribution to account for potential excess variability in the data that would not be captured by a classic Poisson model. Furthermore, after smoothing the epidemic curve, a ''plug-in'' estimate of the reproduction number can be obtained from the renewal equation yielding a closed form expression of R(t) as a function of the spline parameters. The approach is extremely fast and free of arbitrary smoothing assumptions. EpiLPS is applied on data of SARS-CoV-1 in Hong-Kong (2003), influenza A H1N1 (2009) in the USA and current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (2020-2021) for Belgium, Portugal, Denmark and France.","output":"EpiLPS: a fast and flexible Bayesian tool for near real-time estimation of the time-varying reproduction number"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance is a global public health threat. Antibiotics are very commonly prescribed for children presenting with uncomplicated lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), but there is little evidence from randomised controlled trials of the effectiveness of antibiotics, both overall or among key clinical subgroups. In ARTIC PC, we assessed whether amoxicillin reduces the duration of moderately bad symptoms in children presenting with uncomplicated (non-pneumonic) LRTI in primary care, overall and in key clinical subgroups. METHODS: ARTIC PC was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial done at 56 general practices in England. Eligible children were those aged 6 months to 12 years presenting in primary care with acute uncomplicated LRTI judged to be infective in origin, where pneumonia was not suspected clinically, with symptoms for less than 21 days. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive amoxicillin 50 mg/kg per day or placebo oral suspension, in three divided doses orally for 7 days. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was the duration of symptoms rated moderately bad or worse (measured using a validated diary) for up to 28 days or until symptoms resolved. The primary outcome and safety were assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN79914298). FINDINGS: Between Nov 9, 2016, and March 17, 2020, 432 children (not including six who withdrew permission for use of their data after randomisation) were randomly assigned to the antibiotics group (n=221) or the placebo group (n=211). Complete data for symptom duration were available for 317 (73%) patients; missing data were imputed for the primary analysis. Median durations of moderately bad or worse symptoms were similar between the groups (5 days [IQR 4C11] in the antibiotics group vs 6 days [4C15] in the placebo group; hazard ratio [HR] 113 [95% CI 090C142]). No differences were seen for the primary outcome between the treatment groups in the five prespecified clinical subgroups (patients with chest signs, fever, physician rating of unwell, sputum or chest rattle, and short of breath). Estimates from complete-case analysis and a per-protocol analysis were similar to the imputed data analysis. INTERPRETATION: Amoxicillin for uncomplicated chest infections in children is unlikely to be clinically effective either overall or for key subgroups in whom antibiotics are commonly prescribed. Unless pneumonia is suspected, clinicians should provide safety-netting advice but not prescribe antibiotics for most children presenting with chest infections.

The activity of ten-eleven translocase 2 (TET2) responsible for selective DNA demethylation, has been recently identified as a regulator of endogenous virus inactivation and viral invasion, possibly by proteasomal deregulation of the TET2/TET3 activities. In a recent report, we presented a detailed list of factors that can be affected by TET activity, including recognition of zinc finger protein binding sites and bimodal promoters, by enhancing the flexibility of adjacent sequences. In this review, we summarize the TET-associated processes and factors that could account for SARS-CoV-2 diverse symptoms. Moreover, we provide a correlation for the observed virus-induced symptoms that have been previously associated with TET activities by in vitro and in vitro studies. These include early hypoxia, neuronal regulation, smell and taste development, liver, intestinal, and cardiomyocyte differentiation. Finally, we propose that the high mortality of SARS-CoV-2 among adult patients, the different clinical symptoms of adults compared to children, the higher risk of patients with metabolic deregulation, and the low mortality rates among women can all be accounted for by the complex balance of the three enzymes with TET activity, which is developmentally regulated. This activity is age-dependent, related to telomere homeostasis and integrity, and associated with X chromosome inactivation via (de)regulation of the responsible XIST gene expression.","output":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection: Triggering a Lethal Fight to Keep Control of the Ten-Eleven Translocase (TET)-Associated DNA Demethylation?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nonadjacent immune cells communicate through a complex network of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). TNTs can be hijacked by HIV-1, allowing it to spread between connected cells. Dendritic cells (DCs) are among the first cells to encounter HIV-1 at mucosal sites, but they are usually efficiently infected only at low levels. However, HIV-1 was demonstrated to productively infect DCs when the virus was complement-opsonized (HIV-C). Such HIV-C-exposed DCs mediated an improved antiviral and T-cell stimulatory capacity. The role of TNTs in combination with complement in enhancing DC infection with HIV-C remains to be addressed. To this aim, we evaluated TNT formation on the surface of DCs or DC/CD4(+) T-cell co-cultures incubated with non- or complement-opsonized HIV-1 (HIV, HIV-C) and the role of TNTs or locally produced complement in the infection process using either two different TNT or anaphylatoxin receptor antagonists. We found that HIV-C significantly increased the formation of TNTs between DCs or DC/CD4(+) T-cell co-cultures compared to HIV-exposed DCs or co-cultures. While augmented TNT formation in DCs promoted productive infection, as was previously observed, a significant reduction in productive infection was observed in DC/CD4(+) T-cell co-cultures, indicating antiviral activity in this setting. As expected, TNT inhibitors significantly decreased infection of HIV-C-loaded-DCs as well as HIV- and HIV-C-infected-DC/CD4(+) T-cell co-cultures. Moreover, antagonizing C5aR significantly inhibited TNT formation in DCs as well as DC/CD4(+) T-cell co-cultures and lowered the already decreased productive infection in co-cultures. Thus, local complement mobilization via DC stimulation of complement receptors plays a pivotal role in TNT formation, and our findings herein might offer an exciting opportunity for novel therapeutic approaches to inhibit trans infection via C5aR targeting.","output":"HIV-1 Trans Infection via TNTs Is Impeded by Targeting C5aR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE The nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS)/candesartan cilexetil (N/C) combination was demonstrated to be an effective, well-tolerated antihypertensive therapy in a short-term study.

We assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety using the Arabic version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) on admission. The significance threshold used for any data comparison test was the value of p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 103 participants were included. The average age was 44, 17  17, 19 years. About 54,4% of the subjects were male. Of the 103 participants, 36.89% and 23.30% patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of anxiety or depression; respectively. The mean score of anxiety subscale and depression subscale for all patients was 6.45  4.29 and 5.38  4.47, respectively.

The meta-analysis revealed no statistically significant difference in the odds of mortality (pooled OR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.33C1.47), but a statistically significant reduction in the odds of hospital admission (pooled OR = 0.29; 95% CI 0.21C0.42), with the administration of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody among patients with COVID-19, relative to non-administration of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody, at the current sample size. CONCLUSION: The reduced risk of hospital admission with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies use suggests that the timing of neutralizing antibodies administration is key in preventing hospital admission and, ultimately, death. Future randomized trials should aim to determine if the clinical outcomes with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies differ based on serostatus.","output":"The use of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and risk of hospital admission and mortality in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Host shifts, where a pathogen invades and establishes in a new host species, are a major source of emerging infectious diseases. They frequently occur between related host species and often rely on the pathogen evolving adaptations that increase their fitness in the novel host species. To investigate genetic changes in novel hosts, we experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an RNA virus (Drosophila C Virus) in 19 different species of Drosophilidae and deep sequenced the viral genomes. We found a strong pattern of parallel evolution, where viral lineages from the same host were genetically more similar to each other than to lineages from other host species. When we compared viruses that had evolved in different host species, we found that parallel genetic changes were more likely to occur if the two host species were closely related. This suggests that when a virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species. This may explain in part why host shifts tend to occur between related species, and may mean that when a new pathogen appears in a given species, closely related species may become vulnerable to the new disease.","output":"Host shifts result in parallel genetic changes when viruses evolve in closely related species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Political scientists and sociologists have highlighted insecure work as a societal ill underlying individuals? lack of social solidarity (i.e., concern about the welfare of disadvantaged others) and political disruption. In order to provide the psychological underpinnings connecting perceptions of job insecurity with societally-relevant attitudes and behaviors, in this article the authors introduce the idea of perceived national job insecurity. Perceived national job insecurity reflects a person?s perception that job insecurity is more or less prevalent in their society (i.e., country). Across three countries (US, UK, Belgium), the study finds that higher perceptions of the prevalence of job insecurity in one?s country is associated with greater perceptions of government psychological contract breach and poorer perceptions of the government?s handling of the COVID-19 crisis, but at the same time is associated with greater social solidarity and compliance with COVID-19 social regulations.

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the existing research in the field of ethics education in accounting. To synthesize past research, a bibliometric analysis that references 134 primary studies is performed and three bibliometric methods are applied. First, we visualize the historical evolution of ethics education in accounting research through historiography. Second, we use bibliographic coupling to identify clusters of ethics education in accounting research before, during, and after major corporate scandals. Third, we perform a co-word analysis to connect the identified patterns into a map of a contextual space. The results reveal, in each decade, not only an increasing academic focus on this field of research, but also an increasing number of different research clusters. While the clusters Factors affecting moral judgement, Perception of ethics, and Lack of ethics topics in the last research period develop further from the respective clusters in the previous periods, Accounting beyond technical skills, Integration of ethics in accounting education, Use of developed ethics frameworks, and Professional values on the contrary develop anew in the last decade, as a consequence of a growing demand for teaching ethics.

We analyzed biosecurity and disinfection standards at the dental office and dental health personnel to date, and their adaptation to the needs and way of working of each. As a result, according to the information collected the following procedure was identified: a telephone appointment must be made and a questionnaire should be given before dental care; at arrival to the appointment, the temperature of the patient should be taken and proper cleaning and disinfection of the waiting room should be maintained. Panoramic radiography and CBCT are the auxiliary methods of choice. Absolute isolation and atraumatic restorative therapy techniques are a good alternative to decrease fluid exposure. The removal of protective clothing and accessories must follow a specific order and washing hands before and after is essential.

DESIGN: In this qualitative study, data were collected from semi-structured individual interviews and analysed by systematic text condensation. SETTING: A publicly owned virtual primary care clinic in Region V?stra G?taland, Sweden. SUBJECTS: Ten primary care physicians working at the clinic. RESULTS: Connecting with a patient over video could be either straightforward or deficient, depending on communication and the patients condition. Clinical experience, communication skills, and involving patients throughout the consultation and examination were crucial for assessments over video where patients were guided to perform self-examination. The flexibility of work and the regulated assignment online were positive for the physicians work situation and wellbeing. Providing video consultation within the same organisation as the patients regular health centre was considered to facilitate patient care and safety. Video consultation was considered suitable for some diagnoses and for some patients not able to reach a primary healthcare centre, though doubts were expressed about the healthcare and social benefits of this virtual care service. CONCLUSION: For the physicians, video consultation induced changes in the basis for assessment of primary care patients. The limitations on informational exchange demanded an extended form of patient involvement founded upon consultation skills, clinical experience and new skills for virtual examination. Combining virtual care with traditional general practice has the potential to reduce the workload for the individual physician and ensure medical competence in virtual primary care. Video consultation experienced suitable in some situations, but easy access to it expressed problematic in terms of medical prioritisation in healthcare. KEY POINTS: Video consultation is suitable for primary care visits for some patients, but physicians experiences of this are rarely studied. ; ?Clinical experience and consultation skills are important for video assessment of primary care patients which involves physician-guided patient self-examination. ?Video consultation facilitates care in some situations and could benefit from the provider being connected to patients regular health centre. ?Virtual care offers a flexible way of working but challenges healthcare prioritisation from the primary care physicians perspective.","output":"Physicians experiences of video consultation with patients at a public virtual primary care clinic: a qualitative interview study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this mixed-method study, we investigated the impact and design of a multiuser, virtual reality (VR) supported teaching simulation, in comparison with live classroom teaching simulation, on the participatory training of teaching and the teaching knowledge development of student instructors.

The study indicated that the VR simulation better promoted the lab-teaching knowledge development than the live simulation, whereas the latter better fostered class-teaching knowledge development. All participants reported higher teaching self-efficacy after the training. The qualitative data indicated that domain-specific challenges and authentic environmental prompting in the VR simulation fostered both experiential and vicarious learning of teaching.

This study assessed prevalence of, and antecedent factors and care access for the two common cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension and diabetes, to support health system improvements. METHODS: Data was from a population based nationally representative survey. Prevalence of hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure &#8805; 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &#8805; 90 mmHg or a self-reported diagnosis of hypertension; diabetes was defined as a fasting blood glucose &#8805;6.1 mmol/L or a self-reported diagnosis of diabetes. Care-cascades for hypertension and diabetes were created with four stages: being tested, diagnosed, treated, and achieving control. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate individual-level factors - including symptoms of mental illness - associated with having hypertension or diabetes, and with progressing through the hypertension care cascade. Whether people at overt increased risk of hypertension or diabetes (defined as > 50 years old, BMI > 30 kg/m2, or currently smoking) were more likely to be tested was assessed using chi squared. RESULTS: Prevalence of hypertension was 33.5% (CI 30.6-36.5). Older age (OR 7.7, CI 4.93-12.02), some education (OR 0.6, CI 0.44-0.89), obesity (OR 3.1, CI 2.12-4.44), and raised fasting blood glucose (OR 2.4, CI 2.38) were significantly independently associated with hypertension. Only 10.9% (CI 8.6-13.8) of the entire hypertensive population achieved blood pressure control, associated factors were being female (OR 4.8, CI 2.33-9.88), formally employed (OR 3.0, CI 1.26-7.17), and overweight (OR 2.5, CI 1.29-4.76). The prevalence of diabetes was 4.4% (CI 3.4-5.5), and associated with old age (OR 14.1, CI 6.05-32.65) and almost significantly with obesity (OR 2.1, CI 1.00-4.37). Only 11.9% (CI 6.6-20.6) of the diabetic population had achieved control. Individuals at overt increased risk were more likely to have been tested for hypertension (chi2 19.4) or diabetes (chi2 33.2) compared to the rest of the population.

These include growing experience with virtual teaching and virtual learning strategies; the invitation to codify best virtual teaching practices; a tightening of alignment between undergraduate and graduate medical education, e.g., around virtual interview strategies; and opportunities both for self-reflection and a commitment to act virtuously.

Methods: Patients with a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 and OD were prospectively recruited from March 22 to December 15, 2020 from 4 European hospitals. Patients had confirmed OD on psychophysical testing. All patients undertook OT, with add-on 10 days of OC (group 1: OC + OT), or 1 month of NC (group 2: NC + OT) or olfactory training alone (group 3: OT). Olfactory evaluations (SniffinSticks tests) were carried out at the time of inclusion, 1 and 2 months after the start of the therapeutic course. Results: A total of 152 hyposmic or anosmic patients completed the study. Group 1, 2 and 3 included 59, 22 and 71 patients, respectively and all patient groups were comparable regarding baseline SniffinSticks tests. The median SniffinSticks test values significantly improved from pre- to post-intervention in all groups. The increase of SniffinSticks test values was higher in group 1 (OC + OT) compared with groups 2 and 3 (p < 0.001) at one month after treatment but did not remain so at 2 months. Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, presented parosmia in 20/71 (28.2%), 9/22 (40.9%) and 42/71 (59.2%) patients. This difference was statistically significant between group 1 and 3 (p < 0.001). There were no patients with a worsening of the disease or an increase of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusions: The use of OCs in patients with OD related to mild COVID-19 is generally well-tolerated without any case of deterioration of symptoms. OC is associated with greater improvement in psychophysical olfactory evaluations at 1-month post-treatment but there was no difference at 2 months. Parosmia may be reduced following treatment with OC and NC. On the basis of these preliminary results, it is possible to state that considering the 2 months efficacy of OC and NC with respect to the OT alone and the risk-benefit ratio, the benefit to start a specific treatment of COVID-19 related OD cannot be demonstrated and there is a need for a randomised controlled trial to assess this further.","output":"Short-Term Efficacy and Safety of Oral and Nasal Corticosteroids in COVID-19 Patients with Olfactory Dysfunction: A European Multicenter Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Self-instigated isolation is heavily relied on to curb severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission.

Risk factors for NASH include a saturated fat diet, altered lipid metabolism, and genetic and epigenetic factors, including microRNAs. Serum levels of cholecystokinin (CCK) are elevated in mice and humans that consume a high-saturated fat diet. CCK receptors (CCK-Rs) have been reported on fibroblasts which when activated can induce fibrosis; however, their role in hepatic fibrosis remains unknown. We hypothesized that elevated levels of CCK acting on the CCK-Rs play a role in the development of NASH and in NASH-associated HCC. METHODS: We performed a NASH Prevention study and Reversal study in mice fed a saturated fat 75% choline-deficientCethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet for 12 or 18 weeks. In each study, half of the mice received untreated drinking water, while the other half received water supplemented with the CCK-R antagonist proglumide. CCK-R expression was evaluated in mouse liver and murine HCC cells. RESULTS: CCK receptor antagonist treatment not only prevented NASH but also reversed hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and steatosis and normalized hepatic transaminases after NASH was established. Thirty-five percent of the mice on the CDE diet developed HCC compared with none in the proglumide-treated group. We found that CCK-BR expression was markedly upregulated in mouse CDE liver and HCC cells compared with normal hepatic parenchymal cells, and this expression was epigenetically regulated by microRNA-148a.

Three independent GPs interpreted the vignettes to arrive at a Gold Standard consisting of 3 dispositions and divided into one of three categories of triage urgency: (1) emergency care required, (2) primary care required and (3) self-care. Main outcome measures Six professional non-medical and lay inputters simulated 2774 standardized patient evaluations using 3 online symptom checkers (OSC). We recorded when OSC provided a triage recommendation and whether it correctly recommended the appropriate triage recommendation across three categories of triage urgency (emergency care, primary care or self-care). We collected data on whether the solution appeared within the first 3 dispositions in each of the standards across 2774 standardized patient evaluations. Results When benchmarked against the Gold Standard, Healthily provided an appropriate triage recommendation 61.9% of the time compared to 45.3% and 42.4% of the time for Babylon and Ada respectively.

Patients were then clustered into groups based on BMI ranges. A multivariate logistic regression analysis compared the mortality rate among the BMI groups, before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: Overall, 179,288 patients were admitted to the medical wards and had a recorded BMI measurement. 149,098 were admitted before the COVID-19 pandemic and 30,190 during the pandemic. Pre-pandemic, multivariate analysis showed a J curve between BMI and mortality. Severe obesity (BMI > 40) had an aOR of 0.8 (95% CI:0.7C1.0, p = 0.018) compared to the normal BMI group. In contrast, during the pandemic, the analysis showed a U curve between BMI and mortality. Severe obesity had an aOR of 1.7 (95% CI:1.3C2.4, p < 0.001) compared to the normal BMI group. CONCLUSIONS: Medical ward patients with severe obesity have a lower risk for mortality compared to patients with normal BMI. However, this does not apply during COVID-19, where obesity was a leading risk factor for mortality in the medical wards. It is important for the internal medicine physician to understand the intricacies of the association between obesity and medical ward mortality.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the immediate impact of acute COVID-19 infection on maternal well-being and parenting practices among Brazilian families. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: We studied 2579 mothers (29913 observations) of young children from vulnerable neighborhoods in Boa Vista, Brazil over 12 months. METHODS: We monitored family health and caregiving behavior including the incidence of COVID-19 infections in the surveyed households through bi-weekly phone interviews over 50 weeks, from June 2020 to May 2021. Primary outcomes were home-based child stimulation, positive parenting behavior, and parenting stress. We used fixed effects panel regressions to estimate the impact of household COVID-19 infections on parenting outcomes. RESULTS: Over the study period, 441 participants (17.1%; 831 (3.0%) observations) reported at least 1 positive COVID-19 infection in their household. Household COVID-19 infections significantly reduced home-based stimulation by 0.10 SDs (95%CI: ?0.18, ?0.01), positive parenting behaviors by 0.14 SDs (?0.21, ?0.01), and increased parenting stress by 0.07 SDs (0.02, 0.12). The impact on home-based stimulation was most pronounced when the mother herself had a COVID-19 infection (?0.16; ?0.29, ?0.04). Parenting stress responded most strongly to mother or child COVID-19 infections. Effects were relatively short-lived, only children's infections' on parental stress was still detectable 2 weeks after initial infection. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that COVID-19 infections cause substantial disruptions in children's home environments - additional short-term support for families with acute infections could attenuate the negative impact on children's home environment during the pandemic.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on maternal health and child care behavior: Evidence from a quasi-experimental study of vulnerable communities in Boa Vista, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Treatment of dural arteriovenous fistula involving the transverse-sigmoid region with cortical reflux is complex and treatment options may require sacrifice of the fistulous segment of the sinus. OBJECTIVE To review our results in this subset of patients and describe current endovascular decision-making and approaches. METHODS We reviewed cases of endovascular sinus sacrifice for dural fistulas at our institution from 2007 to 2012. Demographic, decision-making, technical and outcome data were collected. RESULTS Seven patients were identified who underwent endovascular sinus sacrifice for treatment of dural fistula during this 4-year period. Determination of the fistulous sinus segment was based on the pattern of cortical drainage. Endovascular access to the sinus was achieved by transarterial, transvenous or via open surgery in one case. Complete cure of the target fistula was obtained in all cases. One patient had transient post-procedure headache. There were no hemorrhages, new neurological deficits or signs of increased intracranial pressure. Six of the seven patients had angiographic follow-up at least 6 months after treatment with no recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Fistulas of the transverse-sigmoid sinuses with cortical reflux may require sacrifice of the parent sinus for cure. Defining the fistulous segment and occluding this segment deliberately, completely and precisely is essential for cure. Several modalities and approaches can be used to achieve this. For properly selected patients, cure of the lesions can be achieved with this method with low risk of morbidity.","output":"Endovascular approach and technique for treatment of transverse-sigmoid dural arteriovenous fistula with cortical reflux: the importance of venous sinus sacrifice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this issue of JEM, Podstawka et al.

To do this, we used a survey data covering 122 micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and micro, small, and medium industry (MSMIs) in four communes in Benin. Firstly, we computed the annual rate change in quarterly turnover to capture the effect of the COVID-19. Secondly, a multiple regression was estimated to identify factors explaining the perceived effect of the COVID-19 on the exporting companies. We found that the exporting companies experience on average a 53.308% drop in quarterly turnover in 2020 probably due to the COVID-19 crisis. Based on the forecasts, the results also revealed a very slow recovery in activities but the rate of change will remain negative until 2021 if nothing is done to support the MSMEs/MSMIs. Finally, we found that the perceived effect of the COVID-19 depends on the level of education of head of the companies, on the experience in exportation, and on the organization of the work because of the pandemic.

Fault diagnosis is a method to ensure the safe operation of motor equipment. This research proposes an automatic fault diagnosis system combined with variational mode decomposition (VMD) and residual neural network 101 (ResNet101). This method unifies the pre-analysis, feature extraction, and health status recognition of motor fault signals under one framework to realize end-to-end intelligent fault diagnosis. Research data are used to compare the performance of the three models through a data set released by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). VMD is a non-recursive adaptive signal decomposition method that is suitable for processing the vibration signals of motor equipment under variable working conditions. Applied to bearing fault diagnosis, high-dimensional fault features are extracted. Deep learning shows an absolute advantage in the field of fault diagnosis with its powerful feature extraction capabilities. ResNet101 is used to build a model of motor fault diagnosis. The method of using ResNet101 for image feature learning can extract features for each image block of the image and give full play to the advantages of deep learning to obtain accurate results. Through the three links of signal acquisition, feature extraction, and fault identification and prediction, a mechanical intelligent fault diagnosis system is established to identify the healthy or faulty state of a motor. The experimental results show that this method can accurately identify six common motor faults, and the prediction accuracy rate is 94%. Thus, this work provides a more effective method for motor fault diagnosis that has a wide range of application prospects in fault diagnosis engineering.","output":"Application Combining VMD and ResNet101 in Intelligent Diagnosis of Motor Faults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY OBJECTIVES: African Americans have faced disproportionate socioeconomic and health consequences associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study examines employment and its association with sleep quality during the initial months of the pandemic in a low-income, predominantly African American adult sample. METHODS: In the early months of COVID-19 (March to May 2020), we administered a survey to an ongoing, longitudinal cohort of older adults to assess the impact of COVID-related changes in employment on self-reported sleep quality (N=460; 93.9% African American). Participants had prior sleep quality assessed in 2018 and a subset also had sleep quality assessed in 2013 and 2016. Primary analyses focused on the prevalence of poor sleep quality and changes in sleep quality between 2018 and 2020, according to employment status. Financial strain and prior income were assessed as moderators of the association between employment status and sleep quality. We plotted trend lines showing sleep quality from 2013 to 2020 in a subset (n=339) with all four waves of sleep data available. RESULTS: All participants experienced increases in poor sleep quality between 2018 and 2020, with no statistical differences between the employment groups. However, we found some evidence of moderation by financial strain and income. The trend analysis demonstrated increases in poor sleep quality primarily between 2018 and 2020.

METHODS A total of 94 patients scheduled for supratentorial craniotomy were enrolled. Patients received either lidocaine through an intravenous bolus (1.5 mg/kg) after induction followed by infusion at a rate of 2 mg/kg/h until the end of surgery or the same volume of normal saline. Mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and bispectral index were recorded at different intraoperative time points. Patients were assessed for pain in the postoperative anesthesia care unit (PACU) by the numeric rating scale (NRS). Other complications including hypertension, tachycardia, dysphoria, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) were reported. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the normal saline and lidocaine group for mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and bispectral index at any time point (P>0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of hypertension, tachycardia, dysphoria, and PONV between groups (P>0.05). The incidence of mild pain (NRS between 1 and 3) after surgery in PACU was lower in lidocaine group than that in the normal saline group (P=0.014); the number of patients with an NRS pain score of 0 before leaving the PACU was significantly greater in the lidocaine group.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between pulmonary function test parameters and laboratory parameters in COVID-19. METHOD: A total of 60 patients who were admitted to the chest diseases department and intensive care unit of our hospital and were diagnosed with COVID-19 by real-time PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs were evaluated. Pulmonary function tests and laboratory parameters at admission and on day 7 of treatment were analysed. RESULTS: On day 7 of treatment, white blood cell count, CRP, and fibrinogen level were significantly lower than at admission (P = .002, 0.001, and 0.001, respectively), while forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) values were significantly higher compared with admitting values (P = .001 for both). Correlation analysis showed that the decrease in CRP from admission to day 7 of treatment correlated with the increase in FEV1 (r = 0.616, P = .01) and FVC (r = 0.51, P = .01) during the same period. A decrease in the fibrinogen level was also correlated with an increase in FEV1 (r = 0.345, P = .01) and FVC (r = 0.357, P = .01).

Detecting mutations by specific RT-qPCR is a rapid and affordable alternative to sequencing. However, care must be taken to ensure that the techniques used are up-to-date and adapted to the variants circulating in the studied population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were screened for detection of mutations of the spike protein using the Novaplex? SARS-CoV-2 Variants I Assay from week 11 of 2021. Target sought were deletion H69/V70 and mutations N501Y and E484 K. From week 18 we used in addition the new Novaplex? SARS-CoV-2 Variants II Assay for samples with no targets found with the Variants I assay or with the mutation E484 K alone, in order to screen the mutations L452R, K417 N/T and W152C. RESULTS: Between weeks 11 and 25, 2239 positive samples out of 54317 were tested with the Variants I Assay. Between weeks 18 and 25, 94 samples met the criteria for being tested with the Variants II Assay. Of these, 47 had the L452R mutation without the W152C mutation, typical in the B.1.617 variant.

So far, CT has emerged as main stay of imaging whereas the local data on radiographic features of COVID-19 is sparse. METHODS: Prospective study includes 402 chest X rays (CXRs) of 105 patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19. The nature of abnormality, distribution and lung zone involvement was documented. Following British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI) guidelines, CXRs were grouped into classic/ probable COVID-19, indeterminate, non-COVID-19 and normal categories. The lung involvement was scored according to modified Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) scoring. The follow up radiographs were assessed for disease progression and improvement. RESULTS: Seventy-six males and 29 females with mean age of 50 years were included in our study. 47 out of 105 baseline radiographs were categorized as classic/ probable COVID-19, 26 as indeterminate, 7 as Non-COVID-19 and 25 as normal. 75 patients were positive and 30 were negative on RT-PCR testing. The sensitivity of CXR in diagnosing COVID-19 is 84%. The worsening radiographic features and higher RALE score correlates with longer hospital stay, ICU admissions and mortality.

OBJECTIVE This study examined the minimally invasive surgical trends, patient characteristics, and operative variables unique to patients undergoing hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery. DESIGN This was a retrospective medical chart review. SETTINGS The study was conducted in a tertiary care medical center. PATIENTS Patients included in the study were those who underwent pure laparoscopic colectomies, hand-assisted laparoscopic colectomies, and traditional open surgery for elective treatment of diverticular disease, colorectal cancer, IBD, and benign polyp disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcomes included patient characteristics and operative variables unique to patients undergoing hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery and documentation of operative technique trends within an experienced colorectal group. RESULTS Diverticular disease characteristics specific to hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery included the presence of dense inflammatory adhesions (p < 0.0001), diverticular fistulas (p < 0.0001), and unresolved phlegmon (p = 0.0003). Characteristics specific for colorectal cancer included intraoperative tumor bulk (p < 0.0001) and the inability to achieve appropriate surgical resection margins (p < 0.001). Similarly, variables identified for benign polyp disease included adhesions (p < 0.0001) and the ability to gain adequate exposure (p < 0.0001). Limited use of hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery was observed in patients with IBD. LIMITATIONS This was a retrospective, observational study from a single center. CONCLUSIONS Conversion to hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery provides benefit in surgical scenarios where dense inflammatory adhesions, diverticular fistulas, and intra-abdominal postdiverticulitis phlegmon are present. In addition, benefit is observed in patients with colorectal cancer where laparoscopic dissection of bulky tumor proves to be difficult and where the technical ability to obtain margins using pure laparoscopy is compromised.

To our knowledge, little is known about how these programs serve this vulnerable population outside the hospital setting. Objective: To assess the safety of a hotel-based isolation and quarantine (I/Q) care system and its association with inpatient hospital capacity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study of a hotel-based I/Q care system for homeless and unstably housed individuals in San Francisco, California, was conducted from March 19 to May 31, 2020. Individuals unable to safely isolate or quarantine at home with mild to moderate COVID-19, persons under investigation, or close contacts were referred from hospitals, outpatient settings, and public health surveillance to 5 I/Q hotels. Of 1009 I/Q hotel guests, 346 were transferred from a large county public hospital serving patients experiencing homelessness. Exposure: A physician-supervised team of nurses and health workers provided around-the-clock support, including symptom monitoring, wellness checks, meals, harm-reduction services, and medications for opioid use disorder. Main Outcomes and Measures: Characteristics of I/Q hotel guests, program retention, county hospital readmissions, and mean length of stay. Results: Overall, the 1009 I/Q hotel guests had a median age of 44 years (interquartile range, 33-55 years), 756 (75%) were men, 454 (45%) were Latinx, and 501 (50%) were persons experiencing sheltered (n = 295) or unsheltered (n = 206) homelessness. Overall, 463 (46%) received a diagnosis of COVID-19; 303 of 907 (33%) had comorbid medical disorders, 225 of 907 (25%) had comorbid mental health disorders, and 236 of 907 (26%) had comorbid substance use disorders. A total of 776 of 955 guests (81%) completed their I/Q hotel stay; factors most strongly associated with premature discontinuation were unsheltered homelessness (adjusted odds ratio, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.3-8.6; P < .001) and quarantine status (adjusted odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5-4.6; P = .001). In total, 346 of 549 patients (63%) were transferred from the county hospital; of 113 ineligible referrals, 48 patients (42%) had behavioral health needs exceeding I/Q hotel capabilities. Thirteen of the 346 patients transferred from the county hospital (4%) were readmitted for worsening COVID-19. Overall, direct transfers to I/Q hotels from emergency and outpatient departments were associated with averting many hospital admissions. There was a nonsignificant decrease in the mean hospital length of stay for inpatients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 from 5.5 to 2.7 days from March to May 2020 (P = .11). Conclusions and Relevance: To support persons experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic, San Francisco rapidly and safely scaled a hotel-based model of I/Q that was associated with reduced strain on inpatient capacity.

RESULTS: Primary viral pneumonia, and mixed viral and bacterial pneumonia, accounted for 90.3% and 9.7%, respectively, of COVID-19-associated CAP, with viral coinfection found in 30.5% of patients with primary viral pneumonia. Influenza virus was the most common (9.4%). Multivariable analysis showed coinfection not to be an independent factor of severity on admission, need for high-flow nasal cannula or invasive mandatory ventilation, and mortality. CONCLUSION: Viral coinfection was common in COVID-19-associated CAP. Severity on admission, need for high-flow oxygen therapy or invasive mandatory ventilation, and mortality were not affected by coinfection.","output":"Frequency and Significance of Coinfection in Patients with COVID-19 at Hospital Admission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microglia are the resident macrophage-like populations in the central nervous system (CNS). Microglia remain quiescent, unable to perform effector and antigen presentation (APC) functions until activated by injury or infection, and have been suggested to represent the first line of defence for the CNS. Previous studies demonstrated that microglia can be persistently infected by neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) which causes meningoencephalitis, myelitis with subsequent axonal loss, and demyelination and serve as a virus-induced model of human neurological disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Current studies revealed that MHV infection is associated with the pronounced activation of microglia during acute inflammation, as evidenced by characteristic changes in cellular morphology and increased expression of microglia-specific proteins, Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1), which is a macrophage/microglia-specific novel calcium-binding protein and involved in membrane ruffling and phagocytosis. During chronic inflammation (day 30 postinfection), microglia were still present within areas of demyelination. Experiments performed in ex vivo spinal cord slice culture and in vitro neonatal microglial culture confirmed direct microglial infection. Our results suggest that MHV can directly infect and activate microglia during acute inflammation, which in turn during chronic inflammation stage causes phagocytosis of myelin sheath leading to chronic inflammatory demyelination.","output":"Microglia Play a Major Role in Direct Viral-Induced Demyelination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), originated at Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019, threatening the world and becomes the public health crisis throughout the globe Due to changing data and behavior of the current epidemic, appropriate pharmacological techniques to cure are getting delayed day by day The estimated trends of the global and Indian region for COVID-19 epidemic were predicted for the next 21 days till 05/05/2020 on the data recorded till 14/04/2020 in the present work The main focus of the work was to estimate the trends of COVID-19 outbreak on population, especially the high-risk age group of elderly people (with age 50 years and greater) in the Republic of India It was observed that this identified age-group could be more prone to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and chances of death in this age group could be more The high-risk Indian states/regions were also identified throughout the nation and trends for infection, death, and cured cases were predicted for the next 21 days The outcome of the present work was presented in terms of suggestions that the proper social and medical care for the identified high-risk age group of elderly people of the Indian population should be required to prevent the COVID-19 community transmission The work also supported the extension in countrywide proper lockdown, mass testing, and also the strict rules to follow social distancing FAU - Singh, Harjit Pal","output":"Estimating the Impact of Covid-19 Outbreak on High-Risk Age Group Population in India.

Hence this research study seeks to identify critical factors influencing Indian people's attitudes and intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered to a sample (n = 254) drawn from Indian population, to assess the impact of perceived benefits, risk perceptions, social media exposure, social norms, and trust associated with Covid-19 vaccines on people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccines and their intentions to take up the Covid-19 vaccinations. RESULTS: The findings showed that the perceived benefits, social norms, and trust correlated significantly with people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccinations. In contrast, risk perceptions and social media exposure showed an insignificant influence on people's attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccinations. Social norms, trust, and people's attitudes towards the Covid-19 vaccinations are significantly correlated with their intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations. On the contrary, social media exposure was found to have an insignificant influence on people's intentions to take up Covid-19 vaccinations.

The expression of virulence factors contributes highly to the pathogenicity of C. albicans. These factors include biofilm formation, yeast-to-hyphal transition, adhesins, aspartyl proteases, and phospholipases secretion. Moreover, resistance development is a critical issue for the therapeutic failure of antifungal agents against systemic candidiasis. To circumvent resistance development, the present study investigated the virulence targeted therapeutic activity of the phyto-bioactive compound morin against C. albicans. Morin is a natural compound commonly found in medicinal plants and widely used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic products/industries. The present study explicated the significant inhibitory potential of morin against biofilm formation and other virulence factors production, such as yeast-hyphal formation, phospholipase, and exopolymeric substances, in C. albicans. Further, qPCR analysis confirmed the downregulation of biofilm and virlence-related genes in C. albicans upon morin treatment, which is in correspondence with the in vitro bioassays. Further, the docking analysis revealed that morin shows strong affinity with Hwp-1 protein, which regulates the expression of biofilm and hyphal formation in C. albicans and, thereby, abolishes fungal pathogenicity. Moreover, the anti-infective potential of morin against C. albicans-associated systemic candidiasis is confirmed through an in vivo approach using biomedical model organism zebrafish (Danio rerio). The outcomes of the in vivo study demonstrate that the morin treatment effectively rescues animals from C. albicans infections and extends their survival rate by inhibiting the internal colonization of C. albicans. Histopathology analysis revealed extensive candidiasis-related pathognomonic changes in the gills, intestine, and kidney of animals infected with C. albicans, while no extensive abnormalities were observed in morin-treated animals. The results evidenced that morin has the ability to protect against the pathognomonic effect and histopathological lesions caused by C. albicans infection in zebrafish. Thus, the present study suggests that the utilization of morin could act as a potent therapeutic medication for C. albicans instigated candidiasis.","output":"Inhibitory Effect of Morin Against Candida albicans Pathogenicity and Virulence Factor Production: An in vitro and in vivo Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The resection of nodules by thoracoscopic surgery is difficult because the nodules may be hard to identify.

The most severe presentations seem to be related with a delayed, deregulated immune response leading to exacerbated inflammation and organ damage with close similarities to sepsis. Methods: In order to improve the understanding on the relation between host immune response and disease course, we have studied the differences in the cellular (monocytes, CD8+ T and NK cells) and soluble (cytokines, chemokines and immunoregulatory ligands) immune response in blood between Healthy Donors (HD), COVID19 and a group of patients with non-COVID19 respiratory tract infections (NON-COV-RTI). In addition, the immune response profile has been analyzed in COVID19 patients according to disease severity. Results: In comparison to HDs and patients with NON-COV-RTI, COVID19 patients show a heterogeneous immune response with the presence of both activated and exhausted CD8+ T and NK cells characterised by the expression of the immune checkpoint LAG3 and the presence of the adaptive NK cell subset. An increased frequency of adaptive NK cells and a reduction of NK cells expressing the activating receptors NKp30 and NKp46 correlated with disease severity. Although both activated and exhausted NK cells expressing LAG3 were increased in moderate/severe cases, unsupervised cell clustering analyses revealed a more complex scenario with single NK cells expressing more than one immune checkpoint (PD1, TIM3 and/or LAG3). A general increased level of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was found in COVID19 patients, some of which like IL18, IL1RA, IL36B and IL31, IL2, IFN and TNF, CXCL10, CCL2 and CCL8 were able to differentiate between COVID19 and NON-COV-RTI and correlated with bad prognosis (IL2, TNF, IL1RA, CCL2, CXCL10 and CXCL9). Notably, we found that soluble NKG2D ligands from the MIC and ULBPs families were increased in COVID19 compared to NON-COV-RTI and correlated with disease severity. Conclusions: Our results provide a detailed comprehensive analysis of the presence of activated and exhausted CD8+T, NK and monocyte cell subsets as well as extracellular inflammatory factors beyond cytokines/chemokines, specifically associated to COVID19. Importantly, multivariate analysis including clinical, demographical and immunological experimental variables have allowed us to reveal specific immune signatures to i) differentiate COVID19 from other infections and ii) predict disease severity and the risk of death.","output":"Integrated analysis of circulating immune cellular and soluble mediators reveals specific COVID19 signatures at hospital admission with utility for prediction of clinical outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Little is known about peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) use, appropriateness and device outcomes in Brazil. METHODS We conducted an observational, prospective, cohort study spanning 16 Brazilian hospitals from October 2018 to August 2020. Patients 18 years receiving a PICC were included. PICC placement variables were abstracted from medical records. PICC-related major (deep vein thrombosis (DVT), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and catheter occlusion) and minor complications were collected. Appropriateness was evaluated using the Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters (MAGIC). Devices were considered inappropriate if they were in place for <5 days, were multi-lumen, and/or were placed in patients with a creatinine >2.0 mg/dL. PICCs considered appropriate met none of these criteria. Mixed-effects logistic regression models adjusting for patient-level and hospital-level characteristics assessed the association between appropriateness and major complications. RESULTS Data from 12 725 PICCs were included. Mean patient age was 66.419 years and 51.0% were female. The most common indications for PICCs were intravenous antibiotics (81.1%) and difficult access (62.7%). Most PICCs (72.2%) were placed under ultrasound guidance. The prevalence of complications was low: CLABSI (0.9%); catheter-related DVT (1.0%) and reversible occlusion (2.5%). Of the 12 725 devices included, a total of 7935 (62.3%) PICCs were inappropriate according to MAGIC. With respect to individual metrics for appropriateness, 17.0% were placed for <5 days, 60.8% were multi-lumen and 11.3% were in patients with creatinine >2.0 mg/dL. After adjusting for patient and hospital-level characteristics, multi-lumen PICCs considered inappropriate were associated with greater odds of major complications (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.61 to 4.02). CONCLUSIONS Use of PICCs in Brazilian hospitals appears to be safe and comparable with North America. However, opportunities to improve appropriateness remain.

In the wake of this pandemic are patients, family members, and various types of care providers, all of whom share different levels of moral distress. Moral conflict occurs in disputes when individuals or groups have differences over, or are unable to translate to each other, deeply held beliefs, knowledge, and values. Such conflicts can seriously affect healthcare providers and cause distress during disastrous situations such as pandemics when medical and human resources are stretched to the point of exhaustion. In the current pandemic, most hospitals and healthcare institutions in the United States have not allowed visitors to come to the hospitals to see their family or loved ones, even when the patient is dying. The moral conflict and moral distress (being constrained from doing what you think is right) among care providers when they see their patients dying alone can be unbearable and lead to ongoing grief and sadness. This paper will explore the concepts of moral distress and conflict among hospital staff and how a system-wide provider wellness programme can make a difference in healing and health.","output":"COVID-19, Moral Conflict, Distress, and Dying Alone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyze the opportunities for in-transit visualization to provide cost savings compared to in-line visualization.

We run two different visualization algorithms, one that is computation heavy and one that is communication heavy with concurrencies up to 32, 768 cores. Our primary results are in exploring the cost model within the context of our corpus. Our findings show that in-transit consistently achieves significant cost efficiencies by running visualization algorithms at lower concurrency, and that in many cases these efficiencies are enough to offset other costs (transfer, blocking, and additional nodes) to be cost effective overall. Finally, this work informs future studies, which can focus on choosing ideal configurations for in-transit processing that can consistently achieve cost efficiencies.","output":"Opportunities for Cost Savings with In-Transit Visualization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Violence against physicians is a global issue that causes impaired physical and mental health, declined work quality, resignations, and even suicides. Studies regarding violence against physicians are very limited. Therefore, our aim is to investigate the physical violence incidents against physicians presented in print media between 2008 and 2018. METHODS: A total of 8612 news reports acquired in national news database via 45 keywords were assessed. Five hundred and sixty-four of the reports met the inclusion criteria and were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Of 5964 news reports, 3754 (62.9%) were reprimands and protests against violence incidents. In 11 years, 560 individual incidents occurred where 647 physicians were physically assaulted, with 2267 news reports written on those incidents. The number of incidents increased over the years, and in 2012 both the number of incidents (n=91) and news reports count per incident were found highest. About 77.7% of assaulted physicians were male, and incident rate was higher in Western Turkey (42.15%). In 11 years, ten dedicated physicians have lost their lives in the line of duty. Emergency medicine (20.4%), primary care (9.89%) were the departments most exposed to physical violence. The claim of receiving inadequate medical attention was noted to be the primary allegation of the assailants. CONCLUSION: The frequency of physical violence incidents against physicians is increasing. Throughout the study period, news reports containing condemnations, critiques, and protests are also more frequently, yet not adequately, placed in print media. Thus, social and public awareness ought to be enhanced through national and global media outlets. Furthermore, extensive measures must be taken by governments in order to prevent and eliminate violence.","output":"Analysis of physical violence incidents against physicians in Turkey between 2008 and 2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study investigates insomnia among employees in occupations critical to the functioning of society (e.g health, education, welfare and emergency services) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these workers experience higher job pressure and increased risk of infection due to their work. It is crucial to investigate which factors that can contribute to insomnia in these important sectors. METHODS: Data was collected using an online survey administered in June 2020. The questionnaire measured demographic variables, sleep, stress, psychosocial factors and health concerns (i.e worrying about health consequences related to the pandemic). The sample in the present study consisted of 1327 (76% females) employees in organizations with societal critical functions. RESULTS: The employees reported higher levels of insomnia symptoms compared to normative data collected before the pandemic. Health concerns specifically related to COVID-19 had the strongest association to insomnia, followed by work stress. Job demands (i.e workload, time pressure and overtime) had merely a weak association to insomnia. CONCLUSION: Worrying about consequences the pandemic can have on your own health and the health of your family or colleagues have a stronger negative impact on sleep than work pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic. Impaired sleep can have detrimental effects on performance and health, and a stronger focus on preventing insomnia as a mean of sustaining critical societal functions both during and after the pandemic is warranted. Organizations should consider interventions aimed at reducing health concerns among their employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Insomnia among employees in occupations with critical societal functions during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Extract].

Here, we review the difficulties of inferring reliable phylogenies by example of a data snapshot comprising a quality-filtered subset of 8, 736 out of all 16, 453 virus sequences available on May 5, 2020 from gisaid.org. We find that it is difficult to infer a reliable phylogeny on these data due to the large number of sequences in conjunction with the low number of mutations. We further find that rooting the inferred phylogeny with some degree of confidence either via the bat and pangolin outgroups or by applying novel computational methods on the ingroup phylogeny does not appear to be credible. Finally, an automatic classification of the current sequences into sub-classes using the mPTP tool for molecular species delimitation is also, as might be expected, not possible, as the sequences are too closely related. We conclude that, although the application of phylogenetic methods to disentangle the evolution and spread of COVID-19 provides some insight, results of phylogenetic analyses, in particular those conducted under the default settings of current phylogenetic inference tools, as well as downstream analyses on the inferred phylogenies, should be considered and interpreted with extreme caution.","output":"Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data is difficult"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a congenital myopathy typically characterized by skeletal muscle weakness and the presence of abnormal thread- or rod-like structures (nemaline bodies) in myofibres.

Guided wound healing may be the only treatment possible. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is not recommended in these cases. The authors challenged these current recommendations and share their preliminary experience. METHOD: The authors adapted a NPWT protocol that uses low-vacuum continuous pressure (-80mmHg) with a silicone sheath and gauze/foam dressing between the wound bed and the device. They monitored the clinical features of patients' wounds to detect bleeding/ischaemia early on. Dressings were changed every 72-96 hours. RESULTS: This protocol was followed in five male patients (aged 23-68 years) with complex wounds over exposed vessels. Two cases were foot crush injuries, one midfoot amputation, one hand self-subamputation and one vascular bypass infection. Comorbidities included monoarterial limbs/stump, severe arteriopathy and psychiatric disorder. The exposed vessels were femoral, radial and ulnar, anterior and posterior tibial arteries and veins. Mean treatment lasted 37 days (range 20-61 days). No episodes of severe bleeding/ischaemia of the extremities were observed. Treatment was discontinued once debridement was complete and granulation tissue allowed spontaneous closure/grafting. All wounds appeared stable at 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: The low-vacuum NPWT protocol was successful in solving five difficult cases. This regimen reduces risks associated with NPWT use on wounds with exposed vessels. The authors believe further validation is required to strengthen the evidence. However, preliminary data are encouraging and might help to change future NPWT recommendations by extending the indications for its use to exposed vessels.","output":"Low-vacuum negative pressure wound therapy protocol for complex wounds with exposed vessels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) forced Spain to implement unprecedented lockdown restriction. In this context, different factors could worsen sleep quality, but the impact of the pandemic and lockdown on sleep is still mostly unknown. In this cross-sectional study, we describe self-reported sleep disturbances in people without mental health disorders from a large Spanish sample (n = 15,070).Methods: During the early phase of the lockdown (19-26 March), an online survey was launched using a snowball sampling method and included sociodemographic and clinical data along with the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES). Two items of the IES were employed to assess sleep characteristics. Descriptive and bivariate analysis and logistic regression models were performed.Results: Difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep were reported by 23.9% of the sample and was associated in the regression model with age (OR = 1.008, p = .003), female sex (OR = 1.344, p < .001), an income reduction >50% (OR = 1.248, p = .037), having one (OR = 1.208, p = .029) and two or more (OR = 1.299, p = .035) elderly dependents, drinking alcohol (OR = 1.129, p = .024), and a higher score on DASS-21 depression (OR = 1.148, p < .001), anxiety (OR = 1.218, p < .001), or stress (OR = 1.302, p < .001) subscales, whereas being able to enjoy free time (OR = 0.604, p < .001) and painting or listening to music (OR = 0.853, p = .012) were protective factors.

Many studies have documented the, mostly negative, effects of maternal ill-health on functioning. Although conceptually important, measurement of functioning remains underdeveloped, and the best way to measure functioning in pregnant and postpartum populations is unknown. METHODS: A cross-sectional study among women presenting for antenatal (N = 750) and postpartum (N = 740) care in Jamaica, Kenya and Malawi took place in 2015-2016. Functioning was measured through the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS-12). Data on health conditions and socio-demographic characteristics were collected through structured interview, medical record review, and clinical examination. This paper presents descriptive data on the distribution of functioning status among pregnant and postpartum women and examines the relationship between functioning and health conditions. RESULTS: Women attending antenatal care had a lower level of functioning than those attending postpartum care. Women with a health condition or associated demographic risk factor were more likely to have a lower level of functioning than those with no health condition. However, the absolute difference in functioning scores typically remained modest. CONCLUSIONS: Functioning is an important concept which integrates a woman-centered approach to examining how a health condition affects her life, and ultimately her return to functioning after delivery. However, the WHODAS-12 may not be the optimal tool for use in this population and additional components to capture pregnancy-specific issues may be needed. Challenges remain in how to integrate functioning outcomes into routine maternal healthcare at-scale and across diverse settings.","output":"Measurement of maternal functioning during pregnancy and postpartum: findings from the cross-sectional WHO pilot study in Jamaica, Kenya, and Malawi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Centre-based childcare may benefit pre-school children and alleviate inequalities in early childhood development, but evidence on socio-emotional and physical health outcomes is limited. Data were from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (n=14,376). Inverse-probability weighting was used to estimate confounder-adjusted population-average effects of centre and non-centre-based childcare (compared to parental care only) between ages 26-31 months on (age 3): internalising and externalising symptoms, pro-social behaviour, independence, emotional dysregulation, vocabulary, school readiness, and body mass index. To assess impacts on inequalities, controlled direct effects of low parental education and lone parenthood on all outcomes were estimated under two hypothetical scenarios: 1) universal take-up of centre-based childcare; and 2) parental care only. On average, non-centre based childcare improved vocabulary and centre-based care improved school readiness, with little evidence of other benefits. However, socio-economic inequalities were observed for all outcomes and were attenuated in scenario 1 (universal take-up). For example, inequalities in externalising symptoms (according to low parental education) were reduced from a confounder-adjusted standard deviation difference of 7.8 (95% confidence intervals: 6.7, 8.8), to 1.7 (0.6, 2.7). Inequalities by parental education in scenario 2 (parental care only) were wider than in scenario 1 for externalising symptoms (at 3.4 (2.4, 4.4)), and for emotional dysregulation and school readiness. Inequalities by lone parenthood, which were smaller, fell in scenario 1, and fell further in scenario 2. Universal access to centre-based pre-school care may alleviate inequalities, while restricted access (e.g. during lockdown for a pandemic such as Covid-19) may widen some inequalities in socioemotional and cognitive development.","output":"Pre-school childcare and inequalities in child development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transpedicular transdiscal screw fixation is an alternative technique used in lumbar spine fixation; however, it requires an accurate screw trajectory.

DESIGN Case report (Canadian Task Force classification III). SETTING Tertiary referral center in New Haven, Connecticut. INTERVENTIONS This is a step-by-step illustration for resection of a retroperitoneal para-aortic schwannoma and of an incidentally found Meckel diverticulum. The patient was a 39-year-old white woman diagnosed with stage IV choriocarcinoma with metastasis to the lungs and left para-aortic area. She received chemotherapy in the form of etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin-D, cyclophosphamide, oncovine (EMA-CO) and had an excellent clinical response with resolution of all metastatic disease except for the para-aortic mass. Therefore, she was taken to the operating room for laparoscopic resection of the persistent left para-aortic mass. After placement of four 5-mm abdominal ports, the pelvis and abdomen were explored and revealed an incidental Meckel diverticulum as well as the 5 cm left para-aortic mass. The peritoneum overlying the para-aortic mass was incised and the retroperitoneum explored. Given the proximity to the mass, left ureterolysis was performed. The retroperitoneal attachments were resected, and the left para-aortic mass was removed without any complications. At this point attention was turned to the Meckel diverticulum. In order not to extend the abdominal incisions, a posterior colpotomy was performed in the cul-de-sac equidistant from the uterosacral ligaments. Endo-GIA (Covidien, New Haven CT) was introduced through the 10-mm port site at the posterior colpotomy. Meckel diverticulum was resected without narrowing the lumen of the distal ileum. The specimen was removed in a contained manner through posterior colpotomy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The procedure was performed without any complications. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home on postoperative day 0. Pathology revealed a retroperitoneal schwannoma with negative margins and benign Meckel diverticulum without ectopic gastric or pancreatic tissue. The patient has been disease-free since the completion of surgery. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic resection of the retroperitoneal schwannoma and Meckel diverticulum were successfully performed in this patient with history of stage IV choriocarcinoma. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing a natural orifice-assisted laparoscopic approach for resection of Meckel diverticulum.

The objective of this study is to characterize the clinical dermatological manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection in cases with few or without general symptoms in patients from Latin America. METHODS: Cross-sectional study using a questionnaire that was made for health professionals (physicians with a specialty in dermatology) to investigate dermatological lesions associated with COVID-19 infection in patients from 25 countries of Latin America. The survey was active from June 9 to July 30, 2020. RESULTS: In this study, information was collected from a total of 347 patients. We found a female gender predominance: 179/347 (51.6%). The mean age at presentation was 40.87 years. The most frequent dermatological manifestations were maculopapular rash and urticarial lesions, followed by papulovesicular lesions, vesicular lesions, chilblain-like lesions, papular lesions, ecchymosis, petechial purpura, pityriasis rosea-like lesions, pruritus, palmoplantar dysesthesias, transient livedo, acral necrosis, palpable purpura, livedo racemosa, and retiform purpura.

SARS-CoV-2 infected millions of people in the world and immediately became a pandemic in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta-coronavirus genus of the large family of Coronaviridae. It is now known that its surface spike glycoprotein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which is expressed on the lung epithelial cells, mediates the fusion of the cellular and viral membranes, and facilitates the entry of viral genome to the host cell. Therefore, blocking the virus-cell interaction could be a potential target for the prevention of viral infection. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 is a protein-protein interaction, and so, analyzing the structure of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and its underlying mechanism to bind the host cell receptor would be useful for the management and treatment of COVID-19. In this study, we performed comparative in silico studies to deeply understand the structural and functional details of the interaction between the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and its cognate cellular receptor ACE2. According to our results, the affinity of the ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 was higher than SARS-CoV. According to the free energy decomposition of the spike glycoprotein-ACE2 complex, we found critical points in three areas which are responsible for the increased binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV. These mutations occurred at the receptor-binding domain of the spike glycoprotein that play an essential role in the increasing the affinity of coronavirus to ACE2. For instance, mutations Pro462Ala and Leu472Phe resulted in the altered binding energy from - 2 kcal mol-1 in SARS-COV to - 6 kcal mol-1 in SARS-COV-2. The results demonstrated that some mutations in the receptor-binding motif could be considered as a hot-point for designing potential drugs to inhibit the interaction between the spike glycoprotein and ACE2.","output":"In silico investigation of critical binding pattern in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background One of the proposed interventions for mitigating COVID-19 epidemics, particularly in low-income and crisis-affected settings, is to physically isolate individuals known to be at high risk of severe disease and death due to age or co-morbidities. This intervention, known as 'shielding', could be implemented in various ways. If shielded people are grouped together in residences and isolation is imperfect, any introduction of infections within the shielding group could cause substantial mortality and thus negate the intervention's benefits. We explored the effectiveness of shielding under various modalities of implementation and considered mitigation measures to reduce its possible harms. Methods We used an individual-based mathematical model to simulate the evolution of a COVID-19 epidemic in a population of which a fraction above a given age cut-off are relocated to shielding residences, in which they have variable levels of contacts with their original household, the outside world and fellow shielding residents. We set our simulation with the context of an internally displaced persons' camp in Somaliland, for which we had recently collected data on household demographics and social mixing patterns. We compared an unmitigated epidemic with a shielding intervention accompanied by various measures to reduce the risk of virus introduction and spread within the shielding residences. We did sensitivity analyses to explore parameters such as residence size, reduction in contacts, basic reproduction number, and prior immunity in the population. Results Shielded residences are likely to be breached with infection during the outbreak. Nonetheless, shielding can be effective in preventing COVID-19 infections in the shielded population. The effectiveness of shielding is mostly affected by the size of the shielded residence, and by the degree by which contacts between shielded and unshielded individuals are reduced. Reductions in contacts between shielded individuals could further increase the effectiveness of shielding, but is only effective in larger shielded residences. Large shielded residences increase the risk of infection, unless very large reductions in contacts can be achieved. In epidemics with a lower reproduction number, the effectiveness of shielding could be negative effectiveness. Discussion Shielding could be an effective method to protect the most at-risk individuals.

Therefore, this study explored the temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait using daily confirmed case data collected between the 23 February and 07 May 2020. METHODS: The pandemic progression was quantified using the time-dependent reproductive number (R(t)). The spatiotemporal scan statistic model was used to identify local clustering events. Variability in transmission dynamics was accounted for within and between two socioeconomic classes: citizens-residents and migrant workers. RESULTS: The pandemic size in Kuwait continues to grow (R(t)s &#8805;2), indicating significant ongoing spread. Significant spreading and clustering events were detected among migrant workers, due to their densely populated areas and poor living conditions. However, the government's aggressive intervention measures have substantially lowered pandemic growth in migrant worker areas. However, at a later stage of the study period, active spreading and clustering events among both socioeconomic classes were found.

The success of any disease programme is based on a functional laboratory network. Health laboratory services are an integral component of the health system. Efficiency and effectiveness of both clinical and public health functions including surveillance, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, research and health promotion are influenced by reliable laboratory services. The establishment of the African Regional polio laboratory for the Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI) has contributed in supporting countries in their efforts to strengthen laboratory capacity. On the eve of the closing of the program, we have shown through this article, examples of this contribution in two countries of the African region: C?te dIvoire and the Democratic Republic of Congo. METHODS: Descriptive studies were carried out in C?te dIvoire (RCI) and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) from October to December 2014. Questionnaires and self-administered and in-depth interviews and group discussions as well as records and observation were used to collect information during laboratory visits and assessments. RESULTS: The PEI financial support allows to maintain the majority of the 14 (DRC) and 12 (RCI) staff involved in the polio laboratory as full or in part time members. Through laboratory technical staff training supported by the PEI, skills and knowledge were gained to reinforce laboratories capacity and performance in quality laboratory functioning, processes and techniques such as cell culture. In the same way, infrastructure was improved and equipment provided. General laboratory quality standards, including the entire laboratory key elements was improved through the PEI accreditation process. CONCLUSION: The Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI) is a good example of contribution in strengthening public health laboratories systems in the African region. It has established strong Polio Laboratory network that contributed to the strengthening of capacities and its expansion to surveillance of other viral priority diseases such as measles, yellow fever, Influenza, MERS-CoV and Ebola. This could serve as lesson and good example of laboratory based surveillance to improving diseases prevention, detection and control in our middle and low income countries as WHO and partners are heading to polio eradication in the world.","output":"Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI) contribution in strengthening public health laboratories systems in the African region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In 2020, the US and New York City experienced unprecedented deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic and drug overdoses. Policy changes reduced burdensome regulations for medication treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). Despite these policy changes, few studies examined buprenorphine treatment outcomes during the pandemic. We compared treatment outcomes among Bronx patients referred to office-based buprenorphine treatment before versus during the pandemic. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, we compared patients referred to buprenorphine treatment in a Bronx community clinic before (MarchCAugust 2019) versus during (MarchCAugust 2020) the pandemic. We describe changes to buprenorphine treatment during the pandemic, including telehealth and prioritizing harm reduction. Using data from medical records and program logs, main outcomes included steps of the OUD treatment cascade of careinitial visit scheduled and completed, treatment initiated, and retained in treatment at 90 days. Using chi square and t-tests, we examined differences in patient characteristics and OUD treatment cascade steps before versus during the pandemic. RESULTS: Before and during the pandemic, 72 and 35 patients were referred to buprenorphine treatment, respectively. Patients' mean age was 46 years, most were male (67.3%) or Hispanic (52.3%), and few had private insurance (19.6%). Patients referred during (vs. before) the pandemic were more likely to have private insurance (31.4% vs. 13.9%, p < 0.05) and be referred from acute care settings (37.1% vs. 19.4%, p < 0.05). No significant differences in OUD cascade of care outcomes existed between those referred during versus before the pandemic. However, among patients who initiated buprenorphine treatment, those referred during (vs. before) the pandemic were more likely to be retained in treatment at 90 days (68.0% vs. 42.9%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the COVID-19 pandemic's unprecedented devastation to the Bronx, along with worsening drug overdose deaths, OUD cascade of care outcomes were similar among patients referred to buprenorphine treatment before versus during the pandemic. Among patients who initiated buprenorphine treatment, treatment retention was better during (versus before) the pandemic. During a public health emergency, incorporating telehealth and prioritizing harm reduction are key strategies to maintain optimal OUD treatment outcomes.","output":"A comparison of office-based buprenorphine treatment outcomes in Bronx community clinics before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine changes in patients perspectives and outlooks regarding the disease and their health after hospitalization for COVID-19 and investigate their discrimination and harassment experiences.

Data were collected from 1870 volunteer study abroad students in Taiwan. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that when controlling for the effects of age, gender, duration of stay, student status (short-term exchange or degree-seeking), and internet use motives (online benefits, habits, and facilitation), the personality trait neuroticism consistently showed significant relationships with the various study abroad difficulties. Moreover, moderation analyses revealed that all the personality traits except conscientiousness showed significant interactions with internet use, while simple slope comparisons showed significant differences between the high personality traits and their lower counterparts.

Although multiple diagnostic methods utilize nasopharyngeal specimens, saliva specimens represent an attractive alternative as they can rapidly and safely be collected from different populations. While saliva has been described as an acceptable clinical matrix for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, evaluations of analytic performance across platforms for this specimen type are limited. Here, we used a novel sensitive RT-PCR/MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry-based assay (Agena MassARRAY?) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva specimens. The platform demonstrated high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when compared to matched patient upper respiratory specimens. We also evaluated the analytical sensitivity of the platform and determined the limit of detection of the assay to be 1562.5 copies/ml. Furthermore, across the five individual target components of this assay, there was a range in analytic sensitivities for each target with the N2 target being the most sensitive. Overall, this system also demonstrated comparable performance when compared to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva by the cobas? 6800/8800 SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR Test (Roche). Together, we demonstrate that saliva represents an appropriate matrix for SARS-CoV-2 detection on the novel Agena system as well as on a conventional real-time RT-PCR assay.

The primary aim of this phase IB study was to determine the safety profile of Allocetra?-OTS (early apoptotic cell) infusion in subjects presenting to the emergency room with sepsis. The secondary aims were to measure organ dysfunction, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays, and mortality. Exploratory endpoints included measuring immune modulator agents to elucidate the mechanism of action. METHODS: Ten patients presenting to the emergency room at the Hadassah Medical Center with sepsis were enrolled in this phase Ib clinical study. Enrolled patients were males and females aged 51C83 years, who had a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score 2 above baseline and were septic due to presumed infection. Allocetra?-OTS was administered as a single dose (day +1) or in two doses of 14010(6) cells/kg on (day +1 and +3), following initiation of standard-of-care (SOC) treatment for septic patients. Safety was evaluated by serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs). Organ dysfunction, ICU and hospital stays, and mortality, were compared to historical controls. Immune modulator agents were measured using Luminex(?) multiplex analysis. RESULTS: All 10 patients had mild-to-moderate sepsis with SOFA scores ranging from 2C6 upon entering the study. No SAEs and no related AEs were reported. All 10 study subjects survived, while matched historical controls had a mortality rate of 27%. The study subjects exhibited rapid resolution of organ dysfunction and had significantly shorter ICU stays compared to matched historical controls (p<0.0001). All patients had both elevated pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and additional immune modulators that gradually decreased following treatment.

RESULTS CCaV-120 compared with a 3:1 C:V ratio resulted in a change during 5-min of CPR in HR 49 versus 40 bpm (p = 0.01), and MAP 1.7 versus -2.8 mmHg (p = 0.03); fatigue rated on a Likert scale 12.9 versus 11.4 (p = 0.2); and a significant decay in CC depth after 90 s (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS The results indicate a trend toward more fatigue during simulated CPR in CCaV-120 compared to the recommended 3:1 C:V CPR. These results support current guidelines.","output":"Rescuers' physical fatigue with different chest compression to ventilation methods during simulated infant cardiopulmonary resuscitation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious new worldwide public health crisis with significant morbidity and mortality, effective therapeutic treatments are urgently needed. Drug repurposing is an efficient and cost-effective strategy with minimum risk for identifying novel potential treatment options by repositioning therapies that were previously approved for other clinical outcomes. Here, we used an integrated network-based pharmacologic and transcriptomic approach to screen drug candidates novel for COVID-19 treatment. Network-based proximity scores were calculated to identify the drugCdisease pharmacological effect between drugCtarget relationship modules and COVID-19 related genes. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was then performed to determine whether drug candidates influence the expression of COVID-19 related genes and examine the sensitivity of the repurposing drug treatment to peripheral immune cell types. Moreover, we used the complementary exposure model to recommend potential synergistic drug combinations. We identified 18 individual drug candidates including nicardipine, orantinib, tipifarnib and promethazine which have not previously been proposed as possible treatments for COVID-19. Additionally, 30 synergistic drug pairs were ultimately recommended including fostamatinib plus tretinoin and orantinib plus valproic acid. Differential expression genes of most repurposing drugs were enriched significantly in B cells.

To evaluate our initial experience, patients treated with SILS cholecystectomy were compared with a comparable group of patients treated with a conventional four trocart technique (LC). METHODS Between May 2009 and April 2010, 60 SILS cholecystectomies were performed. These patients were matched by Body Mass Index (BMI) with 60 cases of conventional LC. RESULTS The operative time was significantly longer in the SILS group 55 min (range, 25-126 min) compared to 49 min (range, 28-75 min) for the LC group. Excluding the first 15 SILS cases the operative time became comparable to the conventional technique, with a mean operative time of 51 min (range, 25-90 min). No patients were converted to open cholecystectomy. In the SILS group 3 patients developed a wound infection, in the conventional LC group 2.

In contrast, biologic scaffold materials composed of resorbable non-cross-linked extracellular matrix (ECM) have been used for tissue reconstruction of multiple organs and are replaced by host tissue. Preparation of whole organ ECM by decellularization through vascular perfusion can maintain much of the native three-dimensional (3D) structure, strength, and tissue-specific composition. A 3D cardiac ECM (C-ECM) biologic scaffold material would logically have structural and functional advantages over materials such as Dacron? for myocardial repair, but the in vivo remodeling characteristics of C-ECM have not been investigated to date. METHODS AND RESULTS A porcine C-ECM patch or Dacron patch was used to reconstruct a full-thickness right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) defect in a rat model with end points of structural remodeling function at 16 weeks. The Dacron patch was encapsulated by dense fibrous tissue and showed little cellular infiltration. Echocardiographic analysis showed that the right ventricle of the hearts patched with Dacron were dilated at 16 weeks compared to presurgery baseline values. The C-ECM patch remodeled into dense, cellular connective tissue with scattered small islands of cardiomyocytes. The hearts patched with C-ECM showed no difference in the size or function of the ventricles as compared to baseline values at both 4 and 16 weeks.

Despite global investment in HIV service delivery and the parallel challenge of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), there are few examples of integrated programs addressing both HIV and NCDs through differentiated service delivery. In 2014, the National Department of Health (NDoH) of South Africa launched the Central Chronic Medicines Dispensing and Distribution (CCMDD) program to provide patients who have chronic diseases, including HIV, with alternative access to medications via community-based pick-up points. This study describes the expansion of CCMDD toward national scale. METHODS: Yale monitors CCMDD expansion as part of its mixed methods evaluation of Project Last Mile, a national technical support partner for CCMDD since 2016. From March 2016 through October 2019, cumulative weekly data on CCMDD uptake [patients enrolled, facilities registered, pick-up points contracted], type of medication provided [ART only; NCD only; and ART-NCD] and collection sites preferred by patients [external pick-up points; adherence/outreach clubs; or facility-based fast lanes], were extracted for descriptive, longitudinal analysis. RESULTS: As of October 2019, 3,436 health facilities were registered with CCMDD across 46 health districts (88 % of South Africas districts), and 2,037 external pick-up points had been contracted by the NDoH. A total of 2,069,039 patients were actively serviced through CCMDD, a significant increase since 2018 (p < 0.001), including 76 % collecting ART [64 % ART only, 12 % ART plus NCD/comorbidities] and 479,120 [24 %] collecting medications for chronic diseases only. Further, 734,005 (35 %) of patients were collecting from contracted, external pick-up points, a 73 % increase in patient volume from 2018. DISCUSSION: This longitudinal description of CCMDD provides an example of growth of a national differentiated service delivery model that integrates management of HIV and noncommunicable diseases. This study demonstrates the success of the program in engaging patients irrespective of their chronic condition, which bodes well for the potential of the program to address the rising burden of both HIV and NCDs in South Africa. CONCLUSIONS: The CCMDD program expansion signals the potential for a differentiated service delivery strategy in resource-limited settings that can be agnostic of the patients chronic disease condition.","output":"Title: Expansion of a national differentiated service delivery model to support people living with HIV and other chronic conditions in South Africa: a descriptive analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a deadly and highly infectious disease caused by SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV).

Here, we determined if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion in a retrospective observational study of a diverse cohort of health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: We assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and collected medical questionnaires, including BCG vaccination status and pre-existing demographic and clinical characteristics, from an observational cohort of HCWs in a multi-site Los Angeles healthcare organization. We used multi-variate analysis to estimate if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion. RESULTS: Of the 6,201 HCWs, 29.6% reported a history of BCG vaccination whereas 68.9% did not receive BCG vaccination. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG as well as incidence of self-reported clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 were significantly decreased among HCWs with a history of BCG vaccination compared to those without BCG vaccination. After adjusting for age and sex, we found that history of BCG vaccination, but not meningococcal, pneumococcal or influenza vaccination, was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion.

METHODS: This study enrolled 115 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and 435 non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients (training dataset, n = 379; validation dataset, n = 131; testing dataset, n = 40). Key radiomics features extracted from chest CT images were selected to build a radiomics signature using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Clinical and clinico-radiomics combined models were constructed. The combined model was further validated in the viral pneumonia cohort, and compared with performance of two radiologists using CO-RADS. The diagnostic performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) analysis, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Eight radiomics features and 5 clinical variables were selected to construct the combined radiomics model, which outperformed the clinical model in diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia with an area under the ROC (AUC) of 0.98 and good calibration in the validation cohort. The combined model also performed better in distinguishing COVID-19 from other viral pneumonia with an AUC of 0.93 compared with 0.75 (P = 0.03) for clinical model, and 0.69 (P = 0.008) or 0.82 (P = 0.15) for two trained radiologists using CO-RADS.

Methods: A total of 17 COVID-19 patients aged between 0 and 17 years old were recruited at the Paediatric Hospital of La Paz University Hospital (Madrid, Spain). A complete ophthalmological examination was performed in all patients. Results: Of 17 patients, 50% had a known COVID-19 previous exposure. PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs was positive in 35.29%, whereas IgM and/or IgG serology tests were positive in 81%. Clinical manifestations were: 6 COVID-19associated Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome (PIMS), 7 pneumonias and 2 cutaneous purpura and/or chilblains. Ocular findings were ocular hyperaemia (5 patients), as bilateral acute conjunctivitis (3 patients) or unilateral episcleritis (2 patients). Mean best corrected visual acuity was 1/1 in all tested cases. Only one patient, presenting unilateral optic neuritis, had visual symptoms as unilateral inferior temporal quadrantanopsy. Retinal involvement was found in one patient, where ocular fundus exam showed unilateral retinal vasculitis. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 infection could produce ocular pathology in children, frequently presented weeks after the acute phase of the disease.

Such apps keep track of proximity contacts and warn contacts of persons who tested positive for an infection. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we analyzed potential barriers to the large-scale adoption of the official contact tracing app that was introduced in Germany on June 16, 2020. METHODS: Survey data were collected from 3276 adults during the week the app was introduced using an offline-recruited, probability-based online panel of the general adult population in Germany. RESULTS: We estimate that 81% of the population aged 18 to 77 years possess the devices and ability to install the official app and that 35% are also willing to install and use it. Potential spreaders show high access to devices required to install the app (92%) and high ability to install the app (91%) but low willingness (31%) to correctly adopt the app, whereas for vulnerable groups, the main barrier is access (62%). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest a pessimistic view on the effectiveness of app-based contact tracing to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. We recommend targeting information campaigns at groups with a high potential to spread the virus but who are unwilling to install and correctly use the app, in particular men and those aged between 30 and 59 years. In addition, vulnerable groups, in particular older individuals and those in lower-income households, may be provided with equipment and support to overcome their barriers to app adoption.","output":"Barriers to the Large-Scale Adoption of a COVID-19 Contact Tracing App in Germany: Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International Guidelines have voted for PCR as the Gold Standard in COVID diagnosis.

This treatment is offered to more than 70% of patients who are on the waiting list for liver transplantation in the United States. HCC typically receives its blood supply from the hepatic artery; however, it can recruit a parasitic supply from extrahepatic collateral (EHC) arteries. The development of an EHC arterial blood supply can interfere with the therapeutic efficacy of TACE and result in treatment failure and poor outcome. Cross-sectional imaging-specifically computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging-has some limitations in depicting the presence or absence of an EHC arterial supply during the pre-TACE evaluation. Catheterization and angiography of every possible EHC artery during a routine TACE procedure would be time consuming and technically challenging and would not always be feasible. Therefore, the prediction of a potential EHC arterial supply on the basis of tumor location before, during, and after TACE is fundamental to achieving optimal therapeutic efficacy. To perform TACE through EHC arteries, special considerations are necessary to avoid potentially serious complications. The authors review the factors influencing the development of an EHC arterial blood supply to HCC and describe a systematic approach to enhance the ability to predict the presence of EHC arteries. They also describe the proper technique for TACE of each EHC artery and how to avoid potential technique-related complications. ?RSNA, 2017.","output":"Chemoembolization of Hepatocellular Carcinoma with Extrahepatic Collateral Blood Supply: Anatomic and Technical Considerations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the high coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality, this disease may be a life-threatening event, especially for individuals at high risk of complications.

The influence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) medication and IBD itself on COVID-19 is controversial. Additionally, IBD focused guidance is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To determine COVID-19 prevalence/exposure, perception and information sources, medication compliance, patient behaviour and physician contact among patients with IBD compared with non-IBD controls. METHODS: A cross-sectional anonymous survey of patients with IBD (N=415) at one university IBD clinic and one gastroenterology practice, matched 4:1 with control participants (N=116), was performed. RESULTS: Patients with IBD had high fear of infection. The fear was more pronounced in patients taking immunosuppressants and it extended to hospitals, private practices and public places, such as supermarkets. IBD patients reported leaving their homes less frequently than their peers without IBD. A total of 90% of patients with IBD reported washing their hands more frequently. Patients taking immunosuppressants were concerned about interactions between medication and COVID-19, whereas patients taking 5-aminosalicylates were not. Nonetheless, 96.4% of patients adhered to continuing their medication. Patients sought guidance primarily from television and internet news sites. Video consultations were found to be a suitable solution for a subset of patients who are young, have a high level of fear and leave their home less frequently than their peers, whereas overall acceptance of video consultations was limited.

METHODS: The life expectancy, cases, and death numbers of COVID-19 until 30th April 2021 were retrieved from open data to derive the epidemiological profiles and DALYs (including years of life lost (YLL) and years loss due to disability (YLD)) by four periods. The VSL estimates were estimated by using hedonic wage method (HWM) and contingent valuation method (CVM). The estimate of willingness to pay using CVM was based on the meta-regression mixed model. Machine learning method was used for classification. RESULTS: Globally, DALYs (in thousands) due to COVID-19 was tallied as 31,930 from Period I to IV. YLL dominated over YLD. The estimates of VSL were US$591 billion and US$5135 billion based on HWM and CVM, respectively. The estimate of VSL increased from US$579 billion in Period I to US$2160 billion in Period IV using CVM. The higher the human development index (HDI), the higher the value of DALYs and VSL.

Globally, a number of studies were conducted to estimate the average serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19. Combining findings of existing studies that estimate the average serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19 significantly improves the quality of evidence. Hence, this study aimed to determine the overall average serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19. METHODS: We followed the PRISMA checklist to present this study. A comprehensive search strategy was carried out from international electronic databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library) by two experienced reviewers (MAA and DBK) authors between the 1st of June and the 31st of July 2020. All observational studies either reporting the serial interval or incubation period in persons diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed using the I(2) and Higgins test. The NOS adapted for cross-sectional studies was used to evaluate the quality of studies. A random effect Meta-analysis was employed to determine the pooled estimate with 95% (CI). Microsoft Excel was used for data extraction and R software was used for analysis. RESULTS: We combined a total of 23 studies to estimate the overall mean serial interval of COVID-19. The mean serial interval of COVID-19 ranged from 4. 2 to 7.5 days. Our meta-analysis showed that the weighted pooled mean serial interval of COVID-19 was 5.2 (95%CI: 4.9C5.5) days. Additionally, to pool the mean incubation period of COVID-19, we included 14 articles. The mean incubation period of COVID-19 also ranged from 4.8 to 9 days. Accordingly, the weighted pooled mean incubation period of COVID-19 was 6.5 (95%CI: 5.9C7.1) days. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the weighted pooled mean serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19 were 5.2, and 6.5 days, respectively. In this study, the average serial interval of COVID-19 is shorter than the average incubation period, which suggests that substantial numbers of COVID-19 cases will be attributed to presymptomatic transmission.

Detailed analysis reveals that Arg298 serves as a key component for maintaining dimerization, and consequently, its mutation will trigger a cooperative switch from a dimer to a monomer. The monomeric enzyme is irreversibly inactivated because its catalytic machinery is frozen in the collapsed state, characteristic of the formation of a short 3(10)-helix from an active-site loop.

Bariatric surgery is playing an increasing role in pediatric surgery. However, current evidence is limited regarding its safety and outcome. METHODS Since 2005, data from obese patients that undergo bariatric procedures in Germany are prospectively registered. For the current analysis, all adolescent and adult subjects that had undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) from 2005 to 2014 were considered. RESULTS LSG represents the most common bariatric procedure in Germany with a proportion of 48.1% in adolescent and 48.7% in adult obese in 2014. LSG was performed in 362 adolescent and 15,428 adult subjects. Pre-operative BMI was comparable between the two populations. However, adult obese had more frequently coexisting comorbidities (p < 0.01). Complication rates and mortality (0 vs. 0.2%) did not differ significantly. Adolescents achieved a BMI reduction of 16.8 and 18.0 kg/m2 at 12 and 24 months compared with 15.4 and 16.6 kg/m2 in the adult group. There was a significantly higher BMI reduction in late adolescents (19-21 years) compared with patients 18 years at 24 months (19.8 vs. 13.6 kg/m2).

In Greece, there is no available research on how open ward environments are perceived and experienced by mental health professionals. The aim of the present study was to illuminate nurses' experiences of working in a public psychiatric hospital which traditionally operates with open doors. Eleven nursing care providers were interviewed, and thematic analysis was employed to explore their experiences of working in locked psychiatric acute care units. Participants described nursing care in units with an open door policy as \\"acceptance,\\" \\"availability of staff,\\" \\"real respect for the person,\\" \\"ensuring patients' rights,\\" \\"listening to the person,\\" and \\"negotiation and not imposition.\\" Trust in therapeutic relationships was perceived as greatly dependent on the trust being given to patients indirectly by the open door policy. Being trusted enhanced patients' self-determination and self-confidence leading to their empowerment. Containment of an acute mental health crisis took place through medication and meaningful discussions with patients and significant others rather than locking the door of the unit. Overall, meaningful care led to professional emancipation, but compassion fatigue narratives emphasized the need for continuous education, support and clinical supervision as necessary support for mental health nurses in a system of mental health provision often reduced to the point of crisis.","output":"Nurses' Experiences of Psychiatric Care in Acute Care Units with an Open Door Policy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corneal dystrophies (CDs) represent a heterogenous group of genetic diseases (Lisch and Weiss, 2019). The International Committee of Classification of Corneal Dystrophies (IC3D) distinguishes between 22 distinct forms of corneal dystrophy (CD) which are predominantly autosomal dominant, although autosomal recessive and X-chromosomal dominant and recessive patterns do exist (Weiss et al, 2018). A detailed corneal examination of as many affected family members as possible can show the phenotypic differences of the various generations. There are few publications which describe the different CDs with regard to the early and late phenotypes. According to early and late phenotype, three types of CD are generally classified: (1) Thirteen CDs with early and late clinical landmarks. However, it must be pointed out that the different penetrances of the gene often leads to quantitative differences in the corneal phenotype in peers in distinct generations of the same family. (2) Seven CDs with late onset and very little progression of the corneal changes. (3) Two CDs with congenital haze which can be interpreted as the final phenotype of this dystrophy.

We report on the particular challenges mathematics lecturers perceive there to be around teaching mathematics remotely, as well as any advantages or disadvantages of teaching mathematics online that they report. Over 90% of respondents had little or no prior experience teaching mathematics online, and, initially, 72% found it stressful and 88% thought it time-consuming. 88% felt there was a difference between teaching mathematics in this way compared with other disciplines. Four main types of challenges were associated with emergency remote teaching of mathematics: technical challenges;student challenges;teaching challenges;and the nature of mathematics. Respondents identified flexibility as the main advantage of online teaching, with lack of interaction featuring strongly as a disadvantage. We also consider respondents personal circumstances during this time, in terms of working conditions and caring responsibilities and conclude by summarizing the impact they perceive this experience may have upon their future teaching.

The Receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein causes invasion of the virus into the host cell by attaching with human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (hACE-2), which leads to further infection. Objective: The novel N-(2-aminophenyl)-2,3-diphenylquinoxaline-6-sulfonamide derivatives were designed and synthesized to inhibit the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by applying molecular docking tools. Methods: The synthesized products were characterized by Infrared Spectroscopy (IR) and1 H Nu-clear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Results: All the derivatives were found to have a very good binding affinity between-9 to-10.1 kcal/mol, better than the drugs which are under investigation for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in-fection. Compound F1 formed 4 hydrogen bonds whereas, F4 and F10 formed two hydrogen bonds each with RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. All the derivatives were subjected to antimicro-bial, antifungal, and antimalarial susceptibility. Conclusion: From the above-obtained results, we have concluded that novel N-(2-aminophenyl)-2,3-diphenylquinoxaline-6-sulfonamide derivatives have excellent potential to inhibit the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which is now an attentive target in designing SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.

Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using cancer patients medical records at Asir Central Hospital in the southern region of Saudi Arabia. Active patients records were extracted between January 2013 and December 2019. Results: A total of 2038 patients were identified during the study period, with a mean age of 60.9 (SD: 19.0) years. The patients had survived with their cancer for a median duration of 4 years (IQR: 2C6). Around 4.6% of the patients required ICU admission with a median period of 9 days (IQR: 5C14.75). The death rate during the study period was 10.9%. Around 20.8% of the cases were metastatic, of which 77.8% were at stage four of metastasis, and 19.7% of the patients were receiving chemotherapy for their disease. The most common types of cancer were malignant neoplasms of digestive organs, comprising 40.8% of the sample. Older age (60 years and above) and using specific chronic disease medications were predictors associated with a higher risk of death due to cancer (p < 0.05). Smoking history, using specific chronic disease medications, and having previous surgery were predictors associated with a higher risk of ICU admission (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Breast, colon, and liver cancers were the most prevalent in the southern region of Saudi Arabia. Several modifiable cancer risk factors were identified.

We sought to determine how work and mental health for healthcare workers changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in a universal healthcare system, stratified by gender factors. DESIGN: A mixed-methods study was employed. Phase 1 was an anonymous, internet-based survey (7 MayC15 July 2020). Phase 2 was semistructured interviews offered to all respondents upon survey completion to describe how experiences may have differed by gender identity, roles and relations. SETTING: National universal healthcare system (Canada). PARTICIPANTS: 2058 Canadian healthcare worker survey respondents (87% women, 11% men, 1% transgender or Two-Spirit), including 783 health professionals, 673 allied health professionals, 557 health support staff. Of the 63 unique healthcare worker types reported, registered nurses (11.5%), physicians (9.9%) and pharmacists (4.5%) were most common. Forty-six healthcare workers were interviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reported pandemic-induced changes to occupational leadership roles and responsibilities, household and caregiving responsibilities, and anxiety levels by gender identity. RESULTS: Men (19.8%) were more likely to hold pandemic leadership roles compared with women (13.4%). Women (57.5%) were more likely to report increased domestic responsibilities than men (45%). Women and those with dependents under the age of 10 years reported the greatest levels of anxiety during the pandemic. Interviews with healthcare workers further revealed a perceived imbalance in leadership opportunities based on gender identity, a lack of workplace supports disproportionately affecting women and an increase in domestic responsibilities influenced by gender roles.

In Alberta, Canada, two novel approaches were created in Spring 2020 to remotely support patients with complex neurological conditions and rehabilitation needs. The first approach is a telehealth service that provides wayfinding and self-management advice to Albertans with physical concerns related to existing neurological or musculoskeletal conditions or post-COVID-19 recovery needs. The second approach is a webinar series aimed at supporting self-management and social connectedness of individuals living with spinal cord injury. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to evaluate the short- and long-term impacts and sustainability of two virtual modalities (telehealth initiative called Rehabilitation Advice Line [RAL] and webinar series called Alberta Spinal Cord Injury Community Interactive Learning Seminars [AB-SCILS]) aimed at advancing self-management, connectedness, and rehabilitation needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. METHODS: We will use a mixed-methods evaluation approach. Evaluation of the approaches will include one-on-one semistructured interviews and surveys. The evaluation of the telehealth initiative will include secondary data analyses and analysis of call data using artificial intelligence. The evaluation of the webinar series will include analysis of poll questions collected during the webinars and YouTube analytics data. RESULTS: The proposed study describes unique pandemic virtual modalities and our approaches to evaluating them to ensure effectiveness and sustainability. Implementing and evaluating these virtual modalities synchronously allows for the building of knowledge on the complementarity of these methods. At the time of submission, we have completed qualitative and quantitative data collection for the telehealth evaluation.

Most previous pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies on hydroxychloroquine were conducted on healthy volunteers or patients receiving long-term therapy. There are no studies on the elimination of hydroxychloroquine after short-term treatments. Hydroxychloroquine is known to have a pro-arrhythmic effect through QT interval prolongation, but data in this setting are not conclusive. Our aims were to estimate the time needed for hydroxychloroquine concentrations (C(HCQ)) to drop to a safe concentration (500 ng/mL) after a short-term therapeutic cycle and to correlate the corrected QT interval with C(HCQ). METHODS: We collected blood samples and electrocardiograms of patients who underwent short-term therapy with hydroxychloroquine during drug intake and after discontinuation. Hydroxychloroquine concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatographyCtandem mass spectrometry and analysed with a linear regression model to estimate the elimination time of the drug after its discontinuation. We conducted a multivariate analysis of the corrected QT interval correlation with C(HCQ). RESULTS: Our data suggest that short-term hydroxychloroquine courses can generate significant C(HCQ) persisting above 500 ng/mL up to 16 days after discontinuation of treatment. Corrected QT interval prolongation significantly correlates with C(HCQ). CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms the long half-life of hydroxychloroquine and its effect on the corrected QT interval even after short-term courses of the drug. This can inform the clinician using hydroxychloroquine treatments that it would be safer to start or re-initiate treatments with corrected QT interval-prolonging potential 16 days after hydroxychloroquine discontinuation.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine Blood Concentrations Can Be Clinically Relevant Also After Drug Discontinuation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To characterize pulmonary edema (PE) fluid induced by enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection, elucidate the relationship between angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and PE, and explore the pathogenesis of PE.

The Ang-2 level in the PE group (2819.2  908.7 pg/ml) was higher than those in both the non-PE and the control groups (both, P < 0.001). Serum samples from the PE group had damaged cell junctions of confluent HPMEC monolayers that were reversed by Ang-1. CONCLUSIONS: The PE fluid of infants with EV71-induced PE was protein-rich, and elevated Ang-2 expression was associated with PE. The mechanism through which PE develops may be related to Ang-2-induced cell junction damage.","output":"Association Between Angiopoietin-2 and Enterovirus 71 Induced Pulmonary Edema"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 global pandemic presents a major challenge and unprecedented pressures on health systems.

Although he managed to survive, he still has difficulty in ambulation and daily living activities. Given the continuing high prevalence of COVID-19, many patients would need immobilization and ICU treatment. Therefore, causes of HO should be scrutinized, physicians and caregivers need to raise vigilance, and comprehensive protective measures should be put in place. On the other hand, as HO is used to be diagnosed quite frequently in the patients with neurological diseases, diagnosis of HO in the COVID-19 patients should not automatically be linked to the stay in the ICU. Yet, it is a fact that impaired immune response is prevalent both in COVID-19 and HO.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic led to dramatic changes in the delivery of outpatient care. It is unclear whether increased use of telehealth affected outcomes for outpatients with heart failure. METHODS: In March 2020, a large Midwestern health care system, encompassing 16 cardiology clinics, 16 emergency departments, and 12 hospitals, initiated a telehealth-based model for outpatient care in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. A propensity-matched analysis was performed to compare outcomes between outpatients seen in-person in 2018 and 2019 and via telemedicine in 2020. RESULTS: Among 8,263 unique patients with heart failure with 15,421 clinic visits seen from March 15 to June 15, telehealth was employed in 88.5% of 2020 visits but in none in 2018 or 2019. Despite the pandemic, more outpatients were seen in 2020 (n = 5,224) versus 2018 and 2019 (n = 5,099 per year). Using propensity matching, 4,541 telehealth visits in 2020 were compared with 4,541 in-person visits in 2018 and 2019, and groups were well matched. Mortality was similar for telehealth and in-person visits at both 30 days (0.8% vs 0.7%) and 90 days (2.9% vs 2.4%). Likewise, there was no excess in hospital encounters or need for intensive care with telehealth visits. CONCLUSIONS: A telehealth model for outpatients with heart failure allowed for distanced encounters without increases in subsequent acute care or mortality. As the pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic abate, these data suggest that telehealth outpatient visits in patients with heart failure can be safely incorporated into clinical practice.","output":"Outpatient Management of Heart Failure During the COVID-19 Pandemic After Adoption of a Telehealth Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since it was first recognized in December 2019, it has resulted in the ongoing worldwide pandemic. Although acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the main features of the disease, the involvement of other organs needs to be explored. There has been a growing concern regarding the association between acute kidney injury (AKI) and poor outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Based on current observational data, AKI is the 2nd most common cause of morbidity and mortality behind ARDS in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor has been shown to be the cornerstone of SARS-CoV-2 infection and possibly plays a significant role in the occurrence of renal injury. The pathogenesis of AKI is likely multifactorial that involves not only direct viral invasion but also dysregulated immune response in the form of cytokine storm, ischemia to kidneys, hypercoagulable state, and rhabdomyolysis, among others. We performed a literature search of the Pubmed and Google Scholar database from 1996 to 2020 using the following keywords: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, and acute kidney injury to find the most pertinent and highest-quality of evidence.

In this study, we infer a dated phylogeny for the species of the Sphaenorhynchini and we reconstructed the biogeographic history describing the diversification chronology, and possible patterns of dispersion and vicariance, providing information about how orogeny, forest dynamics and allopatric speciation affected their evolution in South America. We provided a dated phylogeny and biogeography study for the Sphaenorhynchini tribe using mitochondrial and nuclear genes. We analyzed 41 samples to estimate the ancestral areas using biogeographical analysis based on the estimated divergence times and the current geographical ranges of the species of Sphaenorhynchini. We recovered three characteristic clades that we recognize as groups of species (S. lacteus, S. planicola, and S. platycephalus groups), with S. carneus and G. pauloalvini being the sister taxa of all other species from the tribe. We found that the diversification of the tribe lineages coincided with the main climatic and geological factors that shaped the Neotropical landscape during the Cenozoic. The most recent common ancestor of the Sphaenorhynchini species emerged in the North of the Atlantic Forest and migrated to the Amazonia in different dispersion events that occurred during the connections between these ecoregions. This is the first large-scale study to include an almost complete calibrated phylogeny of Sphaenorhynchini, presenting important information about the evolution and diversification of the tribe.

Indeed, in such a way they put into practice and exercise a procedure before performing it live, reducing the learning curve in a safe environment and the risks for the patients. Really, up to now it is not clear if the nonuse of the cadavers for anatomical education and surgical training can have also forensic implications. A substantial literature research was used for this review, based on PubMed and Web of Science database. From this review, it is clear that the cadaveric training could be considered mandatory, both for surgeons and for medical students, leading to a series of questions with forensic implications. Indeed, there are many evidences that a cadaver lab can improve the learning curve of a surgeon, above all in the first part of the curve, in which frequent and severe complications are possible. Consequently, a medical responsibility for residents and surgeons which perform a procedure without adequate training could be advised, but also for hospital, that has to guarantee a sufficient training for its surgeons and other specialists through cadaver labs. Surely, this type of training could help to improve the practical skills of surgeons working in small hospitals, where some procedures are rare. Cadaver studies can permit a better evaluation of safety and efficacy of new surgical devices by surgeons, avoiding using patients as ?guinea pigs?. Indeed, a legal responsibility for a surgeon and other specialists could exist in the use of a new device without an apparent regulatory oversight. For a good medical practice, the surgeons should communicate to the patient the unsure procedural risks, making sure the patients' full understanding about the novelty of the procedure and that they have used this technique on few, if any, patients before.

There is a need for novel, effective, and accessible vaccines and antivirals capable of inhibiting flavivirus infection and ameliorating disease. The development of therapeutics targeting viral entry has long been a goal of antiviral research, but most efforts are hindered by the lack of broad-spectrum potency or toxicities associated with on-target effects, since many host proteins necessary for viral entry are also essential for host cell biology. Mosquito-borne flaviviruses generally enter cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), and recent studies suggest that a subset of these viruses can be internalized through a specialized form of CME that has additional dependencies distinct from canonical CME pathways, and antivirals targeting this pathway have been discovered.

Solar energy is today the most suitable renewable energy source for Taiwan. However, land prices and policies, and challenges of scale still hinder its development. In this context, identifying optimal sites for solar photovoltaic (PV) construction is a crucial task for major energy stakeholders. In this paper, a two-stage approach, combining the data envelopment analysis (DEA) models and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), has been done for the first time to identify the most suitable locations among 20 potential cities and counties of Taiwan for constructing solar PV farms. DEA models were applied to filter out the areas with the most potential by measuring their efficiency indices with temperature, wind speed, humidity, precipitation, and air pressure, as inputs, and sunshine hours and insolation, as outputs. The locations with perfect efficiency scores were then ranked with the AHP method. Five selected evaluation criteria (site characteristics, technical, economic, social, and environmental) and sub-criteria of each were utilized to prioritize the locations with solar energy potential. AHP was used to determine the relative weights of the criteria and sub-criteria and the final weights of the areas. For criteria weighting results, 'support mechanisms,' 'electric power transmission cost,' and 'electricity consumption demand' with weights of 0.332, 0.122, and 0.086, respectively, were found as the most significant sub-criteria.

Many doctors and nurses, were infected and lost their life by COVID-19 around the world. Therefore COVID-19 brought unbearable psychological pressure on doctors, and nurses. The objective of this study is to find the prevalence of anxiety among medical doctors and nurses. METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study of 101 doctors and nurses carried out in a tertiary care center. Convenience sampling was done with the study period from April to May 2020. Ethical approval was taken from the institutional review board of NAMS (IRB reference no. 1076). The collected data stored and analyzed with statistical software (SPSS version 26.0). Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data. RESULTS: Out of 101 participants prevalence of anxiety was found to be 74 (73.3%) (64.68-81.33 at 95% Confidence Interval). Among them, 9 (8.9%) of participants experienced sever types of generalized anxiety disorder, 23 (22.8%) moderate, and 42 (41.6%) mild type. Similarly, 18 (17.8%) and 10 (9.9%) of participants felt very difficult and extreme difficulty at the workplace and home respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The mental health of medical doctors and nurses is significantly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of Clostridium difficile infection in patients with COVID-19pneumonia Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted on PCR Covid-19 positive patients admitted in the ICU from September,2020 to 30th April 2021. All patients in the cohort study were on mechanical ventilation, or at some point during their ICU admission required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-onset (HO-CDI), defined as a positive C. difficile test over 3 days after admission. Results Overall, during the study period, a total of 240 PCR Covid-19 patients were admitted to the ICU;of these, 11 (4.5%) were COVID-19 CDI positive. Nine were males (81%). The mean hospital stay for these COVID-19 patients was 12 days (range 1C59 days). HO-CDI median day of identification was 12 days. All patients received 2 antibiotics and dexamethasone at admission. Compared to historical controls, COVID-19 patients did not have a higher overall CDI positive rate. However, mortality among COVID-19 HO-CDI patients was increased 7/11 (63%). Conclusion Whether COVID-19 itself increases an individuals risk for CDI remains unclear. Multiple contributing factors drive CDI incidence, severity, and recurrence. Although protective measures such as gowns and gloves during COVID-19 increased, CDI cases in the hospital setting should continue to emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship.

Evidence suggests that mental health care providers and recipients prefer a combination of digital and traditional elements within psychotherapy treatment formats, also called blended care (BC), over standalone digital formats. We examined the attitudes and preferences of licensed psychotherapists in Germany regarding such BC applications. METHODS: We fielded a survey among psychotherapists, including questions about attitudes, previous experiences, and expectations regarding BC, as well as a discrete choice experiment. Attributes for the experiment were developed using a stepwise qualitative approach. A Bayesian D-efficient design was used to generate the choice tasks. The choice data were analyzed by applying mixed logit models. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 200 psychotherapists. Attitudes towards BC were mainly positive, with strong reported intentions to use BC formats. In the choice experiment, recommendation from a professional society for a BC online component was the most important characteristic. Greater effectiveness and a larger share of face-to-face vs. online time were also desired features, while a financial incentive to use BC was less relevant.

In light of the current discussion on the role of ablative therapy, the aim of this study is to compare patients who undergo hepatic resection to those treated with radiofrequency ablation. METHODS The procedures have been conducted in two institutes following the same methodologies. Ninety-six patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis, single or multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and a diameter less than or equal to 3 cm, have been included in this retrospective study: 52 patients have been treated by surgical resection and 44 by radiofrequency ablation. Patient characteristics, survival and disease-free survival have all been analysed. RESULTS Disease-free survival was longer in the resection group in comparison to the radiofrequency group with a median disease-free time of 48 versus 34 months, respectively (P = 0.04, hazard ratio = 1.5, 95 % confidence interval = 0.9-2.5). In the resection group, median survival was 54 months with a survival rate at 1, 3 and 5 years of 100, 98 and 46.2 %. In the radiofrequency group, median survival was 40 months with 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rate of 95.5, 68.2 and 36.4 %. CONCLUSION The current study shows that for small HCC in the presence of compensated cirrhosis, surgical resection gives better results than radiofrequency, both in terms of overall survival, as well as disease-free survival.

Social media platforms such as Facebook are a promising avenue to reach the broader public and enhance access to clinical and translational science, and require further evaluation from the scientific community. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the use of live community events to enhance communication about clinical and health research through a Facebook platform case study (Minnesota [MN] Research Link) with a Minnesota statewide community. We examined variables associated with video engagement including video length and type of posting. METHODS: From June 2019 to February 2021, MN Research Link streamed 38 live community events on its public Facebook page, MN Research Link. Live community events highlighted different investigators clinical and health research in the areas of mental health, health and wellness, chronic diseases, and immunology/infectious diseases. Facebook analytics were used to determine the number of views, total minutes viewed, engagement metrics, and audience retention. An engagement rate was calculated by the total number of interactions (likes, shares, and comments) divided by the total length of the live event by the type of live community event. RESULTS: The 38 live community events averaged 23 minutes and 1 second in duration. The total time viewed for all 38 videos was 10 hours, 44 minutes, and 40 seconds. Viewers watch time averaged 23 seconds of content per video. After adjusting for video length, promotional videos and research presentations had the highest engagement and retention rates. Events that included audience participation did not have higher retention rates compared to events without audience participation. CONCLUSIONS: The use of live community events showed adequate levels of engagement from participants. A view time of 23 seconds on average per video suggests that short informational videos engage viewers of clinical and translational science content. Live community events on Facebook can be an effective method of advancing health promotion and clinical and translational science content; however, certain types of events have more impact on engagement than others.","output":"Use of Live Community Events on Facebook to Share Health and Clinical Research Information With a Minnesota Statewide Community: Exploratory Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The definition of chronic pain after inguinal hernioplasty and the methods of its assessment vary a great deal, which make it complicated to conduct meta-analyses. The primary aim of the present prospective study was to evaluate at which pain severity degree the quality-of-life scores will be reduced. METHOD A prospective study of patients operated for inguinal hernia was conducted. A pain questionnaire and a quality-of-life (QoL) questionnaire were completed. RESULTS Altogether, 370 patients were investigated and included in analysis. Of them, 33.8% experienced pain during different activities. Compared to the non-pain response group, significantly lower QoL scores for the Bodily pain domain were reported by patients who gave 1, 2, or 3 positive responses to the pain questionnaire. Patients with no pain as well as patients who gave 1 positive response to the pain questionnaire and whose VAS score was 20 had similar QoL scores for all domains. Patients who gave 1 positive response to the pain questionnaire and whose VAS score was >20, and patients who gave two or more positive responses to the pain questionnaire, showed significantly lower QoL scores in most of the domains compared with the non-pain group. When the patients who gave 1 positive response to the pain questionnaire and whose VAS score was 20 were excluded from the group of patients with pain, the rate of chronic pain was 19.7%. Considering the above result, the reduction in the rate of chronic pain from 33.8 to 19.7% was statistically significant. CONCLUSION Pain scores 20 mm or less on the VAS (0 to 100 mm) have no impact on the patients' quality of life.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Insulin resistance was induced in rats with a fructose-rich diet and confirmed from baseline analysis of FBS (>250 mg/dl), insulin (>25 IU/ml), and HOMA-IR (>10). For 12 weeks, the insulin-resistant rats were treated exclusively with 5000 mg/kg b.w avicularin (DAvi) or by dietary placement on lettuce (DLet) or a combination of both and compared with non-insulin resistant rats. RESULTS: Avicularin reversed alterations in HbA1c and insulin levels. DLet produced no significant effect on the incretins GLP 1 (P=0.909) and GIP (P=0.990), but DAvi slightly stimulated GLP 1 but not GIP. A strong positive correlation was found between improved -cell responsiveness and the insulin signaling molecules: Akt2 (r=0.7248), IRS 1 (r=0.5173), and PI3K (r=0.7892). Only the combined avicularin and lettuce reversed the Akt2 levels (P=0.728). The lettuce meal slightly stimulated PI3K but normalized IRS 1 while avicularin treatment slightly stimulated IRS 1 but restored the PI3K levels (P=0.815). The positive correlation between -cell responsiveness and hexokinase (r=0.5959), PFK (r=0.6222), and PK (r=0.6591) activities were statistically significant.

Patients underwent Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RS-RARP). The primary objective was to describe the RS-RARP step-by-step surgical technique using the Revo-i. In addition, the safety of the Revo-i was assessed according to intra-operative and the postoperative complications within 30 days of surgery. Early oncological outcomes were also assessed according to surgical margin status and biochemical recurrence (BCR). Continence was defined as use of no or only one pad. Surgeons' satisfaction with the Revo-i was assessed using the Likert scale. RESULTS All surgeries were completed successfully, with no conversion to open or laparoscopic surgery. The median patient age was 72 years. The median docking time, console time, urethrovesical anastomosis time and estimated blood loss were 8 min, 92 min, 26 min and 200 mL, respectively. One patient was transfused intra-operatively as a result of blood loss of 1 500 mL. Postoperatively, two patients received blood transfusion, and there were no other serious/major complications. The median hospital stay was 4 days. At 3 months, four patients had positive surgical margins, one patient had BCR, and 15 patients were continent. Most of surgeons were satisfied with the Revo-i performance.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 10 CIC-dependent children were included in the mass spectrometry analysis (UTI = 5, UTC = 5). Quantitative profiling of urine proteins with isobaric protein labeling was performed using tandem mass spectrometry. Candidate markers were normalized using a collective mixture of proteins from all samples. Relative quantitative abundance of proteins across all samples were compared. Proteins with >50% change in the average abundance were identified as proteins of interest, which were then measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in an additional 40 samples (no growth = 10, UTC = 15, UTI = 15). RESULTS: Mass spectrometry revealed 8 differentially expressed proteins. Of these, apolipoprotein D, alpha-amylase 2B, non-secretory ribonuclease, CD44 antigen, and prosaposin were measurable by ELISA.

These findings may reflect the differences in the severity of disease required for women to present and be admitted to Malawian hospitals, limited access to intensive care and the pandemics disruption to the health system. SUMMARY BOXO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABSO_LIIn pregnant and recently pregnant women, COVID-19 is associated with increased complications such as admission to an intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, and maternal death. C_LIO_LIIn pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19, the current global estimate of all-cause mortality is 0.02%. C_LIO_LIMost countries in Africa rely on paper-based systems to collect key maternal health indicators such as maternal deaths and severe morbidity, which does not enable timely actions. C_LI What are the new findings?O_LIMaternal mortality and adverse perinatal outcomes are alarmingly high in a cohort of pregnant and recently pregnant women admitted to Malawian healthcare facilities located in a low-income country in Africa. C_LIO_LIA national facility-based maternal surveillance platform can be implemented during a pandemic and provide real-time data to aid policymakers in understanding its impacts on this key population. C_LI What do the new findings imply?O_LIIn low-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, pregnant and recently pregnant women with COVID-19 admitted to hospital require enhanced care and a renewed focus on their needs to avert these adverse health outcomes. C_LIO_LIGlobal and national surveillance systems must specifically record outcomes for pregnant, recently pregnant women and their infants to understand the impact of public health emergencies on these groups, as they may be disproportionately affected and may require special considerations.

This was tragically highlighted during the international outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 with attack rates of more than 50% in HCW. The purpose of this article is to review common airborne and droplet-transmitted bacterial and viral respiratory tract infections with regard to their impact on health care workers. Lessons need to be learned from the SARS epidemic. The three main strategies to prevent or control occupationally acquired infections are relatively simple and cost-effective-droplet and contact precautions and for some pathogens also vaccination. Enforced implementation of stringent droplet precautions during the SARS crisis should be maintained; and this will most likely have a major additional impact on other nosocomial infections. Employee health services should proactively and creatively devise delivery systems that enhance compliance with vaccination programs for all health care workers. Hospital surveillance should be expanded to all respiratory diseases to facilitate early detection of nosocomial outbreaks, and this should also include surveillance of all HCW. Integrated syndromic and virological surveillance systems set up during the SARS epidemic will also further our understanding of other respiratory infections in the hospital setting. Even if pursuing early diagnosis for unspecific respiratory illnesses is expensive, identification of the causative organism may reduce unnecessary isolation, contact tracing and anxiety, in particular during an outbreak situation. We have a duty to protect our health care workers.","output":"Risk of respiratory infections in health care workers: lessons on infection control emerge from the SARS outbreak."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The search for successful therapies of infections with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing. We tested inhibition of host cell nucleotide synthesis as a promising strategy to decrease the replication of SARS-CoV-2-RNA, thus diminishing the formation of virus progeny. Methotrexate (MTX) is an established drug for cancer therapy and to induce immunosuppression. The drug inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and other enzymes required for the synthesis of nucleotides. Strikingly, the replication of SARS-CoV-2 was inhibited by MTX in therapeutic concentrations around 1 M, leading to more than 1000-fold reductions in virus progeny in Vero C1008 (Vero E6) as well as Calu-3 cells. Virus replication was more sensitive to equivalent concentrations of MTX than of the established antiviral agent remdesivir. MTX strongly diminished the synthesis of viral structural proteins and the amount of released virus RNA. Virus replication and protein synthesis were rescued by folinic acid (leucovorin) and also by inosine, indicating that purine depletion is the principal mechanism that allows MTX to reduce virus RNA synthesis. The combination of MTX with remdesivir led to synergistic impairment of virus replication, even at 300 nM MTX. The use of MTX in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections still awaits further evaluation regarding toxicity and efficacy in infected organisms, rather than cultured cells. Within the frame of these caveats, however, our results raise the perspective of a two-fold benefit from repurposing MTX for treating COVID-19. Firstly, its previously known ability to reduce aberrant inflammatory responses might dampen respiratory distress. In addition, its direct antiviral activity described here would limit the dissemination of the virus. SIGNIFICANCE MTX is one of the earliest cancer drugs to be developed, giving rise to seven decades of clinical experience. It is on the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines, can be administered orally or parenterally, and its costs are at single digit  or $ amounts/day for standard treatment. In case of its successful further preclinical evaluation for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections, its repurposing to treat COVID-19 would thus be feasible, especially under low-resource conditions. Additional drugs exist to interfere with the synthesis of nucleotides, e.g. additional folate antagonists, inhibitors of GMP synthetase, or inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). Such inhibitors have been approved as drugs for different purposes and might represent further therapeutic options against infections with SARS-CoV-2 Remdesivir is currently the most established drug for treating COVID-19. Our results argue that MTX and remdesivir, even at moderate concentrations, can act in a synergistic fashion to repress virus replication to a considerably greater extent than either drug alone. COVID-19, in its severe forms, is characterized by pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and additional organ involvements. These manifestations are not necessarily a direct consequence of virus replication and cytopathic effects, but rather a result of an uncontrolled inflammatory and immune response. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids are thus being evaluated for treating COVID-19. However, this bears the risk of re-activating virus spread by suppressing a sufficient and specific immune response. In this situation, it is tempting to speculate that MTX might suppress both excessive inflammation as well as virus replication at the same time, thus limiting both the pathogenesis of pneumonia and also the spread of virus within a patient.","output":"The folate antagonist methotrexate diminishes replication of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and enhances the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir in cell culture models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is creating severe issues for healthcare and broad social structures, exposing societal vulnerabilities. Among the populations affected by COVID-19 are people engaged in substance use, such as people who smoke; vape (e-cigarette use); use opioids, cannabis, alcohol, or psychoactive prescription drugs; or have a substance use disorder (SUD). Monitoring substance use and SUD during the pandemic is essential, as people who engage in substance use or present with SUD are at greater risk for COVID-19, and the economic and social changes resulting from the pandemic may aggravate SUD. There have been several reviews focused on COVID-19 in relation to substance use and SUD. Reviews generally did not consider on a large range of substance use variants or SUDs. We plan a scoping review that seeks to fill gaps in our current understanding of substance use and SUD, in the COVID-19 era. METHODS: A scoping review focused on substance use and SUD, in relation to COVID-19, will be conducted. We will search (from January 2020 onwards) Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Africa-Wide Information, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Global Health, WHO Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease Database, WHO Global Index Medicus, PsycINFO, PubMed, Middle Eastern Central Asian Studies, CINAHL Complete, and Sociological Abstracts. Grey literature will be identified using Disaster Lit, Google Scholar, HSRProj, governmental websites, and clinical trials registries (e.g., ClinicalTrial.gov, World Health Organization, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and International Standard Randomized Con-trolled Trial Number registry). Study selection will conform to Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewers Manual 2015 Methodology for JBI Scoping Reviews. Only English language, original studies investigating substance use and SUD, in relation to COVID-19 in all populations and settings, will be considered for inclusion. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. A narrative summary of findings will be conducted. Data analysis will involve quantitative (e.g., frequencies) and qualitative (e.g., content and thematic analysis) methods. DISCUSSION: Original research is urgently needed to mitigate the risks of COVID-19 on substance use and SUD. The planned scoping review will help to address this gap.

Statistical analysis: Chi-squared test; Anova one way F test; Pearsons R coefficient. RESULTS: Correlations: CBI-total and NPI(p < .001); CBI-totalECOG (p = .042); CBI-totalBDI(p< .001); CBI- total-SASB-Cl7(p = .014); SASB-CL8(p<0.000); BDI and SASB-Cl 2 (p = .018), SASB-Cl 3 (p = .004), SASB-Cl7(p < .000), SASB-CL8 (p < .000). High CBI is correlated with high depression, neuropsychiatry symptoms, low cognitive patients functions. Caregivers have the following intrapsychic behaviors: poor self-care, poor ability to take care of themselves; they exercise control over themselves and do not consider and/or ignore their basic needs at emotional and physical levels. These intrapsychic behaviours are indicators of depression (SASB Model) and are correlated with high care burdenCCBI and high depression-CDQ. DISCUSSION: Care burden is closely related to the depression and individual personality (intrapsychic experience) of the caregiver.

Measuring frailty provides valuable prognostic information to help personalize treatment decisions. However, there is minimal evidence on multicomponent frailty interventions in this setting. The TARGET-EFT (The MulTicomponent Acute Intervention in FRail GEriatric PaTients with cardiovascular disease using the Essential Frailty Toolset) trial aims to target physical and non-physical frailty deficits to improve health-related quality of life and hospital-acquired disability in frail patients hospitalized with CVD. METHODS: The TARGET-EFT trial is a single-center parallel-group randomized clinical trial in frail and pre-frail older adults 65 years admitted to the cardiovascular unit (CVU) at the Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec. The trial will compare usual inpatient care to a multicomponent intervention targeting physical weakness, cognitive impairment, malnutrition, and anemia. Outcomes of interest in both groups will be assessed at three time points: (1) study enrollment, (2) discharge from the CVU, and (3) 30 days after hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The overarching goal is to treat patients frailty in parallel with their CVD, and in doing so, optimize patient functional losses while in-hospital and shortly thereafter. The results of this trial will inform best practices for patient-centered care in this vulnerable patient group.

Recent studies introduce deep learning to mitigate the manual feature extraction (i.e., data representation) efforts and achieve high accuracy. However, there are still challenges in learning accurate representations for sensory data due to the weakness of representation modules and the subject variances. We propose a scheme called Distance-based HAR from Ensembled spatial-temporal Representations (DHARER) to address above challenges. The idea behind DHARER is straightforwardthe same activities should have similar representations. We first learn representations of the input sensory segments and latent prototype representations of each class, using a Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-based dual-stream representation module; then the learned representations are projected to activity types by measuring their similarity to the learned prototypes. We have conducted extensive experiments under a strict subject-independent setting on three large-scale datasets to evaluate the proposed scheme, and our experimental results demonstrate superior performance of DHARER to several state-of-the-art methods.","output":"Prototype Similarity Learning for Activity Recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Numerous concerns regarding maintenance of blood inventory have been raised after SARS-CoV-2 pandemic outbreak. These concerns were based on the experience of blood centres in previous pandemics where shortage of blood components was reported. The present study had tried to understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on blood collection and demand as well as the impact of disaster planning in maintaining an adequate inventory. METHODS Data related to blood supply and demand were collected retrospectively using blood bank management software for pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 time period and compared. Strategies adopted and effects of changes in existing disaster plans to maintain an adequate inventory were studied. RESULTS A drastic fall in the red cell inventory was observed as compared to pre-COVID-19 time period was observed due to disproportionate decrease in blood collection (1/6 to 1/9 of the previous collection) and demand (1/2 of the previous demand). The buffer stock fell gradually over a period of three weeks with cancellation of planned blood donation drives. A buffer stock equivalent to 2-week inventory led to adequate inventory in the initial lockdown periods. Similar fall was observed in the platelet inventory with reduction in the blood collection but almost a proportionate reduction in the platelet demand led to adequate inventory. No increase in wastage was observed for both red cells and platelets during this period. DISCUSSION A buffer stock of blood and blood components, strict adherence to the transfusion triggers, good coordination with the clinical staff and a prospective review of blood transfusion requests to ensure rational blood transfusion were some of the steps which helped us to successfully maintain transfusion requirements in the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Use of first-in-first-out policy prevented any wastage due to outdating of blood.","output":"Blood supply management in times of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic - challenges, strategies adopted, and the lessons learned from the experience of a hospital-based blood centre."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Reimagining university life during COVID-19 requires substantial innovation and meaningful community input. One method for obtaining community input is crowdsourcing, which involves having a group of individuals work to solve a problem and then publicly share solutions. Objective: To evaluate a crowdsourcing open call as an approach to COVID-19 university community engagement and strategic planning. Design, Setting, and Participants: This qualitative study assessed a crowdsourcing open call offered from June 16 to July 16, 2020, that sought ideas to inform safety in the fall 2020 semester at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). Digital methods (email and social media) were used for promotion, and submissions were collected online for 4 weeks. Participation was open to UNC students, staff, faculty, and others. Main Outcomes and Measures: Submissions were evaluated for innovation, feasibility, inclusivity, and potential to improve safety and well-being. Demographic data were collected from submitting individuals, and submissions were qualitatively analyzed for emergent themes on challenges with and solutions for addressing safety and well-being in the fall semester. Data were shared with UNC leadership to inform decision-making. Results: The open call received 82 submissions from 110 participants, including current UNC students (56 submissions [68%]), people younger than 30 years (67 [82%]), women (55 [67%]), and individuals identifying as a racial/ethnic minority or as multiracial/ethnic (49 [60%]). Seven submissions were identified as finalists and received cash prizes with the encouragement to use these funds toward idea development and implementation. Seventeen runner-up teams were linked to university resources for further development. Thematic analysis of submissions regarding challenges with the fall semester revealed not only physical health concerns and the limitations of remote learning but also challenges that have been exacerbated by the pandemic, such as a lack of mental health support, structural racism and inequality, and insufficient public transportation. Solutions included novel ideas to support mental health among specific populations (eg, graduate students and racial/ethnic minorities), improve health equity, and increase transit access. All 24 finalists and runners-up indicated interest in implementation after being notified of the open call results. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that open calls are a feasible strategy for university community engagement on COVID-19, providing a stakeholder-driven approach to identifying promising ideas for enhancing safety and well-being. Open calls could be formally incorporated into university planning processes to develop COVID-19 safety strategies that are responsive to diverse community members' concerns.","output":"Assessment of a Crowdsourcing Open Call for Approaches to University Community Engagement and Strategic Planning During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite a plethora of publications on the art and science of respiratory care, a number of basic issues remain unanswered.

RESULTS: A total of 37 studies met inclusion criteria including 11 168 medical students and 91 medical schools. 24 studies evaluated knowledge (64.9%), 16 evaluated volunteering (43.2%) and 5 evaluated medical school curricula (13.5%). Weighted mean willingness to volunteer during a disaster was 68.4% (SD=21.7%, range=26.7%-87.8%, n=2911), and there was a significant difference between those planning to volunteer and those who actually volunteered (p<0.0001). We identified a number of modifiable barriers which may contribute to this heterogeneity. Overall, knowledge of disasters was poor with a weighted mean of 48.9% (SD=15.1%, range=37.1%-87.0%, n=2985). 36.8% of 76 medical schools curricula included teaching on disasters. However, students only received minimal teaching (2-6 hours). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that there is a large number of students who are willing to volunteer during pandemics. However, they are unlikely to be prepared for these roles as overall knowledge is poor, and this is likely due to minimal teaching on disasters at medical school. During the current COVID-19 pandemic and in future disasters, medical students may be required to volunteer as auxiliary staff.

METHODS From March 11 to March 19, 2020, we collected air samples from the clean area, the buffer room and the contaminated area respectively in the COVID-19 wards using a portable bioaerosol concentrator WA-15. And sterile premoistened swabs were used to sample the high-frequency contacted surfaces in the contaminated area and the surfaces of medical staff's protective equipment including outermost gloves, tracheotomy operator's positive pressure respiratory protective hood and isolation clothing. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid of the samples were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. During the isolation medical observation period, those medical staff who worked in the COVID-19 wards were detected for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid with oropharyngeal swabs, IgM and IgG antibody in the sera, and chest CT scans to confirm the infection status of COVID-19. RESULTS No SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was detected in the tested samples, including the 90 air samples from the COVID-19 wards including clean area, buffer room and contaminated area, the 38 high-frequency contact surfaces samples of the contaminated area and 16 surface samples of medical staff's protective equipment including outermost gloves and isolation clothing.

The diagnosis requires documented delay in gastric emptying with an optimal test such as scintigraphy or stable isotope gastric emptying breath test in the absence of mechanical obstruction. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of gastroparesis are multifactorial, including antroduodenal hypomotility, pylorospasm, impaired gastric accommodation, and visceral hypersensitivity. The etiologies of gastroparesis are broad, but the most common subtypes are idiopathic, diabetic, and postsurgical. Less frequent etiologies are neurodegenerative disorder (Parkinson disease), myopathies (scleroderma, amyloidosis), and neoplastic syndrome.

The key controversy is about the strategy that should be used to identify mothers who should receive IAP.

Although screening-based IAP appears to be more efficacious than risk-based IAP, IAP-based prevention has several limitations including ineffectiveness in prevention of late-onset GBS infection in babies, premature and still births, impact of IAP on neonatal microbiota, emergence of antimicrobial resistance and difficulties in implementing IAP-based strategies in middle and low income countries. Alternative strategies, principally maternal immunization against GBS would circumvent use of IAP.

Based on a multivariable regression analysis adjusting for coaching experience, previous history of a child sustaining one or more concussions, first aid experience and cluster by team, exposure to concussion education was associated with a mean score difference of 1.36 (95% CI 0.68 to 2.03), p<0.0001, in the knowledge score. Exposure to concussion education was not significantly associated with any of the HAPA constructs based on Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. CONCLUSION Exposure to concussion education may be associated with small overall differences in concussion knowledge but may not be associated with significant differences in beliefs or intended behaviours related to concussion management among youth hockey parents and coaches.When providing education or recommendations for concussion education sources to coaches and parents, educational strategies grounded in behavioural change theory that specifically target the motivators of behavioural change should be considered.","output":"Association between concussion education and concussion knowledge, beliefs and behaviours among youth ice hockey parents and coaches: a cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 shuttered schools, it created widespread student and family needs and exacerbated challenges stemming from long-standing racial and economic inequities. Here, we examine how an evidenced-based, integrated student support intervention responded to systematically identify and address the academic and nonacademic needs of students and families in 94 high-poverty, urban schools. We conduct thematic analysis of open-ended survey responses about intervention personnel's work in spring 2020 and triangulate findings with descriptive analyses of service provision records and mid-spring estimates of crucial needs. We find that intervention schools developed specific processes to respond to immediate needs, which included resource, academic, and socioemotional support. To accomplish this, the intervention leveraged existing processes and relationships to maintain intervention-specific practices, facilitate referrals and connections to resources, and expand direct intervention for education stakeholders. Findings elucidate practices for meeting academic and nonacademic needs that affect student learning and that may arise in future schooling disruptions.","output":"Leveraging Integrated Student Support to Identify and Address COVID-19-Related Needs for Students, Families, and Teachers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a consequence of the Spring 2020 lockdown that occurred in Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many people lost their jobs or had to be furloughed. The objective of this study is to analyse the influence of the latter changes in labour market status on psychological well-being. For this purpose, an ad-hoc questionnaire featuring socio-demographic and mental health criteria was created. Granted that the pandemic can be viewed as an exogenous shock, the bias caused by the bidirectional problems between the work situation and mental well-being can be tackled. Results indicate that the lockdown exerted a greater negative effect on the self-perceived well-being of unemployed and furloughed persons than on those in employment. Moreover, among those in continuous employment, teleworkers experienced a lesser degree of self-perceived well-being post lockdown as compared to those people remaining in the same work location throughout the COVID-19 crisis. Finally, the lockdown provoked worse effects on the self-perceived well-being of women as compared to men, a result that appears to be related to gender differences in household production. In conclusion, these results could be especially relevant given that the evolution of the pandemic is having ongoing effects on employment and, therefore, on the mental health of workers.","output":"Furloughs, Teleworking and Other Work Situations during the COVID-19 Lockdown: Impact on Mental Well-Being"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emeritus Professor Alan Glasper, from the University of Southampton, discusses the Prime Minister's personal campaign to reduce the impact of COVID-19 by addressing rising levels of obesity in society.","output":"Obesity levels and COVID-19: the Government's mission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I focus on how CSR rating and CSR compensation contracts help the financial performance when the market suffers a macro shock based on the 2008-2009 financial crisis.

Currently, this presents several caveats and the most important are: (i) rodents are nocturnal animals, but mostly tested during the light period; (ii) the conventional behavioral experiments take into consideration only a snapshot of a rich behavioral repertoire; and (iii) environmental factors, as well as experimenter influence, are often underestimated. Consequently, serious concerns have been expressed regarding the reproducibility of research findings on the one hand, and appropriate welfare of the animals (based on the principle of 3Rs-reduce, refine and replace) on the other hand. To address these problems and improve behavioral phenotyping in general, several solutions have been proposed and developed. Undisturbed, 24/7 home-cage monitoring (HCM) is gaining increased attention and popularity as demonstrating the potential to substitute or complement the conventional phenotyping methods by providing valuable data for identifying the behavioral patterns that may have been missed otherwise. In this review, we will briefly describe the different technologies used for HCM systems. Thereafter, based on our experience, we will focus on two systems, IntelliCage (NewBehavior AG and TSE-systems) and Digital Ventilated Cage (DVC?, Tecniplast)-how they have been developed and applied during recent years. Additionally, we will touch upon the importance of the environmental/experimenter artifacts and propose alternative suggestions for performing phenotyping experiments based on the published evidence. We will discuss how the integration of telemetry systems for deriving certain physiological parameters can help to complement the description of the animal model to offer better translation to human studies.

They have many pharmaceutical and/or nutritional functions, and have been widely applied in medical, food, and cosmetics industries. Recently, terpenoids have been used in the clinical treatment of COVID-19 due to the good antiviral activities. The increasing demand for terpenoids in international markets poses a serious threat to many plant species. For environmentally sustainable development, microbial cell factories have been utilized as the promising platform to produce terpenoids. Nevertheless, the bioproduction of most terpenoids cannot meet commercial requirements due to the low cost-benefit ratio until now. The biosynthetic potential of endophytes has gained attention in recent decades owing to the continual discovery of endophytes capable of synthesizing plant bioactive compounds. Accordingly, endophytes could be alternative sources of terpenoid-producing strains or terpenoid synthetic genes. In this review, we summarized the research progress describing the main and supporting roles of endophytes in terpenoid biosynthesis and biotransformation, and discussed the current problems and challenges which may prevent the further exploitation. This review will improve our understanding of endophyte resources for terpenoid production in industry in the future. The four main research interests on endophytes for terpenoid production.

For over 10 years, the National AIDS Program (NAP) has offered HIV voluntary counselling and testing through a partnership with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). In 2018, implementation of HIV self-tests (HIVST) was introduced, and this self-care intervention has been further scaled up during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This paper (1) describes the effectiveness of implementing HIVST in Lebanon, and (2) discusses how the success of HIVST implementation has been reflected during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The NAP conducted a series of workshops (JulyCNovember 2018) to introduce HIVST services for healthcare workers working at different NGOs. The workshops highlighted that HIVST would be distributed for free, that it would be confidential and voluntary, and that participants were encouraged to notify the NGOs of their results, which would be kept strictly confidential. NGOs collected data anonymously and confidentially from beneficiaries (age, consistency of condom use and HIV testing history), who were asked to call back with the results of their HIVST. At the NAP, data were combined, aggregated and analysed. RESULTS: In 2019, the NGOs distributed 1103/1380 (79.9%) HIVST kits to their beneficiaries. The NGOs collected feedback on 111 kit results, of which two were HIV-positive. Feedback about HIVST results from beneficiaries was low (111/1103) due to noncompliance of beneficiaries and the lack of human and financial resources in the NGOs. From January through May 2020, a total of 625/780 HIVST kits (80.1%) were distributed. This period was divided into pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19. The follow-up with the beneficiaries during COVID-19 was much improved because of the absence of on-site activities, shifting more efforts towards HIVST (449/625). There have been no reports of social harm related to HIVST. CONCLUSION: HIVST implementation in Lebanon serves as an example of introducing a self-care intervention as part of a community-led effort. In order to maintain HIVST services at the same improved level, reorganization of care is needed within each NGO following the adaptation process due to COVID-19, along with continuous monitoring and evaluation of HIVST reported data.","output":"Community-led HIV self-testing for men who have sex with men in Lebanon: lessons learned and impact of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The temporal evolution of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy and effectiveness (VE) against infection, symptomatic, and severe COVID-19 is incompletely defined. The temporal evolution of VE could be dependent on age, vaccine types, variants of the virus, and geographic region. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the duration of VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic COVID-19 and severe COVID-19. METHODS: MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the World Health Organization Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease, and CoronaCentral databases were searched and studies were selected. Independent reviewers selected randomized controlled trials and cohort studies with the outcome of interest. Independent reviewers extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Meta-analysis was performed with the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model with Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman variance correction. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used to assess certainty (quality) of the evidence. Primary outcomes included VE as a function of time against SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic and severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included representing nearly 7 million individuals. VE against all SARS-CoV-2 infections declined from 83% in the first month after completion of the original vaccination series to 22% at 5 months or longer. Similarly, VE against symptomatic COVID-19 declined from 94% in the first month after vaccination to 64% by the fourth month. VE against severe COVID-19 for all ages was high overall, with the level being 90% (95% CI, 87C92%) at five months or longer after being fully vaccinated. VE against severe COVID-19 was lower in individuals  65 years and those who received Ad26.COV2.S. CONCLUSIONS: VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptomatic COVID-19 waned over time but protection remained high against severe COVID-19.

During the second wave of COVID-19, the risk of pressure ulcers for patients undergoing femur fracture surgery increased significantly. This variation could be explained by the absence of a caregiver for these patients and the increased average complexity of the patients managed in the orthopaedic setting.

Both transcriptome and proteome of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells synergize the progression of infection in host, which may exacerbate symptoms and/or progression of other chronic diseases such as Parkinsons disease (PD). Oxidative stress is a well-known cause of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress observed in both SARS-CoV-2 and PD. In the current study, we aimed to explore the influence of PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) stress pathway under SARS-CoV-2-mediated infection and in human cell model of PD. Furthermore, we investigated whether they are interconnected and if the ER stress inhibitors could inhibit cell death and provide cellular protection. To achieve this aim, we have incorporated in silico analysis obtained from gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), a literature review and laboratory data. The neurotoxin, 6-hydroxy dopamine (6OHDA), was used to mimic the biochemical and neuropathological characteristics of PD by inducing oxidative stress in dopamine-containing neurons differentiated from ReNVM cell line (dDCNs). Furthermore, we explored if ER stress influences activation of caspases-2, -4 and -8 in SARS-CoV-2 and in stressed dDCNs. Our laboratory data using Western blot, immunocytochemistry and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) analyses indicated that 6OHDA-induced toxicity triggered activation of caspases-2, -4 and -8 in dDCNs. Under SARS-CoV-2 infection of different cell types, GSEA revealed cell-specific sensitivities to oxidative and ER stresses. Cardiomyocytes and type II alveolar epithelial-like cells were more vulnerable to oxidative stress than neural cells. On the other side, only cardiomyocytes activated the unfolded protein response, however, the PERK pathway was operative in both cardiomyocytes and neural cells. In addition, caspase-4 activation by a SARS-CoV-2 was observed via in silico analyses. These results demonstrate that the ER stress pathway under oxidative stress in SARS-CoV-2 and PD are interconnected using diverse pathways. Furthermore, our results using the ER stress inhibitor and caspase specific inhibitors provided cellular protection suggesting that the use of specific inhibitors can provide effective therapeutic approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 and PD.","output":"ER Stress in COVID-19 and Parkinsons Disease: In Vitro and In Silico Evidences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tardigrades are small, globally widespred invertebrates that need at least a thin layer of water to be active.

The state of maturity of the S glycoprotein can be deduced from its sensitivity to hydrolysis by endoglycosidase H (EndoH) or N-glycosidase F (N-Gly F). A fully matured S glycoprotein will be modified with complex oligosaccharides which makes it resistant to cleavage by EndoH but not by N-Gly F. By exploiting this characteristic, it is then possible to determine which forms of the immunoprecipitated S protein are properly processed by the host cell.

Increasing evidence highlights the ability of these stress mediators to modulate cellular metabolism and pro-inflammatory signaling in phagocytes, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and to alter the activation and polarization of these cells. Because these immune cells serve a key role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and organ function, understanding how endogenous oxidized lipids reshape phagocyte biology and function is vital for designing clinical tools and interventions for preventing, slowing down, or resolving chronic inflammatory disorders that are driven by phagocyte dysfunction.

Scientists and environmental organizations have been looking for new ways to combat and control the air pollution, developing new solutions as technologies evolves. In the last decade, devices able to observe and maintain pollution levels have become more accessible and less expensive, and with the appearance of the Internet of Things (IoT), new approaches for combating pollution were born. The focus of the research presented in this paper was predicting behaviours regarding the air quality index using machine learning. Data were collected from one of the six atmospheric stations set in relevant areas of Bucharest, Romania, to validate our model. Several algorithms were proposed to study the evolution of temperature depending on the level of pollution and on several pollution factors. In the end, the results generated by the algorithms are presented considering the types of pollutants for two distinct periods. Prediction errors were highlighted by the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) for each of the three machine learning algorithms used.","output":"Pollution and Weather Reports: Using Machine Learning for Combating Pollution in Big Cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the pandemic represented the upheaval of the order constituted (status quo), as the most evident data It's possible to think of the dynamics within the EU, the relationship between the various political systems, taken as single entities and in their inter-institutional relationships The Coronavirus also called into question strategies that seemed politically well established, for example the ways the US electoral campaigns are conducted and shed a light on political dynamics and practices that usually are less talked about, if not in a detrimental manner, such as the polices carried out by political representatives such as Mr Erdogan and Mr Orban It has unbalanced economic-financial domains, which imposed themselves as unassailable, as it has been the case for China But, not least, the pandemic has disarticulated social and relational models, in every country of the world Not even the First and the Second World Wars had achieved that Everything, inevitably, will result in a rethinking of the regulatory and decision-making processes;likewise, the 'way' of life and the ways relationships are built will undergo a 'restoration' process based on the redefinition of needs, expectations and, above all, desires Those will have to be identified according to a new series of elementary and essential rights to be guaranteed to everyone","output":"Systemic Regeneration and Circular Society"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Modified thoracoabdominal nerves block through perichondrial approach (M-TAPA) was first described as a peripheral nerve block by Tulgar in 2019. This technique provides an analgesic effective range from Th7C11 with a single puncture per side. Although the efficacy and effective duration of M-TAPA have been reported, further examination is required. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the analgesic range and effective duration of M-TAPA in open gynecologic surgery. METHODS: Following approval, 10 adult female patients scheduled for open radical hysterectomy via a vertical incision or laparotomy using a midline incision from under the xiphoid process to the symphysis pubis were enrolled. The primary outcome was the number of anesthetized dermatomes at 2 and 24 h postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included numerical rating scale scores and the total amount of fentanyl used. Cadaveric evaluation was performed to assess the spread of the dye. RESULTS: The median numbers (interquartile range) of anesthetized dermatomes at 2 and 24 h postoperatively were 6 (5C7) and 6.5 (5C7) in the anterior cutaneous branch area and 5 (4C7) and 7 (5C7) in the lateral cutaneous branch area, respectively. There was an 85% chance of simultaneously acquiring analgesia in areas innervated by Th8C11, including complete block in areas innervated by the anterior cutaneous branches of Th9C10.

The search was conducted independently on 13/09/20 by two authors (JOH, JM), any discrepancy was further reviewed by a third author (JC). All original research papers published between 2019- 2020 were included. Results: 68 papers were included in our study. Educational research this year shifted focus on how to combat the negative impact of COVID-19 on otorhinolaryngology teaching. Although many of the interventions created for postgraduate and undergraduate education have not been formally assessed, virtual electives for medical students were found to increase interest and knowledge in the specialty. Surgical simulation represented the most common teaching method reported aside from COVID-19. 3D models were used for emergency training with an aim to increase trainee exposure to an anterior neck abscess, retrobulbar haematoma and paediatric tracheostomy. 3D models were positively rated for face and content validity and gave statistically significant improvements in confidence for trainees. Conclusions: The otorhinolaryngology training in 2019-2020 has changed massively due to the pandemic. Improving on virtual learning and adapting simulation training are the key to maintain a positive learning environment for medical students and doctors in the short term.

DESIGN: Repeated cross-sectional survey. Between July 17 and September 10, 2020, mother-child pairs who were enrolled in a population-based survey in 2017 were re-contacted by telephone for consent and to complete a telephonic COVID-19 survey. We used the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale to assess food security and the Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) to assess maternal mental disorders. McNemar's test for paired data that also accounted for clustering was used. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship of unemployment and receipt of government assistance with food insecurity and MMD in 2020. SETTING: Cear, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: 577 mother-child pairs who completed the 2017 and 2020 surveys. At the time of the 2020 interview, the child cohort was 36-108 months of age. RESULTS: The proportion of mothers reporting food insecurity was 15.5% higher (95% CI: (5.9 - 25.1), p-value < 0.001) during the pandemic in July-August 2020 as compared to November 2017, while the prevalence of MMD was 40.2% higher during the pandemic (95% CI: 32.6 - 47.8, p-value < 0.001).

We assessed the relative filtering efficacy of two currently used surgical face masks (one a molded mask, the other a tie-on mask) and a certified personal particulate respirator, all made by a single manufacturer. METHODS: The authors sprayed bicarbonate particulate against a porcelain surface (representing the patient's mouth) and collected it via a mannequin head (representing the dentist's head) placed 40 centimeters away and a tube with two airflow rates (0.5 cubic meters per hour and 9 m(3)/hour). They calculated the dry residue weight. They performed three separate runs for each mask and three runs with no mask at the two airflow rates with and without aerosol. RESULTS: With no mask (control), the authors recorded significant weight gains at both airflow rates with and without vaporization. With vaporization, the three masks were associated with different dry residue weights (P < .03 with the Kruskal-Wallis test at both flow rates), the respirator providing the lowest amount. The respirator provided an efficiency of 94 to 96 percent, compared with 90 to 92 percent and 85 to 86 percent for the molded and tie-on surgical masks, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide independent evidence that a certified personal respirator can be more effective than high-quality surgical masks in dental settings.

METHODS: This study reports the morphological characterization of both bone marrow and spleen in 11 COVID-19 decedents with respect to findings in the peripheral blood and pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 burden. RESULTS: In the bone marrow, activation and left shift were found in at least 55% of patients, which was mirrored by peripheral anaemia, granulocytic immaturity and multiple thromboembolic events. Signs of sepsis-acquired immunodeficiency were found in the setting of an abscess-forming superinfection of viral COVID-19 pneumonia. Furthermore, a severe B cell loss was observed in the bone marrow and/or spleen in 64% of COVID-19 patients. This was reflected by lymphocytopenia in the peripheral blood. As compared to B cell preservation, B cell loss was associated with a higher pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 burden and only a marginal decrease of of T cell counts. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest the presence of sepsis-related immunodeficiency in severe COVID-19 pneumonia with superinfection. Furthermore, our findings indicate that lymphocytopenia in COVID-19 is accompanied by B cell depletion in hematopoietic tissue, which might impede the durability of the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2.","output":"B cell depletion and signs of sepsis-acquired immunodeficiency in bone marrow and spleen of COVID-19 deceased"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herein it is proposed that sufficient exposure to sunlight (UVB) modulates host gene expression, offering protection against severe consequences of COVID-19.

One solution may be to decontaminate equipment such as facemasks for reuse. AIM: To collect and synthesize existing information on decontamination of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) using microwave and heat-based treatments, with special attention to impact on mask function (aerosol penetration, airflow resistance), fit, and physical traits. METHODS: A systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42020177036) of literature available from Medline, Embase, Global Health, and other sources was conducted. Records were screened independently by two reviewers, and data was extracted from studies that reported on effects of microwave- or heat-based decontamination on N95 FFR performance, fit, physical traits, and/or reductions in microbial load. FINDINGS: Thirteen studies were included that used dry/moist microwave irradiation, heat, or autoclaving. All treatment types reduced pathogen load by a log10 reduction factor of at least three when applied for sufficient duration (>30s microwave, >60 min dry heat), with most studies assessing viral pathogens. Mask function (aerosol penetration <5% and airflow resistance <25mmH(2)O) was preserved after all treatments except autoclaving. Fit was maintained for most N95 models, though all treatment types caused observable physical damage to at least one model. CONCLUSIONS: Microwave irradiation and heat may be safe and effective viral decontamination options for N95 FFR reuse during critical shortages. The evidence does not support autoclaving or high-heat (>90(o)C) approaches.

This article introduces the training dataset, including a snapshot analysis covering the completeness of clinical data, and availability of image data for the various use-cases (diagnosis, prognosis, longitudinal risk). An additional cohort analysis measures how well the NCCID represents the wider COVID-19Caffected UK population in terms of geographic, demographic, and temporal coverage. FINDINGS: The NCCID offers high-quality DICOM images acquired across a variety of imaging machinery; multiple time points including historical images are available for a subset of patients. This volume and variety make the database well suited to development of diagnostic/prognostic models for COVID-associated respiratory conditions. Historical images and clinical data may aid long-term risk stratification, particularly as availability of comorbidity data increases through linkage to other resources. The cohort analysis revealed good alignment to general UK COVID-19 statistics for some categories, e.g., sex, whilst identifying areas for improvements to data collection methods, particularly geographic coverage.

The functional impact of such polymorphisms has been suggested from data derived from genetic association studies, in vitro experiments with primary cells, and transgenic overexpression models. However, heterogeneous genetic background and non-physiological transgene expression levels confound interpretation, leading to conflicting mechanistic conclusions. To overcome these limitations, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to create a unique suite of four isogenic homozygous variants at amino acid positions 16(G/R) and 27(G/Q), which reside in the N terminus of the (2)AR. By producing cardiomyocytes from these hPSC lines, we determined that at a functional level (2)AR signaling dominated over (1)AR . Examining changes in beat rates and responses to isoprenaline, Gi coupling, cyclic AMP (cAMP) production, downregulation, and desensitization indicated that responses were often heightened for the GE variant, implying differential dominance of both polymorphic location and amino acid substitution. This finding was corroborated, since GE showed hypersensitivity to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity relative to GQ and RQ variants. Thus, understanding the effect of (2)AR polymorphisms on cardiac response to anticancer therapy may provide a route for personalized medicine and facilitate immediate clinical impact.","output":"CRISPR/Cas9-mediated generation and analysis of N terminus polymorphic models of (2)AR in isogenic hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although a full course of COVID-19 vaccine is effective in cancer patients, the duration of the protection and the efficacy of a booster dose against the new variants remain unknown. We prospectively evaluated the immunogenicity of the third dose of the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in cancer patients undergoing active treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with solid cancer, vaccinated with a booster dose during active treatment, were enrolled in this study. Patients were classified in SARS-CoV-2 na?ve (without previous COVID-19 infection) and SARS-CoV-2 experienced (with previous COVID-19 infection). Neutralizing antibody (NT Abs) titer and total anti-Spike IgG concentration were quantified in serum. Heparinized whole blood samples were used for SARS-CoV-2 Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA). The primary endpoint was to assess the increase of IgG antibody level between baseline and 3 weeks after the booster. RESULTS: 142 consecutive patients were recruited. In SARS-CoV-2 na?ve subjects, median level of IgG was 157 BAU/mL (interquartile range (IQR) 62-423) at T0 and reached median of 2080 (IQR 2080-2080) at three weeks after booster administration (T1; p<0.0001). A median 16-fold increase of SARS-CoV-2 NT Abs titre (IQR 4-32) was observed in na?ve subjects (from median 20 IQR 10-40 to median 640 IQR 160-640; p<0.0001). Median IFN- level at T1 was significantly higher than that measured at T0 in SARS-CoV-2 na?ve subjects (p=0.0049) but not in SARS-CoV-2 experienced patients.

Many cell surface receptors recycle from endosomes to the plasma membrane via a recently discovered pathway, which includes sorting-nexin SNX17, Retriever, WASH, and CCC complexes. Here, using mammalian cells, we discover that PIKfyve and its upstream PI3-kinase VPS34 positively regulate this pathway. VPS34 produces phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), which is the substrate for PIKfyve to generate PI3,5P(2). We show that PIKfyve controls recycling of cargoes including integrins, receptors that control cell migration. Furthermore, endogenous PIKfyve colocalizes with SNX17, Retriever, WASH, and CCC complexes on endosomes. Importantly, PIKfyve inhibition results in displacement of Retriever and CCC from endosomes. In addition, we show that recruitment of SNX17 is an early step and requires VPS34.

At least 25 reports of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) or thrombocytopenia following the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine have been added to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in the US. ITP is a rare but known complication of several vaccinations. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is new, with a novel mechanism of action, and understanding the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, treatment success and natural history of post-vaccination thrombocytopenia is evolving. We report a 74-year-old man who developed refractory thrombocytopenia within one day of receiving the Moderna SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Several hours after vaccination, he developed significant epistaxis and cutaneous purpura. Severe thrombocytopenia was documented the following day, and he developed extremity weakness and encephalopathy with facial muscle weakness. Over a 14-day period, thrombocytopenia was treated first with high dose dexamethasone, intravenous immunoglobulin, platelet transfusions, rituximab, plasma exchange (for presumed acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP)), and four daily doses of the thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) eltrombopag (Promacta?), without a platelet response. Three days later, he received the TPO-RA romiplostim (Nplate?). Five days later, his platelet count began to rise and by post-vaccination day 25, his platelet count was in the normal range. Thrombocytopenia was refractory to frontline and second-line treatment. The eventual rise in his platelet count suggests that one or both TPO-RAs may have impacted platelet recovery.

Having safe and efficacious vaccines available is only half the equation; people must also take them. We describe a study to identify COVID-19 vaccine attitudes, values and intentions immediately preceding authorization of COVID-19 vaccines in the US. METHODS: A national panel survey was conducted to measure intent to receive COVID-19 vaccines as well as disease and vaccine attitudes, values and trust in local, state and federal public health authorities. RESULTS: Greater than 80% of respondents reported confidence they could adhere to COVID recommendations such as mask wearing, social distancing and hand washing. The majority of respondents (70%) reported believing that current drugs were somewhat or very good at treating COVID-19 infection. Vaccine intent fell into three groups: Intenders (50%), Wait and Learn (40%), and Unlikelys (10%). Intent to get vaccinated was substantially lower among African American (32%), and higher among men (56%), those over 60 years of age (61%), those with a Bachelor's degree or higher (63%), and Democrats (63%). The Wait and Learn group, compared to the Intenders, were less likely to report being diagnosed with a high risk condition for COVID-19, receiving an influenza vaccine in the past 12 months, discussing COVID-19 vaccine with their healthcare provider, perceiving COVID-19 as severe, considering a COVID-19 vaccine important to stop the spread of infection, and wering a mask usually or almost always. CONCLUSION: Only half of US adults intend to accept COVID-19 vaccines; most others (40%) are uncertain. Levels of immunity associated with community protection will not be achieved without reaching those who are currently uncertain.

Often, for people living with dementia this seems an area of care overlooked by professionals. This study investigated the experiences of intimate continence care for people living with dementia and their family member (the family dyad), and whether they viewed this as impacting on their relationship. METHOD Face-to-face interviews were conducted at 6 monthly intervals over a 12-month period with 13 carers (all family members) and one person living with dementia (13 family dyads) in England. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Analysis of the data was achieved using a descriptive phenomenological method. FINDINGS Carers' attitudes towards providing intimate continence care revealed a task-focused approach for some but feelings of disgust and distress for others. Four participants (including the participant living with dementia) reported that intimate continence care had strengthened their dyad relationship. However, some carers perceived the care and support received from health and social care practitioners to be insufficient, which placed extra stress on them and adversely affected their family dyad relationship. CONCLUSION Implications of the study suggest that integrated and effective continence care and support for people living with dementia and their carers could (1) maintain the quality of the family dyad relationship, (2) help keep the person living at home, delaying an unwanted move to a care home and (3) consequently improve overall quality of life for individuals in the family dyad.

Tissue ablation is achieved through the continuous delivery of a narrow range of electromagnetic fields across a tumor, for a period of months. TTFields are designed to affect only cells that divide and to interfere with the cell division process. The therapy is monitored with MRI imaging, performed every couple of months. Current technology is unable to assess the treatment effectiveness in real time. Methods: We propose that the effect of the treatment can be assessed, in real time, by continuously measuring the change in electrical impedance across the TTFields delivery electrode arrays. An in vitro anatomic skull experimental study, with brain and tumor mimics phantom tissues was conducted to confirm the potential value of the proposed monitoring system. Results: Experiments show that measuring the change in the impedance amplitude between opposite TTFields electrode arrays, at a typical TTFields treatment frequency of (200 kHz), can detect changes in the tumor radius with a sensitivity that increases with the radius of the tumor. The study shows that TTFields electrode arrays can be used to assess the effectiveness of TTFields treatment on changes in the tumor dimensions in real time, throughout the treatement. This monitoring system may become a valuable addition to the TTFields cancer treatment technology. It could provide the means to continuously assess the effectiveness of the treatment, and thereby optimize the design of the treatment protocol.","output":"Evaluating the therapeutic effect of tumor treating fields (TTFields) by monitoring the impedance across TTFields electrode arrays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Good preconception and interconception health are fundamental to optimizing womens health and reducing risk factors for adverse maternalCinfant outcomes. Although rural women in the United States tend to experience health disparities, no published qualitative studies have focused on their preconception/interconception health. The purpose of this study was to determine what rural, Midwestern women perceive to be their most pressing health needs and effective ways to provide outreach and education regarding preconception/interconception health and care. METHODS: Non-pregnant, reproductive-age women in Hardin County, Ohio, regardless of parity, were recruited through convenience sampling. Semi-structured interviews with four domains (beliefs and behaviors; perceived needs; knowledge and information sources; barriers to care) were conducted in MayCJune 2021 until saturation was reached. Qualitative methods were used to analyze data and determine themes. Binomial tests were used to compare selected demographic characteristics of participants to the countys reproductive-age residential female population. RESULTS: Nineteen women aged 20C44 years were individually interviewed. Comparing race/ethnicity, education, and insurance status, participants appeared to be representative of the county population. Four themes were identified: (1) needs regarding healthcare and other resources; (2) lack of preconception/interconception care and perceived unimportance due to intergenerational knowledge transfer and paucity of healthcare providers; (3) difference in understanding of the term womens health and low health literacy; and (4) suggested interventions including education and outreach. CONCLUSION: Interviews with rural Midwestern women revealed needs regarding preconception/interconception health and care and potential ways to raise awareness.

METHODS: The study included 55 children infected with COVID-19 and 60 healthy children for the comparison of leukocyte and thrombocyte count, MPV, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Demographic data and clinical findings of all the cases were recorded, including age, gender, weight, temperature, cough, shortness of breath and contact history. RESULTS: The MPV values were determined to be statistically significantly high (p<0.001) and the lymphocyte values were significantly low (p:0.002) in the asymptomatic children infected with COVID-19 compared to the healthy control children. No difference was determined between the groups in respect of CRP level, leukocyte and thrombocyte counts (p>0.05). The optimal cutoff point for MPV was determined as 8.74 fl (Area under the curve-AUC:0.932) with 81.82% sensitivity and 95% specificity for the determination of children infected with COVID-19. A cutoff value of <2.12/mm3 for lymphocytes (AUC:0.670) was determined with 49.09% sensitivity and 86.67% specificity for the prediction of COVID-19. Based on the ROC analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of MPV was determined to be higher than that of lymphocyte levels. CONCLUSION: The results of this study that MPV levels are significantly high in asymptomatic children infected with COVID-19 demonstrate that this is an important predictive value and has better predictive capacity than lymphocyte values.

Scientific study ofinterventions designed to change behavior (e.g., to promote social distancing) requiresmeasures of effectiveness that are fast, that can be assessed through experiments, and that can be investigated without actual virus transmission. This paper presents a methodological approach designed to deliver such indicators. We show that behavioral data, obtainable through tracing apps currently in development, can be used to assess a central concept in epidemiology known as the contact network: a network representation that encodes which individuals have been in physical proximity long enough to transmit the virus. Because behavioral interventions alter the contact network, a comparison of contact networks before and after the intervention can provide information on the effectiveness of the intervention. We coin indicators based on this idea Behavioral Contact Network (BECON) indicators. We examine the performance of three indicators: the Density BECON (based on differences in network density), the Spectral BECON (based on differences in the eigenvector of the adjacency matrix), and the ASPL BECON (based on differences in average shortest path lengths). Using simulations, we show that all three indicators can effectively track the effect of behavioral interventions. Even in conditions with significant amounts of noise, BECON indicators can reliably identify and order effect sizes of interventions. The present paper invites further study of the method as well as practical implementations to test the validity of BECON indicators in real data.","output":"The lighting of the BECONs: A behavioral data science approach to tracking interventions in COVID-19 research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although COVID-19 is viewed primarily as a respiratory disease, cardiovascular risk factors and disease are prevalent among infected patients and are associated with worse outcomes.

However, supply chain logistics have hampered global vaccine delivery, which is impacting mass vaccination strategies. Recent studies have identified different strategies for vaccine dose administration so that supply constraints issues are diminished. These include increasing the time between consecutive doses in a two-dose vaccine regimen and reducing the dosage of the second dose. We consider both of these strategies in a mathematical modeling study of a non-replicating viral vector adenovirus vaccine in this work. We investigate the impact of different prime-boost strategies by quantifying their effects on immunological outcomes based on simple system of ordinary differential equations. The boost dose is administered either at a standard dose (SD) of 1000 or at a low dose (LD) of 500 or 250 vaccine particles. Results show dose-dependent immune response activity. Our model predictions show that by stretching the prime-boost interval to 18 or 20, in an SD/SD or SD/LD regimen, the minimum promoted antibody (Nab) response will be comparable with the neutralizing antibody level measured in COVID-19 recovered patients. Results also show that the minimum stimulated antibody in SD/SD regimen is identical with the high level observed in clinical trial data.

The objective of this article is to analyse the epidemiological evolution of COVID-19 in seven Francophone West African countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, C?te d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Senegal) as well as the public health measures decided upon during the first four months of the pandemic. Methods: : Our method is based on quantitative and qualitative data from the pooling of information from a COVID-19 data platform and collected by a network of interdisciplinary collaborators present in the seven countries. Descriptive and spatial analyses of quantitative epidemiological data and content analyses of qualitative data on public measures and management committees were performed. Results: : Attack rates for COVID-19 range from less than 10 per 100,000 inhabitants (Benin) to more than 45 per 100,000 inhabitants (Guinea). The spatio-temporal analysis shows three phases of incidence clusters. By the end of June 2020, case numbers had plateaued in some countries (Burkina Faso, Niger, Mali) while others continued to see the number of infections increasing (Benin, C?te d'Ivoire, Guinea, Senegal). The countries all reacted quickly to the crisis, in some cases before the first reported infection, and implemented public measures in a relatively homogeneous manner. None of the countries implemented country-wide lockdowns, but in some cases implemented partial or local containment measures. At the end of June 2020, countries began to lift certain restrictive measures, sometimes under pressure from the general population or from certain economic sectors.

However, if these measures are implemented for a long period of time, they can result in adverse modification of people's health perceptions and lifestyle behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cross-national survey was to address the lack of adequate real-time data on the public response to changes in lifestyle behavior during the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-national web-based survey was administered using Google Forms during the month of April 2020. The settings were China, Japan, Italy, and India. There were two primary outcomes: (1) response to the health scale, defined as perceived health status, a combined score of health-related survey items; and (2) adoption of healthy lifestyle choices, defined as the engagement of the respondent in any two of three healthy lifestyle choices (healthy eating habits, engagement in physical activity or exercise, and reduced substance use). Statistical associations were assessed with linear and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: We received 3371 responses; 1342 were from India (39.8%), 983 from China (29.2%), 669 from Italy (19.8%), and 377 (11.2%) from Japan. A differential countrywise response was observed toward perceived health status; the highest scores were obtained for Indian respondents (9.43, SD 2.43), and the lowest were obtained for Japanese respondents (6.81, SD 3.44). Similarly, countrywise differences in the magnitude of the influence of perceptions on health status were observed; perception of interpersonal relationships was most pronounced in the comparatively old Italian and Japanese respondents (?=.68 and .60, respectively), and the fear response was most pronounced in Chinese respondents (?=.71). Overall, 78.4% of the respondents adopted at least two healthy lifestyle choices amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike health status, the influence of perception of interpersonal relationships on the adoption of lifestyle choices was not unanimous, and it was absent in the Italian respondents (odds ratio 1.93, 95% CI 0.65-5.79). The influence of perceived health status was a significant predictor of lifestyle change across all the countries, most prominently by approximately 6-fold in China and Italy. CONCLUSIONS: The overall consistent positive influence of increased interpersonal relationships on health perceptions and adopted lifestyle behaviors during the pandemic is the key real-time finding of the survey. Favorable behavioral changes should be bolstered through regular virtual interpersonal interactions, particularly in countries with an overall middle-aged or older population. Further, controlling the fear response of the public through counseling could also help improve health perceptions and lifestyle behavior. However, the observed human behavior needs to be viewed within the purview of cultural disparities, self-perceptions, demographic variances, and the influence of countrywise phase variations of the pandemic. The observations derived from a short lockdown period are preliminary, and real insight could only be obtained from a longer follow-up.","output":"Health Perceptions and Adopted Lifestyle Behaviors During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-National Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Growing evidence supports a clear association between COVID-19 pandemic and mental health. However, little is known about the longitudinal course of psychopathology in young adults at different stages of the pandemic. METHODS This large-scale, longitudinal, population-based survey was conducted among college students in China. The rates of three mental health problems (acute stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms), and their change patterns at two phases of the pandemic (early vs under-control) were measured. Predictors of changes in mental health symptoms were examined utilizing multivariate regression. RESULTS Among the 164,101 college students who participated in the first wave survey (T1=during onset of outbreak), 68,685 (41.9%) completed a follow-up survey (T2=during remission). In the follow-up survey, the prevalence of probable acute stress (T1: 34.6%; T2: 16.4%) decreased, while the rates of depressive (T1: 21.6%; T2: 26.3%) and anxiety symptoms (T1: 11.4%; T2: 14.7%) increased. Senior students, with suspected or conformed cases in their community and COVID-19 related worries (all AORs > 1.20, ps < 0.001) were found to have a higher risk of developing mental health problems in at least one wave.

Thus, in this work, multivariate statistical methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA), have been studied and applied to analyze the results of many objective engineering optimization problems. PCA reduces the number of objectives to a very small number, CA through the similarities and dissimilarities, creates groups of solutions, i.e., bringing together in the same group solutions with the same characteristics and behaviors.

This intervention has been highly successful in curtailing the coronavirus 2 outbreak. One major concern is the ability of the virus to mutate which potentially can cause SARS-CoV-2 to partially escape from the immune system. Here we evaluate the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the B.1.351 variant. Methods The Ministry of Health, initiated sequencing of selected positive swab samples identified as being of interest. We used logistic regression, with variant type as the dependent variable, vaccination status as the main explanatory variable, controlling for age, sex, subpopulation, place of residence and time of sample, to estimate the odds ratio for a vaccinated case to have the B. 1.351 versus the B.1.1.7 variant, within vaccinated and unvaccinated persons who tested positive. Findings There were 19 cases of B.1.351 variant (3.2%) among those vaccinated more than 14 days before the positive sample and 88 (3.5%) among the unvaccinated. The estimated odds ratio was 1.29 [95% CI: 0.66-2.50]. From this result, assuming the efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant to be 95%, the estimated efficacy against the B.1.351 variant was 94% [95% CI: 87-97%]. Interpretation Despite the concerns caused by the B.1.351 variant, the BNT162b2 vaccine seems to provide substantial immunity against both that variant and the B.1.1.7. Our results suggest that from 14 days following the second vaccine dose the efficacy of BNT162b2 vaccine is at most marginally affected by the B.1.351 variant.

The health care system is facing a tremendous challenge to provide ethical and quality care. The transformation of the patient-based care to population-based care during the COVID-19 pandemic has raised ethical dilemma among urologists. Our objective is to explore the consensus in modified standard urology care, that can be adopted and applied during COVID-19 and similar pandemic. Methods We adopted an exploratory study design using secondary data. The data were extracted from a web-based medical library using keywords COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and urology. We identify and extrapolate (screening, eligibility, and inclusion) the data using PRISMA protocol, and summarize pandemic standard urology care under four main themes: (1) general urology care, (2) choice of surgical modality, (3) triage, and (4) urology training. Result We identified 63 academic papers related to our research question. The majority are expert opinions and perspectives on urology care. The common consensus is triage-based urology care and surgeries. Life or organ threatening conditions need immediate attention. Universal protective measures (personal protective equipment, safe operative environment) and protocol-based patient care are necessary to prevent and control SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conservation of the resources and its rational distribution provide an ethical basis for population-based health care during a pandemic. Informed decision making serves best to patients, families, and society during the public health crisis. Conclusion COVID-19 pandemic tends to transform standard urology practice into crisis standard population-based care.

More than 500,000 new cases of cervical cancer are being diagnosed across the globe, with one woman dying of cervical cancer every 2 min. In addition, about half of cervical cancer survivors have challenges with their sexual function. Despite these findings, literature regarding the sexual function of women with cervical cancer is scanty. The study aims to assess cervical cancers impact on the sexual and physical health of women diagnosed with cervical cancer in Ghana. METHODS: The researchers of this study employed a qualitative approach with phenomenological design. A purposive sampling technique was used to select 30 participants engaged in face-to-face in-depth interviews that were audio-recorded. The content of the transcripts was analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: This study revealed that cervical cancer patients experienced low libido due to the cervical cancer symptoms and the side effects of chemotherapy. This low libido made them divert their sexual gratification from the vagina to other centers of the body. Findings further revealed that some participants showed apathy toward their partners sexual feelings. Some physical problems experienced by the participants were also unraveled. CONCLUSION: Cervical cancer affects all aspects of a womans health, including sexual function and physical well-being. Therefore, there is the need for more to help address challenges faced by cervical cancer women about their sexual and physical health.","output":"Impact of cervical cancer on the sexual and physical health of women diagnosed with cervical cancer in Ghana: A qualitative phenomenological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There exists a dilemma in the treatment of microsatellite stability (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) owing to limited therapeutic options.

In fact, countries have set their own targets and are offering incentives for people to purchase EVs as opposed to traditional gasoline-powered cars. Manufacturers have been hastily deploying charging stations to meet the charging requirements of the EVs on the road. This rapid deployment has contributed to the EV ecosystem's lack of proper security measures, raising multiple questions related to the power grid security and vulnerability. In this paper, we offer a complete examination of the EV ecosystem from the vulnerability to the attacks and finally the solutions. We start by examining the existing vulnerabilities in the EV ecosystem that can be exploited to control the EV charging and launch attacks against the power grid. We then discuss the non-linear nature of the EV charging load and simulate multiple attacks that can be launched against the power grid using these EVs. EV loads have high reactive power demand which can have a larger impact on the grid compared to residential loads. We perform simulations on two power grids and demonstrate that while the grid can recover after a 48 MW attack utilizing traditional residential loads, a smaller 30 MW EV load attack can completely destabilize the system. Finally, we suggest several patches for the existing vulnerabilities and discuss two methods aimed at detecting EV attacks.","output":"Electric Vehicle Attack Impact on Power Grid Operation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background SARS-CoV-2 testing reagents are expected to become in short supply worldwide.

METHODS Prospective pregnancy cohort study including 1503 mother-child dyads with associations between MEEV, psychopathology, and child adaptive functioning examined using cross-lagged panel analysis. Assessment occurred in the third trimester and annually across the first four years of life. RESULTS Higher pre- and postnatal maternal psychopathology predicted lower child adaptive functioning at 12 and 24 months, respectively. MEEV predicted maternal psychopathology cumulatively and offered a repeated prediction of adaptive functioning across the first two years of the child's life, operating predominantly through maternal psychopathology during pregnancy. Child effects on mothers were not observed. CONCLUSIONS Like in socioemotional assessment, pediatric assessment of child adaptive functioning should consider the intergenerational transmission of MEEV. IMPACT Associations between maternal early exposure to violence (MEEV), psychopathology, and child socioemotional development is well documented. Much less is known about the pre- and postnatal programming mechanisms, timing, and direction of effects between MEEV, maternal psychopathology, and child adaptive functioning. Findings suggest associations of both prenatal and postnatal maternal psychopathology with child adaptive functioning, though the effects of MEEV were more strongly operative through the prenatal pathway.

METHODS Case patients with microbiologically confirmed VAP (n = 30)were identified from 542 study participants with claims data and were matched by use of a primary diagnostic code, and subsequently by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, to control patients without VAP (n = 90). Costs were estimated by applying hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratios based on all-payer inpatient costs associated with VAP diagnosis-related groups. RESULTS Median total charges per patient were $198,200 for case patients and $96,540 for matched control patients (P < .001); corresponding median hospital costs were $76,730 for case patients and $41,250 for control patients (P = .001). After adjusting for diagnosis-related group payments, median losses to hospitals were $32,140 for case patients and $19,360 for control patients (P = .151). The median duration of intubation was longer for case patients than for control patients (10.1 days vs 4.7 days; P < .001), as were the median duration of intensive care unit stay (18.5 days vs 8.0 days; P < .001) and the median duration of hospitalization (26.5 days vs 14.0 days; P < .001). Examples of services likely to be directly related to VAP and having higher median costs for case patients were hospital care (P < .05) and respiratory therapy (P < .05).

However, in a large percentage of those infected, the course of the disease is asymptomatic. After the virus entry into the body, the immune system begins to produce antibodies specific to this virus (Ig - immunoglobulins) - an important factor in the formation of the immune system's defense against infection. Antibody testing is recommended as an additional method for diagnosing an acute infection or when it is impossible to study smears by amplification of nucleic acids, to identify individuals with an asymptomatic form of infection, to establish the fact of a previous infection, and also to select potential donors of immunocompetent plasma. Determination of antibodies of different classes in the blood is informative evidence of the current or past infectious process and helps to identify the stage of the infection development.

Global stakeholders have raised concerns that the pandemic is putting enormous strain on parents and other caregivers, compromising capabilities and enabling environments for nurturing care of young children and therefore likely impacting children's development. This rapid review takes stock of emerging research on nurturing care for young children during the COVID-19 crisis. Two databases were searched in addition to an extensive search for grey literature, drawing on 112 scholarly and scientific studies from more than 30 countries that have examined components of nurturing care during the pandemic, namely: responsive caregiving, early learning and play, and children's safety and security. There are some reports of unexpected positive benefits of the pandemic on families, including increased father involvement in caregiving. But more commonly, the studies' findings reveal numerous issues of concern, including parental and caregiver mental health difficulties and less responsive parent and child relationships, increased screen time among children, limited opportunities for outdoor play, and fractured systems for responding to potential child neglect and maltreatment. Evidence suggests limited access and challenges in the provision of remote learning for the youngest learners, such as those in early childhood education. The findings can inform global stakeholders, who have advocated for increased support and funding to ensure young children and other caregivers are supported and protected during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We present a comparison of electronic adherence data of stroke patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) prior to and during the COVID-19 lockdown in spring 2020 in Switzerland. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis using data from the ongoing MAAESTRO study, in which stroke patients with atrial fibrillation electronically monitor their adherence to DOAC treatment. Eligible patients for this analysis had at least four weeks of adherence data prior to and during the COVID-19 lockdown. Three adherence metrics (taking adherence, timing adherence, drug holidays) were calculated and compared descriptively. RESULTS: The analysis included eight patients (median age 81.5 years, IQR 74.8C84.5). Five patients had a pre-lockdown taking adherence over 90% (mean 96.8%  2.9), with no change during lockdown, high timing adherence in both periods and no drug holidays. The remaining three patients had pre-lockdown taking and timing adherence below 90%. Of those, two patients showed a moderate decline either in taking or timing adherence compared to pre-lockdown. One showed a substantial increase in taking and timing adherence during lockdown (both + 25.8%). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that a major disruption of social life (i.e., the imposed COVID-19 lockdown) is unlikely to relevantly affect the medication intake behaviour of patients with high pre-established adherence, but might have an impact in patients with previously suboptimal adherence.

During these unprecedented and challenging times, one institution's Department of Surgery put in place several important initiatives for promoting the well-being of trainees as they were redeployed to provide care to COVID-19 patients. In this article, the authors describe these initiatives, which fall into 3 broad categories: redeploying faculty and trainees, ensuring provider safety, and promoting trainee wellness.The redeployment initiatives are the following: reframing the team mindset, creating a culture of grace and forgiveness, establishing a multidisciplinary wellness committee, promoting centralized leadership, providing clear communication, coordinating between departments and programs, implementing phased restructuring of the department's services, establishing scheduling flexibility and redundancy, adhering to training regulations, designating a trainee ombudsperson, assessing physical health risks for high-risk individuals, and planning for structured deimplementation.Initiatives specific to promoting provider safety are appointing a trainee safety advocate, guaranteeing personal protective equipment and relevant information about these materials, providing guidance regarding safe practices at home, and offering alternative housing options when necessary.Finally, the initiatives put in place to directly promote trainee wellness are establishing an environment of psychological safety, providing mental health resources, maintaining the educational missions, solidifying a sense of community by showing appreciation, being attentive to childcare, and using social media to promote community morale.The initiatives to carry out the department's strategy presented in this article, which were well received by both faculty and trainee members of the authors' community, may be employed in other departments and even outside the context of COVID-19. The authors hope that colleagues at other institutions and departments, independent of specialty, will find the initiatives described here helpful during, and perhaps after, the pandemic as they develop their own institution-specific strategies to promote trainee wellness.","output":"Trainee Wellness and Safety in the Context of COVID-19: The Experience of One Institution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health tourism is a term that has risen from the rapid growth of industry where people from all around the world are travelling to other countries to obtain good medical care.

Methods This two-part study assessed aerosol formation when using cobas e analyzers only and in an end-to-end laboratory workflow. To estimate aerosol formation, recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was used as a surrogate marker for infectious virus particles to evaluate the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to laboratory operators. Using the HBsAg model, air sampling was performed at different positions around the cobas e analyzers and in four scenarios reflecting critical handling and/or transport locations in an end-to-end laboratory workflow. Aerosol formation of HBsAg was quantified using the Elecsys? HBsAg II quant II assay. The model was then applied to a SARS-CoV-2 context using SARS-CoV-2 infection-specific parameters to calculate viral RNA copies. Results Following application to SARS-CoV-2, the mean HBsAg uptake per hour when recalculated into viral RNA copies was 1.9 viral RNA copies across the cobas e analyzers and 0.87 viral RNA copies across all tested scenarios in an end-to-end laboratory workflow. This corresponds to a maximum aspiration rate of <16 viral RNA copies during an 8-hour shift when using cobas e analyzers and/or in an end-to-end laboratory workflow. Conclusions The low production of marker-containing aerosol when using cobas e analyzers and in an end-to-end laboratory workflow is consistent with a remote risk of laboratory-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection for laboratory operators. Summary This study investigated the formation of potentially infectious aerosols during processing of infectious samples in a model using hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) as a marker for infectious virus particles. The risk to laboratory operators of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was then inferred. Air sampling was performed around cobas e analyzers and in an end-to-end laboratory workflow, after which HBsAg was quantified and applied to SARS-CoV-2 using SARS-CoV-2 infection-specific parameters. The maximum aspiration rate of <16 viral RNA copies/8-hour shift, when applied to a SARS-CoV-2 context, poses a remote risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to laboratory operators.","output":"Aerosol Formation During Processing of Potentially Infectious Samples on Roche Immunochemistry Analyzers (cobas e analyzers) and in an End-to-End Laboratory Workflow to Model SARS-CoV-2 Infection Risk for Laboratory Operators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The suspension of memory services during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic delayed dementia diagnosis and access to early intervention. Some services responded to the challenge by developing a remote memory assessment pathway to comply with reduced social contact measures to protect vulnerable patients. The aim of the study was to establish whether remote model is considered a satisfactory experience within the context of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and to understand the factors associated with patient and carer satisfaction of remote pathway. METHOD: 73 participants recruited from patients referred to memory clinic in West Sussex, who were assessed over a video or telephone. Participants completed an 11\\\\item questionnaire capturing satisfaction across a range of elements, contextual items (the impact of the pandemic, loneliness, previous experience of using teleconference technology and diagnosis), as well as 3 dimensions from Patient Experience Questionnaire. Descriptive statistics are reported at a whole sample level, separated by patient and carer status. A hypothesis driven set of bivariate analyses (Spearmans rank) was used to understand the association between overall satisfaction and key independent factors across the whole sample. RESULTS: 73 participants were typically older adults (M=68.5, SD=13.3) and female (n=40, 54.8%). The patient was more likely to be older, feel lonely within the past week and to have used video call software when compared to the carer (p> 0.05). Participants were generally satisfied with the remote pathway with 95.8% (n=69) agreeing or strongly agreeing with the statement Overall, I was satisfied with the assessment. Patients and carers did not significantly differ on any satisfaction response, apart from the ease of use of technology, in which carers were more likely to find the technology easy to use (U= 432.5; p=0.01). Worry about contracting COVID and communication experience was positively associated with overall satisfaction, whilst perceived communication barriers were significantly negatively associated with overall satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Remote memory assessment was a positive and satisfactory experience for most patient and carers.

The aim of this study is to report the nationwide consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on unplanned hospital attendances in Denmark for 7 weeks after a 'shelter at home' order was issued. METHODS: We merged data from national registries (Civil Registration System and Patient Registry) to conduct a study of unplanned (excluding outpatient visits and elective surgery) hospital-based healthcare and mortality of all Danes. Using data for 7 weeks after the 'shelter at home' order, the incidence rate of unplanned hospital attendances per week in 2020 was compared with corresponding weeks in 2017-2019. The main outcome was hospital attendances per week as incidence rate ratios. Secondary outcomes were general population mortality and risk of death in-hospital, reported as weekly mortality rate ratios (MRRs). RESULTS: From 2 438 286 attendances in the study period, overall unplanned attendances decreased by up to 21%; attendances excluding COVID-19 were reduced by 31%; non-psychiatric by 31% and psychiatric by 30%. Out of the five most common diagnoses expected to remain stable, only schizophrenia and myocardial infarction remained stable, while chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, hip fracture and urinary tract infection fell significantly. The nationwide general population MRR rose in six of the recorded weeks, while MRR excluding patients who were COVID-19 positive only increased in two. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic and a governmental national 'shelter at home' order was associated with a marked reduction in unplanned hospital attendances with an increase in MRR for the general population in two of 7 weeks, despite exclusion of patients with COVID-19.

However, there remains a need for studies which examine the impact of COVID-19 on children and youth's mental health needs and service utilization across multiple waves of the pandemic. The present study used data from 35,162 interRAI Child and Youth Mental Health (ChYMH) assessments across 53 participating mental health agencies in Ontario, Canada, to assess the mental health presentations and referral trends of children and youth across the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in the province. Wave 1 consisted of data from March to June 2020, with Wave 2 consisting of data from September 2020 to January 2021. Data from each wave were compared to each other and to the equivalent period one year prior. While assessment volumes declined during both pandemic waves, during the second wave, child and youth assessments in low-income neighborhoods declined more than those within high-income neighborhoods. There were changes in family stressors noted in both waves. Notably, the proportion of children exposed to domestic violence and recent parental stressors increased in both waves of the pandemic, whereas there were decreases noted in the proportion of parents expressing feelings of distress, anger, or depression and reporting recent family involvement with child protection services. When comparing the two waves, while depressive symptoms and recent self-injurious attempts were more prevalent in the second wave of the pandemic when compared to the first, a decrease was noted in the prevalence of disruptive/aggressive behaviors and risk of injury to others from Wave 1 to Wave 2.

AIMS: This study was to analyze the number of colony forming units (CFUs) in bioaerosols generated during ultrasonic scaling procedure as well as to evaluate the efficacy of chlorhexidine 0.12% (CHX) preprocedural mouth rinse and high volume evacuator (HVE) in minimizing the bioaerosol contamination. METHODS: About 45 individuals were divided into three Groups A, B and C. These groups underwent ultrasonic scaling before and after the use of CHX (0.12%), HVE and combination of CHX (0.12%) and HVE. Bioaerosols were collected on blood agar plates which were incubated at 37C for 48 h, and the CFUs were counted with manual colony counting device. A comparison was also done between A versus B, B versus C and A versus C groups. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Student's t-test. RESULTS: We found a significant reduction in the CFUs when CHX (0.12%) preprocedural rinse (P < 0), or HVE (P < 0.001) or combination of both CHX (0.12%) and HVE were employed (P < 0.001). Maximum reduction in CFUs was observed when CHX (0.12%) and HVE were used in combination as compared to their individual use. A moderate significance was seen between A versus C groups but not with B versus C groups and A versus B groups.

Consequently, health care professionals from minority groups and lower socio-economic backgrounds are under-represented in the workforce. APPROACH The Socioeconomic Equity (EQ) support programme aims to increase the participation, retention and academic success of students from low socio-economic communities studying in health professional programmes at the University of Otago. At the start of the academic year, students who had attended a secondary school from a low socio-economic community were invited to take part in the EQ Programme. This includes group workshops on study skills, guidance from peer mentors, subject specific academic support, one-on-one course advice and pastoral support and activities to enhance self-esteem and self-efficacy. EVALUATION Comparing the first two years of the EQ project with the previous year, there was an increase in the percentage of students from schools in low socio-economic communities that passed HSFY.

METHODS: Python 3.7.1 was used to write a SEIR class to model the epidemic procedure and proportional estimation method to estimate the initial true infected number. The epidemic area in China was divided into three parts, Wuhan city, Hubei province (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) based on the different transmission pattern. A testing capacity limitation factor for medical resources was imposed to model the number of infected but not quarantined individuals. Baidu migration data were used to assess the number of infected individuals who migrated from Wuhan to other areas. RESULTS: Basic reproduction number, R(0), was 3.6 before the city was lockdown on Jan 23, 2020. The actual infected number the model predicted was 4508 in Wuhan before Jan 23, 2020. By January 22 2020, it was estimated that 1764 infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei province. Effective reproductive number, R, gradually decreased from 3.6 (Wuhan), 3.4 (Hubei except Wuhan,) and 3.3 (China except Hubei) in stage 1 (from Dec 08, 2019 to Jan 22, 2020) to 0.67 (Wuhan), 0.59 (Hubei except Wuhan) and 0.63 (China except Hubei) respectively. Especially after January 23, 2020 when Wuhan City was closed, the infected number showed a turning point in Wuhan. By early April, there would be 42073 (95% confidence interval, 41673 to 42475), 21342 (95% confidence interval, 21057 to 21629) and 13384 (95% confidence interval, 13158 to 13612) infected cases in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei), respectively.

In addition, considering the viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2, which peaks early in the illness, and the massive burden of the disease, which may increase in the near future, identifying well-tolerated oral antivirals becomes increasingly important. We examined the in vitro activity of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine on SARS-CoV-2, at concentrations which can be used to treat coronavirus-19 patients with little concern of toxicity. METHODS: Lopinavir/ritonavir (7/1.75 g/mL), hydroxychloroquine base (1 or 2 g/mL), or a combination thereof were administered 1 hour after the inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 to Vero cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05. We examined cytopathic effects of virus 48 hours after administration of the respective treatments and measured viral loads at three time points (0, 24, and 48 hours post-treatment) by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and compared the results obtained from the different antiviral regimens tested. RESULTS: The severity of cytopathic effects was lower in lopinavir/ritonavir-treated cells, and viral load was significantly reduced in this group compared with the control group (p < 0.001). However, hydroxychloroquine did not show significant inhibitory effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytotoxicity or on viral load at either concentration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Since 2012, the Health Care Systems Research Collaboratory has served as the resource coordinating center for 21 pragmatic clinical trial demonstration projects. The EHR Core working group invited these demonstration projects to complete a written semistructured survey and used an inductive approach to review responses and identify EHR-related challenges and suggested EHR enhancements. RESULTS: We received survey responses from 20 projects and identified 21 challenges that fell into 6 broad themes: (1) inadequate collection of patient-reported outcome data, (2) lack of structured data collection, (3) data standardization, (4) resources to support customization of EHRs, (5) difficulties aggregating data across sites, and (6) accessing EHR data. DISCUSSION: Based on these findings, we formulated 6 prerequisites for PCTs that would enable the conduct of pragmatic research: (1) integrate the collection of patient-centered data into EHR systems, (2) facilitate structured research data collection by leveraging standard EHR functions, usable interfaces, and standard workflows, (3) support the creation of high-quality research data by using standards, (4) ensure adequate IT staff to support embedded research, (5) create aggregate, multidata type resources for multisite trials, and (6) create re-usable and automated queries.

This study aimed to provide an overview of the current situation of anti-COVID-19 measures in Japanese enterprises during the winter, considering company size. METHODS: This study was an Internet-based nationwide cross-sectional study. Individuals who were registered as full-time workers were invited to participate in the survey. Data were collected using an online self-administered questionnaire in December 2020. The chi-squared test for trend was performed to calculate the P-value for trend for each workplace measure across company sizes. RESULTS: For the 27 036 participants, across company sizes, the most prevalent workplace measure was encouraging mask wearing at work, followed by requesting that employees refrain from going to work when ill and restricting work-related social gatherings and entertainment. These measures were implemented by approximately 90% of large-scale enterprises and by more than 40% of micro- and small-scale enterprises. In contrast, encouraging remote working was implemented by less than half of large-scale enterprises and by around 20% of micro- and small-scale enterprises. There were statistically significant differences in all workplace measures by company size (all P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We found that various responses to COVID-19 had been taken in workplaces.

Following a synthesis of each major line of literature, we discuss how science-based principles of message design can be used in COVID-19 public health messaging. Additionally, we identify emerging challenges for public health messaging during the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss possible remedies. We conclude that communication science offers promising public health messaging strategies for combatting COVID-19 and future pandemics.","output":"Public Health Messaging during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond: Lessons from Communication Science"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has developed into a pandemic, yet still has many unknowns. The modalities of transmission, different symptoms and manifestations as well as concomitant circumstances of the disease are insufficiently characterized. Especially patient groups in special situations like pregnant women and newborns have to be considered separately. The current knowledge about pregnancy, labor and the first days of life is characterized by particular uncertainty due to the scarce data available. However, there is currently no evidence of significant unfavorable maternal and perinatal outcome. Many pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection remain asymptomatic. The possibility of vertical transmission to the child cannot be excluded with certainty. However, indications of vertical transmission were detected only in individual cases. Newborn infections are also rather rare, unspecific and usually mild, with respiratory symptoms dominating. In this article, the data available to date are examined in order to provide better information, advice and treatment for pregnant women and newborns with SARS-CoV-2 and to provide suggestions for future research.","output":"Perinatale Aspekte der SARS-CoV-2 Infektion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Critically ill COVID-19 patients are generally admitted to the ICU for respiratory insufficiency which can evolve into a multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome requiring extracorporeal organ support.

Students presence in the operating theater and on wards is reduced to a bare minimum and face-to-face teaching is diminished. Aim of this study was therefore to evaluate alternative but feasible educational concepts, such as an online-only-platform for undergraduates. OBJECTIVE: A new online platform for undergraduate surgical education was implemented. A virtual curriculum for online-only education was designed. METHODS: A video-based online platform was designed. Following this, a cohort of medical students participating in a (voluntary) surgical course was randomized into a test and control group. Prior to conducting a written exam, students in the test group prepared using the video platform. Students in the control group prepared with standard surgical text books. Results of the exam were used to compare educational means. RESULTS: Students in the test group preparing through the video-based online platform reached significantly higher scores in the written exams (p = 0.0001) than students of the control group. A trend towards reduced preparation time that did not reach statistical significance was detectable in the test group (p = 0.090). Scores of perceived workload and desire to become a surgeon offered no differences between the groups. (p = 0.474 and 1.000). CONCLUSIONS: An online-only, virtual curriculum proved feasible for surgical education in undergraduates. While blended learning concepts were applied in both groups, only the test group had access to case-based videos of surgical procedures and scored significantly better in the written exams. Thus, video-based virtual education offers a realistic alternative to face-to-face teaching or conventional text books in times of restricted access to the operating theatre.","output":"Development of a tailor\\\\made surgical online learning platform, ensuring surgical education in times of the COVID19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Clinical education represents the most important formative period in undergraduate medical education. It is often criticised as haphazard and inefficient. Experience-based learning (ExBL) is a novel clinical education design that utilises practices of support, learner participation and real patient learning to enhance students' development of vital professional capabilities. We introduced ExBL to address the challenges of a 50% reduction in clinical placement time that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic. APPROACH: Final year medical students were assimilated into clinical teams as co-workers to facilitate learning through participation rather than observation. Placement education was supported by an integrated case-based learning and high-fidelity simulation program. Real patient learning in workplace contexts was supported by a network of clinician mentors. EVALUATION: A qualitative evaluation revealed that granting students co-worker status strongly supported participatory learning and professional identity formation. Furthermore, the triangulation of placements with cognitive coaching and high-fidelity simulation greatly enhanced skills development and students' sense of readiness for practice. IMPLICATIONS: Utilisation of ExBL significantly enhanced the quality of informal learning on clinical placements despite the reduced clinical placement time. In addition, the integration of cognitive coaching with simulation opportunities meant students were better prepared for meaningful participation as members of clinical teams. The introduction of ExBL increased the workload of clinical teachers. Moreover, favouring learning through participatory experience reduced exposure to more traditional formal bedside teaching encounters. Despite these challenges, we have adopted an ExBL model created in a crisis as our core educational design for our final year clinical programme.","output":"Experience-based learning: how a crisis solution informed fundamental change in a clinical education curriculum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cross-sectional study compared hospital staff who had received influenza or COVID-19 vaccination or who had refused COVID-19 vaccination in terms of attitudes towards each vaccination, uptake of influenza vaccination and reasons for refusing COVID-19 vaccination.

Several guidelines recommend the use of either unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparins in preventing thrombotic events in these patients. However, results from clinical studies, so far published, reached controversial conclusions on heparin efficacy in this kind of patients since the incidence of venous thromboembolism remains high despite prophylaxis. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties of heparins and their efficacy and safety in SARS-CoV-2 medical ward-patients. Moreover, anatomical findings and ongoing trials are also reported. Finally, this narrative review tries to explain why heparins fail to prevent venous thrombosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS We searched for the most relevant published studies on heparins and 2019-nCoV infected patients using the MEDLINE electronic database in the period between January and December 2020. Articles were preliminarily defined as eligible if they: a) were in English language, b) enrolled 250 or more medical ward-patients and 100 or more ICU-patients, c) reported results on patients treated with heparins in a percentage of at least 70% and d) performed an objectively confirmed diagnosis of VTE. RESULTS Data from medium to large scientific studies show that the incidence of venous thrombotic events in medical ward-patients with SARS-CoV-2 vary between 0% and 8.3%, while this rate is higher, from 6.2% to 49%, in Intensive Care Unit-patients. However, heparins reduce the mortality rate in these patients of about 50%. Histological findings show that thrombosis could affect capillaries, main and small-mid-sized vessels, and it is associated with diffuse alveolar damage. CONCLUSIONS Heparins have anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties, which may be of help in reducing mortality in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Failure of heparins at prophylactic dosages in preventing VTE, especially in ICU-patients, could be due to the severity of the disease. Data on the use of heparins in an early phase of the 2019-nCoV infection are still lacking.","output":"Heparins and 2019-nCoV infection: a narrative review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The virtual interview season has challenged general surgery residency programs to recruit applicants through the loss of visiting clerkships, tours, and time with residents. Webinars, increased informal resident and faculty sessions, and live-narrated video tours are potential solutions. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of these elements in virtually showcasing a residency program during the virtual interview season. DESIGN/SETTING: Prospective applicants to one general surgery residency program (Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota) were invited to attend six webinars: Program Overview, Simulation Education, Diversity, Resident Life, Mingle with Residents, and Last-Minute Q&A. An anonymous survey was sent to all registered participants of the webinars. Interviewees participated in a preinterview social hour with resident and faculty and a live-narrated video tour of our facilities during their interview. A second anonymous survey was sent to all interviewees. PARTICIPANTS: Webinars C 33% of 159 unique registrants surveyed participated. Interviews C 46% of 109 interviewees surveyed participated. RESULTS: Average satisfaction with the webinars was 9.4/10. Overall, 98% of attendees felt that the webinars gave them a feel for the program. Attendees found the Last-Minute Q&A webinar and Program Overview to be most useful. For resident-led webinars, 100% of attendees felt that themed break-out rooms were effective. Average satisfaction with the interviews was 4.4/5. Interviewees rated access to faculty and residents highly (4.4/5 and 4.5/5, respectively). 98% of interviewees found the live-narrated video tour helpful. CONCLUSIONS: A webinar curriculum can be effective in virtual residency recruitment, as prospective applicants developed a good understanding of the resident program after participating.

Video conferencing has limitations in surgical education, but more immersive techniques, such as 360 virtual reality (360VR), may have a greater role in demonstrating surgical anatomy and techniques. In person cadaveric courses and online VR resources have independently been proven to be effective educational tools. By combining both elements, we ran the first live VR cadaveric course in Urology which aimed to bridge the current educational gaps. METHODS: A combination of lectures, live surgery and recordings were made of Urological operations using multiple cameras superimposed onto 360VR view. The candidates watch using headsets that hold their smartphones and adjust their view by turning their head. 4K videos could also be watched without VR. The course, run for regional trainees, covered procedures including ureteric reimplantation, glansectomy, perineal urostomy, penile fracture and open approach to bladder with SPC insertion. Videos were either pre-recorded and supplemented with step-by-step lectures or live streamed allowing simultaneous questions and answers. Feedback was sent to candidates via an online survey. RESULTS: 15 people attended, with 100% survey completion rate. Of the attendees, 72% had little or no prior VR experience, 100%thought VR was valuable with 91% saying it was very or extremely useful. 55% have attended postgraduate cadaveric courses, with 100% reporting it would be useful. 100% thought VR added to their learning experience and 100% would attend again. Qualitative feedback highlighted 70% benefited specifically from observing procedures that they would otherwise not experience. Improvements include obtaining higher quality VR headsets and more live stream sessions. CONCLUSIONS: Utilising VR technology in the context of live cadaveric teaching allows an immersive innovative experience which is easily accessible, low cost to participants and integrates the fundamentals of education.

Although many antagonists have been developed to inhibit the metastasis of breast cancer, their practical application has been limited because of the poor solubility of many chemotherapeutic drugs in the physiological environment. Herein, a complex of E5 peptide antagonist and acetylated PAMAM G5 (PAC80) has been constructed to enhance the solubility of the peptide antagonist. The E5 peptide antagonist has been designed and it was confirmed that it could specifically bind to CXCR4, which is a chemokine receptor involved in the metastasis of several types of cancers, in our previous work. The results demonstrated that PAC80 could significantly increase the solubility of the E5 peptide in the physiological environment, as well as the affinity of the E5 peptide to CXCR4-positive cell lines, and the inhibitory effect of the E5 peptide for cell migration in vitro. Meanwhile, the passive lung metastasis model of breast cancer was established and the anti-tumor metastasis of the PAC80-E5 complex was evaluated in vivo. The results show that the PAC80-E5 complex demonstrated excellent inhibition for the tumor metastasis at an E5 dosage of 10 and 20 mg kg-1. These effects indicate a feasible strategy to apply the PAC80-peptide complex in cancer therapies to improve the solubility and bioavailability.","output":"Improving the inhibitory effect of CXCR4 peptide antagonist in tumor metastasis with an acetylated PAMAM dendrimer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conservation history of D614 residue is valuable in predicting the consequences of D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (SGP).

Forty-seven HAEs (15%) were performed urgently to manage refractory symptoms in inpatients (urgent group), and 273 HAEs (85%) were elective (elective group). Overall survival (OS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methodology. Complications were categorized per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine independent predictors for OS, complications, and 30-day mortality. The independent factors were combined to develop clinical risk score groups. RESULTS Urgent HAE (P = .007), greater than 50% liver replacement by tumor (P < .0001), and extrahepatic metastasis (P = .007) were independent predictors for shorter OS. Patients with all three risk factors had decreased OS versus those with none (median, 8.5 vs 86 mo; P < .001). Thirty-day mortality was significantly lower in the elective (1%) versus the urgent group (8.5%; P = .0009).

Design: A qualitative descriptive design was used. Method: From December 2019 to May 2020, a one-to-one, semi-structured in-depth interview with 10 critical care nurses from two intensive care units in a tertiary general hospital with 3,200 beds in China was conducted using the method of purposeful sampling. The data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Findings: The perception of physical restraints among critical care nurses was that patient comfort can be sacrificed for patient safety. Physical restraints protected patient safety by preventing patients from unplanned extubation but influenced patient comfort. Physical restraints were common practice of critical care nurses. Relative physical restraints provided patients with more freedom of movement and rationalization of physical restraints which were the practical strategies. Conclusion: The study identified problems in critical care nurses' perception and practice on physical restraints. Critical care nurses are confident that physical restraints can protect patient safety, and the influence of physical restraints on patient comfort is just like the side effect. Although physical restraints were common practice, critical care nurses still faced dilemmas in the implementation of physical restraints. Relative physical restraints and rationalization of physical restraints help critical care nurses cope with the bad feelings, which may also be the cause of unplanned extubation. It is necessary for the adaptation of clinical practice guidelines about physical restraints for critically ill patients in the Chinese context, to change the perception and practice of critical care nurses and deliver safe and high-quality patient care.","output":"Patient Comfort Can Be Sacrificed for Patient SafetyPerception and Practice Reported by Critical Care Nurses Toward Physical Restraints: A Qualitative Descriptive Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 32-year-old multiparous woman at 29 weeks of gestation developed dizziness, fainting, meaningless and difficult speech, stiffness in the extremities, and movement limitation following the non-severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection.

This study aimed to analyze the determinants of a household's food insecurity status in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia. A panel data of 2,410 households in a six-round High-Frequency Phone Survey were retrieved from the World Bank database. The product of corresponding pairwise severity weight and household responses to each coping strategy was summed to get the individual's Coping Strategy Index. The Random Effect Model (REM) for panel data analysis was used to identify factors associated with household-related food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic. The descriptive statistics result shows that 18.63% and 11.08% of rural households and 56.55% and 38.13% of urban residents were food secure in the first and sixth rounds, respectively. On the contrary, 3.65% and 3.2% of rural households and 6.8% and 7.18% of the urban household got severe food insecurity from the first to the sixth round, respectively. Most households have maintained their food security in urban areas than rural residents. However, the number of food secure households was gradually reduced from Round-1 to Round-6. Besides, REM output indicates that access to financial services, farm income, wage employment, income from property, investment, and savings, and NGO assistance were negatively affected household's food insecurity. Whereas, government support showed a positive association with households' food insecurity. Based on the findings, we recommend that households should adopt the behavior of enhancing and diversifying their source of income and the government also emphasize establishing national social security services by taking experience from NGOs emergency response mechanism.","output":"Prevalence of Household Food Insecurity in Ethiopia during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from panel data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesThe COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected workers mental health. We investigated changes in UK workers mental health by industry, social class, and occupation and differential effects by UK country of residence, gender and age. MethodsWe used representative Understanding Society data from 6,474 adults (41,207 observations) in paid employment who participated in pre-pandemic (2017-2020) and at least one COVID-19 survey. The outcome was psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire-12; score>=4). Exposures were industry, social class and occupation and are examined separately. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to estimate relative (OR) and absolute (%) increases in distress before and during pandemic. Differential effects were investigated for UK countries of residence (Non-England/England), gender (Male/female), and age (Younger/Older) using 3-way interaction effects. ResultsPsychological distress increased in relative terms most for professional, scientific and technical (OR:3.15, 95% CI 2.17-4.59) industry in the pandemic versus pre-pandemic period. Absolute risk increased most in hospitality (+11.4%). For social class, small employers/self-employed were most affected in relative and absolute terms (OR:3.24, 95% CI 2.28-4.63; +10.3%). Across occupations Sales and customer service (OR:3.01, 95% CI 1.61-5.62; +10.7%) had the greatest increase. Analysis with 3-way interactions showed considerable gender differences, while for UK country of residence and age results are mixed.

Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are becoming more common with some healthcare-associated pneumonia events. Early detection of MDRO risk improves the outcomes; however, MDROs risk in pneumonia with sepsis is unknown. This study investigated the disease outcomes of pneumonia with septic shock in patients admitted in the emergency department (ED) intensive care unit (ICU), a population with a high prevalence of MDROs, after early screening of MDROs risk. METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, patients with pneumonia and early septic shock (n = 533) admitted to the ED at the Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital from 2013 to 2019 were selected. The study population was divided into four subgroups after the MDROs risk and screening procedure were completed within 1 or 6 hours of admission. ICU mortality and multidrug antibiotic therapy were compared. RESULTS The high-risk MDROs groups had higher percentage of P. aeruginosa than the low-risk group. Furthermore, the appropriate ED first antibiotics were higher in the 1-hour subgroup than in the 6-hour subgroup of the high-risk MDROs group. In multivariate analysis, the 6-hour high-risk MDROs group had an adjusted odds ratio of 7.191 (95% CI: 2.911-17.767, p < 0.001) and 2.917 (95% CI:1.456-5.847, p = 0.003) for ICU mortality and multidrug therapy in the ICU, respectively, after adjusting for other confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS MDRO screening within 1 hour is recommended following admission of patients with pneumonia and early septic shock in the ED, especially in areas with a high prevalence of MDROs.","output":"Early Screening of Risk for Multi-Drug Resistant Organisms in the Emergency Department In Patients With Pneumonia And Early Septic Shock: Single-Center, Retrospective Cohort Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluated a lyophilized CRISPR-Cas12 assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection (Lyo-CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit) based on reverse transcription, isothermal amplification, and CRISPR-Cas12 reaction.

A randomized crossover study was conducted in 12 pigs intubated with double-lumen endobronchial tube to achieve lung separation. During CPR, the animals underwent three 5-min ventilation trials based on a randomized crossover design: left-lung, right-lung, or two-lung ventilation. Arterial blood gases were measured at the end of each ventilation trial. Ventilation was provided using the same tidal volume throughout the ventilation trials. Comparison using generalized linear mixed model revealed no significant group effects with respect to aortic pressure, coronary perfusion pressure, and carotid blood flow; however, significant group effect in terms of ETCO2 was found (P < 0.001). In the post hoc analyses, ETCO2 was lower during the right-lung ventilation than during the two-lung (P = 0.006) or left-lung ventilation (P < 0.001). However, no difference in ETCO2 was detected between the left-lung and two-lung ventilations.

Furthermore, the impact of COVID-19 on subsequent health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has so far not been described. We aimed to evaluate the HRQoL in relation to the severity of COVID-19 in a cohort of survivors. Methods: We conducted a population-based study investigating the outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with UC and CD in Denmark. The Danish COVID-19 IBD Database is an extensive populationbased database which prospectively monitors the disease course of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among patients with UC and CD. Severe COVID-19 was defined as COVID-19 necessitating intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, or death, while adverse COVID- 19 was defined as requirement of COVID-19 related hospitalization. HRQoL was assessed using several validated questionnaires, including the EuroQol five-dimension five-level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire, EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS), Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ), IBD Disability Index (IBD-DI), and IBD Fatigue Score. Results: HRQoL after COVID-19 was assessed among 137/319 (42.9%) patients with UC of whom 125 (91.2%) and 12 (8.8%) patients experienced mild and adverse COVID-19, respectively. Furthermore, HRQoL was assessed among 85/197 (43.1%) patients with CD of whom 74 (87.1%) and 11 (12.9%) patients experienced mild and adverse COVID-19, respectively. HRQoL was assessed after a median of 5.1 months (IQR 4.5-7.9) after infection. Baseline characteristics are presented according to the availability of HRQoL data in Table 1. No difference was observed in terms of EQ-5D-5L among patients with UC and CD or patients with mild, adverse, or severe COVID-19 (Table 2). Accordingly, the SIBDQ scores were similar among patients with mild, adverse or severe COVID-19 and UC (mild: median 59 (IQR 50-65), adverse: 62 (54-65), severe: 62 (54-65), p=0.89) or CD (mild: 57 (46- 65), 58 (49-64), 58 (49-64), p=0.91) as well, and no difference was observed in the subscores (Table 2).

METHODS: The patient is a 68-year-old man with a prior history of parathyroidectomy, who initially presented with a severe hypercalcemia of 16.3 mg/dL and a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 2692 pg/mL on routine labs. RESULTS: Diagnostic and staging work up revealed a 7.2-cm mass extending from just superior to the sternal notch into the right posterior mediastinum to the carina, causing esophageal displacement. No evidence of local invasion or distant metastasis was observed on further imaging, and cytology demonstrated hypercellular parathyroid tissue. The PTH level of the aspirate was >5000 pg/mL. The patient subsequently underwent a right hand-assisted video-assisted thoracoscopic resection of the intrathoracic mass. Final pathology identified a 7.0-cm, 57-g parathyroid adenoma, without any pathologic findings suspicious for malignancy. However, the endocrine surgery team plans for annual laboratory assessment to ensure no recurrence. CONCLUSION: Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by a single adenoma. However, in the setting of severe hypercalcemia and elevated PTH, one must have a high suspicion for malignancy, and care should be taken to remove the mass en bloc. For extremely large adenomas extending into the mediastinum, a minimally invasive, hand-assisted, thoracoscopic approach is a safe and effective method of resection.","output":"Hypercalcemic Crisis Caused by a Parathyroid Mass Requiring Thoracoscopic Resection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antiviral response in a pan-tumor immune monitoring (CAPTURE) ( NCT03226886 ) is a prospective cohort study of COVID-19 immunity in patients with cancer.

By comparison with individuals without cancer, patients with hematological, but not solid, malignancies had reduced neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses. Seroconversion showed poor concordance with NAbT against VOC. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection boosted the NAb response including against VOC, and anti-CD20 treatment was associated with undetectable NAbT. Vaccine-induced T cell responses were detected in 80% of patients and were comparable between vaccines or cancer types. Our results have implications for the management of patients with cancer during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Adaptive immunity and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern following vaccination in patients with cancer: the CAPTURE study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: At Brigham and Women's Hospital, we identified the need for a comprehensive training program designed to prepare frontline staff to safely manage a patient with Ebola viral disease (EVD). The primary goal of this program was to ensure the safety of staff, patients, and the general public by training staff in the correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE) before, during, and after care of patients with EVD. METHODS: We delivered a 4-hour experiential training program to frontline health care professionals who would be expected to care for a patient with EVD. The program occurred in a simulation center with multiple flexible spaces and consisted of demonstration, multiple skills practice sessions, and a patient simulation case. We analyzed completed pre- and posttraining questionnaires. The questionnaire assessed their subjective level of confidence in three key areas: donning and doffing PPE, performing clinical skills while wearing PPE, and management of a contamination breach. RESULTS: This program was effectively deployed in the STRATUS Center for Medical Simulation over a 4-month period, with 220 health care professionals participating in the training and 195 participants completing the pre-/posttraining questionnaires. Our intervention significantly increased the confidence of participants on each primary objective (p = .001 for all three stations). DISCUSSION: This interprofessional simulation-based program has been shown to be a well-received method of training clinicians to manage patients collaboratively during an EVD outbreak. Our intent is that the skills taught in this training program would also be transferable to management of other infectious diseases in the clinical setting.","output":"Ebola Emergency Preparedness: Simulation Training for Frontline Health Care Professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Santiago River is one of Mexico's most polluted waterways and evaluating its surface water quality during the COVID-19 outbreak is critical to assessing the changes and improvements, if any, from the nationwide lockdown (April-May 2020).

The values of BOD (14%), COD (29%), TSS (7%), f. coli (31%), t. coli (14%) and Pb (20%) declined, while pH, EC, turbidity, total nitrogen and As enhanced by 0.3-21% during the lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown period suggesting decrements of organic load in the river due to the temporary closure of industrial and commercial activities. An eleven-year comparison estimated the reduction of pH, TSS, COD, total nitrogen and Pb by 1-38%. The analysis of water quality index estimates showed short-term improvements of river water quality in the lockdown period, compared to pre-lockdown and eleven-year trend as well as indicated very poor quality of the river. The contamination sources identified by factor analysis were mainly related to untreated domestic sewage, industrial wastewaters and agriculture effluents influencing the river water quality.

Because of their huge surface area and related high reactivity, nanomaterials perform better in environmental clean-up than other conventional approaches. They can be modified for specific uses to provide novel features. Due to the large surface-area-to-volume ratio and the presence of a larger number of reactive sites, nanoscale materials can be extremely reactive.

A major objective of managing hospitalized patients with documented or suspected COVID-19 infection is the rapid identification of features associated with severe illness using readily available laboratory tests and clinical tools. The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score is a validated tool to facilitate the identification of patients at risk of dying from sepsis. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the discriminatory accuracy of the SOFA score in predicting clinical decompensation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis at a three-hospital health system, comprised of one tertiary and two community hospitals, located in the Chicago metropolitan area. All patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 testing and were hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. The primary outcome was clinical decompensation, defined as the composite endpoint of death, ICU admission, or need for intubation. We utilized the most abnormal laboratory values observed during the admission to calculate the SOFA score. Receiver Operating Curves (ROC) were then constructed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of SOFA scores. RESULTS: Between March 1st and May 31st 2020, 1029 patients were included in our analysis with 367 patients meeting the study endpoint. The median SOFA score was 2.0 IQR (Q1, Q3 1,4) for the entire cohort. Patients who had in-hospital mortality had a median SOFA score of 4.0 (Q1,Q3 3,7). In patients that met the primary composite endpoint, the median SOFA score was 3.0, IQR (Q1, Q3 2,6). The ROC was 0.776 (95% CI 0.746C0.806, p<0.01).

If required, the investigator aimed to close the loop in this audit by educating orthopaedic surgeons on the necessary standards of obtaining written consent for orthopaedic trauma. Methods Following being granted approval by our institutional audit committee, a pre-intervention cycle was performed to assess the quality of consent obtained in written format using electronic patient records in consecutive patients over a four-week period. Following the analysis of this data, an education session was provided for all orthopaedic doctors responsible for obtaining informed written consent from patients who are planned to undergo operative management of a soft tissue or bony injury by the trauma and orthopaedic service in the emergency setting. Thereafter, a post-intervention cycle was performed with subsequent descriptive analysis using the GraphPad software. Results In the pre-intervention audit cycle, all included (n = 107) consent forms (100%) correctly included the patients name, date of birth (DOB) and institutional board number (BN). However, only 79 consent forms (74.5%) were completed without using abbreviations or acronyms of any kind, whilst 81 consent forms (76.4%) were completed without correctly stating the side or site of the planned intervention. In the post-intervention cycle, all included (n = 40) consent forms (100%) correctly included the patients name, DOB and institutional BN. Additionally, a total of 37 consent forms (92.5%) were correctly completed without using abbreviations or acronyms of any kind (74.5% versus 92.5%, p = 0.02). Furthermore, a total of 39 consent forms (97.5%) were completed correctly stating the side or site of the planned intervention (76.4% versus 97.5%, p = 0.0015). Conclusion This closed-loop audit found that the quality of informed consent obtained by orthopaedic surgeons in the emergency setting might potentially be significantly improved with at least one virtual education session. Such simple education sessions may potentially improve the documentation of the planned potential operative intervention by orthopaedic surgeons for cases of orthopaedic trauma to ensure patient safety is optimised.

We reviewed the electronic medical records of patients positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (the COVID-19 virus) on qualitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay, who were admitted between 3/8-6/14/20. We assessed risk factors for mortality using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. Results. We included 565 patients with mean age (standard deviation) 64.4 (16.2) years, 52.0% male (294) and 77.2% (436) black/African American. The overall mean body mass index (BMI) was 32.0 (9.02) kg/m2.

Other common comorbidities were chronic kidney disease (40.1%), chronic pulmonary disease (30.3%), active cancer (13%), and immunosuppression (13%). The Confusion, BUN, Respiratory Rate, Systolic BP and age 65 (CURB-65) score at admission was >2 in 40.7% of patients. During hospitalization, 77.8% of patients received antivirals, 43.3% systemic corticosteroids, and 22.2% full anticoagulation. The rate of bacterial co-infection was 5.5%, and 105 (32.4%) patients had an increased level of troponin I. The median time from initiation of therapy to death was 5 days (IQR 3.0C8.0). In 45 patients (13.9%), the death was exclusively attributed to COVID-19, and in 254 patients (78.4%), both COVID-19 and the clinical status before admission contributed to death. Progressive respiratory failure was the most frequent cause of death (92.0%). Twenty-five patients (7.7%) had an unexpected death. Factors independently associated with unexpected death were male sex, chronic kidney disease, insulin-treated diabetes, and functional independence. Conclusions: This case series provides in-depth characterization of hospitalized non-ICU COVID-19 patients who died in Madrid. Male sex, insulin-treated diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and independency for activities of daily living are predictors of unexpected death.","output":"The SADDEN DEATH Study: Results from a Pilot Study in Non-ICU COVID-19 Spanish Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important medical imaging modality, but its acquisition speed is quite slow due to the physiological limitations. Recently, super-resolution methods have shown excellent performance in accelerating MRI. In some circumstances, it is difficult to obtain high-resolution images even with prolonged scan time. Therefore, we proposed a novel super-resolution method that uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) with cyclic loss and attention mechanism to generate high-resolution MR images from low-resolution MR images by a factor of 2. We implemented our model on pelvic images from healthy subjects as training and validation data, while those data from patients were used for testing. The MR dataset was obtained using different imaging sequences, including T2, T2W SPAIR, and mDIXON-W. Four methods, i.e., BICUBIC, SRCNN, SRGAN, and EDSR were used for comparison. Structural similarity, peak signal to noise ratio, root mean square error, and variance inflation factor were used as calculation indicators to evaluate the performances of the proposed method. Various experimental results showed that our method can better restore the details of the high-resolution MR image as compared to the other methods. In addition, the reconstructed high-resolution MR image can provide better lesion textures in the tumor patients, which is promising to be used in clinical diagnosis.","output":"High-Resolution Pelvic MRI Reconstruction Using a Generative Adversarial Network with Attention and Cyclic Loss"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECT: In this study, we aimed to explore the influences of stress responses and negative emotion on mental health of college students during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 1,351 college students, aged 18C23 years, took part in an online survey during the COVID-19 outbreak. The ANOVA, correlation coefficients, structural equation modeling (path analysis), and other statistical analysis methods were used for data analysis. RESULTS: (1) The Chinese college students' epidemic panic and cognitive evaluation were found to be moderate (3.73  0.74, 3.76  0.62), while their defensive response was higher (4.61  0.55). Their mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak was found to be good (3.75  0.76). (2) The quality of their mental health was significantly and negatively associated with epidemic panic, and the quality of their mental health was significantly and positively associated with defensive response. (3) The quality of their mental health was significantly and negatively associated with negative emotion. (4) College students' epidemic panic and defensive response to the COVID-19 had a directly predictive effect on their mental health.

Memory formation can be investigated through repetition effects, the common finding that neural activity is altered when stimuli are repeated. However, whether differences in this indirect measure of memory formation relate to lifespan differences in memory specificity has not yet been established. In the present study, we examined repetition effects in event-related potentials and their relation to recognition. During incidental encoding, children (aged 7C9 years), young adults (18C30 years), and older adults (65C76 years) viewed repeated object images from different categories. During subsequent recognition, we distinguished memory for the specific items versus the general categories. We identified repetition suppression in all age groups, and repetition enhancement for adults. Furthermore, individual item recognition performance comprising lure discrimination was positively associated with the magnitude of the neural repetition effects, which did not differ between groups, indicating common neural mechanisms of memory formation. Our findings demonstrate that neural repetition effects reflect the formation of highly specific memory representations and highlight their significance as a neural indicator of individual differences in episodic memory encoding across the lifespan.","output":"Memory specificity is linked to repetition effects in event-related potentials across the lifespan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess global trends in otolaryngologic and non-otolaryngologic education in response to COVID-19, specifically with regard to surgical simulation and personnel reallocation needs in case of patient demand.

The survey was open for responses for ten days in March 2020. RESULTS: A total of 96 completed surveys were received across 22 countries. 87.5% of respondents reported that no supplementary operative education is being provided. Despite 71.43% of responses indicating that simulation was useful for all levels of residents, 20.95% of responses indicated that simulation is not possible at their institution, with the majority of these being skewed toward responses from South America. CONCLUSION: Despite the majority of respondents stating that simulation was helpful, there were disparities in access to simulation seen across countries.

It has historically been deployed to streamline healthcare delivery and reach those who would previously have faced obstacles to accessing services.

Despite recommendation by the World Health Organization, countries have been slow to embrace such technology in the health sector.

The goal of this pilot study is to investigate the feasibility of measuring lower airways inflammation in patients with ARDS using repeated endotracheal aspirates (ETAs). METHODS ETAs were obtained within 24 hours by intensive care unit admission from 25 mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS and 10 of them underwent a second ETA within 96 hours after the first sampling. In each sample, cell viability was assessed using trypan blue exclusion method and the total and differential cell counts were measured using Neubauer-improved cell counting chamber and cytospins stained with Diff-Quik. RESULTS The median cell viability was 89 (IQR 80-93)%, with a median total cell count of 305 (IQR 130-1270)103/mL and a median macrophage, neutrophil, lymphocyte and eosinophil count, respectively, of 19.8 (IQR 5.4-71.6)103/mL; 279 (IQR 109-1213)103/mL; 0 (IQR 0-0.188)103/mL; 0 (IQR 0-1.050)103/mL. Eosinophil count in the ETA correlated with the number of blood eosinophils (r=0.4840, p=0.0142). Cell viability and total and differential cell counts were neither significantly different in the second ETA compared with the first ETA nor were unaffected by the presence or absence of bacteria in the blood and/or ETA, or by the ARDS aetiology, apart from the macrophage count which was significantly increased in patients with ARDS associated with acute pancreatitis compared with those associated with pneumonia (p=0.0143). CONCLUSIONS ETA can be used to investigate the cellularity of the lower airways in patients with ARDS and it is an easy-to-perform and non-invasive procedure. Eosinophil counts in ETA and blood are significantly correlated.

This article presents an evidence-based hypothesis that activating the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway is a potential target for COVID-19. Interferons (IFNs) have broad-spectrum antiviral activity including against SARS-CoV-2. Induction of HO-1 and increase in the heme catabolism end-product confer antiviral activity. IFN activation results in inhibition of viral replication in various viral infections. COVID-19 induced inflammation as well as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and coagulopathies are now known major causes of mortality. A protective role of HO-1 induction in inflammation, inflammation-induced coagulation, and ARDS has been reported.

If an association is established, it might be helpful in identifying patients at high risk. Hence, we hypothesize that HO-1 pathway activation could be a therapeutic strategy against COVID-19 and associated complications.","output":"Heme oxygenase-1 modulation: A potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 and associated complications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUNDS The oldest-old population is increasing sharply in China, and intergenerational support has been their primary source of caregiving. Although intergenerational support has been found to be associated with wellbeing of older people in previous study, most analysis were from the perspective of children's characteristics and exchange patterns. This study aims to investigate the impact of different types of intergenerational support on subjective wellbeing among Chinese oldest-old and the variation across groups of different economic status, based on their five-tier of needs (physiological needs, safety needs, love/belonging needs, esteem needs, and self-actualization needs). METHODS We included older adults aged  80 years from the 2018 Chinese longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). We assessed older people's subjective wellbeing by their life satisfaction and psychological health. We evaluated four types of intergenerational support: parents provide financial support, receive financial, instrumental and emotional support. We applied binary logistic regression analysis to analyze the association between different intergenerational support and older people's subjective wellbeing and the moderating effect of self-rated economic status on this relationship. RESULTS A total of 8.794 participants were included, with a mean age of 91,46 years (standard deviation:7.60). Older adults who provide financial support (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.85) and receive emotional support (OR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.40, 2.83) report better subjective wellbeing. However, receiving instrumental support depressed psychological health (OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.79) while improved life satisfaction (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.55). Receiving emotional support promoted parents' psychological health among all combinations of support, and receiving all the three types together raised their subjective wellbeing most. CONCLUSIONS Our study recognizes that higher level of subjective wellbeing for oldest-old is related to providing financial support, receiving emotional and certain instrumental support. In addition, higher economic status can moderate these associations.","output":"Intergenerational support and subjective wellbeing among oldest-old in China: the moderating role of economic status."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In last two decade world suffer with three epidemic diseases like SARS-CoV, H1N1 influenza, MERS CCoV and presently the world under a pandemic of Covid-19, out of these SARS-CoV, MERS CCoV and Covid-19 are form the same virus call as corona, which primary present on bats and transferred from ani-mal to human, and then it transfer from human to human mostly by respiratory droplets or in the direct contact with the diseased person, these recurrent infection of corona virus is the burning issue in the word, so to avoid these recurrent infections good habitual behaviour with regular immune booster medicine should be taken which can be used in both normal and symptomatic patient for this Rasayan churna is the best drug of choice as it is used for reju-venation therapy From literally study from various recourses it is found that Rasayan churna have property anti-depressant, anti-xylotic, Immunomodu-latory, Anti-diabetes, anti hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, Anti-toxic effects, Anti-arthritic, Anti-cancer effects, Anti-microbial effect, and Anti-oxidant which can be useful in preventive aspect of Covid-19 in all phase like normal individual, also can be used in asymptomatic patients and symptomatic patients, clinical study can be performed for the same to evaluate the result","output":"Role of Rasayan churna in outbreak of COVID-19 as preventive and curative aspect"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advances in information and communication technology (ICT) are having an increasing impact on the practice of ophthalmology.

Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the R_0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R_0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a tunneling effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.

The causes of PHH are still not entirely understood, and its prevention and treatment are controversial. We tried to analyze the risk factors for such complication in our cohort. METHODS: We reviewed our neonatology data bank and included all preterms below 28 weeks who were born in the period between 1999 and 2014 and suffered from an intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). We reviewed gestational age, gender, birth weight, type of birth, IVH degree, comorbidities, therapy, complications, time to event, protein content of cerebrospinal fluid, and clinical follow-up. RESULTS: We identified 180 patients, divided into two subgroups, B1 with 37 cases (IVH + PHH) and B2 with 143 cases (IVH ? PHH). In group B1, the presence of IVH grades I, II, III, or IV was in 11%, 19%, and 70% respectively.

Reverse transcription (RT)-nested PCR detected GAV in spermatophores and mature ovarian tissue from broodstock and in fertilized eggs and nauplii spawned from wild-fertilized females. In laboratory-reared P. monodon (> 12 mo old) that had a high mortality rate, RT-nested PCR detected GAV in male spermatophores at levels significantly higher than that detected in the lymphoid organ. By transmission electron microscopy (TEM), GAV virions were detected in spermatophore seminal fluid, but not sperm cells. Histological evidence of hypertrophied cell foci (spheroids) and TEM observation of GAV nucleocapsids and virions in spheroid cells was also found in 100% of lymphoid organs of approximately 1.2 g juvenile P. monodon reared in the laboratory from postlarvae collected from commercial hatcheries. Sequence analysis of PCR amplicons from parental P. monodon and fertilized eggs of artificially inseminated broodstock indicated that GAV associated with eggs can originate from both the male and female parents. Although the female GAV genotype was predominant in eggs, there was some dependence on infection levels in the male and female shrimp as indicated by RT-PCR. RT-nested PCR data on GAV levels in eggs, nauplii, protozoea and PL5 progeny of the artificial matings suggests that vertically transmitted virus is most probably associated with the egg surface.","output":"Vertical transmission of gill-associated virus (GAV) in the black tiger prawn Penaeus monodon."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic crisis has led to a paradigm shift in the economy.

The study is based on theoretical research as well as empirical research based on a questionnaire applied in economic entities, and respondents are both decision makers and professional accountants. The results obtained by the statistical analysis of the questionnaire (Chi-square, Crosstabulation, Friedman test) suggest that digitization is more than a conventional change, being equally about technology and people. The orientation towards digitalization implies, in addition to a well-organized implementation plan, a change in the mentalities of the human factor corroborated with the evolution of the organizational culture of economic entities. At the same time, we are witnessing a change in the accounting paradigm, and the role of professional accountants is evolving from transaction logger to analyst and consultant for entrepreneurs.

Materials and methods: Forty-eight patients with abnormal papillary frenum were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly assigned into three groups; conventional frenectomy operation (C group), diode laser-assisted frenectomy (L group), and diode laser-assisted frenectomy with conventional horizontal incision on the periosteum (L + P group). Post-operative pain, discomfort in speaking, and chewing scores were assessed with visual analogue scale (VAS) at post-operative 3rd hour and on days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 45. Epithelialization process of the wound surface was evaluated by hydrogen peroxide solution applied to the wound on days 7, 14, 21, and 45 following operations. The distance between the frenum attachment point and mucogingival junction (FMGJ) was recorded at baseline, post-operative 45th day, and 6th month to assess the reattachment of the frenum. Plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, and probing depth were recorded at baseline and post-operative 7th, 14th, 21st, and 45th days. Results: On the 1st and 7th day after operation, VAS pain score in the C group was significantly higher than in the L and L + P groups (p < 0.017).

The purpose of this study was to investigate potential effects of psychological symptoms on quality of life in patients with psychological disorders. We recruited 124 patients with psychological disorders from a psychological teaching hospital in northern Taiwan. Data were obtained from medical records of all patients with a diagnosis of mood or adjustment disorder. We assessed psychological symptoms on the BSRS-5 and examined quality of life by using the Taiwanese version of the abbreviated World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF). We performed hierarchical linear regression analysis to explore the relationship between psychological symptoms and quality of life. The analysis revealed a significant correlation between the items on the BSRS-5 and WHOQOL and their correlations with the total scores on these assessments (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05). Our findings indicated that scores on the BSRS-5 can predict scores on quality of life.

Literature search of PubMed including all English publications from 1973 to 2021.We found 57 articles for a total of 21.791 patients; of these, 14 studies reported on arrhythmic events in the follow-up. Syncope was reported in 15.8% (3.452 of 21.791) patients. It was considered unexplained in 91% of cases. Life-threatening arrhythmic events occurred in 3.6% of non-syncopal patients and in 7.7% of syncopal patients during a mean follow-up of 5.6a?years. A relative risk of 1.99 (95%CI 1.39 to 2.86) was estimated for syncope patients by the random effect model using Haldane continuity correction for 0 events. CONCLUSIONS: In the current practice, the cause of syncope remained unexplained in most patients affected by HCM.

To anticipate vaccine preparedness in adolescents, we studied COVID-19 vaccination awareness and willingness to vaccinate before the vaccine became available. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 9153 (4575 boys, 50%) students with a mean age of 14.2 years old in four cities in China to collect information on demographic characteristics and their COVID-19 vaccination concerns. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze the influencing factors of vaccine hesitancy (not sure) and resistance (do not want it). The results showed that 2891 (31.6%) were hesitant and 765 (8.4%) were resistant to being vaccinated. Additionally, multivariable analyses showed that vaccine hesitancy and vaccine resistance were associated with living in the Beijing area (OR = 1.62; 95% CI: 1.40C1.88; OR = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.44C2.28), lack of influenza vaccination experience (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.14C1.55; OR = 1.57; 95% CI: 1.25C1.98), no perceived susceptibility (OR = 1.72; 95% CI: 1.50C1.97; OR = 3.57; 95% CI: 2.86C4.46), and perceiving no cues to action (OR = 3.24; 95% CI: 2.56C4.11; OR = 27.68; 95% CI: 21.81C35.13). Postulating a highly effective vaccine (OR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.72C0.98; OR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.52C0.83) decreased both vaccine hesitancy and resistance.

Although invariant in humans, the Env binding domain of the chimpanzee CD4 is highly polymorphic, with nine coding variants circulating in wild populations. Here, we show that within-species CD4 diversity is not unique to chimpanzees but found in many African primate species. Characterizing the outermost (D1) domain of the CD4 protein in over 500 monkeys and apes, we found polymorphic residues in 24 of 29 primate species, with as many as 11 different coding variants identified within a single species. D1 domain amino acid replacements affected SIV Env-mediated cell entry in a single-round infection assay, restricting infection in a strain- and allele-specific fashion. Several identical CD4 polymorphisms, including the addition of N-linked glycosylation sites, were found in primate species from different genera, providing striking examples of parallel evolution. Moreover, seven different guenons (Cercopithecus spp.) shared multiple distinct D1 domain variants, pointing to long-term trans-specific polymorphism. These data indicate that the HIV/SIV Env binding region of the primate CD4 protein is highly variable, both within and between species, and suggest that this diversity has been maintained by balancing selection for millions of years, at least in part to confer protection against primate lentiviruses. Although long-term SIV-infected species have evolved specific mechanisms to avoid disease progression, primate lentiviruses are intrinsically pathogenic and have left their mark on the host genome.","output":"CD4 receptor diversity represents an ancient protection mechanism against primate lentiviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A population-based, longitudinal study was conducted among 29 provinces in mainland China to investigate how public trust in physicians (PTP) changed since the outbreak of COVID-19 and how the resulting lockdown and social support contributed to its restoration.

The inhibitory effect of all studied compounds was studied with compared to some proposed antiviral drugs which currently used in COVID-19 treatment such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, baloxvir, lopinavir, and favipiravir. Homology modeling and sequence alignment was computed to evaluate the similarity between the SARS-CoV-2-3CL main protease and other SARS-CoV receptors. ADMET properties of all studied compounds were computed and reported. Also, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was performed on the compound which has the highest binding affinity inside 6LU7 obtained from molecular docking analysis to study it is stability inside receptor in explicit water solvent. Based on molecular docking analysis, we found that caulerpin has the highest binding affinity inside all studied receptors compared to other bioactive compounds and studied drugs. Our homology modeling and sequence alignment showed that SARS-CoV main protease (PDB ID: 3TNT) shares high similarity with 3CLpro (96.00%). Also, ADMET properties confirmed that caulerpin obeys Lipinskis rule and passes ADMET property, which make it a promising compound to act as a new safe natural drug against SARS-CoV-2-3CL main protease.

Studies published in English, from 1 December 2019 to 27 May 2020 were considered eligible. We included studies which mentioned testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2 of asymptomatic cancer patients before starting immunosuppressive treatments.

Two articles were cohort studies, and the remaining were expert consensuses and published guidelines. The most common recommendation among the studies in this systematic review was to test asymptomatic patients for SARS-CoV-2 prior to treatment. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of studies which directly address COVID-19 testing of asymptomatic patients before treatment. Our systematic review showed that most of the published data favours routine test for SARS-CoV-2 before initiating systemic treatment but failed to identify a good level of evidence to support these recommendations.

Efforts towards rationally designed pan-NPEV vaccines would greatly benefit from structural biology methods for rapid and comprehensive evaluation of vaccine candidates and elicited antibody responses. Towards this goal, we tested if electron-microscopy-based polyclonal epitope mapping (EMPEM), a method where structural analysis is performed using serum-derived polyclonal antibodies (pAbs), can be applied to an NPEV. EMPEM was performed on immune complexes featuring CV-A21 viral particles and CV-A21-specific pAbs isolated from mice. Notably, this is the first example of structural analysis of polyclonal immune complexes comprising whole virions. We introduce a data processing workflow that allows reconstruction of different pAbs at near-atomic resolution. The analysis resulted in identification of several antibodies targeting two immunodominant epitopes, near the 3-fold and 5-fold axis of symmetry; the latter overlapping with the receptor binding site.

Results show that more than two-thirds of the respondents experienced income shocks due to the COVID-19 crisis. Food security and dietary quality worsened, as measured by the food insecurity experience scale and the frequency of consumption of nutritionally-rich foods. The proportion of food insecure respondents increased by 38% and 44% in Kenya and Uganda respectively, and in both countries, the regular consumption of fruits decreased by about 30% during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to a normal period (before the pandemic). Results from probit regressions show that the income-poor households and those dependent on labour income were more vulnerable to income shock, and had poorer food consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to other respondent categories. As such, they were more likely to employ food-based coping strategies compared to those pursuing alternative livelihoods, who generally relied on savings. Farmers were less likely to experience worsened food security compared to other respondent categories who depended to a great extent on market sources for food.

Conversely, membership in savings and loan groups was correlated with less likelihood of suffering income shocks and reduction in food consumption. The results suggest that ongoing and future government responses should focus on structural changes in social security by developing responsive packages to cushion members pushed into poverty by such pandemics while building strong financial institutions to support the recovery of businesses in the medium term, and ensuring the resilience of food supply chains particularly those making available nutrient-dense foods.","output":"COVID-19 implications on household income and food security in Kenya and Uganda: Findings from a rapid assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to Vivian Mao, partner at Dezan Shira & Associates, if specific circumstances such as epidemics, diseases and plagues have been included in the force majeure clauses under executed contracts, the coronavirus can easily be identified as a force majeure event According to Lijun Cao, partner at Zhong Lun Law Firm, in China, force majeure clauses of commercial contracts rarely list epidemics as an example of a force majeure event, and that each case will be examined based on its own merits in accordance with the relevant provisions of PRC contract law According to Cao, where parties have set out specific requirements for the use of such certificates in the force majeure clause of their commercial contracts, for example, by specifying a particular issuing authority or the necessary contents, the certificates can be used only when these requirements are satisfied","output":"Force majeure clauses provide coronavirus relief for business"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Dengue fever has been one of the most common mosquito-transmitted diseases in the world, affecting more than 128 countries in both tropical and subtropical regions. Bangladesh has been sufferring from dengue outbreaks almost annually since 2000, and in 2019, Bangladesh faced the worst outbreak of dengue to date. This study aimed to provide clinical and biochemical profiles of Bangladesh's dengue-infected patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from August through December 2019 in three tertiary private hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We collected information on demographic data, clinical characteristics, and laboratory profiles for 542 confirmed hospitalized acute dengue cases using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: The average age of the enrolled patients was 26.15 years, and about 50% of patients belonged to the age group of 20C40 years. The most frequent among the prevalent clinical symptoms were fever (93.1%), abdominal pain (29.5%), skin rash (25.3%), and diarrhea (19.7%). 316 patients had some complications, such as breathing problems (41.4%), pleural effusion (38.9%), gum bleeding (11.1%), etc. More than 90% of the patients showed seropositivity for the DENV-NS1 antigen. CONCLUSIONS: Over the last couple of years, dengue fever has become a major health issue for Bangladesh. To reduce the burden of this disease, timely diagnosis and prompt treatment are necessary. This analysis thus yields the clinical features, laboratory profiles, and seropositivity test results of dengue patients from Bangladesh. The research results may help clinicians understand the circumstantial diagnosis of dengue patients and facilitate early intervention.","output":"Dengue outbreak 2019: clinical and laboratory profiles of dengue virus infection in Dhaka city"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeWith the explosion of digital technologies in contemporary daily life, fuelled by a pandemic and remote working, online learning and shopping and the proliferation of social platforms, much remains nebulous about the opportunities these technologies hold for social marketers beyond their previously documented use as communication and promotion tools. This paper aims to provide a rich examination of the variety of digital technologies used within social marketing and establish the scale of integration between digital technologies and social marketing.Design/methodology/approachFollowing systematic literature review procedures, a systematic literature review through eight databases was conducted. The systematic review focussed on the assessment of social marketing studies that incorporated a wide range of mature and emerging digital technologies such as the internet, mobile platforms and social media channels. A total of 50 social marketing studies (2014C2020) were analysed.FindingsThe review found that there have been major advancements in the technologies available to social marketers in recent years. Furthermore, the adoption of digital technologies by social marketers has evolved from a communication or promotion function where generic information is pushed to the citizen, towards the use of these technologies for a more personalised design, content and behaviour change intervention. In some studies, the digital technologies were the primary means for interactions and collaborations to take place. The review also found that digital technologies target more than the individual citizen. Digital technologies are used to target multi-level stakeholders, policy makers and partners as part of behavioural change interventions.Originality/valueOnly two previous reviews have synthesised digital technologies and their use in social marketing. This review provides a recent depiction of the range and scale of integration within social marketing. Specifically, it demonstrates the expansion beyond a persuasive application to their use for research, segmentation and targeting, collaboration and co-creation, the product and facilitator of service delivery.

The government of all countries in the world are in the situation to make effective steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the society. If this situation continuous means the extinction of human beings may possible. So, the foremost action towards the virus is to stop spreading from the infected to the non-infected persons. To prevent spreading of the virus, one has to maintain social distancing from other people and personal hygiene. The main mode of transmission of the COVID-19 is by the droplets of saliva and the discharge from the nose. The governments laid a strict rule to wear a mask in the public places to prevent the spreading of the virus. Various technological techniques are well applied in pandemic studies. In this case we applied a deep learning algorithm to determine whether or not an individual is wearing a face mask. This research resulted in identification of face mask in the public places which results in the lowering of spread of the virus. This model is developed using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It extracts the facial landmarks of the person and finds the face mask region.

STUDY DESIGN: In vitro biomechanical study. SAMPLE POPULATION: Twist, single-loop and double-loop cerclage configurations of 1.0 mm wire. METHODS: The peak load resisted by each cerclage type was determined (n = 6). Cerclage were loaded cyclically to 80%, 60%, 40%, or 20% of its peak load (n = 8 per load level). The number of cycles until each cerclage loosened (residual tension <10 N) was recorded. RESULTS: All wires that failed did so by loosening. Twist cerclage cycled to 390 N and 290 N loosened within the first 10 cycles, and, when cycled to 100 N, they loosened by 250 cycles. All twist knots loosened by untwisting. Single-loop cerclage cycled to 320 N loosened within 10 cycles. At 240 N, 5 single-loop cerclage resisted 250 cycles before loosening. At 160 N, 2 of the 8 single-loop cerclage did not loosen by 100 000 cycles. When cycled to 640 N, one of the double-loop cerclage did not loosen following 500 000 cycles. When cycled to 480 N, 3 of the 8 wires did not loosen. CONCLUSION: Double-loop cerclage will be tighter and are better able to resist cycling than twist or single-loop cerclage. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Use of double-loop cerclage to stabilize bone fragments or prevent fissure propagation can be expected to provide greater resistance to loosening than twist or single-loop cerclage, both initially and with repeated loading.","output":"Double-loop cerclage resists greater loads for more cycles than twist and single-loop cerclage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) caused the ongoing pandemic This pandemic devastated the world by killing more than a million people, as of October 2020 It is imperative to understand the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV2 so that novel and interdisciplinary prevention, diagnostic, and therapeutic techniques could be developed In this work, we model and analyze the transmission of SARS-CoV2 through the human respiratory tract from a molecular communication perspective We consider that virus diffusion occurs in the mucus layer so that the shape of the tract does not have a significant effect on the transmission Hence, this model reduces the inherent complexity of the human respiratory system We further provide the impulse response of SARS-CoV2-ACE2 receptor binding event to determine the proportion of the virus population reaching different regions of the respiratory tract Our findings confirm the results in the experimental literature on higher mucus flow rate causing virus migration to the lower respiratory tract These results are especially important to understand the effect of SARS-CoV2 on the different human populations at different ages who have different mucus flow rates and ACE2 receptor concentrations in the different regions of the respiratory tract IEEE","output":"Molecular Communication Theoretical Modeling and Analysis of SARS-CoV2 Transmission in Human Respiratory System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Olfactory dysfunction significantly impairs the life quality of patients but without effective treatments to date.

However, whether chitosan can further treat olfactory dysfunction in vivo remains unexplored. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effect of chitosan on a 3-methylindole-induced anosmic rat model. Intraperitoneal injection of 3-methylindole is performed to induce anosmia in rats. Experimental results demonstrate that the food-finding duration after chitosan treatment gradually decrease to around 80 s, and both the olfactory neuroepithelium (ON) thickness and mature ORNs (expressing olfactory marker protein) are significantly restored. Furthermore, proliferating cells (expressing bromodeoxyuridine) are mainly co-expressed with immature ORNs (expressing ?III tubulin) below the intermediate layer of the ON in the chitosan-treated group on day 28 following 3-methylindole treatment. Conversely, proliferating cells are scattered over the ON, and co-localized with immature ORNs and sustentacular cells (expressing keratin 18) in the sham group, and even immature ORNs go into apoptosis (expressing DNA fragmentation and cleaved caspase-3), possibly causing incomplete regeneration.

Moreover, the role of hypertension as mortality risk factor in LTCFs has not yet been clearly established. OBJECTIVES The study aimed to investigate whether treated hypertension is associated with lower mortality among older LTCF residents with multimorbidity. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study was performed in a group of 168 residents aged  65 years in three LTCFs. Initial assessment included blood pressure (BP) measurements and selected geriatric scales: MNA-SF, AMTS and ADL. Hypertension, comorbidities, pharmacotherapy, antihypertensive drugs and mortality during one-year follow-up were extracted from the medical records. The data was compared in groups: Survivors and Deceased. RESULTS Survivors and Deceased revealed similar age, DBP, number of diseases, medications, and antihypertensive drugs. However, Deceased had significantly lower SBP (P <0.05) and presented significantly worse functional, nutritional and cognitive status than Survivors (P <0.001). Hypertension (P <0.001) and antihypertensive therapy (P <0.05) were significantly more frequent among Survivors. Significantly more of the hypertensive-treated than other multimorbid residents survived the follow-up (P <0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that treated hypertension had a protective effect on mortality [OR = 0.11 (95% CI, 0.03-0.39); P <0.001]. CONCLUSIONS One-year survival of LTCF residents with treated hypertension was significantly higher than the others.

In this regard, high-throughput gene transcriptional profiling has become a leading technology, generating whole-genome data on the transcriptional alterations caused by diseases or drug compounds. However, identifying direct gene targets, especially in the background of indirect (downstream) effects, based on differential gene expressions is difficult due to the complexity of gene regulatory network governing the gene transcriptional processes. RESULTS: In this work, we developed a network analysis method, called DeltaNeTS+, for inferring direct gene targets of drugs and diseases from gene transcriptional profiles. DeltaNeTS+ uses a gene regulatory network model to identify direct perturbations to the transcription of genes using gene expression data. Importantly, DeltaNeTS+ is able to combine both steady-state and time-course expression profiles, as well as leverage information on the gene network structure. We demonstrated the power of DeltaNeTS+ in predicting gene targets using gene expression data in complex organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans and human cell lines (T-cell and Calu-3). More specifically, in an application to time-course gene expression profiles of influenza A H1N1 (swine flu) and H5N1 (avian flu) infection, DeltaNeTS+ shed light on the key differences of dynamic cellular perturbations caused by the two influenza strains. CONCLUSION: DeltaNeTS+ is a powerful network analysis tool for inferring gene targets from gene expression profiles. As demonstrated in the case studies, by incorporating available information on gene network structure, DeltaNeTS+ produces accurate predictions of direct gene targets from a small sample size (~ 10 s). Integrating static and dynamic expression data with transcriptional network structure extracted from genomic information, as enabled by DeltaNeTS+, is crucial toward personalized medicine, where treatments can be tailored to individual patients.

METHODS From March 2012 to June 2015, 178 consecutive patients (mean age 65.25.8 years; 124 men) with symptoms of atherosclerotic vertebrobasilar ischemia underwent angiography prior to stent implantation in the vertebral, subclavian, and/or carotid arteries. In this cohort, 54 patients (mean age 67.35.3 years; 40 men) had VAO stent implantation. Angiography of the vertebral artery was recorded in 2 phases with breath-hold: deep inspiration (DIP) and deep expiration (DEP). Obvious VAO tortuosity was defined as any VAO angle 120 in DIP. Obvious VAO-DRT was defined as any VAO angle increasing 60 from DIP to DEP. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) or digital subtraction angiography was used in follow-up to detect ISR and stent fracture. RESULTS Of the 178 patients in this study, 21 (11.8%) had obvious VAO tortuosity and 8 (4.5%) had obvious VAO-DRT. Two of the 21 patients with obvious VAO tortuosity also had obvious VAO-DRT. Three of the 54 VAO stent patients had VAO-DRT. There were no correlations between VAO-DRT and age, sex, risk factors, body mass index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or obvious VAO tortuosity (p>0.05). Over a mean follow-up of 2810 months, there were 4 (7.4%) asymptomatic VAO ISR cases. Two (3.7%) were occlusions at 6 and 12 months, respectively; both were associated with stent fracture in patients with obvious VAO-DRT before stenting. Both stents fractured at the tortuous VAO region. VAO-DRT was correlated with stent fracture (Spearman =0.81, p<0.01) and ISR (Spearman =0.55, p<0.01). CONCLUSION VAO-DRT could be a risk factor for stent fracture and restenosis after VAO stent implantation. Angiography in both inspiration and expiration phases, especially the latter, should be considered before VAO stenting. Using a shorter stent to avoid crossing the tortuosity could reduce the occurrence of fracture.","output":"Dynamic Respiratory Tortuosity of the Vertebral Artery Ostium."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate how personal protective equipment (PPE) guidance altered the facial hair of hospital doctors and explore the wider impact and implications of these changes.

Critical resources rarely become obsolete very quickly. However, this could happen in the case of crude oil because climate policy is forcing defossilisation, but also because artificial scarcity is falling as a result of geostrategic rivalries that are causing oversupply. This article analyses this process and the possible consequences using Saudi Arabia as an example. The development of a green hydrogen industry has potential, but it should not be overestimated in view of the absorption capacity of the economy.","output":"The Loss of Raw Material Criticality: Implications of the Collapse of Saudi Arabian Oil Exports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the discovery of SARS-CoV-2, several antigens have been proposed to be part of COVID-19 vaccines. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike protein is one of the promising candidates to develop effective vaccines since it can induce potent neutralizing antibodies. We previously reported the production of RBD in Pichia pastoris and showed it is structurally identical to the protein produced in mammalian HEK-293T cells. In this work we designed an RBD multimer construct with the purpose of increasing RBD immunogenicity. We produced multimeric particles by a transpeptidation reaction between the RBD expressed in P. pastoris and Lumazine Synthase from Brucella abortus (BLS), which is a highly immunogenic and very stable decameric protein of 170 kDa. We vaccinated mice with two doses 30 days apart, and then we measured humoral immune response. When the number of RBD copies coupled to BLS was high (6-7 RBD molecules per BLS decamer, in average), the immune response was significantly better than that elicited by RBD alone or even by RBD-BLS comprising low number of RBD copies (1-2 RBD molecules per BLS decamer). Remarkably, the construct with high number of RBD copies induced high IgG titers with high neutralizing capacity. Furthermore, a superior immune response was observed when Al(OH)3 adjuvant was added to this formulation, exhibiting a higher titer of neutralizing antibodies. Altogether our results suggest that RBD covalent coupled to BLS forming a multimer-particle shows an advantageous architecture to the antigen-presentation to the immune system which enhances immune responses. This new antigen should be considered a potent candidate for a protein-based vaccine.","output":"Production of a Highly Immunogenic Antigen from SARS-CoV-2 by Covalent Coupling of the Receptor Binding Domain of Spike Protein to a Multimeric Carrier"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Este artigo objetivou realizar uma anlise dos casos confirmados e bitos por COVID-19 em profissionais de enfermagem do estado do Amazonas.

The objective of this study was to analyze the evolution of this pandemic in Guinea, Mali, Senegal, and Burkina Faso over the first six weeks. We hypothesize that there exist significant differences in the incidence of COVID-19 between countries. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted as part of a collaborative project. Data collection focused on the epidemiological surveillance indicators available in the countries COVID-19 daily situation reports. Data were entered into a standardized Microsoft Excel spreadsheet which was exported to the STATA 15 software for analysis. Results COVID-19 had a different dynamic in the four countries over the first six weeks. Its incidence in Burkina Faso and Senegal was dropping, while it was increasing slowly in Mali;only in Guinea, it increased rapidly. The analysis of variance revealed that the differences observed in the weekly COVID-19 incidence in the four countries were statistically significant ( p ? 0.01). Different screening approaches have been used by the four countries. Guinea (n = 4,539) performed more tests compared to Senegal (n = 2,961), Burkina Faso (n = 2,455) and Mali (n = 2,397). The positivity rates were significantly higher in Mali (25.5%) and Burkina Faso (23.7%) than in Guinea (19.0%) and Senegal (9.5%) ( p ? 0.0001). Hospitalization rates by country ranged from 32.0C79.6%, with Guineas hospitalization rate (79.6%) being significantly higher as compared to that of the three other countries ( p ? 0.0001). The cure rates were significantly higher in Burkina Faso (61.4%) and Senegal (61.1%) than in Mali (37.3%) and Guinea (19.7%) ( p ? 0.0001). The case fatality rate was significantly higher in Burkina Faso (6.5%) than in Mali (5.2%) ( p ? 0.001), Guinea (0.7%), and Senegal (0.7%) ( p ? 0.0001). Conclusion This study highlighted insights from COVID-19 surveillance data, as a basis for improving response strategies in the four countries.

CD147, a receptor on host cells, is a novel route for SARS-CoV-2 invasion. Thus, drugs that interfere in the spike protein/CD147 interaction or CD147 expression may inhibit viral invasion and dissemination among other cells, including in progenitor/stem cells. Studies suggest beneficial effects of azithromycin in reducing viral load of hospitalized patients, possibly interfering with ligand/CD147 receptor interactions; however, its possible effects on SARS-CoV-2 invasion has not yet been evaluated. In addition to the possible effect in invasion, azithromycin decreases the expression of some metalloproteinases (downstream to CD147), induces anti-viral responses in primary human bronchial epithelial infected with rhinovirus, decreasing viral replication and release. Moreover, resident lung progenitor/stem are extensively differentiated into myofibroblasts during pulmonary fibrosis, a complication observed in COVID-19 patients. This process, and the possible direct viral invasion of progenitor/stem cells via CD147 or ACE2, could result in the decline of these cellular stocks and failing lung repair.

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of the pandemic on neurofibromatosis (NF) care and research. METHODS: Sixty-three United States NF clinics were surveyed to identify the impact of the pandemic on clinician role, patient volume, continuity of guideline-driven surveillance, research protocols, and use of (and satisfaction with) telehealth for the delivery of NF care. RESULTS: Fifty-two clinic directors or their representatives completed the survey (83% response rate). About 2/3 of the clinics reported a greater than 50% decrease in the number of available patient appointments, and modified clinical surveillance and research protocols. Fifty-one clinics (98%) newly instituted telehealth during the pandemic. Barriers to telehealth prior to the pandemic were insurance reimbursement concerns and lack of infrastructure. Since telehealth was initiated, high provider satisfaction was reported with ease of use. The most common area of concern was related to inability to perform a physical examination. CONCLUSION: Results show marked impacts on NF care and research since the beginning of the pandemic, with potential long-term changes related to the introduction (or adoption) of telehealth for clinical care.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on neurofibromatosis clinical care and research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a novel disease entity that is spreading throughout the world. It has been speculated that patients with comorbidities and elderly patients could be at high risk for respiratory insufficiency and death. Immunosuppression could expose infected patients to even higher risks of disease complications due to dampened immune response. However, it has been speculated that overactive immune response could drive clinical deterioration and, based on this hypothesis, several immunosuppressants are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19. METHODS: In this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with ocrelizumab (a B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody) for primary progressive multiple sclerosis who developed COVID-19. RESULTS: Despite complete B cell depletion, patient symptoms abated few days after hospitalization, and he was discharged to home-quarantine. Phone interview follow-up confirmed that, after 14 days, no new symptoms occurred.

Cats are an ideal model to test parasitic infection risk in outdoor animals because there have been many studies analysing this risk factor in this species; and there is a useful dichotomy in cat ownership between indoor-only cats and those with outdoor access. Thus, we used meta-analysis to determine whether outdoor access is a significant risk factor for parasitic infection in domestic pet cats across 19 different pathogens including many relevant to human, domestic animal and wildlife health, such as Toxoplasma gondii and Toxocara cati. Cats with outdoor access were 2.77 times more likely to be infected with parasites than indoor-only cats. Furthermore, absolute latitude trended towards significance such that each degree increase in absolute latitude increased infection likelihood by 4%. Thus, restricting outdoor access can reduce the risk of parasitic infection in cats and reduce the risk of zoonotic parasite transmission, spillover to sympatric wildlife and negative impacts on feline health.","output":"Who let the cats out?

F344 rats were exposed by inhalation 6 h/day, 5 days/wk for 13 wk to 1 of 3 dilutions of emissions from a diesel engine burning 100% soybean oil-derived fuel, or to clean air as controls. Whole emissions were diluted to nominal NO(x) concentrations of 5, 25, or 50 ppm, corresponding to approximately 0.04, 0.2, and 0.5 mg particles/m(3), respectively. Biologically significant, exposure-related effects were limited to the lung, were greater in females than in males, and were observed primarily at the highest exposure level. There was a dose-related increase in the numbers of alveolar macrophages and the numbers of particles in the macrophages, as expected from repeated exposure, but no neutrophil response even at the highest exposure level. The macrophage response was reduced 28 days after cessation of the exposure. Among the high-level females, the group mean lung weight/body weight ratio was increased, and minimal, multifocal bronchiolar metaplasia of alveolar ducts was observed in 4 of 30 rats. Lung weights were not significantly increased, and metaplasia of the alveolar ducts was not observed in males. An increase in particle-laden macrophages was the only exposure-related finding in lungs at the intermediate and low levels, with fewer macrophages and fewer particles per macrophage at the low level. Alveolar histiocytosis was observed in a few rats in both exposed and control groups.

Objective: To assess the short-term change of depressive and anxiety symptoms in relation to COVID-19 vaccination among Swedish adults. Design: A prospective cohort study with monthly data collections on self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms from December 2020 to October 2021 and COVID-19 vaccination from July to October 2021. Setting: The Omtanke2020 Study, Sweden. Participants: 7,925 participants of the Omtanke2020 study with complete data on depressive and anxiety symptoms and vaccination status. Intervention(s) or Exposure(s): Receiving the first or second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Main outcomes(s) and Measure(s): Binary measures of depression (PHQ-9, cut-off [] 10) and anxiety (GAD-7, cut-off [] 10) one month before the first dose, one month after the first dose, and, if applicable, one month after the second dose. For individuals not vaccinated or chose to not report vaccination status (unvaccinated individuals), we selected three monthly measures of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 with 2-month intervals in-between based on data availability. Results: 5,079 (64.1%) individuals received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, 1,977 (24.9%) received one dose, 305 (3.9%) were not vaccinated, and 564 (7.1%) chose not to report vaccination status. There was a lower prevalence of depression and anxiety among vaccinated, compared with unvaccinated, individuals, especially after the second dose. Among individuals receiving two doses of vaccine, the prevalence of depression and anxiety was lower after both first (aRR=0.82, 95%CI 0.76-0.88 for depression; aRR=0.81, 95%CI 0.73-0.89 for anxiety) and second (aRR=0.79, 95%CI 0.73-0.85 for depression; aRR=0.73, 95%CI 0.66-0.81 for anxiety) dose, compared with before vaccination.

To address this, an antibiotic-free strategy that can combat multiple bacteria is recommended. Most of the proposed approaches nevertheless have several limitations, including bacterial targeting. To overcome such limitations, the proposed strategy employs the bacterial machinery to self-destruct. Herein, the biosynthesis of magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) is reported for the first time in multiple pathogenic bacteria, including MDR bacteria. The intracellular MNPs composed of superparamagnetic zinc ferrites were formed in presence of iron and zinc precursors. Exposure of the treated bacteria/biofilms to an alternating magnetic field (AMF) exhibited hyperthermia (5-6C) and a dramatic decrease in bacterial viability, suggesting the MNPs therapeutic potential. Likewise, the bacteria existing in vivo biosynthesize the MNPs by mining these elements from the host. To determine its therapeutic efficacy, the infected tissues were exposed directly to AMF. A 3-4 log reduction in bacterial burden, as compared to antibiotics treatment, confirmed the significance of using naturally existing MNPs to combat bacterial infections. The proposed broadCspectrum approach can therefore aid in overcoming the challenges facing anti-bacterial therapies.","output":"A Drug-free, Self-destruction Strategy to Combat Bacterial Infections by Using the Intrinsically formed Magnetic Nanoparticles in Bacterial Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions triggered a rapid alteration in the interview process for fellowships this spring We describe our initial experience with virtual interviews for Advanced GI Minimally Invasive Surgery Fellowships and assess the value and limitations via a post-interview applicant survey STUDY DESIGN: Twenty candidates were interviewed via Zoom teleconferencing March-April 2020 using combined group and breakout rooms An anonymous post-interview Likert and free text survey was sent to candidates with questions regarding feasibility, appropriateness, and acceptability of this method RESULTS: Seventeen of 20 candidates (85%) responded to the survey The candidates rated ease of interaction with the program director, faculty surgeons, and the current fellow highly: 94%, 83%, and 89%, respectively The majority (53%) stated the virtual interviews exceeded or met expectations Only a minority, 12%, reported the virtual platform was short of expectations Approximately 70% noted little to no impact of not being able to conduct these interviews in-person and not being able to physically see the program institution Overall, 94% were satisfied with their experience, and only 6% were neutral with no respondents reporting dissatisfaction Finally, 76% would recommend a virtual interview in the future Most negative open response comments were secondary to issues with software rather than the lack of the in-person traditional interviews CONCLUSIONS: The use of a remote teleconferencing platform provides a favorable method for conducting fellowship interviews and results in a high degree of candidate satisfaction Virtual interviews will likely be increasingly substituted for in-person interviews across the spectrum of medical training","output":"Initial Experience with a Virtual Platform for Advanced Gastrointestinal Minimally Invasive Surgery Fellowship Interviews"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increasing number of scRNA-seq data emphasizes the need for integrative analysis to interpret similarities and differences between single-cell samples.

This model was developed for a reference country with a large number of cases and high intensity of COVID-19 testing.

The estimate of cases in most countries is significantly higher than the official record. As of April 12, 2020, the global estimate is 5.2 million compared to 1.8 million in the official record. The models developed in this study are available at covid-model.net. The model ignores several factors that are known to influence mortality, such as the demographics and health condition of population, state of epidemic and sociological differences between countries.

This study aims to provide new insights into the prevalence of maternal and paternal depression, its demographic and clinical correlates, and its symptom network among Chinese pregnant women and their partners. METHODS: In this multicenter, cross-sectional study, 769 pregnant women and their partners were assessed by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) from June 15th to Sep 15th, 2020 in southern China. Convenient sampling method was used. Univariate analyses, multivariate logistic regression, and network analyses were conducted. Networks of maternal and paternal depression were compared. RESULTS: In total, 60 (EPDS total score 13, 7.80%, 95% CI: 5.90C9.70%) women and 23 (2.99%, 95% CI: 1.78C4.20%) of these womens partners reported depression. Physical comorbidities (OR=2.664, P=0.003) was the only factor that was found to significantly correlate with maternal depression. Network analyses showed that the resulting networks were well connected and that there was significant difference of network structure between maternal and paternal depression (M=0.330, P<0.001). Centrality plot indicated that sad or miserable (strength=1.097) was the most central symptom in the maternal depression network, while scared or panicky (strength=1.091) was the most central node in the paternal network. The edge between things have been getting on top of me C able to laugh and see the funny side of things (difference: 0.153, P=0.020), and scared or panicky C the thought of harming myself (difference: 0.084, P<0.001) was significantly stronger in womens partners than that in pregnant women.

Symptoms like sad or miserable and scared or panicky are critical and might be potential targets for further interventions. Evidence-based treatments, such as pharmacology, psychotherapy, community reinforcement and family training, might be beneficial for parents with depression during and after the pregnancy.","output":"Maternal and Paternal Depression During Pregnancy in China: Prevalence, Correlates, and Network Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A new coronavirus appeared in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China. He was named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus is responsible for Covid-19, the name given to the disease associated with it. It spreads worldwide, infecting more than a million people and killing more than 70 miles. The rapid and accurate diagnosis of suspected Covid-19 cases plays a crucial role in medical treatment and timely quarantine. Materials and Methods: In order to counter the Covid-19 pandemic, we have developed a method for the automatic detection of Covid -19, from 2D computed tomography (CT) chest images. It is a supervised software system based on the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) algorithm. Pulmonary CT images were collected from multiple international datasets, with a total of 395 images: 70% were used for training and 30% were used for testing. For each patient, the lungs were segmented using simple thresholding. Then, the segmented lungs were fed into a neural network to predict the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infectious. Results: The internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 97.5% with a specificity of 96.6 % and a 100 % sensitivity. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the proof-ofprinciple for using artificial intelligence to extract radiological features for timely and accurate Covid-19 diagnosis.","output":"An accurate neural network algorithm to diagnose Covid-19 from CT images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has rapidly spread across the globe. Critical to the control of COVID-19 is the characterisation of its epidemiology. Despite this, there has been a paucity of evidence from many parts of the world, including Malaysia. We aim to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Malaysia to inform prevention and control policies better. METHODS: Malaysian COVID-19 data was extracted from 16 March 2020 up to 31 May 2021. We estimated the following epidemiological indicators: 7-day incidence rates, 7-day mortality rates, case fatality rates, test positive ratios, testing rates and the time-varying reproduction number (Rt). FINDINGS: Between 16 March 2020 and 31 May 2021, Malaysia has reported 571,901 cases and 2,796 deaths. Malaysia's average 7-day incidence rate was 26?6 reported infections per 100,000 population (95% CI: 17?8, 38?1). The average test positive ratio and testing rate were 4?3% (95% CI: 1?6, 10?2) and 0?8 tests per 1,000 population (95% CI: <0?1, 3?7), respectively. The case fatality rates (CFR) was 0?6% (95% CI: <0?1, 3?7). Among the 2,796 cases who died, 87?3% were  50 years. INTERPRETATION: The public health response was successful in the suppression of COVID-19 transmission or the first half of 2020. However, a state election and outbreaks in institutionalised populations have been the catalyst for more significant community propagation. This rising community transmission has continued in 2021, leading to increased incidence and strained healthcare systems. Calibrating NPI based on epidemiological indicators remain critical for us to live with the virus.

The phenomenon is key to understanding the current structure and dynamics of these labor markets, although little is known about self-selection in LDC. This document addresses this knowledge gap by analyzing the case of Chile using functional areas. Chile is a country where LDC has become the principal strategy of labor mobility and is closely linked to the mining and construction sectors. The results obtained show a pattern of negative self-selection, meaning that it is the least qualified who have the highest probability of commuting between functional areas. Commuting could therefore be more than just a mechanism for accessing qualified labor, allowing less qualified individuals access job opportunities when the labor market where they come from is more qualified.","output":"Do workers negative self-select when they commute?

Herein, we provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through cellCcell contact in cultures, mediated by the spike glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 spike is more efficient in facilitating cell-to-cell transmission than is SARS-CoV spike, which reflects, in part, their differential cellCcell fusion activity. Interestingly, treatment of cocultured cells with endosomal entry inhibitors impairs cell-to-cell transmission, implicating endosomal membrane fusion as an underlying mechanism. Compared with cell-free infection, cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is refractory to inhibition by neutralizing antibody or convalescent sera of COVID-19 patients. While angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 enhances cell-to-cell transmission, we find that it is not absolutely required. Notably, despite differences in cell-free infectivity, the authentic variants of concern (VOCs) B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.351 (beta) have similar cell-to-cell transmission capability. Moreover, B.1.351 is more resistant to neutralization by vaccinee sera in cell-free infection, whereas B.1.1.7 is more resistant to inhibition by vaccinee sera in cell-to-cell transmission.

In this context, social distancing was imposed to prevent or decrease significantly further transmission of the COVID-19. In other words, research results have shown that slowing the spread of COVID-19 is the way to save people's lives and relieve the burden on health-care systems. This social distancing can be tracked using cell phone movement/data. This paper presents a new approach/algorithm for allocating and optimizing/adapting the movement permits during/outside curfew periods inside workplaces, buildings, companies and institutions. This approach is an effective tool to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by promoting health safety during the pandemic, especially in places where social distancing can be difficult. Consequently, this paper presents a technological solution to automate the process of giving movement permits in workplaces. The paper results showed that the proposed strategy of social distancing inside buildings is effective enough to flatten the curve. Furthermore, health authorities are not required to recommend staying home to slow the spread of COVID-19. Consequently, this paper introduces a solution for the resource sharing problem (resource allocation problem), where multiple agents (people or robots) of a system trying to move reliably in their environment. The biggest concern of these agents is to avoid collisions (infections). As a result, the experiments carried out in this paper showed the high performance of the designed algorithm complying with COVID-19 social distancing regulations.","output":"A Generic Approach for Allocating Movement Permits During/Outside Curfew Period during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent declaration of a state of alarm have required changes throughout the entire health system and diagnostic imaging departments are no exception.

A multi-center, double-blind, placebo- and waitlist controlled randomized trial (NTR5365) in two academic hospitals in The Netherlands was performed. Eighty-five very preterm children with parent-rated attention problems on the Child Behavior Checklist were randomized to one of three treatment conditions: EF training, placebo training or waitlist condition. EF or placebo training was completed at home (6 weeks, 25 sessions of 30C45 min each). At baseline, 2 weeks after training or being on the waitlist, and five months after first follow-up visit, children underwent assessments of primary outcomes (parent and teacher ratings of attention) and secondary outcomes (parent and teacher ratings of daily-life EF, computerized EF tasks and academic performance). Linear mixed model analyses were performed for all outcome measures. There were no significant differences in improvement over time on parent- and teacher ratings of attention, parent- and teacher ratings of daily-life EF, computerized EF tasks, and academic performance (arithmetic and reading) between the EF training, placebo training and waitlist condition.

This study, prepared by a large international panel of stroke experts, assesses the rapidly growing research and personal experience with COVID-19 stroke and offers recommendations for stroke management in this challenging new setting: modifications needed for prehospital emergency rescue and hyperacute care; inpatient intensive or stroke units; posthospitalization rehabilitation; follow-up including at-risk family and community; and multispecialty departmental developments in the allied professions. SUMMARY: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 uses spike proteins binding to tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptors, most often through the respiratory system by virus inhalation and thence to other susceptible organ systems, leading to COVID-19. Clinicians facing the many etiologies for stroke have been sobered by the unusual incidence of combined etiologies and presentations, prominent among them are vasculitis, cardiomyopathy, hypercoagulable state, and endothelial dysfunction. International standards of acute stroke management remain in force, but COVID-19 adds the burdens of personal protections for the patient, rescue, and hospital staff and for some even into the postdischarge phase. For pending COVID-19 determination and also for those shown to be COVID-19 affected, strict infection control is needed at all times to reduce spread of infection and to protect healthcare staff, using the wealth of well-described methods. For COVID-19 patients with stroke, thrombolysis and thrombectomy should be continued, and the usual early management of hypertension applies, save that recent work suggests continuing ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Prothrombotic states, some acute and severe, encourage prophylactic LMWH unless bleeding risk is high. COVID-19-related cardiomyopathy adds risk of cardioembolic stroke, where heparin or warfarin may be preferable, with experience accumulating with DOACs. As ever, arteritis can prove a difficult diagnosis, especially if not obvious on the acute angiogram done for clot extraction. This field is under rapid development and may generate management recommendations which are as yet unsettled, even undiscovered. Beyond the acute management phase, COVID-19-related stroke also forces rehabilitation services to use protective precautions. As with all stroke patients, health workers should be aware of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and/or distress developing in their patients and caregivers. Postdischarge outpatient care currently includes continued secondary prevention measures. Although hoping a COVID-19 stroke patient can be considered cured of the virus, those concerned for contact safety can take comfort in the increasing use of telemedicine, which is itself a growing source of patient-physician contacts. Many online resources are available to patients and physicians. Like prior challenges, stroke care teams will also overcome this one. KEY MESSAGES: Evidence-based stroke management should continue to be provided throughout the patient care journey, while strict infection control measures are enforced.","output":"Stroke Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic: International Expert Panel Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surgical smoke evacuators may reduce the concentration of alcohol vapors from skin preparations at the site of electrosurgical device activation, decreasing operating room fire risk.

On the 14th October the English government introduced a tier system for control of the epidemic but just 3 weeks later a National lockdown across all areas of England was implemented. When English areas emerged from Lockdown many were placed in different tiers (most typically moved up at least one tier). However, the effectiveness of the tier system has been challenged by the emergence of a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 which appears to be much more infectious. In addition, from early November a trial mass testing service was being run in Liverpool. We used publicly available data of daily cases by local authority (local government areas) and estimated the reproductive rate (R value) of the epidemic based on 7-day case numbers compared with the previous 7-day period. There was a clear surge in infections from a few days before to several days after the lockdown was implemented. But this surge was almost exclusively associated with Tier 1 and Tier 2 authorities. In Tier 3 authorities where hospitality venues were only allowed to operate as restaurants there was no such surge. After this initial surge, cases declined in all three tiers with the R value dropping to a mean of about 0.7 independent of tier. London, The South East and East of England Regions saw rising infection rates in the last week or so of lockdown primarily in children of secondary school age. We could find no obvious benefit of the trial mass screening programme in Liverpool city. We conclude that in Tiers 1 and 2 much of the beneficial impact of the national lockdown was lost probably because of the leak of its likely implementation five days early leading to increased socialising in these areas before the start of lockdown. We further conclude that given that the new variant is estimated to have an R value of between 0.39 and 0.93 greater than previous variants, any lockdown as strict as the November one would be insufficient to reverse the increase in infections by itself. The value of city-wide mass testing to control the epidemic remains uncertain.","output":"The Impact of the November 2020 English National Lockdown on COVID-19 case counts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to unprecedented worries and challenges for pregnant women due to social restrictions and changes in maternity care provision. We aimed to investigate the mental health impact of COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant women in Sweden and explore factors associated with poor perinatal mental health in this specific context. Method: This was a nation-wide cross-sectional survey of pregnant women living in Sweden. Validated questionnaires were distributed through non-profit organizations websites and social media channels from May 2020 to February 2021. Perinatal depression, anxiety, and acute stress reaction were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7(GAD-7) and Impact Event Scale (Revised)(IES-R), respectively. Sociodemographic characteristics and self-perceived mental well-being were also obtained. Factors associated with mental health outcomes were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression model. Results: : Among a total of 522 participants, 42.5% (n=222) reported depression (EPDS 13), 25.3% (n=132) moderate to severe anxiety (GAD-7 score10), and 23.4% (n=122) moderate to severe acute stress reaction (IES-R 33). 27.4% participants (n=143, 27.4%) expressed concerns regarding their mental well-being during the pandemic. Pregnant mothers who had sick family members reported more severe poor mental health outcomes than those who did not (median [Interquartile range (IQR)] EPDS scores: 14.0 [8.75 C 18.0] vs 10.0 [6.0 C 14.0], p<.001;median [IQR] GAD7 scores: 7.0 [4.0 C 12.25] vs 5.0 [3.0 C 9.0], p<.001;median (IQR) IES-R scores: 20.0 [9.0 C 38.0] vs 15.0 [7.0 C 28.0], p=.008). Logistic regression analyses revealed that risk factors for poor mental health outcomes were having a sick family member with any illness, unemployment, giving birth, and experiencing an exceptional stressful life event. Having a higher educational level, younger age, and changing career during the pandemic were protective. Conclusion: Depression and anxiety were highly prevalent among pregnant women in Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating a need for professional mental health support for this vulnerable group of population. Unemployment was an associated risk factor whereas younger age and higher educational level were protective suggesting an important role of socio-economic factors in modulating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal mental health.","output":"Self-reported mental health status of pregnant women in Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oral administration of antibodies is a promising strategy against various infectious diseases.

To date, no effective control measures exist to limit Campylobacter colonization in the chicken's intestinal tract. Here, the effect of lyophilization of hyperimmune egg yolk on protection of broilers against C. jejuni was investigated. During an in vivo trial, broiler chickens were prophylactically given feed with lyophilized hyperimmune or non-immunized egg yolk powder starting from day 1 after hatch. At day 11, broilers were inoculated with C. jejuni according to a seeder model. Five days later, all broilers were euthanized and cecal content was examined for C. jejuni colonization. No decrease in C. jejuni colonization was found. The freeze-drying resulted in a 16-fold decrease of the antibody titer in the yolk powder compared to the fresh yolks, presumably caused by structural changes in the antibodies. In conclusion, applying freeze-dried hyperimmune egg yolk failed to protect broilers against C. jejuni colonization, possibly because lyophilization affected the antibodies' functionality.","output":"Research Note: Lyophilization of hyperimmune egg yolk: effect on antibody titer and protection of broilers against Campylobacter colonization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The social and behavioral health of older adults is of particular concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is estimated that at least 50% of older adults in the U.S. have pets; while pets may be a source of support, they could also pose unique challenges during an already trying time. We aimed to investigate how pets impacted the everyday lives of older adults in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A large survey of U.S. pet owners (n = 2,068) was administered to assess the impact of relationships with pets during COVID-19 on human health and well-being. We conducted bivariate analyses to compare levels of social support, loneliness, pet attachment, and family income for a subset of older adults (ages 65 and older) with a younger comparison group (ages 18-64). Using thematic and content analysis, we analyzed two open-ended prompts from age 65+ respondents (n = 122): (1) the pros and cons of living with pets during the pandemic, and (2) advice for those living with pets in future pandemics. Results: Older adults, on average, reported lower levels of social support and less loneliness than respondents below age 65. There were no significant differences in strength of attachment to pets nor income between the younger and older respondents. For the open-ended prompt regarding pros and cons, we coded three emerging themes and related sub-themes: (1) pros (company; more time together; life purpose or meaning; love; support; stress relief; routine; distraction; exercise), (2) cons (general worry; potential for illness; limited participation; veterinary care access; obtaining supplies; difficulty meeting pet needs; financial concerns), and (3) no difference. Advice shared was coded into 13 themes/sub-themes: pets' health and welfare; make plans; veterinary information; treat pets like family; don't abandon pets; human health and well-being; stay calm; enjoy pets; keep routine; be careful of transmission; seek community resources; keep supplies stocked; and finances.

While we have been willingly moving towards open societies and reducing movement barriers, there is a need to be prepared for minimizing the openness of society on occasions such as large pandemics, which are low probability events with massive impacts. Certainly, similar to many phenomena, the Covid-19 pandemic has shown us its own geography presenting its emergence and evolving patterns as well as taking advantage of our geographical settings for escalating its spread. Hence, this study aims at presenting a data-driven approach for exploring the spatio-temporal patterns of the pandemic over a regional scale, i.e., Europe and a country scale, i.e., Denmark, and also what geographical variables potentially contribute to expediting its spread. We used official regional infection rates, points of interest, temperature and air pollution data for monitoring the pandemics spread across Europe and also applied geospatial methods such as spatial autocorrelation and space-time autocorrelation to extract relevant indicators that could explain the dynamics of the pandemic. Furthermore, we applied statistical methods, e.g., ordinary least squares, geographically weighted regression, as well as machine learning methods, e.g., random forest for exploring the potential correlation between the chosen underlying factors and the pandemic spread. Our findings indicate that population density, amenities such as cafes and bars, and pollution levels are the most influential explanatory variables while pollution levels can be explicitly used to monitor lockdown measures and infection rates at country level. The choice of data and methods used in this study along with the achieved results and presented discussions can empower health authorities and decision makers with an interactive decision support tool, which can be useful for imposing geographically varying lockdowns and protectives measures using historical data.","output":"The Geography of the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Data-Driven Approach to Exploring Geographical Driving Forces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nowcasting approaches enhance the utility of reportable disease data for trend monitoring by correcting for delays, but implementation details affect accuracy. OBJECTIVE: To support real-time COVID-19 situational awareness, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene used nowcasting to account for testing and reporting delays. We conducted an evaluation to determine which implementation details would yield the most accurate estimated case counts. METHODS: A time-correlated Bayesian approach called Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing (NobBS) was applied in real time to line lists of reportable disease surveillance data, accounting for the delay from diagnosis to reporting and the shape of the epidemic curve. We retrospectively evaluated nowcasting performance for confirmed case counts among residents diagnosed during the period from March to May 2020, a period when the median reporting delay was 2 days. RESULTS: Nowcasts with a 2-week moving window and a negative binomial distribution had lower mean absolute error, lower relative root mean square error, and higher 95% prediction interval coverage than nowcasts conducted with a 3-week moving window or with a Poisson distribution. Nowcasts conducted toward the end of the week outperformed nowcasts performed earlier in the week, given fewer patients diagnosed on weekends and lack of day-of-week adjustments. When estimating case counts for weekdays only, metrics were similar across days when the nowcasts were conducted, with Mondays having the lowest mean absolute error of 183 cases in the context of an average daily weekday case count of 2914. CONCLUSIONS: Nowcasting using NobBS can effectively support COVID-19 trend monitoring. Accounting for overdispersion, shortening the moving window, and suppressing diagnoses on weekendswhen fewer patients submitted specimens for testingimproved the accuracy of estimated case counts.

Here, we show that the intestines of virus-infected bats that were also infected with fungus contained on average 60-fold more viral RNA than bats with virus alone. Increased viral RNA in the intestines correlated with the severity of fungus-related pathology. Additionally, the intestines of bats infected with fungus exhibited different expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and cytokine related transcripts, irrespective of viral presence.

Little is known about this storage because geochemical and geophysical observations are limited to pits, boreholes, or outcrops or to inferences based on indirect measurements between these sites. We trained a rock physics model to borehole observations in a well-constrained ridge and valley landscape and then interpreted spatial variations in seismic refraction velocities. We discovered that P-wave velocities track where a porosity-generating reaction initiates in shale in three boreholes across the landscape. Specifically, velocities of 2.7  0.2 km/s correspond with growth of porosity from dissolution of chlorite, the most reactive of the abundant minerals in the shale. In addition, sonic velocities are consistent with the presence of gas bubbles beneath the water table under valley and ridge. We attribute this gas largely to CO2 produced by 1) microbial respiration in soils as meteoric waters recharge into the subsurface and 2) the coupled carbonate dissolution and pyrite oxidation at depth in the rock. Bubbles may nucleate below the water table because waters depressurize as they flow from ridge to valley and because pores have dilated as the deep rock has been exhumed by erosion. Many of these observations are likely to also describe the weathering and flow path patterns in other headwater landscapes. Such combined geophysical and geochemical observations will help constrain models predicting flow, storage, and reaction of groundwater in bedrock systems.","output":"Seismic refraction tracks porosity generation and possible CO2 production at depth under a headwater catchment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advanced age is a risk factor for severe infection by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Children, however, often present with milder manifestations of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Associations have been found between COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) Patients with the latter condition present more severe involvement Adults with comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) are more severely affected This narrative review aimed to look into whether CKD contributed to more severe involvement in pediatric patients with COVID-19 The studies included in this review did not report severe cases or deaths, and indicated that pediatric patients with CKD and previously healthy children recovered quickly from infection However, some patients with MIS-C required hospitalization in intensive care units and a few died, although it was not possible to correlate MIS-C and CKD Conversely, adults with CKD reportedly had increased risk of severe infection by SARS-CoV-2 and higher death rates The discrepancies seen between age groups may be due to immune system and renin-angiotensin system differences, with more pronounced expression of ACE2 in children Immunosuppressant therapy has not been related with positive or negative effects in individuals with COVID-19, although current recommendations establish decreases in the dosage of some medications To sum up with, CKD was not associated with more severe involvement in children diagnosed with COVID-19 Studies enrolling larger populations are still required","output":"An analysis of chronic kidney disease as a prognostic factor in pediatric cases of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The genus Circovirus groups some of the smallest viruses capable of autonomous replication, including some notable swine and avian pathogens. Among domestic and wild birds, circoviruses are often associated with immunosuppression and integumental disorders, but, despite their relevance, nothing is known about their circulation in birds of prey. By conducting molecular analyses on samples from birds of prey recovered by a wildlife rescue centre in Italy, we identified a new viral species in the spleen of a tawny owl (Strix aluco). However, there is contrasting evidence regarding its definitive host. On one hand, the virus was discovered to be phylogenetically closer to mammalian rather than avian circoviruses, which allows speculations on its host being a micromammal preyed by the tawny owl, rather than the bird itself. On the other hand, its detection in the spleen, a lymphoid organ in which other avian circoviruses are often detected, supports the tawny owl being its actual host, perhaps following a spillover event associated with predation. Adding to the growing number of circoviruses found in recent years in a diverse range of hosts, this discovery represents another step forward in the characterization of this genus of remarkable veterinary importance. ABSTRACT: Thanks to recent developments in molecular methods, many new species have been discovered within the genus Circovirus, which comprises viruses of veterinary relevance found in a broad range of hosts. In particular, several circoviruses are known to infect birds, often causing immunosuppression and feathering disorders. Nonetheless, nothing is known about their circulation in birds of prey. In this study, samples from 61 birds of prey representing ten different species, recovered by a wildlife rescue centre in Southern Italy, were taken at necropsy and analysed by PCR with pan-Circovirus primers. Only one sample, collected from a tawny owl (Strix aluco), tested positive. Its genome, sequenced by primer walking, displays the typical features of circoviruses. Based on demarcation criteria, the detected strain qualifies as a novel species, which was named tawny owl-associated circovirus (ToCV). Phylogenetically, ToCV clustered with mammalian rather than avian circoviruses, and its closeness to a rodent circovirus suggests that its host may have been a micromammal eaten by the tawny owl. On the other hand, its detection in the spleen fits with the tropism of other avian circoviruses. Little can be therefore said on its biology and pathogenicity, and further efforts are needed to better characterize its epidemiology.","output":"Detection and Molecular Characterization of a Novel Species of Circovirus in a Tawny Owl (Strix aluco) in Southern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More urgently than ever we need an answer to the question posed by the late Mick Moran in The Political Quarterly nearly two decades ago: if government now invests huge resources in trying to be smart why does it often act so dumb?.

However, little is known about the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-2(1C5). Here we report on 149 COVID-19 convalescent individuals. Plasmas collected an average of 39 days after the onset of symptoms had variable half-maximal pseudovirus neutralizing titers: less than 1:50 in 33% and below 1:1000 in 79%, while only 1% showed titers >1:5000. Antibody sequencing revealed expanded clones of RBD-specific memory B cells expressing closely related antibodies in different individuals. Despite low plasma titers, antibodies to three distinct epitopes on RBD neutralized at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) as low as single digit ng/mL. Thus, most convalescent plasmas obtained from individuals who recover from COVID-19 do not contain high levels of neutralizing activity.

The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of edema in subacute lesion progression and its influence on unfavorable functional outcome by quantifying net water uptake. Methods: We included all 187 patients from the MR CLEAN trial who had high quality follow-up non-contrast CT at 24 h and 1 week. Using a CT densitometry-based method to calculate the net water uptake, we differentiated total ischemic lesion volume (TILV) into edema volume (EV) and edema-corrected infarct volume (ecIV). We calculated these volumes at 24 h and 1 week after stroke and determined their progression in the subacute period. We assessed the effect of 24-h lesion characteristics on EV and ecIV progression. We evaluated the influence of edema and edema-corrected infarct progression on favorable functional outcome after 90 days (modified Rankin Scale: 0-2) after correcting for potential confounders. Lastly, we compared these volumes between subgroups of patients with and without successful recanalization using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Results: Median TILV increased from 37 (IQR: 18-81) ml to 68 (IQR: 30-130) ml between 24 h and 1 week after stroke, while the net water uptake increased from 22 (IQR: 16-26)% to 27 (IQR: 22-32)%. The TILV progression of 20 (8.8-40) ml was mostly caused by ecIV with a median increase of 12 (2.4-21) ml vs. 6.5 (2.7-15) ml of EV progression. Larger TILV, EV, and ecIV volumes at 24 h were all associated with more edema and lesion progression. Edema progression was associated with unfavorable functional outcome [aOR: 0.53 (0.28-0.94) per 10 ml; p-value: 0.05], while edema-corrected infarct progression showed a similar, non-significant association [aOR: 0.80 (0.62-0.99); p-value: 0.06]. Lastly, edema progression was larger in patients without successful recanalization, whereas ecIV progression was comparable between the subgroups. Conclusion: EV increases in evolving ischemic lesions in the period between 1 day and 1 week after acute ischemic stroke. This progression is larger in patients without successful recanalization and is associated with unfavorable functional outcome. However, the extent of edema cannot explain the total expansion of ischemic lesions since edema-corrected infarct progression is larger than the edema progression.","output":"The Role of Edema in Subacute Lesion Progression After Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Worldwide COVID-19 epidemiology data indicate differences in disease incidence amongst sex and gender demographic groups.

METHODS (CASE DESCRIPTION): The case report setting is a physical therapy and occupational therapy department (department) of an academic pediatric medical center that provides a range of health care services for children and youth. Challenges that COVID-19 presented to the Department included: (1) managing safety concerns for patients, their families, and staff; (2) continuing to provide high-quality therapy services within state mandated restrictions; (3) triaging patients; and (4) keeping clinicians employed and working productively. RESULTS: The Department therapists responded to these challenges by: (1) increasing communication huddles, (2) developing procedures for staffing and triaging of patients, (3) developing procedures for telehealth therapy services, and (4) designing a remote work program for all department employees. The number of patients and staff on site were reduced by initiating telehealth services, triaging patients, and developing a remote work plan. Communication huddles, department meetings, and supervision meetings were converted to virtual meetings. Staffing rates, patient-care productivity, and department project work were maintained. CONCLUSION: In response to COVID-19, the department developed new protocols provided information about the protocols, which might be helpful for other pediatric hospitals or outpatient settings when planning for future pandemics or other issues that challenge the ability to provide usual care. Increasing the frequency of verbal and written communication on operational topics is recommended.

Consequently, studies that only consider separable, unidirectional effects can produce divergent conclusions and equivocal ecological implications. To address this complexity, we use empirical dynamic modeling to assemble causal networks for 19 natural aquatic ecosystems (N24?~N58?) and quantified strengths of feedbacks among phytoplankton diversity, phytoplankton biomass, and environmental factors. Through a cross-system comparison, we identify macroecological patterns; in more diverse, oligotrophic ecosystems, biodiversity effects are more important than environmental effects (nutrients and temperature) as drivers of biomass. Furthermore, feedback strengths vary with productivity. In warm, productive systems, strong nitrate-mediated feedbacks usually prevail, whereas there are strong, phosphate-mediated feedbacks in cold, less productive systems. Our findings, based on recovered feedbacks, highlight the importance of a network view in future ecosystem management.","output":"Causal networks of phytoplankton diversity and biomass are modulated by environmental context."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a common manifestation of lupus erythematosus. Hydroxychloroquine is commonly used in the treatment of lupus erythematosus. The present study aims to report hallucinations induced by hydroxychloroquine. CASE PRESENTATION A 37-year-old woman came to the dermatology clinic with a complaint of a red lesion on her left cheek. Physical examination revealed an ulcerative erythematous plaque with keratotic scales, an atrophic area of ~ 2  2.5 cm. Biopsy of the lesion was performed, and histopathology result was consistent with the diagnosis of DLE. Laboratory tests were all normal. Topical clobetasol and pimecrolimus were prescribed for the patient, who was recommended to use sunscreen as well. However, the treatment did not work, thus hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily was added to the treatment. After a week, the patient came back to the clinic with her husband with the complaint of auditory and visual hallucinations, nightmares, and occasional decrease in consciousness level. After neurology and psychiatric consultation, hydroxychloroquine was discontinued and replaced with intralesional administration of triamcinolone. The lesion disappeared and did not recur. DISCUSSION Previous studies and the lack of another explanation for the patient's hallucinations imply a strong correlation between hydroxychloroquine and hallucinations. The mechanism of these side effects has not been fully elucidated. However, this side effect has only been reported in cases of connective tissue diseases. As currently hydroxychloroquine is widely used in the treatment of COVID-19 and other diseases, its potential risk of psychiatric complications should be considered in clinical practice.","output":"A case report of hydroxychloroquine-induced auditory and visual hallucination."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PRECIS: Vascular diseases have been linked to alterations in optic nerve head perfusion.

The purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of progressive submaximal cycling on selected cardiorespiratory and metabolic variables in endurance- and strength-trained athletes. The sample comprised participants with different training background: endurance trained group (triathletes), strength trained group (bodybuilders), and a control group (recreationally active students). The research problem was based on the verification of the minor non-specific cardiometabolic responses in strength and endurance trained athletes during a progressive submaximal cycling exercise test. The substantive finding of this study was that endurance- and strengthtrained athletes differed only in the metabolic responses of respiratory exchange ratio and blood lactate concentration, whereas the acute cardiorespiratory variables did not demonstrate any statistically relevant differences. Based on our findings we recommend that endurance-trained athletes follow a concurrent training program, combined strength and endurance training, to improve neuromuscular parameters and thus optimize their economy of movement and endurance-specific muscle power capacity. ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of a progressive submaximal cycling exercise on selected cardiorespiratory and metabolic variables in endurance and strength trained athletes. The sample comprised 32 participants aged 22.0  0.54 years who were assigned into three groups: an endurance trained group (END, triathletes, n = 10), a strength trained group (STR, bodybuilders, n = 10), and a control group (CON, recreationally active students, n = 12). The incremental cycling exercise was performed using a progressive protocol starting with a 3 min resting measurement and then a 50 W workload with subsequent constant increments of 50 W every 3 min until 200 W. The following cardiometabolic variables were evaluated: heart rate (HR), oxygen uptake (VO(2)), carbon dioxide production (VCO(2)), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), and blood lactate (BLa(?)). We found the between-group differences in metabolic variables (the average RER and BLa(?)) were statistically significant (Tukeys HSD test: CON vs. STR, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively; CON vs. END, p < 0.001; END vs. STR, p < 0.001). RER and BLa(C) differences in all groups depended on the workload level (G-G-epsilon = 0.438; p < 0.004 and G-G-epsilon = 0.400; p < 0.001, respectively). There were no significant differences in cardiorespiratory variables between endurance- and strength-trained groups. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that acute cardiorespiratory responses at each of the four submaximal workloads were comparable in endurance- compared to strength-trained athletes, but significantly different compared to recreationally active men. However, there were significant differences in the metabolic responses of RER and BLa(?). Based on our findings we recommend that endurance-trained athletes follow a concurrent training program, combined strength and endurance training, to improve neuromuscular parameters and thus optimize their economy of movement and endurance-specific muscle power capacity.","output":"Acute Cardiorespiratory and Metabolic Responses to Incremental Cycling Exercise in Endurance- and Strength-Trained Athletes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The low crude oil prices in 2019 add momentum to Nigerias need for economic diversification as its foreign earnings come primarily from crude oil sales.

Evidence highlights just providing patients with NAFLD with information and advice to change behaviour is an insufficient intervention. Readiness to change weight-related behaviours is often low and not associated with severity of liver disease. The Lead Clinician and Hepatology Nurse Specialist led on development of a new NAFLD pathway. They established a multidisciplinary clinic with input General Practitioners, dietitians and psychologists. Eligible patients (Fib 4>1.45) were offered input from a Liver Nurse, Health Psychologist, dietitian and Consultant. Over 6 months patients received a low intensity psychology intervention. Each participant was seen for an assessment (and 8 weekly follow-ups via email, telephone or video call). Psychologist reviewed patients at three and six months. 101 patients, (53% Males and 47% Females) agreed to participate in the health psychology intervention. Average BMI of patients assessed was 40.1 (113.5kg). Baseline daily step count was 1635. Majority of patients presented with two or more Long Term Conditions alongside NAFLD. Most common being Type 2 Diabetes (44%) and anxiety/depression (27%). Average Fib 4 score was 1.4, KPa 14.4. HbA1c 58.8, Cholesterol 5.0, ALT 81.4, AST 58.4. 91% of patients were followed up (9% drop out). Average weight loss 5.5kg (range 0.5kg- 23kg). 82% increased daily step count (1635 to 5958). Anxiety scores (HADs) decreased from (7.4 to 6) and Depression scores reduced 6.3 to 3.3 Due to Covid 19 restrictions we don't have repeat measures on medical markers. However self reported outcomes at 6 months are encouraging. A learning point when we are able to fully resume normal service delivery is to try and increase the number of patients benefitting from this service. We see scope to access patients earlier in primary care thus reducing waiting times and freeing up secondary care medical staff for more complex cases. Overall, it is considered that this new pathway and multidisciplinary clinic has been very worthwhile.

Recent literature from India has described policy aspects addressing nutritional implications of specific foods (eg, fruits, vegetables, and trans-fats), and identified opportunities to tackle the double burden of malnutrition. This paper attempts to deepen the understanding on how health concerns and the role of the health sector are addressed across food systems policies in India. METHODS This qualitative study used two approaches; namely (i) the framework method and (ii) manifest content analysis, to investigate national-level policy documents from relevant sectors (ie, food security, agriculture, biodiversity, food processing, trade, and waste management, besides health and nutrition). The documents were selected purposively. The textual data were coded and compared, from which themes were identified, described, and interpreted. Additionally, mentions of various health concerns and of the health ministry in the included documents were recorded and collated. RESULTS A total of 35 policy documents were included in the analysis. A variety of health concerns spanning nutritional, communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) were mentioned. Undernutrition received specific attention even beyond nutrition policies. Only few policies mentioned NCDs, infectious diseases, and injuries. Governing and advisory bodies were instituted by 17 of the analysed policies (eg, food safety, agriculture, and food processing), and often included representation from the health ministry (9 of the 17 identified inter-ministerial bodies). CONCLUSION We found some evidence of concern for health, and inclusion of health ministry in food policy documents in India. The ongoing and planned intersectoral coordination to tackle undernutrition could inform actions to address other relevant but currently underappreciated concerns such as NCDs. Our study demonstrated a method for analysis of health consideration and intersectoral coordination in food policy documents, which could be applied to studies in other settings and policy domains.","output":"Health in Food Systems Policies in India: A Document Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review provides an overview of studies and case reports of neurological and neuromuscular complications associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and describes the possible mechanisms of viral transmission to the central nervous system (CNS).

The identification of infected individuals is vital to prevent the spread of illness to staff and other patients as well as to identify those who may be at risk for disease-related complications. This is particularly relevant with the resumption of elective orthopaedic surgery around the world. We report the results of a universal testing protocol for COVID-19 in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery during the coronavirus pandemic and to describe the postoperative course of asymptomatic patients who were positive for COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective review of adult operative cases between March 25, 2020, and April 24, 2020, at an orthopaedic specialty hospital in New York City was performed. Initially, a screening questionnaire consisting of relevant signs and symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath) or exposure dictated the need for nasopharyngeal swab real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for all admitted patients. An institutional policy change occurred on April 5, 2020, that indicated nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR testing for all orthopaedic admissions. Screening and testing data for COVID-19 as well as relevant imaging, laboratory values, and postoperative complications were reviewed for all patients. RESULTS: From April 5, 2020, to April 24, 2020, 99 patients underwent routine nasopharyngeal swab testing for COVID-19 prior to their planned orthopaedic surgical procedure. Of the 12.1% of patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 58.3% were asymptomatic. Three asymptomatic patients developed postoperative hypoxia, with 2 requiring intubation. The negative predictive value of using the signs and symptoms of disease to predict a negative test result was 91.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81.0% to 97.1%). Including a positive chest radiographic finding as a screening criterion did not improve the negative predictive value of screening (92.5% [95% CI, 81.8% to 97.9%]). CONCLUSIONS: A protocol for universal testing of all orthopaedic surgery admissions at 1 hospital in New York City during a 3-week period revealed a high rate of COVID-19 infections. Importantly, the majority of these patients were asymptomatic. Using chest radiography did not significantly improve the negative predictive value of screening.

Apart from the virus survival outside the host, the latent infection transmissions caused by asymptomatic and presymptomatic hosts represent major challenges for controlling the epidemics. In this regard, social mixing and various biological factors play their subtle, but often critical, role. For example, a life-threatening condition may result in the infection contracted from an asymptomatic virus carrier. Here, we use a new recently developed microscopic agent-based modeling framework to shed light on the role of asymptomatic hosts and to unravel the interplay between the biological and social factors of these nonlinear stochastic processes. The model accounts for each human actor's susceptibility and the virus survival time, as well as traceability along the infection path. These properties enable an efficient dissection of the infection events caused by asymptomatic carriers from those which involve symptomatic hosts before they develop symptoms and become removed to a controlled environment. Consequently, we assess how their relative proportions in the overall infection curve vary with changing model parameters. Our results reveal that these proportions largely depend on biological factors in the process, specifically, the virus transmissibility and the critical threshold for developing symptoms, which can be affected by the virus pathogenicity. Meanwhile, social participation activity is crucial for the overall infection level, further modulated by the virus transmissibility.","output":"Microscopic dynamics modeling unravels the role of asymptomatic virus carriers in SARS-CoV-2 epidemics at the interplay between biological and social factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zika virus (ZIKV) can cause pregnancy loss and congenital Zika syndrome, among other poor health outcomes.

The proposal of a DBS target in the midbrain, known as the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), to address FOG was based on its observed neuropathology in PD and its hypothesized involvement in locomotor control as a part of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). Initial reports of PPN DBS were met with enthusiasm; however, subsequent studies reported mixed results. A closer review of the MLR basic science literature, suggests that the closely related cuneiform nucleus (CnF), dorsal to the PPN, may be a superior site to promote gait. Although suspected to have a conserved role in the control of gait in humans, deliberate stimulation of a homolog to the CnF in humans using directional DBS electrodes has not been attempted. METHODS: As part of an open-label Phase 1 clinical study, one PD patient with predominantly axial symptoms and severe FOG refractory to levodopa therapy was implanted with directional DBS electrodes (Boston Science Vercise Cartesia(TM)) targeting the CnF bilaterally. Since the CnF is a poorly defined reticular nucleus, targeting was guided both by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography and anatomical landmarks. Intraoperative stimulation and microelectrode recordings were performed near the targets with leg EMG surface recordings in the subject. RESULTS: Post-operative imaging revealed accurate targeting of both leads to the designated CnF. Intraoperative stimulation near the target at low thresholds in the awake patient evoked involuntary electromyography (EMG) oscillations in the legs with a peak power at the stimulation frequency, similar to observations with CnF DBS in animals. Oscillopsia was the primary side effect evoked at higher currents, especially when directed posterolaterally. Directional DBS could mitigate oscillopsia. CONCLUSION: DTI-based targeting and intraoperative stimulation to evoke limb EMG activity may be useful methods to help target the CnF accurately and safely in patients. Long term follow-up and detailed gait testing of patients undergoing CnF stimulation will be necessary to confirm the effects on FOG.

Changing the worldwide use of the great quantity of food loss and waste can help to move in this direction. At this purpose, it seems useful to transform food waste into richness, extracting and using its content in natural ingredients and biopolymers to make new sustainable products and goods, including cosmetics and medical devices. Many of these ingredients are not only bioactive molecules considered of interest to produce these consumer products but are also useful in reducing the environmental footprint. The active agents may be obtained, for example, from waste material such as grapes or olive pomace, which include, among others natural polymers, phythosterols, vitamins, minerals and unsaturated fatty acids. Among the polymers, chitin and lignin have shown particular interest because biodegradable, nontoxic, skin- and environmentally friendly ingredients can be obtained at low cost from food and forestry waste, respectively. According to our experience, these polymers may be used to make nanocomposites and micro-nanoparticles that encapsulate different active ingredients, and which may be embedded into gel and non-woven tissues to realize advanced medications and smart cosmeceuticals. However, to utilize food waste in the best possible way, a better education of both industry and the consumer is considered necessary, introducing all to change the ways of production and living. The consumer has to understand the need to privilege, food, cosmetics and goods by selecting products known to be effective that also have a low release of carbon dioxide. Thus, they must pay heed to purchasing cosmetics and medical devices made by natural ingredients and packaged by biodegradable and/or reusable containers that are possibly plastic free. Conversely, the industry must try to use natural raw materials obtained from waste by changing their actual production methods. Therefore, both industry and the consumer should depart from the linear economy, which is based on taking, making, and producing waste, to move into a circular economy, which is based on redesigning, reducing, reusing and recycling. Some examples will report on the possibility to use natural polymers, including chitin and lignin, to produce new cosmeceutical tissues. These innovative tissues, to be used as biodegradable carriers for making smart cosmetics and medical devices, may be produced at zero waste to save our health and the planet biodiversity.","output":"Food Loss and Food Waste for Green Cosmetics and Medical Devices for a Cleaner Planet"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), strict follow-up is essential.

Methods: To improve the accuracy of the HCM patient list in a single hospital, we developed a rule-based information extraction natural language processing (NLP) framework. The framework employed ontological expansion of vocabulary and exclusion-first annotation, and received training by an 'expert in the loop'. The output stratified patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF), those without active cardiology care and likely screened individuals. Results: The algorithm was validated against multiple data sources, including manual validation, for HCM, AF and HF and family history of the disease. Overall precision and recall were 0.854 and 0.865 respectively. The pipeline found 25,356 documents featuring HCM-related terms belonging to 11,083 patients. Excluding scanned documents resulted in 17,178 letters from 3,120 patients. Subsequent categorisation identified 1,753 real cases, of whom 357 had AF and 205 had HF.

Results showed that sediments were highly enriched with Pb with enrichment factors >5.5, while Pb in sediments was dominated by reducible and residual Pb fractions, residing mainly in Fe-oxide and silicate minerals. Pb isotopes in sediments was characterized by radiogenic Pb produced from the decay of uranium and thorium with 206Pb/207Pb ratios of 1.1744 for less radiogenic Pb and 1.1816 for more radiogenic Pb. The leachates and residues from BCR extraction generally had similar Pb isotope compositions, of which the 206Pb/207Pb ratios were 1.1798a?a?0.002 and 1.1844a?a?0.008 respectively. Differentiation of Pb isotopes between BCR leachates and residues was insignificant.

Notably, the structure provides consistent enhancement over other competitive SPR structures for both angular and wavelength interrogations with a figure-of-merit of 692.28. Additionally, we repeated simulations for various ligate-ligand pairs to assess the range of applicability and robust performance improvement has been observed. As a result, the proposed sensor design provides a suitable configuration for highly sensitive, rapid, noninvasive biosensing which can be useful if adopted in experimental sensing protocols.","output":"Numerical Analysis of a Highly Sensitive Surface Plasmon Resonance Sensor for SARS-CoV-2 Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus are contagious respiratory pathogens with similar symptoms but require different treatment and management strategies. This study investigated whether laboratory blood tests can discriminate between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infections at emergency department (ED) presentation. Methods723 influenza A/B positive (2018/1/1 to 2020/3/15) and 1,281 SARS-CoV-2 positive (2020/3/11 to 2020/6/30) ED patients were retrospectively analyzed. Laboratory test results completed within 48 hours prior to reporting of virus RT-PCR results, as well as patient demographics were included to train and validate a random forest (RF) model. The dataset was randomly divided into training (2/3) and testing (1/3) sets with the same SARS-CoV-2/influenza ratio. The Shapley Additive Explanations technique was employed to visualize the impact of each laboratory test on the differentiation. ResultsThe RF model incorporating results from 15 laboratory tests and demographic characteristics discriminated SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infections, with an area under the ROC curve value 0.90 in the independent testing set. The overall agreement with the RT-PCR results was 83% (95% CI: 80-86%). The test with the greatest impact on the differentiation was serum total calcium level. Further, the model achieved an AUC of 0.82 in a new dataset including 519 SARS-CoV-2 ED patients (2020/12/1 to 2021/2/28) and the previous 723 influenza positive patients. Serum calcium level remained the most impactful feature on the differentiation. ConclusionWe identified characteristic laboratory test profiles differentiating SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infections, which may be useful for the preparedness of overlapping COVID-19 resurgence and future seasonal influenza.","output":"A Machine Learning Model Incorporating Laboratory Blood Tests Discriminates Between SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza Infections at Emergency Department Visit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Despite early identification and advancements in cochlear implant and hearing aid technology, delays in language skills in deaf children continue to exist. Good-quality parent-child interaction (PCI) is a key predictor for the successful development of deaf children's signed and/or spoken language. Though professionals have standard assessments to monitor child language, a clinical tool to observe the quality of parental interaction is yet to be developed. AIMS AND METHODS This systematic review with narrative synthesis aims to uncover which parent behaviours are assessed in PCI studies with deaf infants aged 0-3 years, how these behaviours are assessed, and which are correlated with higher scores in child language. RESULTS Sixty-one papers were included, spanning 40 years of research. Research included in the review assessed parents' skills in gaining attention, joint engagement, emotional sensitivity, and language input. PCI was mostly assessed using coding systems and frame-by-frame video analysis. Some of the parent behaviours mentioned previously are associated with more words produced by deaf children. CONCLUSION The results of the review provide the evidence base required to develop the content of a future clinical assessment tool for parent-child interaction in deafness.","output":"Assessing Parent Behaviours in Parent-Child Interactions with Deaf and Hard of Hearing Infants Aged 0-3 Years: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The phenomenon of the Corona Virus Diseases (COVID-19) Pandemic that has occurred in all corners of the world has made the worlds internal situation very worrying.

Material and locations The extant fern taxa occupying Africa south of the Sahara, Madagascar and some islands of the South Atlantic. Methods The number of taxa in each area or operational geographical unit (OGU) was scored, and the correlation between this number and physical and climatic variables analysed by standard pairwise and stepwise multiple regression analysis (SPR and SMR). The effects of biological factors such as dispersal capacity, reproductive biology, genetic features and certain physiological adaptations were evaluated by comparing the number of species in each OGU. Floral affinities among OGUs were analysed using non\\\\metric multi\\\\dimensional scaling (NMS) and parsimonic analysis of dispersion (PAD), and compared with ©\\\\turnover and inter\\\\OGU distances. Results OGU area, elevation and the distance between refuges determined the composition of local floras, but only greater OGU area and the existence of higher maximum elevations increased species richness. The distance between refuges also affected the number of endemic species, especially on islands. The biological features studied only slightly influenced fern distribution. The main climatic predictor of species number was humidity. SPR and SMR revealed three main groups of ferns with different ecological trends. NMS and PAD analyses separated the four areas of highest diversity in Africa, three of which are inhabited by ferns with distinct ecological requirements. The fourth area was Madagascar, which shows an accumulation of endemic and relict diversity that is not easy to explain. Main conclusions The distribution of ferns in Africa has been influenced by refuges. These probably allowed many species to recolonize the neighbouring areas after the extinctions of the Pleistocene. Three major components were detected in the African flora: Guinea\\\\Congolian thermophilous, cold\\\\tolerant Afro\\\\montane, and Southern drought\\\\tolerant elements. These are related to the three main refuge areas, i.e. the Gulf of Guinea area, the eastern tropical region, and the Cape region. Endemicity in ferns was found to be lower than that of seed plants due to the higher dispersability of fern spores.

Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) was measured at baseline and during rebreathing followed by a maximal end-inspiratory apnea. In women, baseline MSNA was greater in the midluteal (ML) than early-follicular (EF) phase of the menstrual cycle. Baseline MSNA burst incidence was greater in men than women, while burst frequency and total MSNA were similar between men and women only in the ML phase. Chemoreflex activation evoked graded increases in MSNA burst frequency, amplitude, and total activity in all participants. In women, this sympathoexcitation was greater in the EF than ML phase. The sympathoexcitatory response to chemoreflex stimulation of the EF phase in women was also greater than in men. Nonetheless, changes in total peripheral resistance were similar between sexes and menstrual cycle phases. This indicates that neurovascular transduction was attenuated during the EF phase during chemoreflex activation, thereby offsetting the exaggerated sympathoexcitation. Chemoreflex-induced increases in mean arterial pressure were similar across sexes and menstrual cycle phases. During acute chemoreflex stimulation, reduced neurovascular transduction could provide a mechanism by which apnea-associated morbidity might be attenuated in women relative to men.","output":"Menstrual cycle and sex effects on sympathetic responses to acute chemoreflex stress."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on surgical volume and emergency department (ED) consults across obstetric & gynecologic (OB/GYN) services at a New York City hospital. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: Tertiary-care academic medical center in New York City PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Women undergoing OB/GYN ED consults or surgeries between February 1st to April 15th. INTERVENTIONS: March 16th institutional moratorium on elective surgeries MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The volume and types of surgeries and ED consults were compared before and after the COVID-19 moratorium. During the pandemic, the average weekly volume of ED consults and GYN surgeries decreased, while OB surgeries remained stable. The proportions of OBGYN ED consults, GYN surgeries, and OB surgeries relative to all ED consults, all surgeries, and all labor and delivery patients were 1.87%, 13.8%, 54.6% in the pre-COVID timeframe (February 1st to March 15th) versus 1.53%, 21.3%, 79.7% in the COVID timeframe (March 16th to April 15th), representing no significant difference in proportions of OBGYN ED consults (p=0.464) and GYN surgeries (p=0.310) before and during COVID, with proportionate increase in OB surgeries (p<.002). The distribution of GYN surgical case types changed significantly during the pandemic with higher proportions of emergent surgeries for ectopics, miscarriages, and concern for cancer (p <.001). Alternatively, the OB surgery distribution of case types remained relatively constant. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights how the pandemic has impacted the ways OB/GYN patients access and receive care. As expected, institutional policies suspending elective surgeries during the pandemic decreased GYN surgical volume and affected the types of cases performed. This decrease was not appreciated for OB surgical volume reflecting the non-elective and time-sensitive nature of obstetric care. A decrease in ED consults was noted during the pandemic begging the question \\"Where have all the emergencies gone?\\". Although the moratorium on elective procedures was necessary, \\"elective\\" GYN surgeries remain medically indicated to address symptoms such as pain and bleeding and to prevent serious medical sequelae such as severe anemia requiring transfusion.

Objective Thus, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of epidemiological data and laboratory para-meters for in-hospital case fatality in patients with COVID-19. Materials and Methods A retrospective cohort of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Shahid Mostafa Khomeini Hospital of Ilam University of Medical Sciences from February 29 until March 29, 2020 was performed. Epidemiologic data and laboratory results were collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were performed to evaluate the prognostic value of the laboratory parameters for in-hospital death. Results A total of 256 Iranian COVID-19 patients were included in the evaluation; 38 of them died, resulting in a in-hospital case-fatality rate of 14.8%. The univariate analysis showed that advanced age [OR=1.04, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.06, P=0.001], smoking [OR=4.041, 95% CI: 1.546-10.563, P=0.004], white blood cells [OR=0.941, 95% CI: 0.904-0.980, P =0.003] and hematocrit [OR=1.060, 95% CI: 1.009-1.113, P=0.020] were positively associated with the risk of a fatal outcome.

In doing so, the X77-mimetic candidates were predicted based on the crystal X77-MPro structure by a public web-oriented virtual screening platform Pharmit. Models of these candidates bound to SARS-COV-2 MPro were generated by molecular docking, quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. At the final point, analysis of the interaction modes of the identified compounds with MPro and prediction of their binding affinity were carried out. Calculation revealed 5 top-ranking compounds that exhibited a high affinity to the active site of SARS-CoV-2 MPro. Insights into the ligand - MPro models indicate that all identified compounds may effectively block the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 MPro, in line with the low values aaof binding free energy and dissociation constant. Mechanism of binding of these compounds to MPro is mainly provided by van der Waals interactions with the functionally important residues of the enzyme, such as His-41, Met-49, Cys-145, Met-165, and Gln-189 that play a role of the binding hot spots assisting the predicted molecules to effectively interact with the MPro active site.

This upward trajectory leads to a substantial personal and societal cost. There is growing body of literature demonstrating decision-making impairments associated with affective disorders, and more studies are using computational modelling methods to infer underlying mechanisms of these impairments from participant choice behaviour. However, lack of population modelling suggests that data resources may still be underutilised. RECENT FINDINGS: A number of recent studies associated major depression with abnormal risky decision-making as well as impairments in temporal discounting and social decision-making. These domains capture relevant aspects of real-life decision-making. Consequently, data from these studies can be used to define behavioural phenotypes for major depression. SUMMARY: The manuscript describes a detailed proposal for population modelling to capture changes in the prevalence rate of major depression. The population modelling approach can also identify which decision-making domains can account for a larger part of impairments in psychosocial functioning and how behavioural interventions built on computational principles can target these to improve real-life psychosocial functioning in patient groups.","output":"Population Modelling in Affective Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sejak awal tahun 2020 virus Corona bentuk baru/COVID-19 telah menyebar di seluruh dunia.

The aim of this study was to analyse and report the containment measures' impact on trauma surgery activity during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to quickly react and adjust in case of a new sanitary crisis and containment. METHODS: An original epidemiological study was performed in our trauma centre in France. Data from trauma surgeries performed during the pre-containment (from March 1 to March 16, 2020), containment (from March 17 to April 17, 2020) and reference (from March 1 to April 17, 2019) periods were compared. The primary outcome was the number of patients operated on daily and the daily operating room time. Clinical data, delay for surgery, mechanism of injury and injury pattern were also reviewed. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant decrease in the number of patients operated upon daily (- 39,8%, p value < 0.001) and daily operating room time (- 35.5%, p value < 0.001) between the reference and containment periods and between the pre-containment and containment periods (respectively, - 35.0%, p value < 0.001 and - 28.7%, p value 0.002).

We observed that cyclic dinucleotide as well as novel non-dinucleotide STING ligands diABZI and MSA-2 co-stimulated cytokine induction in V2 T cells within peripheral blood mononuclear cells but simultaneously inhibited their proliferative expansion in response to the aminobisphosphonate Zoledronate and to æ T-cell specific phosphoantigen. In purified æ T cells, STING ligands co-stimulated cytokine induction but required the presence of monocytes. STING ligands strongly stimulated IL-1 and TNF- secretion in monocytes and co-stimulated cytokine induction in short-term expanded V2 æ T-cell lines. Simultaneously, massive cell death was triggered in both cell populations. Activation of STING as revealed by TBK1/IRF3 phosphorylation and IP-10 secretion varied among STING-expressing tumor cells. STING ligands modulated tumor cell killing by V2 T cells as analyzed in Real-Time Cell Analyzer to variable degree, depending on the tumor target and time course kinetics. Our study reveals complex regulatory effects of STING ligands on human æ T cells in vitro. These results help to define conditions where STING ligands might boost the efficacy of æ T cell immunotherapy in vivo.","output":"Stimulatory and inhibitory activity of STING ligands on tumor-reactive human gamma/delta T cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel types of the vaccines with high immunogenicity and low risks, including epitope-based vaccines, are sought.

The postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics is representative of global cancellations of sporting events, reduced facility access and support restrictions that have affected both current and former athletes psychological wellbeing. This study aimed to determine whether current (n=93) and former (n=111) athletes experienced worsened body image, relationship with food or eating disorder symptomatology during acute COVID-19 transitions.MethodsThe study was a Convergent Mixed Methods design whereby qualitative content analysis was collected and analysed simultaneously with quantitative cross-sectional data using the EAT-26 and self-report COVID-19 questions. Data were collected from April until May 2020 to capture data pertaining to transitions related to the pandemic and included individuals across 41 different individual and team sports from club to international competition levels. ResultsThere was a surge in disordered eating behaviours and cognitions in current and former athletes as a result of the early COVID-19 response. Eating disorders were suggested to occur in 21.1% of participants (18% current athletes n=17, 25% former athletes (n=26). There was a significant difference between males and females (p=0.018, r=0.17), but interestingly no differences between groups from individual vs team sports, type of sporting category (endurance, antigravitational, ball sport, power, technical and aesthetic) or level of competition (club, state, national or international). 34.8% (n=69) self-reported worsened body image and 32.8% (n=65) self-reported a worsened food relationship directly from COVID-19. Qualitative analysis indicated that disordered eating occurred predominantly in the form of body preoccupation, inhibitory food control, fear of body composition changes and binge eating.ConclusionsThis study indicates that transitions in COVID-19 have worsened food-body relationships in current and former athletes and must be treated as an at-risk time for eating disorder development. We suggest that resources are allocated appropriately to assist athletes foster psychologically positive food and body relationships through COVID-19 transitions.

METHODS: A matched case-control study was conducted in 366 Thai participants, including 122 who were confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive by RT-PCR (case group) and 244 who were SARS-CoV-2-negative (control group). Taste, smell, and appetite changes were assessed by self-reported visual analog scale. Preference for sweet, salty, umami, sour, bitter, and spicy were judged using the validated TASTE-26 questionnaire. RESULTS: Partial taste and smell losses were observed in both groups, while complete losses (ageusia and anosmia) were detected only in the case group. Moreover, only ageusia and anosmia were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity (P < 0.001, odds ratio of 14.5 and 27.5, respectively). Taste, smell, and appetite scores were more severely reduced in the case group (P < 0.0001).

Aiming to initiate a climate-centered dialogue, a hybrid team of scientists and artists collected local narratives within the Kerourien neighbourhood, in the city of Brest in Brittany, France. Kerourien is a place known for its stigmatizing crime, poverty, marginalization and state of disrepair. Social work is higher on the agenda than climate action. The team thus acknowledged that local narratives might not make much mention of climate change, and recognized part of the work might be to shift awareness to the actual or potential, current or future, connections between everyday non-climate concerns and climate issues. Such a shift called for a practical intervention, centered on local culture. The narrative collection process was dovetailed with preparing the neighbourhoods 50th anniversary celebration and establishing a series of art performances to celebrate the neighbourhood and its residents. Non-climate and quasi-climate stories were collected, documented, and turned into art forms. The elements of climate service co-production in this process are twofold. First, they point to the ways in which non-climate change related local concerns may be mapped out in relation to climate change adaptation, showing how non-climate change concerns call for climate information. Secondly, they show how the co-production of climate services may go beyond the provision of climate information by generating procedural benefits such as local empowerment C thus generating capacities that may be mobilized to face climate change. We conclude by stressing that place-based climate service co-production for action may require questioning the nature of the services rendered, questioning the nature of place, and questioning what action entails. We offer leads for addressing these questions in ways that help realise empowerment and greater social justice.","output":"Facing climate injustices: community trust-building for climate services through Arts and Sciences narrative co-production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter will focus on stage-based interventions for substance use disorders.

METHODS: We contacted hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 64) by phone, at three time-points: during the first days after admission to the hospital (T1); after ~two weeks from the beginning of hospitalization (T2), and one month after hospitalization (T3). At all time-points we assessed the levels of anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as PRSF. At T3, PTSS were assessed. RESULTS: The levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms decreased one-month following hospitalization. Moreover, higher levels of anxiety (standardized  = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.81C1.49, p < 0.001) and depression ( = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.63C1.31 p < 0.001) symptoms during the first week of hospitalization, feeling socially disconnected ( = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.37C0.81 p < 0.001) and experiencing a longer hospitalization period ( = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.03C0.47 p = 0.026) predicted higher PTSS scores a month post-hospitalization.

We also investigated predictors of willingness to have a COVID-19 vaccine and found that although vaccine acceptance was high on average, it decreased as a function of lower belief in science and higher conspiracy mentality. We found that 24% of participants had shared possible misinformation and that this was predicted by a lower belief in science.

Additionally, new policies have been implemented to better facilitate patient care, safety, and privacy. The convenience provided by this low resource modality facilitates the intercommunication between physicians and offers a suitable alternative for patients who are medically or socially unable to see providers in person.

In the future, the impact of telemedicine on healthcare environments cannot be overstated, especially in hospice and nursing home settings where it stands to improve treatment efficacy and monitoring for the elderly. Newer inventions such as the remote patient monitoring system can act as safety nets for clinic patients, while improving accessibility of electronic health records (EHRs) will dramatically augment available treatment options.

However, the impact of teaching feedback during hematologyoncology training has not been studied. We aimed to identify barriers in delivering and receiving highquality feedback in our fellowship program and to create a curriculum aimed at teaching fellows and faculty how to engage in more effective feedback conversations. Methods: This pilot study aimed at determining and addressing perceived barriers to high-quality feedback in the hematology-oncology fellowship program. A pre-intervention questionnaire, consisting of Likert scale and openended questions, was administered to identify barriers to giving feedback and to assess satisfaction with the quality of feedback received in our fellowship program. The results of the baseline questionnaire were utilized to build a virtual interactive three-session workshop provided by the ASCO Quality Training Program in which the importance of feedback and methods of providing effective feedback were taught. Topics included feedback set-up, low-inference observation, and a structured approach to reinforcing and modifying feedback. One month after the intervention the participants completed a follow up questionnaire. This project was developed through the ASH Medical Educators Institute. Results: Each questionnaire was completed by 11 participants. The two main barriers to high-quality feedback identified were the discomfort with both giving and receiving feedback, and the lack of protected time. At baseline only 54% of the participants reported they were comfortable giving feedback, increasing to 81% post- intervention. Pre-intervention, 81% of participants reported they did not have protected time for feedback, decreasing to 64% after the intervention and institution of weekly protected time for feedback. Half of the participants reported that the feedback was not actionable in the initial questionnaire, decreasing to 10% postintervention. Overall, fellows reported that their feedback was mostly focused on notes, followed by presentations and interpersonal skills. Faculty reported that most of the feedback they received was about time management and patient care. Conclusions: This pilot study helped address a major barrier to improvement and growth within our training program and confirmed that feedback skills must be taught and practiced. A 6-hour virtual workshop showed tangible results in the satisfaction with and quality of feedback given to both fellows and faculty.

METHODS: One-hundred nasopharyngeal samples were collected from 47 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, and 200 samples were collected from healthy donners. We measured the SARS-CoV-2 antigen and nucleic acid using Lumipulse Presto SARS-CoV-2 Ag and the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Detection Kit, respectively. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen test were 75.7% (56/74) and 96.0% (192/200), respectively. The concordance rate in the positive group between the antigen and nucleic acid tests was 66% (66/100). In addition, the correlation coefficient between the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 antigen and the level of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 0.74. There were 19 discrepant samples in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected without SARS-CoV-2 antigen. There was significant difference between the discrepant and matched samples in terms of the time since symptom onset: the 19 discrepant samples were collected a median of 33 days after onset, while the 55 matched samples were collected a median of 19 days after onset. In addition, the 19 discrepant samples were collected from patients who were immune against SARS-CoV-2.

The salt recrystallization following aerosol exposure was characterized over time on sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium sulfate (K2SO4), and potassium chloride (KCl) powders and coatings, which revealed that NaCl and KCl start to recrystallize within 5 min and K2SO4 within 15 min. The inactivation kinetics observed for the H1N1 influenza virus and Klebsiella pneumoniae matched the salt recrystallization well, which was identified as the main destabilizing mechanism. Additionally, the salt-coated filters were prepared with different methods (with and without a vacuum process), which led to salt coatings with different morphologies for diverse applications. Finally, the salt-coated filters caused a loss of pathogen viability independent of transmission mode (aerosols or droplets), against both DI water and artificial saliva suspensions.

Well aware that understanding the real connection between the spread of this fatal virus and air pollutants would require many other investigations at a level appropriate to the scale of this phenomenon (e.g., biological, chemical, and physical), we propose the results of a study, where a series of the measures of the daily values of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2were considered over time, while the Granger causality statistical hypothesis test was used for determining the presence of a possible correlation with the series of the new daily COVID19 infections, in the period February-April 2020, in Emilia-Romagna. Results taken both before and after the governmental lockdown decisions show a clear correlation, although strictly seen from a Granger causality perspective. Moving beyond the relevance of our results towards the real extent of such a correlation, our scientific efforts aim at reinvigorating the debate on a relevant case, that should not remain unsolved or no longer investigated.","output":"Particulate matter and COVID-19 disease diffusion in Emilia-Romagna (Italy).

This study was conducted to examine the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine for people who were  75 years of age, specifically those who first took two doses of the vaccine at the COVID-19 central vaccination center in South Korea. METHODS: Safety monitoring after the BNT162b2 vaccine was conducted in three ways for older adults who received the first dose of the vaccine at our center between April 5 and April 23, 2021. For immediate adverse reactions, every person who was vaccinated was observed for 15C30 minutes after injection at the center. For active surveillance, a telephone interview was conducted for stratified randomly sampled people after 7 days of each vaccination to enquire regarding types of adverse reactions they experienced, and its severity and duration. For passive surveillance, reported adverse event data were collected from the COVID-19 vaccine adverse event following immunization (AEFI) surveillance systemrun by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). The data were then reviewed. RESULTS: In total, 2,123 older adults received at least one vaccine dose during the study period. The frequency of acute adverse reactions that developed during the observed 15C30 minutes after injection was 8.5 cases per 1,000 doses. None of the reactions was assessed as acute allergic reactions to the vaccine and no cases required special treatment or drug administration. Overall, 638 people were followed up at least once by telephone interview 7 days post vaccination. The overall response rate was 82.3%. The rates of local reactions were 50.3% after the first dose and 45.2% after the second dose, and the rates of systemic reactions were 15.2% and 26.0%, respectively. During the study period, 23 medically attended adverse events (5.4 cases per 1,000 administered doses) were reported to the KDCA AEFI surveillance system. The most common symptoms of medically attended cases were nonspecific general weakness (26%) and dizziness (26%), followed by muscle pain (22%), headache (13%), fever (13%), and skin rash or urticaria (13%). Among them, there were five serious adverse events reported, which required hospitalization, including one death. However, most of them were not related to the vaccines.

The murine dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (Dpp4) protein is not a functional receptor for MERS-CoV; thus, mice are resistant to MERS-CoV infection. We generated human DPP4 knock-in (hDPP4 KI) mice by replacing exons 10C12 at the mouse Dpp4 locus with exons 10C12 from the human DPP4 gene. The resultant human DPP4 KI mice are permissive to MERS-CoV (HCoV-EMC/2012 strain) infection but develop no disease.

Early identification and proper management of patients with COVID-19 are important. Features in chest computed tomography (CT) can facilitate identifying newly infected individuals. However, CT findings of some lung contusions are similar to those of COVID-19, as shown in the present case. CASE SUMMARY: A 46-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for backache and foot pain caused by a fall injury 1 d before hospitalization. She was suspected of having COVID-19, since there was a confirmed COVID-19 case near her residence. But she had no fever, cough, chest tightness, difficult breathing, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, etc. On physical examination, the lower posterior chest of both sides showed dullness on percussion and moist rales at the end of inspiration on auscultation. The white blood cell count and lymphocyte count were 10.88  10(9)/L and 1.04  10(9)/L, respectively. CT performed on February 7, 2020 revealed that both lungs were scattered with patchy ground-glass opacity. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary contusion with thoracic spinal fracture (T12), calcaneal fracture, and pelvic fracture. On day 9 after conservative treatment, her condition was alleviated. On review of the chest CT, the previous shadows were significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: Differential diagnosis of lung contusion and COVID-19 must be emphasized.

Here, we generated global statistics on virus infections in NHPs (VI-NHPs) based on a literature search and public data mining. In total, 140 NHP species from 12 families are reported to be infected by 186 DNA and RNA virus species, 68.8% of which are also found in humans, indicating high potential for crossing species boundaries. The top 10 NHP species with high centrality in the NHP-virus network include two great apes (Pan troglodytes, Pongo pygmaeus) and eight Old World monkeys (Macaca mulatta, M. fascicularis, M. leonina, Papio cynocephalus, Cercopithecus ascanius, C. erythrotis, Chlorocebus aethiops, and Allochrocebus lhoesti). Given the wide distribution of Old World monkeys and their frequent contact with humans, there is a high risk of virus circulation between humans and such species. Thus, we suggest recurring epidemiological surveillance of NHPs, specifically Old World monkeys that are in frequent contact with humans, and other effective measures to prevent potential circulation and transmission of viruses.

Longitudinal evaluation of total RBD IgG and neutralizing antibody revealed declining total antibody titers but improved neutralization potency per antibody to original SARS-CoV-2, indicative of antibody response maturation. Neutralization assays with authentic viruses revealed that early antibodies capable of neutralizing original SARS-CoV-2 had limited reactivity toward B.1.351 (501Y.V2) and P.1 (501Y.V3) variants. Antibodies from late convalescents exhibited increased neutralization potency to VOCs, suggesting persistence of cross-neutralizing antibodies in plasma. Thus, maturation of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 potentiates cross-neutralizing ability to circulating variants, suggesting that declining antibody titers may not be indicative of declining protection.","output":"Temporal maturation of neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent individuals improves potency and breadth to circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global threat. Few studies have explored the risk factors for the recovery time of patients with COVID-19. This study aimed to explore risk factors associated with long-term hospitalization in patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective study, patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in a hospital in Wuhan by March 30, 2020, were included. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data from COVID-19 patients on hospital admission were extracted and were compared between the two groups, defined as short- and long-term hospitalization, respectively according to the median hospitalization time. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods were performed to identify risk factors associated with long-term hospitalization in patients with COVID-19. Results: A total of 125 discharged patients with COVID-19 were reviewed, including 123 general patients and two severe patients. The median hospitalization time was 13.0 days (IQR 10.0C17.0). Among them, 66 patients were discharged &lt;14 days (short-term group) and 59 patients were discharged 14 days (long-term group). Compared with the short-term group, patients in the long-term group had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein (P = 0.000), troponin I (P = 0.002), myoglobin (P = 0.037), aspartate aminotransferase (P = 0.005), lactic dehydrogenase (P = 0.000), prothrombin time (P = 0.030), fibrinogen (P = 0.000), and D-dimer (P = 0.006), but had significantly lower levels of lymphocyte count (P = 0.001), platelet count (P = 0.017), albumin (P = 0.001), and calcium (P = 0.000). Additionally, the incidences of hypocalcemia (P = 0.001), hyponatremia (P = 0.021), hypochloremia (P = 0.019), and bilateral pneumonia (P = 0.000) in the long-term group were significantly higher than those in the short-term group. Multivariable regression showed that hypocalcemia (P = 0.007, OR 3.313, 95% CI 1.392C7.886), hypochloremia (P = 0.029, OR 2.663, 95% CI 1.104C6.621), and bilateral pneumonia (P = 0.009, OR 5.907, 95% CI 1.073C32.521) were independent risk factors associated with long-term hospitalization in patients with COVID-19.

The resulting model (LINKNZ) was evaluated by comparing site simulations against independent field measurements of stand sequences and across temperature and moisture gradients. It successfully simulated gap dynamics and forest succession for a range of temperate forest ecosystems in New Zealand, while retaining its utility for the forests of eastern North America. These simulations provided insight into New Zealand coniferChardwood and beech species forest succession. The adequacy of the ecological processes, such as soil moisture balance, decomposition rates, and nutrient cycling, embodied in a forest simulation model was tested by applying it to New Zealand forest ecosystems. This gave support to the models underlying hypothesis, derived from LINKAGES, that interactions among demographic, microbial, and geological processes can explain much of the observed variation in ecosystem carbon and nitrogen storage and cycling.

According to the current reports, this is a situation when people need to be more careful and take the precaution measures more seriously, unless the condition may become even worse. Maintaining social distances and proper hygiene, staying at isolation or adopting the self-quarantine method are some of the common practices that people should use to avoid the infection. And the growing information regarding COVID-19 and its symptoms help the people to take proper precautions. In this present study, we consider an SEIRS epidemiological model on COVID-19 transmission which accounts for the effect of an individuals behavioural response due to the information regarding proper precautions. Our results indicate that if people respond to the growing information regarding awareness at a higher rate and start to take the protective measures, then the infected population decreases significantly. The disease fatality can be controlled only if a large proportion of individuals become immune, either by natural immunity or by a proper vaccine. In order to apply the latter option, we need to wait until a safe and proper vaccine is developed and it is a time-taking process. Hence, in the latter part of the work, an optimal control problem is considered by implementing control strategies to reduce the disease burden. Numerical figures show that the control denoting behavioural response works with higher intensity immediately after implementation and then gradually decreases with time. Further, the control policy denoting hospitalisation of infected individuals works with its maximum intensity for quite a long time period following a sudden decrease. As, the implementation of the control strategies reduce the infected population and increase the recovered population, so, it may help to reduce the disease transmission at this current epidemic situation.","output":"Epidemic model of COVID-19 outbreak by inducing behavioural response in population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we develop a novel neural network model for predicting implied volatility surface.

Patients were categorized into two groups: virologic responses achieved in the first week (group 1) and in the first to the fourth week (group 2). Pretreatment factors were compared between the groups. RESULTS: Patients in group 1 who achieved ultraRVR (undetectable HCV RNA after 1 week of treatment) had significantly lower mean pretreatment HCV RNA levels and lower prevalence of ESRF than patients in group 2. CONCLUSIONS: RVR has been indicated to be a robust positive predictor of sustained virologic response. We concluded that some pretreatment factors such as low HCV RNA level and absence of ESRF might lead to faster RVR and shorter treatment duration with DAAs for CHC.","output":"Rapid virologic response in chronic hepatitis C genotype 1: Evaluation of pretreatment factors in patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), has claimed millions of human lives worldwide since the emergence of the zoonotic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China in December 2019. Notably, most severe and fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans have been associated with underlying clinical conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, and heart diseases. Here we describe a case of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in a domestic cat ( Felis catus ) that presented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a chronic heart condition that has been described as a comorbidity of COVID-19 in humans and that is prevalent in domestic cats. The lung and heart of the affected cat presented clear evidence of SARS-CoV-2 replication, with histological lesions similar to those observed in humans with COVID-19 with high infectious viral loads being recovered from these organs. The study highlights the potential impact of comorbidities on the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals and provides important information that may contribute to the development of a feline model with the potential to recapitulate the clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19 in humans.","output":"Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cat with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study was to investigate the relationships between taste responsiveness and food liking in preadolescents. Model food samples of grapefruit juice (GF) and vegetable broth (VB) modified with four additions of sucrose and sodium chloride, respectively, were employed. Intensity perception for sweetness, sourness, and bitterness were measured in GF while saltiness and umami were measured in VB. The children (N = 148) also completed food choice, familiarity, stated liking and neophobia questionnaires. The test was conducted at school, with instructions provided remotely via video call. Four segments were defined differing in basic taste responsiveness. Segments and sucrose concentrations significantly affected liking for GF, while no significant effect of segments and sodium chloride concentrations occurred on liking for VB. An increasing sucrose concentration was positively associated with liking for GF only in the segment with low responsiveness to bitter and sour tastes. No significant differences across segments were found for food choice, familiarity, stated liking, and neophobia. Conclusively, relationships between taste responsiveness and liking are product and basic taste-dependent in addition to being subject-dependent. Strategies to improve acceptance by using sucrose as a suppressor for warning sensations of bitterness and sourness can be more or less effective depending on individual responsiveness to the basic tastes.","output":"Does Responsiveness to Basic Tastes Influence Preadolescents Food Liking?

Here, we attempt to provide strategies to construct adenovirus vectors based on restriction-assembly for researchers with little experience in this field. Restriction-assembly is a combined method of restriction digestion and Gibson assembly, by which the major part of the obtained plasmid comes from digested DNA fragments instead of PCR products. We demonstrated the capability of restriction-assembly in manipulating the genome of simian adenovirus 1 (SAdV-1) in this study. A PCR product of the plasmid backbone was combined with SAdV-1 genomic DNA to construct an infectious clone, plasmid pKSAV1, by Gibson assembly. Restriction-assembly was performed repeatedly in the steps of intermediate plasmid isolation, modification, and restoration. The generated adenoviral plasmid was linearized by restriction enzyme digestion and transfected into packaging 293 cells to rescue E3-deleted replication-competent SAdV1XE3-CGA virus. Interestingly, SAdV1XE3-CGA could propagate in human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. The E1 region was similarly modified to generate E1/E3-deleted replication-defective virus SAdV1-EG. SAdV1-EG had a moderate gene transfer ability to adherent mammalian cells, and it could efficiently transduce suspension cells when compared with the human adenovirus 5 control vector. Restriction-assembly is easy to use and can be performed without special experimental materials and instruments. It is highly effective with verifiable outcomes at each step. More importantly, restriction-assembly makes the established vector system modifiable, upgradable and under sustainable development, and it can serve as the instructive method or strategy for the synthetic biology of adenoviruses.","output":"Restriction-Assembly: A Solution to Construct Novel Adenovirus Vector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has had unprecedented effects on lifestyle stability and physical and mental health.

This patient arrived at the ER with respiratory discomfort that had been evolving over a month with symptoms of flu and deterioration of her general condition. A chest CT scan revealed an aspect of lung miliary tuberculosis with isolation of Kochs bacilli in the sputum. A polymerization chain reaction (PCR) was positive for COVID-19 on a nasopharyngeal swab. HIV serology was positive. The course was marked by a spectacular clinical improvement and two negative COVID-19 PCR controls at the end of treatment (at days 9 and 10). Anti-tubercular drugs (especially, rifampin) are powerful enzyme inducers that can reduce the effectiveness of chloroquine in our patient. This therapeutic success may be linked to the effect of anti-tubercular drugs against SARS ncov-2, especially rifampin, inhibiting the formation of messenger RNAs of SARS ncov-2 or to the synergistic effect of chloroquine and rifampin.

In this study, we cloned, expressed and purified N protein of SARS-CoV. This 46-kD N protein was verified by SDS-PAGE and Western-blot. Then, the peptides binding-specific to N protein were identified using 15-mer phage-displayed library. Surprisingly, all of the 89 clones from monoclonal ELISA were positive (S/N>2.1) and the result was further confirmed experimentally once again. Six N protein-binding peptides, designated separately as SNA1, SNA2, SNA4, SNA5, SNA9 and SNG11, were selected for sequencing. Sequence analysis suggested that SNA5 shared approximatively 100% sequence identity to SNA4, SNA2, SNA9 and SNA1. In addition, the binding specificity of the 15-mer peptides with the SARS-CoV N protein was further demonstrated by blocking ELISA using the synthetical 15-mer peptide according to the deduced amino acid sequence of SNA5. Also, the deduced amino sequence of SNA5 was compared with proteins in translated database using the tblastx program, and the results showed that the proteins with the highest homology were Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase iron-sulfur subunits (UCRI or UQCR), otherwise known as the Rieske iron-sulfur proteins (RISP). Notablely, in the [2Fe-2S] redox centre of UCRI, there were 6 residues [GGW(Y)F(Y)CP] compatible to the residues (position 27, GGWFCP7) of the NH2-terminal of the 15-mer peptide, which indicated higher binding specificity between the N protein of SARS-CoV and the redox centre of UCRI to some extent.

Prior to the pandemic, medical residents and physicians often experienced difficulty receiving counseling due to concerns about confidentiality, stigma, cost, time, and reportability to licensure/credentialing bodies. Since 2004, the OHSU Resident and Faculty Wellness Program (RFWP) team has sought to reduce these barriers by providing on-site free, confidential, individual counseling and medication management. Utilization of this program is high with over 500 physicians a year seeking care; 38% of all OHSU residents/fellows and 7% of all faculty eligible for our services participated in 2019-20. In the present essay, we describe how our model of care for trainees and faculty was a key wellness resource during COVID-19. Similar to other accounts of lower help-seeking by health professionals initially during the pandemic, we experienced a slight downturn in utilization rates during the initial weeks of when the pandemic struck our area, but quickly returned to normal and exceeded prior levels. All appointments shifted to telehealth visits and a number of physicians expressed gratitude for the opportunity to talk through concerns and strengthen coping. A number of physicians requested medication consultations to address severe insomnia, anxiety, and depression.

We aimed to review the literature to get an insight into the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on lactating women. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: We searched Ovid Embase Classic+Embase, PubMed and BioMed Central for articles published between December 1(st) 2020 and December 31(st) 2021. REVIEW METHODS: The search strategy contained terms and combinations related to COVID-19 vaccination during lactation, including the MeSH terms COVID-19, COVID-19 Vaccines, SARS-CoV-2, Lactation, Breast Feeding, Pregnancy and Postpartum period. The database search was completed with a manual search of the reference lists of included articles. Data concerning country, study period, number of participants, type of applied vaccine, time points of sampling and outcome measures were collected from the selected manuscripts. The data are summarized and synthesized in a descriptive way. RESULTS: 30 manuscripts were included in this review. Data on safety of COVID-19 vaccination during lactation indicate no severe vaccine-related local and systemic reactions, both after first and second dose, neither in the mother nor the nursing child. No significant amount of vaccine components seems to appear in breast milk. Milk supply data after vaccination are inconclusive as there are no quantitative data available. Some women however observe a temporary increase or reduction in milk supply, without long-term effects. All prospective cohort studies demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in breast milk of nursing mothers vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Nearly all studies were conducted with mRNA vaccines. CONCLUSION: There is evidence that the administration of a COVID-19 vaccine is safe and poses no additional risk to the breastfeeding woman or the breastfed baby. After vaccination of the mother during the lactation period, antibodies appear in the milk, which could protect the infant against COVID-19. Professional associations and government health authorities should therefore recommend offering COVID-19 vaccines to breastfeeding women, as the potential benefits of maternal vaccination while breastfeeding outweigh the risks.","output":"The Effects of COVID-19 Vaccination on Lactating Women: A Systematic Review of the Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a case series of ozonated autohemotherapy of four COVID-19 patients, classified as critically ill (1 patient), severe (1 patient), and moderate (2 patients).

Various monotherapy or combination therapies with antivirals or other agents have been tried. The present study aims to evaluate the therapeutic potential of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavirCritonavir in combination with ribavirin in mildCsevere COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A single-center, open-label, parallel-arm, stratified randomized controlled trial evaluated the therapeutic potential of combination antiviral therapies. Enrolled patients in the severe category were randomized into three groups: (A) standard treatment, (B) hydroxychloroquine+ribavirin+standard treatment, or (C) lopinavir+ritonavir+ribavirin+standard treatment; while the non-severe category comprised two groups: (A) standard treatment or (B) hydroxychloroquine+ribavirin. Combination antivirals were given for 10 days and followed for 28 days. The primary endpoints were safety, symptomatic and laboratory recovery of organ dysfunctions, and time to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative report. RESULTS: In total, 111 patients were randomized: 24, 23, and 24 in severe categories A, B, and C, respectively, and 20 in each of the non-severe groups. Two patients receiving ribavirin experienced drug induced liver injury, and another developed QT prolongation after hydroxychloroquine. In the severe category, 47.6%, 55%, and 30.09% in A, B, and C groups, respectively, showed symptomatic recovery, compared to 93.3% and 86.7% in A and B groups, respectively, in the non-severe category at 72 hours (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Though the results failed to show statistical superiority of the antiviral combination therapies to that of the standard therapy in both the severe and non-severe categories in symptomatic adult patients of COVID-19 due to very small sized trial, clinically hydroxychloroquine+ribavirin therapy is showing better recovery by 7.4% than standard therapy in the former category.

Other migratory flows introduced into the Brazilian population genetic components from Asia and the Middle East. Currently, Brazil has a highly admixed population and, therefore, the study of genetic factors in the context of health or disease in Brazil is a challenging and remarkably interesting subject. This phenomenon is exemplified by the genetic variant CCR532, a 32 base-pair deletion in the CCR5 gene. CCR532 originated in Europe, but the time of origin as well as the selective pressures that allowed the maintenance of this variant and the establishment of its current frequencies in the different human populations is still a field of debates. Due to its origin, the CCR532 allele frequency is high in European-derived populations (~10%) and low in Asian and African native human populations. In Brazil, the CCR532 allele frequency is intermediate (4-6%) and varies on the Brazilian States, depending on the migratory history of each region. CCR5 is a protein that regulates the activity of several immune cells, also acting as the main HIV-1 co-receptor. The CCR5 expression is influenced by CCR532 genotypes. No CCR5 expression is observed in CCR532 homozygous individuals. Thus, the CCR532 has particular effects on different diseases. At the population level, the effect that CCR532 has on European populations may be different than that observed in highly admixed populations. Besides less evident due to its low frequency in admixed groups, the effect of the CCR532 variant may be affected by other genetic traits. Understanding the effects of CCR532 on Brazilians is essential to predict the potential use of pharmacological CCR5 modulators in Brazil. Therefore, this study reviews the impacts of the CCR532 on the Brazilian population, considering infectious diseases, inflammatory conditions, and cancer.

The aim of the study was to develop a clinical tool able to predict the failure of COT in COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with ARF. This was a retrospective monocentric cohort study carried out in the ED of the University Hospital of Bologna SantOrsola-Malpighi Polyclinic, Italy. The cohort comprised 101 COVID-19 patients with ARF from the first pandemic wave who received COT. This cohort was used to develop a scale that considers serum lactate concentration, partial arterial oxygen pressure/inspired oxygen fraction (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) ratio, and body temperature to predict COT failure, referred to as the Lactate, Oxygenation, and Temperature (LOT) score. The highest possible score was 17 points. The LOT score was associated with COT failure (area under the receiver operating curve or AUROC = 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 - 0.89, p < 0.001); the cut-off value of > 5 points had optimal predictive power and showed significantly higher 30-day mortality (log-rank (2) = 28,828, p < 0.0001). The LOT score was able to effectively predict COT failure in COVID-19 patients with ARF. Patients with LOT score > 5 had a very high risk of therapy failure, and more advanced respiratory therapies must be considered in these patients.","output":"Prediction of Conventional Oxygen Therapy Failure in COVID-19 Patients With Acute Respiratory Failure by Assessing Serum Lactate Concentration, PaO2/FiO2 Ratio, and Body Temperature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A major goal in human genetics is to use natural variation to understand the phenotypic consequences of altering each protein-coding gene in the genome.

Two questions are addressed: Whether and how do employers associations, business interest associations and economic chambers articulate themselves in the context of the Covid-19 crisis? Does their interaction with the state follow the pattern of a dedicated crisis corporatism? The starting point is the concept of path-dependence and the revitalisation of established patterns of state-business-interaction in the crisis. The study focuses on the period between March 2020 and February 2021. Based on an investigation of the forms and frequencies of state-business-interactions, three phases are identified and then analysed in detailed case studies. For the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic (MarchCJune 2020) a) information offers and political demands of employers associations, business interest associations and economic chambers are examined quantitatively and b) the congruence between the groups demands and the political measures introduced with the economic stimulus package is investigated. For the second phase (JulyCSeptember 2020) a case study of the branch-specific automotive corporatism during the crisis is presented. Finally, the analysis focuses on the growing distance between business demands and government in the third phase (October 2020CFebruary 2021).

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 313 consecutive hospitalized adult patients (18 years or older) with confirmed COVID-19. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the discriminatory power of the qCSI score and BCRSS prediction rule compared to the CURB-65 score for predicting mortality and intensive care unit admission. RESULTS: The overall in-hospital fatality rate was 32.3%, and the ICU admission rate was 31.3%. The CURB-65 score had the highest numerical AUC to predict in-hospital mortality (AUC 0.781) compared to the qCSI score (AUC 0.711) and the BCRSS prediction rule (AUC 0.663). For ICU admission, the qCSI score had the highest numerical AUC (AUC 0.761) compared to the BCRSS prediction rule (AUC 0.735) and the CURB-65 score (AUC 0.629).

We initiated the boarding restriction protocol that limits the time of stay in the ED for patients awaiting hospitalization to 24 hours from arrival. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the boarding restriction protocol on ED crowding. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The primary outcome was ED occupancy rate, which was calculated as the ratio of the number of occupying patients to the total number of ED beds. Time factors, such as length of stay (LOS), treatment time, and boarding time, were investigated. RESULTS: The mean of the ED occupancy rate decreased from 1.5320.432 prior to implementation of the protocol to 1.2730.353 after (p<0.001). According to time series analysis, the absolute effect caused by the protocol was -0.189 (-0.277 to -0.110) (p=0.001). The proportion of patients with LOS exceeding 24 hours decreased from 7.6% to 4.0% (p<0.001). Among admitted patients, ED LOS decreased from 770.7 (421.4C1587.1) minutes to 630.2 (398.0C1156.8) minutes (p<0.001); treatment time increased from 319.6 (198.5C482.8) minutes to 344.7 (213.4C519.5) minutes (p<0.001); and boarding time decreased from 298.9 (109.5C1149.0) minutes to 204.1 (98.7C545.7) minutes (p<0.001).

Technological solutions exist to sharing clinic visit information, but their effectiveness is unclear. OBJECTIVES: To assess if and how technology is being used to connect informal caregivers to patient clinic visit information when they cannot otherwise attend, and its impact on caregiver and patient outcomes. EVIDENCE REVIEW: MEDLINE, Cochrane, Scopus, and CINAHL were searched through 5/3/2020 with no language restrictions or limits. ClinicalTrials.gov and other reference lists were included in the search. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized trials that involved using a technological medium e.g., video or the electronic health record, to communicate visit information to a non-attending caregiver were included. Data were collected and screened using a standardized data collection form. Cochranes Risk of Bias 2.0 and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were used for RCTs and nonrandomized trials, respectively. All data were abstracted by two independent reviewers, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. FINDINGS: Of 2115 studies identified in the search, four met criteria for inclusion. Two studies were randomized controlled trials and two were nonrandomized trials. All four studies found positive effects of their intervention on caregiver outcomes of interest, and three out of four studies found statistically significant improvements in key outcomes for caregivers receiving visit information. Improved outcomes included caregiver happiness, caregiver activation, caregiver preparedness, and caregiver confidence in managing patient health.

But the generative model may become inaccurate or even collapse if the state has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we introduce a model called Curiosity-driven Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which combines variational autoencoder and curiosity-driven exploration. During the training process, the CVAE model can improve sample efficiency while curiosity-driven exploration can make sufficient exploration in a complex environment. Then, a CVAE-based algorithm is proposed, namely DQN-CVAE, that scales CVAE to higher dimensional environments. Finally, the performance of our algorithm is evaluated through several Atari 2600 games, and the experimental results show that the DQN-CVAE achieves better performance in terms of average reward per episode on these games.","output":"Curiosity-Driven Variational Autoencoder for Deep Q Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: There has been a drive towards increased digitalisation in healthcare. The aim was to provide a snapshot of current apps, instant messaging, and smartphone photography use in paediatric emergency care. A web-based self-report questionnaire was performed. Individual physicians working in paediatric emergency care recorded their personal practice. One hundred ninety-eight medical doctors completed the survey. Eight percent of respondents had access to institutional mobile devices to run medical apps. Eighty-six percent of respondents used medical apps on their personal mobile device, with 78% using Apple iOS devices. Forty-seven percent of respondents used formulary apps daily. Forty-nine percent of respondents had between 1C5 medical apps on their personal mobile device. Respondents who used medical apps had a total of 845 medical apps installed on their personal device, accounted for by 56 specific apps. The British National Formulary (BNF/BNFc) app was installed on the personal mobile device of 96% of respondents that use medical apps. Forty percent of respondents had patient confidentiality concerns when using medical apps. Thirty-eight percent of respondents have used consumer instant messaging services, 6% secure specialist messaging services, and 29% smartphone photography when seeking patient management advice. CONCLUSION: App use on the personal mobile devices, in the absence of access to institutional devices, was widespread, especially the use of a national formulary app. Instant messaging and smartphone photography were less common.

Using the 2007C2008 global financial crisis as an exogenous event which led to a gold mining boom in Mexico, I find that women living in gold endowed municipalities experienced higher decision-making power contrary to some theoretical predictions. These results appear to be consistent with unitary household bargaining models which assume income pooling, as female decision-making power increased despite no changes in female labor force participation and an observed increase in male employment. Findings from a separate survey additionally show that while women residing in gold endowed states had higher decision-making power, they were also more likely to suffer from intimate partner violence (IPV). This suggests that a womans intra-household decision-making authority is not necessarily negatively correlated with her risk of IPV as posited in feminist theory.","output":"Male employment and female intra-household decision-making: a Mexican gold mining case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: We aim to provide sensible estimates of the average incubation time of COVID-19 by capitalizing available estimates reported in the literature and explore different ways to accommodate heterogeneity involved with the reported studies. Methods: We search through online databases to collect the studies about estimates of the average incubation time and conduct meta-analyses to accommodate heterogeneity of the studies and the publication bias. Cochran's heterogeneity statistic Q and Higgin's & Thompson's I2 statistic are employed. Subgroup analyses are conducted using mixed effects models and publication bias is assessed using the funnel plot and Egger's test. Results: Using all those reported mean incubation estimates, the average incubation time is estimated to be 6.43 days with a 95% confidence interval (CI) (5.90, 6.96), and using all those reported mean incubation estimates together with those transformed median incubation estimates, the estimated average incubation time is 6.07 days with a 95% CI (5.70,6.45). Conclusions: Providing sensible estimates of the average incubation time for COVID-19 is important yet complex, and the available results vary considerably due to many factors including heterogeneity and publication bias.

Node features are represented by image embedding and edges are encoded with clinical or demographic similarity. Results: Our experiments on data collected from Emory Healthcare network indicate that our fusion modeling scheme performs consistently better than predictive models using only imaging or non-imaging features, with f1-scores of 0.73, 0.77, and 0.66 for discharge from hospital, mortality, and ICU admission, respectively. External validation was performed on data collected from Mayo Clinic. Our scheme highlights known biases in the model prediction such as bias against patients with alcohol abuse history and bias based on insurance status. Conclusion: The study signifies the importance of fusion of multiple data modalities for accurate prediction of clinical trajectory. Proposed graph structure can model relationships between patients based on non-imaging EHR data and graph convolutional networks can fuse this relationship information with imaging data to effectively predict future disease trajectory more effectively than models employing only imaging or non-imaging data. Forecasting clinical events can enable intelligent resource allocation in hospitals.

Attention and resources have focused on physicians, patients, and healthcare systems with little information regarding the effects on nurses and technologists in the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL). METHODS A national, online survey was conducted for nurses and technologists working in the CCL in the United States. The survey was self administered, anonymous, and included 45 questions assessing baseline demographics, logistical changes to workflow and responsibilities, staff preparedness, and mental health. RESULTS A total of 450 respondents completed the survey, including 283 nurses (63%) and 167 technologists (37%). A total of 349 (78%) were female and mean age range was 41-50 years. Responses indicated that 68% were the primary financial provider for their families, and 74% experienced >75% decrease in case volume despite a low inpatient COVID-19 census (54% of respondents with census <10%). There were high rates of direct care for COVID-19 patients (47%), relocation (45%), lay-off/furloughs of part-time or per diem staff (42%), lay-offs of full-time staff (12%), and decreased work hours (65%). A total of 95% expressed decreased morale with an increase in mental distress, including depression (36%). Predictors of depression included relocation status, staff preparedness, and work hours.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the incidence of hospitalization and death for COVID-19 in a large sample of patients with plaque psoriasis receiving biologic therapies compared with the general population. METHODS: This is a retrospective multicenter cohort study including patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (n = 6501) being treated with biologic therapy and regularly followed up at the divisions of dermatology of several main hospitals in the Northern Italian cities of Verona, Padua, Vicenza, Modena, Bologna, Piacenza, Turin, and Milan. Incidence rates of hospitalization and death per 10,000 person-months with exact mid-p 95% CIs and standardized incidence ratios were estimated in the patients with psoriasis and compared with those in the general population in the same geographic areas. RESULTS: The incidence rate of hospitalization for COVID-19 was 11.7 (95% CI, 7.2-18.1) per 10,000 person-months in patients with psoriasis and 14.4 (95% CI, 14.3-14.5) in the general population; the incidence rate of death from COVID-19 was 1.3 (95% CI, 0.2-4.3) and 4.7 (95% CI, 4.6-4.7) in patients with psoriasis and the general population, respectively.

However, due to the limitations of the first generation of intestinal organoids, basal-out structure and growth in Matrigel, most pathogens can rarely attach to the apical membrane directly and hardly initiate infection. In this study, we first developed a next-generation porcine intestinal organoid culture system, characterized by an apical membrane on the surface, called apical-out. To investigate the infectivity and antiviral immune responses of this apical-out porcine intestinal organoid, a swine enteric virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was employed to inoculate the culture system. Both RT-qPCR and IFA analysis demonstrated that TGEV replicated in the apical-out porcine intestinal organoid culture system. Additionally, our results illustrated that TGEV infection significantly upregulated the expression levels of IFN-, IFN-1, ISG15, ISG58, TNF-, and IL-6 in this culture system. Hence, we successfully developed a porcine intestinal apical-out organoid culture system, which will facilitate the investigation of pathogen-host interactions in pig intestines.IMPORTANCE Intestinal organoids are a newly developed culture system for investigating pathogen-host interactions. Intestinal organoid models have been widely used since their development because the results obtained from this type of culture model better represent physiological conditions than those from well-established cell lines. The 3D porcine intestinal organoid model was reported in 2018 and 2019 for the investigation of intestinal pathogens. However, those organoid culture models were basal-out intestinal organoids, which are not suitable for porcine enteric virus research because they invade the intestines via the apical side of epithelial cells on villi. In this study, we developed a porcine apical-out intestinal organoid culture system and verified its infectivity, type I, and type III IFN antiviral responses, and inflammatory responses following infection by a swine enteric virus. Our results imply that this apical-out porcine intestinal organoid culture system is an ideal model for the investigation of interactions between swine enteric viruses and the intestines.","output":"Next-generation porcine intestinal organoids: an apical-out organoid model for swine enteric virus infection and immune response investigations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a serious health concern which alert all healthcare professionals worldwide.

Precisely, the curve is inverted u-shaped. Notably, results show that digital skills only matter when employees have very demanding duties to accomplish. In all other cases, digital skills do not affect intellectual property significantly.Research limitations/implicationsThe research is solely focused on firms' operating in the European Union.

Health care workers with and without COVID-19-patient contact at nine units at Sk?ne University Hospitals in Malm? and Lund, Sweden and university employees from Lund University, Sweden were enrolled. To limit impact of health care worker to health care worker transmission, units with known outbreaks were excluded. A SARS-CoV-2-positive case was defined by a previous positive PCR or anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the ZetaGene COVID-19 Antibody Test. RESULTS SARS-CoV-2-positivity was detected in 11/51 (22%) health care workers in COVID-19-units, 10/220 (5%) in non-COVID-19-units and 11/192 (6%) University employees (p = .001, Fischer's exact).

Materials and methods: All PCR-positive patients were included in the study, whose CT, PCR, and laboratory values were obtained simultaneously at the time of first admission. Patients were divided into 4 groups in terms of the extent of radiological lesions. These groups were compared in terms of intensive care transfer needs and Covid-related mortality rates. Results: A total of 477 patients were included in the study. Ninety of them were group 0 (no lung involvement), 162 were group 1 (mild lesion), 89 were group 2 (moderate lesion), and 136 were group 3 (severe lung involvement). A significant relationship was found between the extensiveness of the radiological lesion on CT and admission to intensive care and mortality rate. As the initial radiological involvement amounts increased, the rate of ICU transfer and mortality increased. The mortality rates of the groups were 0%, 3%, 12.3%, and 12.5%, respectively, and the difference was significant (p < 0.001).

OBJECTIVE To determine the overall complication rate (permanent and transient) associated with the use of this new device from a single institution. METHODS We retrospectively examined a prospectively maintained database of our patients treated with the PED since its availability to the current time. 126 patients (24 men, 102 women; age range 14-83 years, mean 59.8 years) were treated for a total of 137 intracranial aneurysms, one cervical internal carotid artery dissection, one cervical vertebral artery dissection, and one carotid-cavernous fistula with a total of 217 PEDs (1.72 PED/patient). RESULTS A total of 40 complications were experienced by 33 patients in our cohort. Four complications (4/126, 3.2%) in four patients were permanent, resulting in three deaths and one permanent disability. The other 36 complications (28.6%) occurred in 29 patients, all of whom went on to recover completely. The total complication rate associated with the use of the PED was 31.7% (40/126).

Though charitable crowdfunding has been popular in recent years, the widespread creation of COVID-19 related campaigns points to potential shifts in how the platform is being used, and the volume of needs users have brought to the site during a profound economic, social, and epidemiological crisis. This study offers a systematic examination of the scope and impacts of COVID-19 related crowdfunding in the early months of the pandemic and assesses how existing social and health inequities shaped crowdfunding use and outcomes. Using data collected from all US-based GoFundMe campaigns mentioning COVID or coronavirus, we used descriptive analysis and a series of negative binomial and linear models to assess the contributions of demographic factors and COVID-19 impacts to campaign creation and outcome. We find significant evidence of growing inequalities in outcomes for campaigners. We find that crowdfunding provides substantially higher benefits in wealthier counties with higher levels of education. People from these areas are more likely to initiate campaigns in response to adverse health and economic impacts of COVID-19, and they also receive more funding compared to people living in areas with lower income and education. Modeling also indicates differential outcomes based on the racial and ethnic composition of county population, though without more detail about who is creating and funding campaigns we cannot explain causality. A targeted qualitative analysis of the top earning COVID-19 campaigns offers further evidence of how user privilege and corporate practices contribute to highly unequal outcomes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate how a market-oriented digital technology used to respond to large-scale crisis can exacerbate inequalities and further benefit already privileged groups.","output":"Crowdfunding as a response to COVID-19: Increasing inequities at a time of crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Behavioral research in cognitive and human systems neuroscience has been largely carried out in-person in laboratory settings. Underpowering and lack of reproducibility due to small sample sizes have weakened conclusions of these investigations. In other disciplines, such as neuroeconomics and social sciences, crowdsourcing has been extensively utilized as a data collection tool, and a means to increase sample sizes. Recent methodological advances allow scientists, for the first time, to test online more complex cognitive, perceptual, and motor tasks. Here we review the nascent literature on the use of online crowdsourcing in cognitive and human systems neuroscience. These investigations take advantage of the ability to reliably track the activity of a participant's computer keyboard, mouse, and eye gaze in the context of large-scale studies online that involve diverse research participant pools. Crowdsourcing allows for testing the generalizability of behavioral hypotheses in real-life environments that are less accessible to lab-designed investigations. Crowdsourcing is further useful when in-laboratory studies are limited, for example during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We also discuss current limitations of crowdsourcing research, and suggest pathways to address them. We conclude that online crowdsourcing is likely to widen the scope and strengthen conclusions of cognitive and human systems neuroscience investigations.","output":"Crowdsourcing in Cognitive and Systems Neuroscience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Substance use in Zambia is stigmatized and treatment access is limited. Over 30,000 people are homeless in Lusaka, where one-quarter of homeless youth report use. Zambia's Ministry of Health recently developed policies targeting alcohol, suggesting Chainama, the only mental health hospital, offer treatment. Together, they endorsed training in the curriculum studied in this paper. We hypothesized training Zambian professionals would improve their perceptions of substance users and treatment. We then explored if treatment using the curriculum, as delivered to clients by training participants, would encourage client motivation to change, participation in groups, and reduce substance use frequency. METHODS: Part 1: One-hundred professionals were trained in a curriculum-based, literacy-free intervention employing cognitive behavioral and rational emotive behavior therapy techniques to explore 12 Steps of addiction recovery through Zambian art forms. Pre/post questionnaires captured perspectives around substance users and treatment. Part 2: Trained organizations delivered the curriculum in their communities. Twenty-five organizations rated feasibility and benefit of the curriculum. Data for 200 clients recorded pre/post motivation to change, open-sharing/participation, and frequency of substance use. RESULTS: While training significantly modified professionals perspectives regarding the value of offering treatment, their views of substance users did not change. Clients endorsed increases in motivation to change and participation/open-sharing. Frequency of alcohol, marijuana, inhalant, and cigarette use significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: Training in the curriculum helped address a public health need, playing a role in increased motivational variables and decreased substance use. Research addressing this studys limitations is encouraged.

Methods: The participants of this study included oil field company workers from the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration of Karamay City, Xinjiang, who underwent occupational health examinations. The Occupational Stress Inventory Revised Edition (OSI-R) was used to measure the occupational stress of the oil workers. The mental health status of oil workers was evaluated using the Symptoms Checklist-90. Results: Occupational tasks: The total scores of the personal strain and mental health questionnaires were positively correlated with somatization, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, terror, paranoia, and psychosis (P < 0.05). Individual coping resources and the mental health total score was negatively correlated with somatization, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, hostility, terror, paranoia, and psychosis. The following factors were identified as mental health risk factors: female gender; age 45 and above (relative to 30 years old); high scores on the personal strain questionnaire; occupational stress; external effort; internal investment; and high effort-low return. The following factors were identified as protective factors for mental health: Han nationality; oil transportation (relative to drilling); individual resilience; and work returns. In respect to the abnormal psychological group and the normal psychological group, statistically significant differences were found in the distribution of genotypes and allele frequencies at the rs1800497 locus (P < 0.05). The depression and paranoia scores observed between different genotype groups at the rs1800497 locus were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusions: This study shows that occupational stress and the D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) gene have an impact on the mental health of oil field workers in the arid desert environment of Xinjiang. Effort-reward imbalance and occupational stress were identified as risk factors for mental health, while rewards for work were protective factors. Higher levels of occupational stress may lead to depression and other psychological disorders, adversely affecting mental health. In oil field operators in the arid desert environment of Xinjiang, the AA genotype of the DRD2 gene in the rs1800497 locus was identified as a genotype specific to susceptibility to mental health problems, and a correlation was found between the A allele and an increased risk of psychological problems. Therefore, it is necessary to devise relevant measures to alleviate occupational stress among oil workers and increase their job rewards, so as to improve their mental health.","output":"Research on the Effects of Occupational Stress and the DRD2 Gene on the Psychological Health of Workers in the Xinjiang Desert Oil Field"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are often under-recognized in the community. MCI/ADRD screening could offer benefits such as early treatment, research participation, lifestyle modification, and advanced care planning. To date, there are no clear guidelines regarding the benefits vs. harms of dementia screening or whether a dementia screening program could be successful. METHODS: A community-based study was conducted to evaluate an MCI/ADRD screening program and determine what older adults would do with the information. Measures of cognition, physical health, functionality, and mood were collected. Participants met with a health professional, were given screening results with recommendations, and then contacted 60 days later to determine what was done with the results. Logistic regression models were used to build predictive models. RESULTS: Participants (n = 288) had a mean age of 71.58.3y, mean education of 13.34.8y, and were 70% female, 67% White, 26% African American, and 48% Hispanic. After 60 days, 75% of participants were re-contacted; 54% shared results with family, 33% shared results with health care providers (HCPs), and 52% initiated behavioral change. Among participants sharing results with HCPs, 51% reported HCPs did not follow-up on the results, and 18% that HCPs did not show any interest in the screening visit or its results. Predictors of sharing results with HCPs were elevated hemoglobin A1C (OR = 1.85;95%CI:1.19-2.88), uncontrolled hypertension (OR = 2.73;95%CI:1.09-6.83), and mobility issues (OR = 2.43;95%CI: 1.93-5.54). Participant behavioral changes included lifestyle modification (58%), social engagement (10%), cognitive stimulation (5%), and advanced care planning (4%). The most significant predictors of sharing with family were better overall mental health (OR = 0.19; 95%CI: 0.06-0.59) and better physical function (OR = 0.38; 95%CI: 0.17-0.81). DISCUSSION: MCI/ADRD screening was well-received by a diverse community sample. Participants showed interest in sharing the results with their family and HCPs and many attempted behavioral change. While HCPs did not always act on screening results, 25% ordered further testing and evaluation. Efforts need to be directed toward (1) increasing self-efficacy of older adults to discuss screening results with their HCPs, and (2) educating HCPs on the value of early detection of MCI/ADRD. Community dementia screening programs can increase MCI/ADRD detection and improve patient-centered outcomes and medical decision-making.","output":"What older adults do with the results of dementia screening programs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The clinical and imaging features of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections that progressed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been explored in numerous studies. However, little is known about these features in patients who received negative respiratory nucleic acid test results after the infections resolved. In this study, we aim to describe these features in a group of Chinese patients. METHODS: This retrospective study includes 51 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (median age: 34.0 years and 47.1% male) between January 31 and February 28, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and computed tomography (CT) imaging data were collected before and after two consecutive negative respiratory SARS-CoV-2 tests. RESULTS: Following a negative test result, the patients clinical symptoms continued to recover, but abnormal imaging findings were observed in all moderate cases. Specifically, 77.4% of patients with moderate COVID-19 exhibited multi-lobar lung involvement and lesions were more frequently observed in the lower lobes. The most common CT imaging manifestations were ground-glass opacities (51.6%) and fibrous stripes (54.8%%). Twelve of the 31 patients with moderate COVID-19 underwent repeated chest CT scans after a negative SARS-CoV-2 test. Among them, the ground-glass opacities decreased by > 60% within 1 week in seven patients (58.3%), but by < 5% in four patients (13.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Following a positive and subsequent negative SARS-CoV-2 tests, patients with COVID-19 continued to recover despite exhibiting persistent clinical symptoms and abnormal imaging findings.

She was off treatment after 2 months. The second patient, with onset 3-week post-vaccination, had a more severe illness, requiring high dose immunosuppression. In our third case, the onset of illness was slightly delayed i.e., 3-month post-vaccination, but she had the most severe disease with macrophage activation syndrome at presentation requiring immunosuppression and biologicals. The underlying mechanism may be linked to the activation of Toll-like receptors (TLR)TLR-7 and TLR-9leading to a robust immune response.

METHODS: We searched PubMed database using all available keyword for COVID-19. All related studies between January 1st, 2020 to May 22nd, 2020 were reviewed. Only studies published in English language were considered. Articles were screened based on titles and abstract. All reports of confirmed COVID-19 patients who have associated clinical evidence of autoimmune disease were selected. RESULTS: Among 10006 articles, searches yielded, Thirty-two relevant articles for full-text assessment. Twenty studies meet the eligibility criteria. The twenty eligible articles reported 33 cases of confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis who developed an autoimmune disease after the onset of covid-19 symptoms. Ages of patients varied from a 6 months old infant to 89 years old female (Mean=53.9 years of 28 cases); five cases had no information regarding their age. The time between symptoms of viral illness and onset of autoimmune symptoms ranged from 2 days to 33 days (Mean of the 33 cases=9.8 days). Autoimmune diseases were one case of subacute thyroiditis (3%), two cases of Kawasaki Disease (6.1%), three cases of coagulopathy and antiphospholipid syndrome (9.1%), three cases of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (9.1%), eight cases of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (24.2%), and sixteen cases of Guillain-Barr syndrome (48.5%).

DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 97 articles were identified, of which seven comprised this review. The association of KD to the new coronavirus appears to trigger a severe clinical condition of vasculitis. Different from the usual, in this inflammatory syndrome, patients are older, and prevalence is higher in children from African or Caribbean ancestry; clinical and laboratory manifestations are also atypical, with a predominance of abdominal complaints and exaggerated elevation of inflammatory markers. In addition, there was a greater report of rare complications and greater resistance to the recommended treatment for KD. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric COVID-19 and its potential association to severe KD, still unfamiliar to health professionals, reinforces the importance of testing patients with vasculitis for the new coronavirus and the need to wage high surveillance and preparation of the health system during the current pandemic.","output":"CLINICAL-EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RELATION BETWEEN SARS-COV-2 AND KAWASAKI DISEASE: AN INTEGRATIVE LITERATURE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many different osteotomy procedures has been proposed in the literature for dental implant site preparation. The osseodensification is a drilling technique that has been proposed to improve the local bone quality and implant stability in poor density alveolar ridges. This technique determines an expansion of the implant site by increasing the density of the adjacent bone. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effectiveness of the osseodensification technique for implant site preparation through a literature review and meta-analysis. The database electronic research was performed on PubMed (Medline) database for the screening of the scientific papers. A total of 16 articles have been identified suitable for the review and qualitative analysis11 clinical studies (eight on animals, three on human subjects), four literature reviews, and one case report. The meta-analysis was performed to compare the bone-to-implant contact % (BIC), bone area fraction occupied % (BAFO), and insertion torque of clockwise and counter-clockwise osseodensification procedure in animal studies. The included articles reported a significant increase in the insertion torque of the implants positioned through the osseodensification protocol compared to the conventional drilling technique. Advantages of this new technique are important above all when the patient has a strong missing and/or low quantity of bone tissue. The data collected until the drafting of this paper detect an improvement when the osseodensification has been adopted if compared to the conventional technique. A significant difference in BIC and insertion torque between the clockwise and counter-clockwise osseodensification procedure was reported, with no difference in BAFO measurements between the two approaches. The effectiveness of the present study demonstrated that the osseodensification drilling protocol is a useful technique to obtain increased implant insertion torque and bone to implant contact (BIC) in vivo.

To determine the impact of the pandemic on students varying in ability, we measured perceived pandemic disruption, objective numeracy (ONS), math interest, and other academic- and life-related outcomes in an introductory data analysis course (N = 399) that switched mid-semester from in-person to online instruction because of the pandemic. As in prior research, those higher in objective numeracy had better academic outcomes before and during the pandemic. Ability did not predict perceived disruption, but students with lower numeric self-efficacy, women, and Pell Grant recipients (indicating low socioeconomic status) experienced more pandemic disruption. Although we expected numeracy to protect academic outcomes from disruption, we observed this effect only for grades. Unexpectedly, numeracy predicted greater vulnerability to losing interest in math, such that greater perceived disruption reduced math interest for those higher in objective numeracy but not for those lower in objective numeracy. Similarly, we found a small indirect effect of objective numeracy and disruption on course enrollment via math interest. In practical terms, about 30% fewer high-objective numeracy students enrolled in the advanced statistics course when they were high rather than low in disruption. Thus, high-ability students may paradoxically perform better but feel worse when faced with unexpected hardships. Our findings highlight the importance of educators being mindful of their high-ability students' struggles as their academic motivation may be less resilient than previously expected.

As most of the works focused on ground-glass opacity and consolidation segmentation of COVID-19 on CT images, lung fibrosis is relatively undervalued and less studied. Automatic segmentation and accurate measurement of lung fibrosis can potentially aid treatment planning for patients of post-COVID-19 pneumonia. However, the lack of sufficient training data hinders the fibrosis segmentation of CT images. Also, redundancy among CT images can reduce annotating efficiency. To address these issues, we propose deep active learning (AL) framework, which consists of a segmentation model called UNet-RGD, and a novel acquisition method named DeepRISS. The segmentation model consists of improved structures of residual blocks, channel gates, and dropout layers. The deep learning-based acquisition method combines uncertainty estimation and clustering for selecting representative and informative samples. Experimental results show that the AL framework can achieve state-of-the-art performance and effectively reduce the number of selected samples, saving the annotation cost by 25% to 44% compared to the non-selective approach. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Deep Active Learning for Fibrosis Segmentation of Chest Ct Scans from Covid-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemi COVID-19 menjadi masalah global.

Using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray developed in our lab, we comprehensively profiled both IgM and IgG antibodies in forty patients with early-stage COVID-19, influenza, or non-influenza who had similar symptoms. The results revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is not an ideal biomarker for COVID-19 diagnosis because of its low immunogenicity, thus tests that rely on this marker alone will have a high false negative rate. Our data further suggest that the S protein subunit 1 receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) might be the optimal antigen for IgM antibody detection, while the S protein extracellular domain (S1+S2ECD) would be the optimal antigen for both IgM and IgG antibody detection. Notably, the combination of all IgM and IgG biomarkers can identify 87% and 73.3% COVID-19 patients, respectively.

METHODS A total of 1 511 clinically confirmed SARS cases in Guangdong Province of China from November 16, 2002 to Jun 15, 2003 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS The first SARS case was identified in Foshan municipality on November 16, 2002, followed by 1 511 clinically confirmed cases (including 58 deaths) up to May 15, 2003. Of all cases, health care workers and community family cluster cases accounted for 19.38% and 12.04%. 65.86% SARS patients aged 20 - 49 years, and increased incidence was positively related to their ages. 95.97% cases lived in the following five cities around Pearl Delta Area: Foshan, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhongshan, and Jiangmen. Eleven early reported cases in the communities took animal-related positions. Face-to-face contacts with infected droplets were the main transmission route. An epidemic peak occurred during January 28 to February 26, and those cases accounted for 50.69% of total. Incidence, mortality, and case fatality of SARS were 1.77/100,000, 0.07/100,000, and 3.84% respectively. The mean incubation period was 4.5 days. CONCLUSION The most effective way to control SARS is to break the chain of transmission from infected to healthy persons-early identification, prompt and effective isolation, and vigorous close contact tracing. Hospital infections among health care workers is critical. Several observations support the hypothesis of an animal origin for the disease.","output":"[Severe acute respiratory syndrome in Guangdong Province of China: epidemiology and control measures]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many academics use yearly publication numbers to quantify academic interest for their research topic. While such visualisations are ubiquitous in grant applications, manuscript introductions, and review articles, they fail to account for the rapid growth in scientific publications. As a result, any search term will likely show an increase in supposed \\"academic interest\\". One proposed solution is to normalise yearly publication rates by field size, but this is arduous and difficult. Here, we propose an simpler index that normalises keywords of interest by a ubiquitous and innocuous keyword, such as \\"banana\\". Alternatively, one could opt for field-specific keywords or hierarchical structures (e.g. PubMed's Medical Subject Headings, MeSH) to compute \\"interest market share\\". Using this approach, we uncovered plausible trends in academic interest in examples from the medical literature. In neuroimaging, we found that not the supplementary motor area (as was previously claimed), but the prefrontal cortex is the most interesting part of the brain. In cancer research, we found a contemporary preference for cancers with high prevalence and clinical severity, and notable declines in interest for more treatable or likely benign neoplasms. Finally, we found that interest in respiratory viral infections spiked when strains showed potential for pandemic involvement, with SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic being the most extreme example. In sum, the time is ripe for a quick and easy method to quantify trends in academic interest for anecdotal purposes.

METHODS Two liquid chip panels were developed which used a target-enriched multiplexed RT-PCR amplification followed by Luminex liquid chip hybridization based on xMAP technology. One was for the detection of 5 type/ subtypes of the influenza virus (called Influenza Panel), the other was for the identification of 14 major respiratory viruses, including emerging human metapneumovirus (HMPV), coronavirus (CoV NL63, HKU1), human bocavirus (HBoV), and WU polyomavirus (WUPyV) (called Respiratory Panel). The analytical sensitivity and specificity of these two panels were determined. 108 throat swabs from influenza-like-illness (ILI) cases and 88 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from hospitalized children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) were used to evaluate the two panels. RESULTS The Influenza Panel returned the analytical sensitivity of 4 - 10 copies vRNA/microL of sample for seasonal H1N1, H3N2, pandemic H1N1, and B, and 200 copies vRNA/microL of sample for H5. The analytical sensitivity of the Respiratory Panel was as follows: 10 - 150 copies vRNA/microL of sample for most of the viral targets tested in this panel except RSV (400 copies vRNA/microL of sample). No cross reactivity was observed for both panels. As determined by commercial multi-PCR kit and conventional PCR (for HBoV and WUPyV), the diagnostic sensitivity of the Respiratory Panel for each viral targets ranged from 50.0% to 100.0%, the diagnostic specificity was 96.2%-100.0%, and accordance rate was 93.2% - 100.0%, the kappa correlation of eight viral targets was > 0.75. CONCLUSIONS Two liquid chip assay panels, developed based on xMAP technology, can detect 5 types/subtypes of influenza viruses and 14 respiratory viruses simultaneously in one reaction in 6 hours.

In AI and linguistics research, this has mostly been studied in cases where the referent is explicitly stated in the preceding text nearby. However, pronouns in natural text often refer to entities, collections, or events that are only implicitly mentioned previously; in those cases the need to use pragmatic knowledge to disambiguate becomes much more acute and the characterization of the knowledge becomes much more difficult. Extended literary texts at times employ both extremely complex patterns of reference and extremely rich and subtle forms of knowledge. Indeed, it is occasionally possible to have a pronoun that is far separated from its referent in a text. In the opposite direction, pronoun use is affected by considerations of focus of attention and by formal constraints such as a preference for parallel syntactic structures; these can be so strong that no pragmatic knowledge suffices to overrule them.","output":"Pragmatic constraints and pronoun reference disambiguation: the possible and the impossible"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in disruption of essential health care services. Children with cancer are very vulnerable group and delay in seeking treatment or defaulting scheduled medications adversely affects the outcome. Aim: To obtain insight into barriers and to evaluate concerns, outlook and challenges faced by parents of children suffering with malignancy in accessing the health care services during lockdown imposed due to COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted from parents of children newly diagnosed (during lockdown restrictions) with malignancy and previously diagnosed and under treatment at Paediatric Haematology Oncology unit in a Tertiary care centre. The responses were recorded in pre-designed proforma during fifteen days period after restrictions were relaxed. Results: Fifty-five responses were recorded and analysed. Father was respondent in most cases. Acute Leukaemia (n=37) and Lymphoma (n=14) patients comprised majority of the patients. Major challenges faced were transportation (98.2%), financial burden (96.4%) and loss of job (65.4%). Fear of contracting COVID-19 infection was a primary barrier in seeking treatment for most respondents. Conclusion: The success and outcome of children with malignancy has been suboptimal in low-income and middleincome countries due to effect of lack of timely access of health care services, delayed diagnosis, treatment abandonment, poor compliance and financial constraints. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated setbacks have accentuated these factors and may have long term impact in final outcome for such patients.

Many viruses, including herpesviruses, are known to exploit the nucleolar compartment during their replication cycle. In a previous study, we demonstrated the preferential targeting and accumulation of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL83 phosphoprotein (pp65) to the nucleolar compartment and, in particular, to the nucleolar matrix of lytically infected fibroblasts; such targeting was already evident at very early times after infection. Here we have investigated the possible effects of rRNA synthesis inhibition upon the development of HCMV lytic infection, by using either actinomycin D or cisplatin at low concentrations, that are known to selectively inhibit RNA polymerase I activity, whilst leaving RNA polymerase II function unaffected. Following the inhibition of rRNA synthesis by either of the agents used, we observed a significant redistribution of nucleolar proteins within the nucleoplasm and a simultaneous depletion of viral pp65 from the nucleolus; this effect was highly evident in both unextracted cells and in nuclear matrices in situ. Of particular interest, even a brief suppression of rRNA synthesis resulted in a very strong inhibition of the progression of HCMV infection, as was concluded from the absence of accumulation of HCMV major immediate\\\\early proteins within the nucleus of infected cells. These data suggest that a functional relationship might exist between rRNA synthesis, pp65 localization to the nucleolar matrix and the normal development of HCMV lytic infection. J. Cell.

Treatment variables included surgical treatment, extent of resection, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, type of radiation, and treatment facility type. Outcomes included 30-day readmission, 30- and 90-day mortality, and overall survival. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate variables associated with race and overall survival. Results A total of 103 652 glioblastoma patients were identified.

In this study, evolutionary optimized DNNs were analyzed to classify three common airway-related symptoms, namely coughs, throat clears and dry swallows. As opposed to typical microphone-acoustic signals, mechanoacoustic data signals, which did not contain identifiable speech information for better privacy protection, were acquired from laboratory-generated and publicly available datasets. The optimized DNNs had a low footprint of less than 150 kB and predicted airway symptoms of interests with 83.7% accuracy on unseen data. By performing explainable AI techniques, namely occlusion experiments and class activation maps, mel-frequency bands up to 8,000 Hz were found as the most important feature for the classification. We further found that DNN decisions were consistently relying on these specific features, fostering trust and transparency of proposed DNNs.

Study design: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from SARS cases infected by the same infectious source were tested for both negative-stranded RNA (minus-RNA, replicative intermediates) and positive-stranded RNA (genomic RNA) of SARS-CoV during the course of hospitalization by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: SARS-CoV minus-RNA was detected in PBMCs from SARS patients. The viral replicative forms in PBMCs were detectable during a period of 6 days post-onset of the disease, while the plus-RNA were detectable for a longer period (8C12 days post-onset).

Specifically, HSCs are highly responsive to acute changes in systemic inflammation and this influences not only their division rate but also their lineage fate. Identifying how inflammation regulates HSCs and shapes the blood system is crucial to understanding the mechanisms underpinning these processes, as well as potential links between them. Recent Findings: A widening array of physiologic and pathologic processes involving heightened inflammation are now recognized to critically affect HSC biology and blood lineage production. Conditions documented to affect HSC function include not only acute and chronic infections but also autoinflammatory conditions, irradiation injury, and physiologic states such as aging and obesity. Summary: Recognizing the contexts during which inflammation affects primitive hematopoiesis is essential to improving our understanding of HSC biology and informing new therapeutic interventions against maladaptive hematopoiesis that occurs during inflammatory diseases, infections, and cancer-related disorders.","output":"Common Sources of Inflammation and Their Impact on Hematopoietic Stem Cell Biology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lower perceived control (PC) is related to maladaptive psychological responses to stressful events, yet it is unclear whether longer-term situations are associated with PC change over time.

Further, it remains unclear whether neurological manifestations are primarily due to neurotropism of the virus, or indirect effects, like cerebral hypoxia. METHODS: We analysed the electroencephalograms (EEGs) of 19 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, performed at peak disease severity as part of their clinical management. Disease severity, respiratory failure, immune and metabolic dysfunction, sedation status, and neurological examination on the day of the EEG were noted. RESULTS: Severe encephalopathy was confirmed in 13 patients, all with severe COVID-19; 10 remained comatose off sedation, and five of them had alpha coma (AC). Disease severity, sedation, immune and metabolic dysfunction were not different between those with AC and those without. CONCLUSIONS: Severe COVID-19 encephalopathy is a principal cause of persisting coma after sedation withdrawal. The relatively high incidence of the rare AC pattern may reflect direct SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism with a predilection for the brainstem ascending reticular system. SIGNIFICANCE: Systematic early EEG detection of encephalopathy related to severe COVID-19 is important for the acute care and the management of long-term neurological and cognitive sequelae, and may help our better understanding of its pathophysiology.","output":"Alpha coma EEG pattern in patients with severe COVID-19 related encephalopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic required a shift of graduate medical education recruitment to a virtual format.

By benchmarking using multiple gene expression datasets of gene silencing studies, we found that RegEnrich using the GSEA method to rank the regulators performed the best to retrieve the key regulators. Further, RegEnrich was applied to 21 publicly available datasets on in vitro interferon-stimulation of different cell types. We found that not only IRF and STAT transcription factor families played an important role in cells responding to IFN, but also several ETS transcription factor family members, such as ELF1 and ETV7, are highly associated with IFN stimulations.

In-hospital mortality rate was 17.9% vs 6.7% (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.54-17.2, p=0.25), mechanical ventilation 17.9% vs 6.7% (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.54-17.2, p=0.25), and prolonged hospitalization 21.4% vs 30% (OR 0.64, 95%CI, 0.19-2.1, p=0.55) in early versus deferred CP group, respectively. Viral clearance rate on day 3 (26% vs 8%, p=0.20) and day 7 (38% vs 19%, p=0.37) did not differ between groups. Two patients experienced serious adverse events within 6 or less hours after plasma transfusion. Conclusion: Immediate addition of CP therapy in early stages of COVID-19 -compared to its use only in case of patient deterioration- did not confer benefits in mortality, length of hospitalization or mechanical ventilation requirement.","output":"Early Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Convalescent Plasma in Patients Admitted for COVID-19: A Randomized Phase II Clinical Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A variety of public health measures have been implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada to reduce contact between individuals. The objective of this study was to provide empirical contact pattern data to evaluate the impact of public health measures, the degree to which social contacts rebounded to normal levels, as well as direct public health efforts toward age- and location-specific settings. METHODS: Four population-based cross-sectional surveys were administered to members of a paid panel representative of Canadian adults by age, gender, official language, and region of residence during May (Survey 1), July (Survey 2), September (Survey 3), and December (Survey 4) 2020. A total of 4981 (Survey 1), 2493 (Survey 2), 2495 (Survey 3), and 2491 (Survey 4) respondents provided information about the age and setting for each direct contact made in a 24-h period. Contact matrices were constructed and contacts for those under the age of 18 years imputed. The next generation matrix approach was used to estimate the reproduction number (R(t)) for each survey. Respondents with children under 18 years estimated the number of contacts their children made in school and extracurricular settings. RESULTS: Estimated R(t) values were 0.49 (95% CI: 0.29C0.69) for May, 0.48 (95% CI: 0.29C0.68) for July, 1.06 (95% CI: 0.63C1.52) for September, and 0.81 (0.47C1.17) for December. The highest proportion of reported contacts occurred within the home (51.3% in May), in other locations (49.2% in July) and at work (66.3 and 65.4% in September and December). Respondents with children reported an average of 22.7 (95% CI: 21.1C24.3) (September) and 19.0 (95% CI 17.7C20.4) (December) contacts at school per day per child in attendance. CONCLUSION: The skewed distribution of reported contacts toward workplace settings in September and December combined with the number of reported school-related contacts suggest that these settings represent important opportunities for transmission emphasizing the need to support and ensure infection control procedures in both workplaces and schools.

This stress is likely to be heightened when the transition occurs during a pandemic. We aimed to evaluate the perceived stress levels of housemen as they begin housemanship and explore their sentiments and preparedness in starting work amidst the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: Housemen starting work at a tertiary institution in Singapore in May 2020 completed the following: (1) Perceived Stress Scale, (2) open-ended questions on perceived challenges and concerns and (3) questionnaire on preparedness and confidence in starting work. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse quantitative data and modified thematic analysis performed for qualitative data. Results: Sixty-one housemen participated. Thirty-five (57.4%) reported high perceived stress. The themes for perceived challenges in this transition included coping with constant change, lack of reliable information from authorities, dealing with disappointment, physical fatigue, and loss of autonomy. The themes for concerns in beginning housemanship elicited relate to clinical competence, transitioning into new responsibilities, risk of infection with COVID-19, senior expectations, physical fatigue and training-related concerns. Despite these challenges and concerns, housemen were prepared to begin work during this pandemic. Conclusion: Housemen transitioning during this pandemic experienced additional stressors and unique challenges pertaining to working in a pandemic. Encouragingly, they remain prepared to start work. Institutions and departments should be mindful of the specific concerns and challenges so that appropriate support can be put in place to support these junior doctors.

Forty-four S2P-specific monoclonal antibodies were generated, three of which bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD). The antibodies were minimally mutated from germline and were derived from different B cell lineages. Only two antibodies displayed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus. The most potent antibody bound the RBD in a manner that prevented binding to the ACE2 receptor, while the other bound outside the RBD. Our study indicates that the majority of antibodies against the viral envelope spike that were generated during the first weeks of COVID-19 infection are non-neutralizing and target epitopes outside the RBD. Antibodies that disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 spike-ACE2 interaction can potently neutralize the virus without undergoing extensive maturation. Such antibodies have potential preventive/therapeutic potential and can serve as templates for vaccine-design. IN BRIEF SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to expansion of diverse B cells clones against the viral spike glycoprotein (S). The antibodies bind S with high affinity despite being minimally mutated. Thus, the development of neutralizing antibody responses by vaccination will require the activation of certain na?ve B cells without requiring extensive somatic mutation.

Serology testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is currently run using well-plate ELISAs in centralized laboratories. However, the scale of serology testing needed for epidemiological and clinical screening studies will overwhelm existing clinical laboratory resources. Instead, a point-of-need device that can be used at home or in doctors offices for COVID-19 serology testing must be developed and is one of four target products prioritized by the World Health Organization. Lateral flow assays are common and easy to use, but lack the sensitivity needed to reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in clinical samples. This work describes a disposable ELISA device that is as simple to use as a lateral flow assay, but as sensitive as a well-plate ELISA. The device utilizes capillary-driven flow channels made of transparency films and double-sided adhesive combined with paper pumps to drive flow. The geometry of the channels and storage pads enables automated sequential washing and reagent addition steps with two simple end-user steps. An enzyme label is used to produce a colorimetric signal instead of a nanoparticle label in order to amplify signal and increase sensitivity, while the integrated washing steps decrease false positives and increase reproducibility. Naked-eye detection can be used for qualitative results or a smartphone camera for quantitative analysis. The device can detect antibodies at 2.8 ng/mL from whole blood, which was very close the concentration of detectable target in a well-plate ELISA (1.2 ng/mL). In this study the dELISA system was used to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, but we believe that the device represents a fundamental step forward in point-of-care technology that will enable sensitive detection of many other analytes outside of a centralized laboratory.","output":"Point-of-Need Disposable ELISA System for COVID-19 Serology Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is an evolving urban crisis.

This affected both the quantity and quality of food consumed. Coping strategies reported include curtailing consumption, relying on inexpensive starchy staples, increasing the share of total expenditure allocated to food, taking out loans and accessing relief. The pandemic has exacerbated the precariousness of existing food and nutrition security in these cities, although residents with guaranteed incomes and adequate savings did not suffer significantly during lockdown.

Effective government communication of COVID-19 information with the public is of crucial importance. OBJECTIVE: We investigate how the most-read state-owned newspaper in China, People's Daily, used an online social networking site, Sina Weibo, to communicate about COVID-19 and whether this could engage the public. The objective of this study is to develop an integrated framework to examine the content, message style, and interactive features of COVID-19-related posts and determine their effects on public engagement in the largest social media network in China. METHODS: Content analysis was employed to scrutinize 608 COVID-19 posts, and coding was performed on three main dimensions: content, message style, and interactive features. The content dimension was coded into six subdimensions: action, new evidence, reassurance, disease prevention, health care services, and uncertainty, and the style dimension was coded into the subdimensions of narrative and nonnarrative. As for interactive features, they were coded into links to external sources, use of hashtags, use of questions to solicit feedback, and use of multimedia. Public engagement was measured in the form of the number of shares, comments, and likes on the People's Daily's Sina Weibo account from January 20, 2020, to March 11, 2020, to reveal the association between different levels of public engagement and communication strategies. A one-way analysis of variance followed by a post-hoc Tukey test and negative binomial regression analysis were employed to generate the results. RESULTS: We found that although the content frames of action, new evidence, and reassurance delivered in a nonnarrative style were predominant in COVID-19 communication by the government, posts related to new evidence and a nonnarrative style were strong negative predictors of the number of shares. In terms of generating a high number of shares, it was found that disease prevention posts delivered in a narrative style were able to achieve this purpose. Additionally, an interaction effect was found between content and style. The use of a narrative style in disease prevention posts had a significant positive effect on generating comments and likes by the Chinese public, while links to external sources fostered sharing. CONCLUSIONS: These results have implications for governments, health organizations, medical professionals, the media, and researchers on their epidemic communication to engage the public. Selecting suitable communication strategies may foster active liking and sharing of posts on social media, which in turn, might raise the public's awareness of COVID-19 and motivate them to take preventive measures. The sharing of COVID-19 posts is particularly important because this action can reach out to a large audience, potentially helping to contain the spread of the virus.","output":"Grappling With the COVID-19 Health Crisis: Content Analysis of Communication Strategies and Their Effects on Public Engagement on Social Media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Detecting gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries allows us to explore the dynamical, nonlinear regime of general relativity and constrain modifications to it. Some of the gravitational-wave events observed by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration have sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio in the merger, allowing us to probe the relaxation of the remnant black hole to its final, stationary state - the so-called black-hole ringdown, which is characterized by a set of quasinormal modes. Can we use the ringdown to constrain deviations from general relativity, as predicted by several of its contenders? Here, we address this question by using an inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model in the effective-one-body formalism, augmented with a parametrization of the ringdown based on an expansion in the final black hole's spin. We give a prescription on how to include in this waveform model, the quasinormal mode frequencies calculated on a theory-by-theory basis. In particular, we focus on theories that modify general relativity by higher-order curvature corrections, namely, Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB), dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) theories, and cubic- and quartic-order effective-field-theories (EFT) of general relativity. We use this parametrized waveform model to measure the ringdown properties of the two loudests ringdown signals observed so far, GW150914 and GW200129. We find that while EdGB theory cannot be constrained with these events, we can place upper bounds on the fundamental length-scale of cubic- ($\\\\ell_{\\\\rm cEFT} \\\\leqslant 38.2$ km) and quartic-order ($\\\\ell_{\\\\rm qEFT} \\\\leqslant 51.3$ km) EFTs of general relativity, and of dCS gravity ($\\\\ell_{\\\\rm dCS} \\\\leqslant 38.7$ km). The latter result is a concrete example of a theory presently unconstrained by inspiral-only analyses which, however, can be constrained by merger-ringdown studies with current gravitational-wave data.","output":"Black-hole ringdown as a probe of higher-curvature gravity theories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between personality traits and hoarding behavior during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

Material and methods: RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 positive subjects were divided into two groups, one comprising asymptomatic subjects (Group 1) and the other one ICU admitted patients (Group 2). In both groups, various comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, renal disease and malignancy were taken into consideration. Vitamin D estimation was performed along with serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and ferritin using automated immunoassays on Siemens Advia Centaur XP. Results:On acknowledging the cut-off serum concentration level of vitamin D as < 30 ng/mL for establishing vitamin D deficiency the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 66.18% in Group 1 and 98.30% in Group 2.

METHODS: This is a retrospective study in which the rate of COVID-19 deaths was correlated with each of the following independent variables: total tests per 1 million population, gross domestic product (GDP), average temperatures per country, ultraviolet index, median age, average BMI per country, food supply, Bacille Calmette-Guerin compulsory status, and passenger traffic.

While lockdowns and physical distancing have proven effective for reducing COVID-19 transmission, there is still limited understanding of how NPI measures are reflected in indicators of human mobility. Further, there is a lack of understanding about how findings from high-income settings correspond to low and middle-income contexts. MethodsIn this study, we assess the relationship between indicators of human mobility, NPIs, and estimates of Rt, a real-time measure of the intensity of COVID-19 transmission. We construct a multilevel generalised linear mixed model, combining local disease surveillance data from subnational districts of Ghana with the timing of NPIs and indicators of human mobility from Google and Vodafone Ghana. FindingsWe observe a relationship between reductions in human mobility and decreases in Rt during the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ghana. We find that the strength of this relationship varies through time, decreasing after the most stringent period of interventions in the early epidemic. InterpretationOur findings demonstrate how the association of NPI and mobility indicators with COVID-19 transmission may vary through time. Further, we demonstrate the utility of combining local disease surveillance data with large scale human mobility data to augment existing surveillance capacity and monitor the impact of NPI policies.

The data thus far suggests that NPI measures including physical distancing, reduction of travel, and use of personal protective equipment have been demonstrated to reduce COVID-19 transmission. Much of the existing research focuses on comparisons of NPI stringency with COVID-19 transmission among different high-income countries, or on high-income countries, leaving critical questions about the applicability of these findings to low- and middle-income settings. Added value of this studyWe used a detailed COVID-19 surveillance dataset from Ghana, and unique high resolution spatial data on human mobility from Vodafone Ghana as well as Google smartphone GPS location data. We show how human mobility and NPI stringency were associated with changes in the effective reproduction number (Rt). We further demonstrate how this association was strongest in the early COVID-19 outbreak in Ghana, decreasing after the relaxation of national restrictions. Implications of all the available evidenceThe change in association between human mobility, NPI stringency, and Rt may reflect a \\"decoupling\\" of NPI stringency and human mobility from disease transmission in Ghana as the COVID-19 epidemic progressed.

However, the pivoting function of a CT scan during the pandemic presents several drawbacks, including high cost and cross-contamination problems. Radiation-free lung ultrasound (LUS) imaging, which requires high expertise and is thus being underutilised, has demonstrated a strong correlation with CT scan results and a high reliability in pneumonia detection even in the early stages.

In Central America, strong lockdown measures started during March of 2020. In this study, we used seismic stations from Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua to study the effects of these measures on seismic records by characterizing temporal variations in the high-frequency band (4-14 Hz) via spectral and amplitude analyses. In addition, we studied the link between the reduction in seismic noise and the number of earthquake detections and felt reports in Costa Rica and Guatemala. We found that seismic stations near the capitals of Costa Rica, Guatemala, and El Salvador presented a decrease in their typical seismic noise levels, from 200 to 140, from 100 to 80, and from 120 to 80 nm, respectively. Our results showed that the largest reduction of similar to 50% in seismic noise was observed at seismic stations near main airports, busy roads, and densely populated cities. In Nicaragua, the seismic noise levels remained constant (similar to 40 nm), as no lockdown measures were applied. We suggest that the decrease in seismic noise levels may have increased earthquake detections and the number of felt reports of low-magnitude earthquakes. However, the variations observed in several seismic parameters before and after the lockdown are not significant enough to easily link our observations or separate them from other contributing factors.

The results of the empirical research are based on 593 responses;most of the subjects belong to generation Z (digital natives) and Y (millennials). The analysis revealed attitudes towards different AI-based transport solutions and AI robots that provide information at the airports. Based on the perceived attractiveness of such services, the environmentally conscious behaviour of consumers, and sociodemographic data, subjects were classified into three different clusters (Negligents, AV Enthusiasts, and Robot Fanatics). Results proved the attractiveness of AI-based transport services that can be used in the air-side zone. Among the millennials, the idea of self-driving buses running between airport terminals is the most appealing. Greater interest in AI-based communication solutions can be perceived among generation Z. For both generations, environmentally conscious consumption is also of paramount importance. The attractiveness of AI-based solutions has been analyzed in a tourist environment, which might be a good starting point for further research into the technology acceptance of AI-based services.","output":"Technology-Enhanced Airport ServicesAttractiveness from the Travelers Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had severe impacts on global public health. In England, social distancing measures and a nationwide lockdown were introduced to reduce the spread of the virus. Green space accessibility may have been particularly important during this lockdown, as it could have provided benefits for physical and mental wellbeing. However, the associations between public green space use and the rate of COVID-19 transmission are yet to be quantified, and as the size and accessibility of green spaces vary within England's local authorities, the risks and benefits to the public of using green space may be context-dependent. To evaluate how green space affected COVID-19 transmission across 299 local authorities (small regions) in England, we calculated a daily case rate metric, based upon a seven-day moving average, for each day within the period June 1st - November 30th 2020 and assessed how baseline health and mobility variables influenced these rates. Next, looking at the residual case rates, we investigated how landscape structure (e.g. area and patchiness of green space) and park use influenced transmission. We first show that reducing mobility is associated with a decline in case rates, especially in areas with high population clustering. After accounting for known mechanisms behind transmission rates, we found that park use (showing a preference for park mobility) was associated with decreased residual case rates, especially when green space was low and contiguous (not patchy). Our results support that a reduction in overall mobility may be a good strategy for reducing case rates, endorsing the success of lockdown measures. However, if mobility is necessary, outdoor park use may be safer than other forms of mobility and associated activities (e.g. shopping or office-based working).","output":"Associations between COVID-19 transmission rates, park use, and landscape structure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Existing literature recognizes the possible role of trade policy and firms exposure to international trade as determinants of productivity. A strand of the literature sheds light on the effects of trade policy changes on firm-level productivity. Another strand studies the relationship between firms trade status (exporting production or importing intermediates, but usually not both simultaneously) and firm-level TFP dynamics. However, the analyses that integrate both strands are scarce. This paper aims to disentangle the impact of input and output tariffs on firms productivity. Further, it analyses whether the impact of changes in tariffs is conditioned by the trade status of the firm (exporting and/or importing). At difference to most previous papers, we carry out our analysis for a large developing country in a period of slow trade liberalization. Thus, in the empirical part, we use data from firms belonging to Brazilian industrial sectors (manufacturing and mining) during 2000C2008. After estimating total factor productivity (TFP) at the firm level using updated methodologies, we estimate both the impact of trade policy and firms trade status on TFP dynamics. Our results suggest that trade liberalization (through reductions in input or output tariffs) increases TFP, being the effect associated to a reduction in input tariffs greater. Furthermore, the impact of trade policy on TFP spreads among all firms, which could be consistent with the existence of spillovers from trading firms to non-trading firms or with the notion that trade liberalization exerts competitive pressure on all firms, regardless of their initial exposure to international trade. Finally, we also find evidence of a positive effect of both the import and export statuses on TFP.","output":"Firm productivity gains in a period of slow trade liberalization: evidence from Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Urban centers play a central role in night-time leisure activities in the city. They combine the offerings of the night-time economies, such as bars, restaurants or clubs, which are often concentrated in separate hotspots. To get to these hotspots, routes have to be travelled and means of transport have to be used. In this context, spatial mobility at night, especially in the field of local public transport, differs in many respects from that during the day. Against this background, the article analyzes the nocturnal mobility processes that take place for leisure purposes on public transport, using Karlsruhe as an example. The basis of the analysis is a data set that was created as part of a student workshop during a nightly survey of the trains of the Karlsruhe public transport system. The results show, among other things, that stops located in the immediate vicinity of night-time economies are used more frequently than average by public transport passengers during the night. Despite some points of criticism, the public transport service at night is largely perceived positively. Nevertheless, the article identifies fundamental potential for improvement and presents suitable scope for action and optimization measures. Finally, recommendations for further research approaches to the topic of night-time mobility are given.","output":"Freitagnachts unterwegs im ?PNV: Muster und Motive anhand des Fallbeispiels Karlsruhe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To describe the clinical and electrophysiological features of adult-onset macular dystrophy, due to novel combinations of CDHR1 alleles, and compare the associated phenotypes with previous reports. METHODS: The clinical records of patients with macular dystrophy and biallelic variants in CDHR1 were reviewed. Data analysed included best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fundus images: autofluorescence (AF) and optical coherence tomography (OCT); full field electroretinography (ERG) and pattern ERG (PERG). RESULTS: Seven patients from six pedigrees were ascertained. One patient was homozygous for a known synonymous variant p.(Pro261=), four were compound heterozygous for the p.(Pro261=) variant and a novel allele of CDHR1: p.(Gly188Ser), p.(Met1?), or p.(Val458Asp); one patient was compound heterozygous for two previously unreported variants: c.297+1G>T in trans with p.(Pro735Thr). The range of BCVA at the last clinic review was (6/5-6/60). Autofluorescence showed macular flecks of increased AF in mild cases and patches of reduced AF in severe cases. The OCT showed attenuation of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) in mild cases and loss of the EZ and the outer nuclear layer in severe cases; one patient had subfoveal hyporeflective region between the EZ and the retinal pigment epithelium. The full field ERG was normal or borderline subnormal in all cases, and the PERG was subnormal in mild cases or undetectable in severe cases. CONCLUSIONS: This report corroborates previous observations that genotypes distinct from those causing pan-retinal dystrophy can cause a milder phenotype, predominantly affecting the macula, and expands the spectrum of these genotypes. The findings in this cohort suggest a potential macular susceptibility to mild perturbations of the photoreceptor cadherin.","output":"A clinical study of patients with novel CDHR1 genotypes associated with late-onset macular dystrophy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many people began sharing that they experienced unexpected menstrual bleeding after SARS-CoV-2 inoculation.

We investigated menstrual bleeding patterns among currently and formerly menstruating people, with a research design based off our expectations that these bleeding changes related to changes in clotting or inflammation, affecting normal menstrual repair. In this sample, 42% of people with regular menstrual cycles bled more heavily than usual, while 44% reported no change, after being vaccinated. Among people who typically do not menstruate, 71% of people on long-acting reversible contraceptives, 39% of people on gender-affirming hormones, and 66% of post-menopausal people reported breakthrough bleeding. We found increased/breakthrough bleeding was significantly associated with age, other vaccine side effects (fever, fatigue), history of pregnancy or birth, and ethnicity.

COVID-19 is known to be a highly infectious virus, and infected individuals do not initially exhibit symptoms, while some remain asymptomatic. Thus, a non-negligible fraction of the population can, at any given time, be a hidden source of transmissions. In response, many governments have shown great interest in smartphone contact tracing apps that help automate the difficult task of tracing all recent contacts of newly identified infected individuals. However, tracing apps have generated much discussion around their key attributes, including system architecture, data management, privacy, security, proximity estimation, and attack vulnerability. In this article, we provide the first comprehensive review of these much-discussed tracing app attributes. We also present an overview of many proposed tracing app examples, some of which have been deployed countrywide, and discuss the concerns users have reported regarding their usage.

While the four seasonal HCoVs appear to be mildly pathogenic and circulate among human populations, the other three designated SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe diseases in some cases. The newly identified SARS-CoV-2, a causative virus of COVID-19 that can be deadly, is now spreading worldwide much more efficiently than the other two pathogenic viruses. Despite evident differences in these properties, all HCoVs commonly have an exceptionally large genomic RNA with a rather peculiar gene organization and have the potential to readily alter their biological properties. CoVs are characterized by their biological diversifications, high recombination, and efficient adaptive evolution. We are particularly concerned about the high replication and transmission nature of SARS-CoV-2, which may lead to the emergence of more transmissible and/or pathogenic viruses than ever before. Furthermore, novel variant viruses may appear at any time from the CoV pools actively circulating or persistently being maintained in the animal reservoirs, and from the CoVs in infected human individuals. In this review, we describe knowns of the CoVs and then mention their unknowns to clarify the major issues to be addressed. Genome organizations and sequences of numerous CoVs have been determined, and the viruses are presently classified into separate phylogenetic groups. Functional roles in the viral replication cycle in vitro of non-structural and structural proteins are also quite well understood or suggested. In contrast, those in the in vitro and in vivo replication for various accessory proteins encoded by the variable 3 one-third portion of the CoV genome mostly remain to be determined. Importantly, the genomic sequences/structures closely linked to the high CoV recombination are poorly investigated and elucidated. Also, determinants for adaptation and pathogenicity have not been systematically investigated. We summarize here these research situations. Among conceivable projects, we are especially interested in the underlying molecular mechanism by which the observed CoV diversification is generated. Finally, as virologists, we discuss how we handle the present difficulties and propose possible research directions in the medium or long term.","output":"Toward Understanding Molecular Bases for Biological Diversification of Human Coronaviruses: Present Status and Future Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contrary to the pre-existing mapping and top-down instantiation from thought to language, Discourse Dynamics Framework for Metaphor(DDFM)argues that metaphor works mainly inductively upwards from the linguistic metaphor data, offering a tool for understanding people, revealing something of speaker's ideas, affective aspects and values.

Bats are reservoirs of, or can be infected by, several viral diseases, including rabies virus strains (in the Lyssavirus genus). Within this genus are bat variants that have been recorded in Europe; European bat lyssavirus 1 (EBLV-1), European bat lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-2) and, four currently unclassified isolates. Since 1977, 783 cases of EBLVs (by isolation of viral RNA) have been recorded in Europe. EBLV-1 or EBLV-2 has been identified in 12 bat species, with over 95% of EBLV-1 infections identified in Eptesicus serotinus. EBLV-2 is associated with Myotis species (Myotis daubentonii and Myotis dasycneme). A programme of passive surveillance in the United Kingdom between 1987 and 2004 tested 4871 bats for lyssaviruses. Of these, four M. daubentonii (3.57% of submitted M. daubentonii) were positive for EBLV-2. Potential bias in the passive surveillance includes possible over-representation of synanthropic species and regional biases caused by varying bat submission numbers from different parts of the UK. In 2003, active surveillance in the UK began, and has detected an antibody prevalence level of 1C5% of EBLV-2 in M. daubentonii (n = 350), and one bat with antibodies to EBLV-1 in E. serotinus (n = 52).

This angry-men-happy-women bias has been ascribed to either top-down (e.g., well-learned stereotypes) or bottom-up (e.g., shared morphological cues) processes.

The current effort addresses this challenge by harnessing two complementary metatheoretical approaches to dimensional interaction: Garner's logic of inferring informational structure and General Recognition Theorya multidimensional extension of signal detection theory. Conjoint application of these two rigorous methodologies afforded us to: (a) uncover the internal representations that generate the angry-men-happy-women phenomenon, (b) disentangle varieties of perceptual (bottom-up) and decisional (top-down) sources of interaction, and (c) relate operational and theoretical meanings of dimensional independence.

Since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province in China, the spectrum of lung parenchymal findings has been well described but the underlying pathophysiology is less well understood. DECT imaging contributes to the growing evidence that vascular dysregulation has an important role in the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. Three patients with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 underwent DECT scans. One patient had a DECT for persistent spikes in temperature while the other two patients underwent dual-energy CT pulmonary angiograms (CTPA) for worsening shortness of breath, elevated D dimers and suspected pulmonary embolism. The perfusion abnormalities include focal areas of both hyperperfusion, hypoperfusion, and areas of hypoperfusion surrounded by hyperemia. In addition, dilatation of segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries was seen in relation to the lung parenchymal change. DECT has proven useful in supporting the hypothesis that vascular dysregulation plays a significant role in the pulmonary pathophysiology of COVID-19. Early identification and a high index of suspicion is required in the emergency department setting to identify and isolate cases even prior to the results of RT-PCR test being available.

Follow-up data of a national survey with German ORLs were evaluated regarding differences between the two waves of the pandemic. METHODS: As in the initial survey, German ORLs were addressed via e?mail through the German Society of ORL, Head and Neck Surgery and the German ENT Association. All ORLs afflicted with SARS-CoV?2 were invited to participate in a web-based survey. General data on infections and concomitant parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: Since the start of the pandemic, 129 ORLs reported testing positive for SARS-CoV?2 in Germany. The ORLs infected during the first wave had a relative risk (RR) of 4.07 (95% CI: 3.20; 5.19) of contracting SARS-CoV?2. During the second wave, the RR decreased to 0.35 (95% CI: 0.28; 0.45). The availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) increased from the first to the second wave along with an increased perception of protection in the professional environment. The source of infection shifted from infections via medical staff during the first wave to patients and household exposure during the second wave. Regular medical practice was resumed by clinicians and general practitioners in the second wave. Nevertheless, a proportionally lower infection rate was observed compared with the German population as a whole. CONCLUSION: The data reflect a unique long-term survey of ORLs during the pandemic. Differences in the source of infection were seen between the first and second wave, confirming the need for appropriate PPE for medical professionals working in high-risk environments. Further strategies to reduce the risk of infection include consistent testing for SARS-CoV?2 in healthcare professionals, patients, and the general public as well as vaccination of high-risk medical groups.

Differences in viral structure and clinical outcome prompted us to postulate that innate mucosal immune responses would be markedly different following rotavirus and coronavirus infections. To address this hypothesis, gene expression following BRV and BCV infection was analysed in surgically prepared intestinal loops from 1-day-old colostrum-deprived calves. Gene expression was profiled at 18 h post-infection using bovine cDNA microarrays; the majority of differentially expressed significant genes were associated with the cell cycle and innate immune responses. A select group of these genes was validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression of genes associated with interferons (IFNs), cytokines and Toll-like receptors, which were not present on the microarray, was analysed further by qRT-PCR. Strong activation of TLR3, IL-6 and p65 was observed in BRV-infected host tissues, but not in tissues infected with BCV. Both viruses also downregulated IFN- and pro-inflammatory cytokine-associated pathways. In vitro studies confirmed that IFN inhibited viral replication.

METHODS: According to the sMVAP quartiles, we divided all patients into four groups. The clinical electronic medical records, nursing records, laboratory findings, and radiological examinations for all patients with laboratory confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were reviewed. Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) models were used to determine the risk factors associated with in hospital death. RESULTS: A total of 97 patients were included in this study. The Quartile 4 group 's ICU transfer rate was significantly higher than the Quartile 1 group. Coronary heart disease, high d-dimer and sMVAP at admission were associated with increased odds of death.

Therefore, the use of sMVAP index for OSAHS screening for inpatients with COVID-19 should be vigorously promoted, and high-risk patients should be effectively managed.","output":"Symptomless multi-Variable apnea prediction index assesses adverse outcomes in patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Agro Innovation Park is a forum for developing various superior technologies from the Agricultural Research and Development Agency The services provided are complemented by a library, a consultation area, a training arena, and a playground This study aims to determine visitors perceptions of several technological innovations implemented The data presented are in the form of park arrangement, various technological innovations, number of visitors, perceptions of visitors, and apprentices in 2018, 2019, and 2020 The Agro Innovation Park is located in Sungai Tiga IP2TP office area, Pondok Meja Village, Mestong District, Muaro Jambi Regency, Jambi Province This park was built in 2015, having several types of plants with various adaptive and innovative technologies, ranging from short-lived plants such as leaf-producing vegetables, medium-aged plants such as fruit-producing vegetables, and long-lived plants such as perennials, and also equipped with medicinal plants There was an increase in the number of visitors and internship students from 2018 to 2019, but there was a decline afterward This happened due to the Covid-19 pandemic resulting in the temporary closure of parks for visitors and apprentices The findings indicate that In terms of the service provided, 20% of the visitors were satisfied and 80% said that they were very satisfied For the various technological innovations implemented, 88% of the visitors stated that they were very interested in park management and 75% were very interested in hydroponic technology innovations","output":"Visitors Perceptions of Cultivation Technology Innovation in Agro Innovation Park, BPTP Jambi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The advent of COVID-19 abruptly thrust the health and safety of children and families into greater risk around the world. As regional and local governments, nongovernmental organizations, communities, families, and children grapple with the immediate public health impact of COVID-19, the rights and well-being of children, especially those who are already marginalized, have been overlooked. Those working with children have likely encountered unprecedented challenges and responded in innovative ways in efforts to address the needs and rights of all children. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a protocol for a large-scale, multinational study using a new smartphone app to capture the real-time experiences and perspectives of practitioners and policymakers supporting children and families during the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe in relation to a childrens human rights 4P framework of protection, provision, prevention, and participation. METHODS: This protocol describes a mixed methods survey utilizing a custom-built iOS and Android smartphone app called the COVID 4P Log for Childrens Wellbeing, which was developed in close consultation with 17 international key partner organizations. Practitioners and policymakers working with and for childrens well-being across 29 countries and 5 continents were invited to download the app and respond to questions over the course of 8 weeks. The anticipated large amount of qualitative and quantitative response data will be analyzed using content analysis, descriptive statistics, and word frequencies. RESULTS: Formal data collection took place from October 2020 until March 2021. Data analysis was completed in July 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The findings will directly inform the understanding of the ways in which COVID-19 has impacted practitioners, managers, and policymakers efforts to support childrens well-being in their practices, services, and policies, respectively. Innovative and ambitious in its scope and use of smartphone technology, this project also aims to inform and inspire future multinational research using app-based methodologiesthe demand for which is likely to continue to dramatically rise in the COVID-19 era.

Many putative antibiotics demonstrate promising in vitro potency but fail in vivo due to poor drug-like qualities (e.g. serum half-life, oral absorption, solubility, toxicity). These drug-like properties can be modified through the addition of chemical protecting groups, creating prodrugs that are activated prior to target inhibition. Lipophilic prodrugging techniques, including the attachment of a pivaloyloxymethyl group, have garnered attention for their ability to increase cellular permeability by masking charged residues and the relative ease of the chemical prodrugging process. Unfortunately, pivaloyloxymethyl prodrugs are rapidly activated by human sera, rendering any membrane permeability qualities absent during clinical treatment. Identification of the bacterial prodrug activation pathway(s) will allow for the development of host-stable and microbe-targeted prodrug therapies. Here, we use two zoonotic staphylococcal species, S. schleiferi and S. pseudintermedius, to establish the mechanism of carboxy ester prodrug activation. Using a forward genetic screen, we identify a conserved locus in both species encoding the enzyme hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase (GloB), whose loss-of-function confers resistance to carboxy ester prodrugs. We enzymatically characterize GloB and demonstrate that it is a functional glyoxalase II enzyme, which has the capacity to activate carboxy ester prodrugs. As GloB homologs are both widespread and diverse in sequence, our findings suggest that GloB may be a useful mechanism for developing species-or genus-level prodrug targeting strategies.","output":"Antimicrobial prodrug activation by the staphylococcal glyoxalase GloB"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Infectious diseases-related stigmatization is a common feature in health-care workers (HCWs) This study aims to evaluate the factors associated with stigmas and the effects of stigmatization in HCWs during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic Methods: This study was conducted by an anonymous online survey of 452 actively working HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic All subjects provided informed consent electronically before registration and completed the sociodemographic data form, a questionnaire about COVID-19 pandemics, a COVID-19 stigmatization questionnaire for health-care workers, a hospital anxiety depression scale form (HADS), a psychological well-being scale form, the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale short form (WHO-QOL BREF) and Coping Styles Scale brief form (CBSS-BF) Results: Perception of stigma score was significantly higher among HCWs with one or more of the following characteristics: they had worked with patients with COVID-19 (+) but had no specific training related to coronavirus, experienced COVID-19 symptoms themselves, delayed testing due to anxiety, received psychological support during COVID-19 pandemics, suffered from a psychological disorder, or had suicidal thoughts/attempts before or during the COVID-19 pandemic (p&lt;0 05) A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between the perception of stigmatization score and HAD-S (p&lt;0 05) A statistically significant negative correlation was observed between the perception of the stigmatization score and the Psychological Well-Being Score, CSS-BF problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping, and all subscales of WHOQOL-BRIEF (p&lt;0 05) Conclusion: The findings of our study showed that the negative perception of stigma in HCWs could affect their psychological well-being and life satisfaction During the pandemic, it is necessary to prevent stigmatizing HCWs and improve coping strategies to protect their mental health and increase their life quality","output":"Stigma-related Factors and their Effects on Health-care Workers during COVID-19 Pandemics in Turkey: A Multicenter Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of review: The COVID-19 pandemic has widespread implications not only for clinical practice but also for academic medicine and postgraduate training The need to promote physical distancing and flexibility within our department has generated important revisions to the core curriculum for the Adult Nephrology Training Program in Vancouver, Canada Sources of information: We reviewed available educational resources and objectives to develop curricular adaptations informed by staff and trainee feedback Methods: Many facets of the program including clinical rotations, scholarly activities, evaluation, and wellness have been impacted, and thus revised for online delivery where possible Trainees have personalized a learning plan based on individual goals and supplemented by a list of internet-based resources for independent review Changes in learning objectives and methods for specific rotations have occurred and are described Ongoing evaluation will be undertaken Key findings: Curriculum adaptation in the era of COVID-19 is necessary to ensure ongoing high-quality education for future nephrologists We describe existing changes to formal training in British Columbia (BC), which will be tailored as the pandemic evolves, and anticipate them to have lasting impact on the way we structure training programs in the future Standardization and harmonization of modified curriculum may be possible across Canada with sharing of these learnings Limitations: Formal evaluation of these changes in terms of knowledge acquisition and examination performance has not yet been undertaken Next steps will include assessing and documenting the impact of this curricular transformation to further optimize scheduling, educational yield, and trainee wellness ?

SARS-CoV-2 is an exposure agent recently added to the network of exposures that comprise the human exposome, i.e. the totality of all environmental exposures throughout one's lifetime. At the same time, the application of measures to tackle SARS-CoV-2 transmission leads to changes in the exposome components and in characteristics of urban environments that define the urban exposome, a complementary concept to the human exposome, which focuses on monitoring urban health. This work highlights the use of a comprehensive systems-based approach of the exposome for better capturing the population-wide and individual-level variability in SARS-CoV-2 spread and its associated urban and individual exposures towards improved guidance and response. Population characteristics, the built environment and spatiotemporal features of city infrastructure, as well as individual characteristics/parameters, socioeconomic status, occupation and biological susceptibility need to be simultaneously considered when deploying non-pharmacological public health measures. Integrating individual and population characteristics, as well as urban-specific parameters is the prerequisite in urban exposome studies. Applications of the exposome approach in cities/towns could facilitate assessment of health disparities and better identification of vulnerable populations, as framed by multiple environmental, urban design and planning co-exposures. Exposome-based applications in epidemics control and response include the implementation of exposomic tools that have been quite mature in non-communicable disease research, ranging from biomonitoring and surveillance to sensors and modeling. Therefore, the exposome can be a novel tool in risk assessment and management during epidemics and other major public health events.

With over 72 million cases globally till December 2020, countries need to gear up to detect, isolate and treat Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases. Laboratories play a crucial role in diagnosis thereby instituting early contact tracing and quarantine measures. The laboratory based COVID-19 diagnostic testing data may help in formulating strategies to contain the spread of infection. Aim: To describe key patient variables of the respiratory samples processed for SARS-CoV-2 by Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) at a diagnostic laboratory. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive, single centre study carried out at ICMR approved COVID-19 diagnostic laboratory, nasopharyngeal swabs received in Viral Transport Medium (VTM) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RTPCR. Key patient variables, like age, gender, symptoms and sample positivity rate were tabulated. The demographic and clinical data of samples tested were summarised by medians and Interquartile Range (IQR) for continuous variables and by proportions for categorical variables. Results: A total of 12,187 samples were received between 21st March to 8th July 2020. The data from 11,196 individuals were complete and were included in the analysis. Overall, 2,053 samples were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 indicating positivity rate of 18.33%. Sample positivity was highest (63.91%) among high-risk contacts of a laboratory confirmed case. The maximum number of samples tested belonged to age group of 21-40 years and male predominance was observed. Conclusion: Although social distancing, mask usage, hand hygiene and respiratory etiquettes are important measures for containment of COVID-19, strengthening and capacity building of laboratory network is crucial for mitigating the pandemic.

Responding to the pandemic, Sweden has taken a different approach aiming to mitigate, not suppress, community transmission, by using physical distancing without lockdowns. Here we contrast the consequences of different responses to COVID-19 within Sweden, the resulting demand for care, intensive care, the death tolls and the associated direct healthcare related costs. METHODS: We used an age-stratified health-care demand extended SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) compartmental model for all municipalities in Sweden, and a radiation model for describing inter-municipality mobility. The model was calibrated against data from municipalities in the Stockholm healthcare region. RESULTS: Our scenario with moderate to strong physical distancing describes well the observed health demand and deaths in Sweden up to the end of May 2020. In this scenario, the intensive care unit (ICU) demand reaches the pre-pandemic maximum capacity just above 500 beds. In the counterfactual scenario, the ICU demand is estimated to reach 20 times higher than the pre-pandemic ICU capacity. The different scenarios show quite different death tolls up to 1 September, ranging from 5000 to 41 000, excluding deaths potentially caused by ICU shortage. Additionally, our statistical analysis of all causes excess mortality indicates that the number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 could be increased by 40% (95% confidence interval: 0.24, 0.57). CONCLUSION: The results of this study highlight the impact of different combinations of non-pharmaceutical interventions, especially moderate physical distancing in combination with more effective isolation of infectious individuals, on reducing deaths, health demands and lowering healthcare costs. In less effective mitigation scenarios, the demand on ICU beds would rapidly exceed capacity, showing the tight interconnection between the healthcare demand and physical distancing in the society. These findings have relevance for Swedish policy and response to the COVID-19 pandemic and illustrate the importance of maintaining the level of physical distancing for a longer period beyond the study period to suppress or mitigate the impacts from the pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 healthcare demand and mortality in Sweden in response to non-pharmaceutical mitigation and suppression scenarios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The association between current tobacco smoking, the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 and the severity of illness is an important information gap. METHODS: UK users of the Zoe COVID-19 Symptom Study app provided baseline data including demographics, anthropometrics, smoking status and medical conditions, and were asked to log their condition daily. Participants who reported that they did not feel physically normal were then asked by the app to complete a series of questions, including 14 potential COVID-19 symptoms and about hospital attendance. The main study outcome was the development of 'classic' symptoms of COVID-19 during the pandemic defined as fever, new persistent cough and breathlessness and their association with current smoking. The number of concurrent COVID-19 symptoms was used as a proxy for severity and the pattern of association between symptoms was also compared between smokers and non-smokers.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 related stressors and their relationship to key mental health and functioning outcomes in a resettled refugee sample. METHOD: N = 656 refugees and asylum seekers living in Australia completed a survey in June 2020 to index their mental health (posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, health anxiety and disability) and COVID-19 experiences. The relationship between COVID-19 stressors and mental health was examined using a series of hierarchical linear regression models while controlling for other key demographic factors. RESULTS: Refugees most prevalent stressors related to worries of being infected by COVID-19 or the risk COVID-19 posed to others, which predicted health anxiety and PTSD. Social-related difficulties predicted depression and disability symptoms. Accessing and trusting information from authorities were the least prevalent stressors and were not significantly associated with mental health outcomes; neither was accessing basic supplies and financial support. Fears relating to the future such as concerns about visa application processes predicted health anxiety and disability. Crucially, the strongest predictor of all mental health outcomes was COVID-19 serving as a reminder of difficult past events. CONCLUSIONS: Refugees may be uniquely affected by COVID-19 because the pandemic serves as a reminder of their past conflict and persecution trauma.

Thus, these changes in living conditions have had deleterious consequences on the behavior of PWD and subsequently on their caregivers' mental health, the two being linked. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to examine changes in behavior among PWD and to look for associations between the evolution of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and caregivers' mental health in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: The study was conducted among caregivers of PWD living at home in France. Caregivers were interviewed via an anonymous cross-sectional online survey during the first lockdown between April 15 and June 15, 2020. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-nine caregivers accompanying a relative living at home participated in the study; 43.3%of the PWD presented a worsening of BPSD during the lockdown. With multivariate logistic regressions, a significant association was observed between \\"more BPSD\\" and burden, anxiety and depression, between \\"BPSD equivalent\\" and anxiety and depression, and between \\"emerging BPSD\\" and only depression. CONCLUSION: The lockdown seems to have an impact on behavioral disorders in PWD and these disorders are associated with poorer mental health of caregivers. Our findings suggest attention should be given to caregivers of PWD who have BPSD before lockdown and the need for continued consultations and professional help in case of new lockdowns.","output":"COVID-19: Association Between Increase of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia During Lockdown and Caregivers' Poor Mental Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is faced with the dire challenge of finding an effective treatment against the rampaging COVID 19 pandemic.

It is divided into two granular lobes, one on the right and one on the left, connected by a bile duct. The liver is essential in the removal of waste products from human food consumption, the creation of bile, the regulation of metabolic activities, the cleaning of the blood by sensitizing digestive management, and the storage of vitamins and minerals. To perform the classification of liver illnesses using computed tomography (CT scans), two critical phases must first be completed: liver segmentation and categorization. The most difficult challenge in categorizing liver disease is distinguishing the liver from the other organs near it. Methodology. Liver biopsy is a kind of invasive diagnostic procedure, widely regarded as the gold standard for accurately estimating the severity of liver disease. Noninvasive approaches for examining liver illnesses, such as blood serum markers and medical imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance MR, and CT) have also been developed. This approach uses the Partial Differential Technique (PDT) to separate the liver from the other organs and Level Set Methodology (LSM) for separating the cancer location from the surrounding tissue based on the projected pictures used as input. With the help of an Improved Convolutional Classifier, the categorization of different phases may be accomplished. RESULTS: Several accuracies, sensitivity, and specificity measurements are produced to assess the categorization of LSM using an Improved Convolutional classifier. Approximately, 97.5% of the performance accuracy of the liver categorization is achieved with a 94.5% continuous interval (CI) of [0.6775 1.0000] and an error rate of 2.1%. The suggested method's performance is compared to that of two existing algorithms, and the sensitivity and specificity provide an overall average of 96% and 93%, respectively, with 95% Continuous Interval of [0.7513 1.0000] and [0.7126 1.0000] for sensitivity and specificity, respectively.","output":"A Liver Damage Prediction Using Partial Differential Segmentation with Improved Convolutional Neural Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The catheterisation laboratory today combines diagnosis and therapeutics, through various imaging modalities and a prolific list of interventional tools, led by balloons and stents.

Interpretation of the physiologic significance of coronary stenosis based on prior angiographic images is being explored and implemented. Major efforts to reduce X-ray exposure to the staff and the patients, using computer-based algorithms for image processing, and novel methods to limit the radiation spread are being explored. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning for better patient care requires attention to universal methods for sharing and combining large data sets and for allowing interpretation and analysis of large cohorts of patients. Barriers to data sharing using integrated and universal protocols should be overcome to allow these methods to become widely applicable. Robotic catheterisation takes the physician away from the ionising radiation spot, enables coronary angioplasty and stenting without compromising safety, and may allow increased precision.

The semi-structured interview was used to collect the data, from April to May 2020. The data were organized and analyzed using the Collective Subject Discourse (CSD) method with the aid of the Qualiquantisoft? software. RESULTS Twenty members of the nursing team participated (10 nurses and 10 nursing technicians). After the analysis, three CSDs with their respective central ideas (CI) emerged. The CSD software, Qualiquantisoft?, also provided a quantitative analysis of the responses, in which 12 (60%) of the respondents believe that the main stressors are associated with work organization, 6 (30%) of the respondents believe that the main stressors are associated to work relationships and 2 (10%) of respondents believe that the main stressors are associated with working conditions.

METHODS We performed a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), comparing intravascular access methods performed by operators wearing full level C PPE. We evaluated the procedure time and success rate of intraosseous and peripheral intravenous access. RESULTS Eight RCTs were included in quantitative synthesis. The use of PPE during intravascular access procedures has an influence on the procedure time of intraosseous access (MD=11.69; 95%CI: 6.47, 16.92; P<0.001), as well as reduced the success rate by 0.8% in intraosseous access and by 10.1% in intravenous access.

PTPases from both cases were partially purified into 0%-40% and 40%-80% fractions based on ammonium sulfate saturation levels. Fraction (40%-80%) exhibited a purification level of 4.44-fold and 2.86-fold with specific activity of 44.06 and 23.33 U/mg for PTPases from T. ammi and C. verum, respectively. PTPases being found to be thermally stable up to 70C imply their industrial significance. Kinetic studies showed Km values to be 7.14 and 8.33 mM, whereas the activation energy (Ea ) values were 25.89 and 29.13 kJ/mol, respectively. Divalent cations: Cu2+ , Zn2+ , and Mn2+ acted as inhibitors of PTPases, from both sources. The Ki values of inhibitors varied from 0.014-0.125 mM in the descending order Cu2+ > Zn2+ > Mn2+ and Mn2+ > Cu2+ > Zn2+ for PTPases from T. ammi and C. verum, respectively. The inhibitory effect of sodium metavanadate aligns with prominent PTPase characteristics.

Compliance with social distancing policies, strict return-to-play protocols, and COVID-19 specific training has, perhaps, forever changed the way that children and young people engage in organised sport. Within this context, and while many children and families seek to re-engage with community sport, we (researchers and sport practitioners) have an obligation to ask questions about how the pandemic has impacted youth sport, understand the short- and long-term consequences, and explore what (if any) opportunities can be seized to assist and improve future participation and retention. The aim of this paper was to present an in-depth exploration of the impact of COVID-19 on youth sport in South Australia. METHODS: Within an interpretive descriptive methodology, this qualitative investigation draws on rich, individual interview and focus group data with 39 youth (ages 15-18), parents, coaches, and sport administrators. A reflexive thematic analysis was undertaken, leading to the development of four substantive themes. RESULTS: We conceptualised the '4 Rs' to advance theoretical understandings about the pandemic's impact on youth sport, including the themes 'recognising struggle', 'reconnection', 're-engaging after restrictions, and 'reimagining sport'. The themes captured insights about a decline in mental wellbeing and physical activity, an increase in family connectedness, the challenge for sports to attract volunteers and participants back into sport, and the opportunities to reset values and philosophies underpinning the provision of youth sport. CONCLUSION: The findings provide valuable insight into the youth sport setting as a result of the global pandemic and suggest that families, sporting clubs and sporting organisations require additional resources and tools (for example, support for parents to facilitate their children's training at home during lockdown) to aid recovery efforts and to ensure the survival and prosperity of youth sport into the future.","output":"Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on youth sport in Australia and consequences for future participation and retention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Throughout childhood and adolescence, periods of heightened neuroplasticity are critical for the development of healthy brain function and behavior.

We tested the hypothesis that inflammation disrupts developmental cortical plasticity in vivo using the mouse ocular dominance model of experience-dependent plasticity in primary visual cortex. We found that the administration of systemic lipopolysaccharide suppressed plasticity during juvenile critical period with accompanying transcriptional changes in a particular set of molecular regulators within primary visual cortex.

In the current study, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was investigated for the presence of large-scale internal RNA base pairing in its genome. This property, termed genome-scale ordered RNA structure (GORS) has been previously associated with host persistence in other positive-strand RNA viruses, potentially through its shielding effect on viral RNA recognition in the cell. Genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were remarkably structured, with minimum folding energy differences (MFEDs) of 15%, substantially greater than previously examined viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) (MFED of 7 to 9%). High MFED values were shared with all coronavirus genomes analyzed and created by several hundred consecutive energetically favored stem-loops throughout the genome. In contrast to replication-associated RNA structure, GORS was poorly conserved in the positions and identities of base pairing with other sarbecoviruses-even similarly positioned stem-loops in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV rarely shared homologous pairings, indicative of more rapid evolutionary change in RNA structure than in the underlying coding sequences. Sites predicted to be base paired in SARS-CoV-2 showed less sequence diversity than unpaired sites, suggesting that disruption of RNA structure by mutation imposes a fitness cost on the virus that is potentially restrictive to its longer evolution. Although functionally uncharacterized, GORS in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses represents important elements in their cellular interactions that may contribute to their persistence and transmissibility.IMPORTANCE The detection and characterization of large-scale RNA secondary structure in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 indicate an extraordinary and unsuspected degree of genome structural organization; this could be effectively visualized through a newly developed contour plotting method that displays positions, structural features, and conservation of RNA secondary structure between related viruses. Such RNA structure imposes a substantial evolutionary cost; paired sites showed greater restriction in diversity and represent a substantial additional constraint in reconstructing its molecular epidemiology. Its biological relevance arises from previously documented associations between possession of structured genomes and persistence, as documented for HCV and several other RNA viruses infecting humans and mammals. Shared properties potentially conferred by large-scale structure in SARS-CoV-2 include increasing evidence for prolonged infections and induced immune dysfunction that prevents development of protective immunity. The findings provide an additional element to cellular interactions that potentially influences the natural history of SARS-CoV-2, its pathogenicity, and its transmission.","output":"Pervasive RNA Secondary Structure in the Genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and Other Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The three-term conjugate gradient (CG) algorithms are among the efficient variants of CG algorithms for solving optimization models.

Data collection commenced mid\\\\year 2018. METHODS: A multivariate approach was used to apply the consensus scores of 1.911 internationally based nurses in the missed opportunities for maintaining infection control. RESULTS/FINDINGS: Thirteen variables exert direct effects on the nurses total scores underpinning missed infection control care. These include the methods used to prevent hospital\\\\acquired infections, surveillance and hand hygiene practices. Significant nurses demographic factors also included their countries of origin, employment status, employer type, job retention intentions, work intensity, length of clinical experience and staff development attendance.

Besides, medical crises (like the COVID-19 outbreak) and air pollution represent additional motives for the transition from traditional to socially and environmentally sustainable LMD mode. An emerging problem for companies in the postal and logistics industry is how to determine the best LMD mode in a multi-criteria setting under uncertainty. METHOD: For the first time, an extension of the Weighted Aggregated Sum Product ASsessment (WASPAS) method under the picture fuzzy environment is presented to solve the LMD mode selection problem. The introduced picture fuzzy set (PFS) based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method can be highly beneficial to managers who are in charge of LMD since it can take into account the neutral/refusal information and efficiently deal with high levels of imprecise, vague, and uncertain information. The comparative analysis with the existing state-of-the-art PFS-based MCDM methods approved the high reliability of the proposed picture fuzzy WASPAS method. Its high robustness and consistency are also confirmed. The presented method can be used to improve LMD in urban areas worldwide. Besides, it can be applied to solve other emerging MCDM problems in an uncertain environment.

There are several characteristics that may differentiate pathologic coughs from protective cough responses, including cough duration, frequency, hypersensitivity, impaired cough suppressibility, or treatment refractoriness.

Such adaptation is not likely to have emerged suddenly but, instead, may have evolved step by step with each step favored by natural selection. It is thus necessary to develop a theory about the origin in order to guide the search. Here, we propose such a model whereby evolution occurs in both the virus and the hosts (where the evolution is somatic; i.e., in the immune system). The hosts comprise three groups - the wild animal hosts, the nearby human population, and farther-away human populations. The theory suggests that the conditions under which the pandemic has initially evolved are: (i) an abundance of wild animals in the place of origin (PL0); (ii) a nearby human population of low density; (iii) frequent and long-term animal-human contacts to permit step-by-step evolution; and (iv) a level of herd immunity in the animal and human hosts. In this model, the evolving virus may have regularly spread out of PL0 although such invasions often fail, leaving sporadic cases of early infections. The place of the first epidemic (PL1), where humans are immunologically na?ve to the virus, is likely a distance away from PL0.

Until safe and efficacious vaccines or antiviral drugs become widely available, viral testing remains the primary mitigation measure for rapid identification and isolation of infected individuals. We aimed to assess the economic trade-offs of expanding and accelerating testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) across the USA in different transmission scenarios. METHODS: We used a multiscale model that incorporates SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the population level and daily viral load dynamics at the individual level to assess eight surveillance testing strategies that varied by testing frequency (from daily to monthly testing) and isolation period (1 or 2 weeks), compared with the status-quo strategy of symptom-based testing and isolation. For each testing strategy, we first estimated the costs (incorporating costs of diagnostic testing and admissions to hospital, and salary lost while in isolation) and years of life lost (YLLs) prevented under rapid and low transmission scenarios. We then assessed the testing strategies across a range of scenarios, each defined by effective reproduction number (R(e)), willingness to pay per YLL averted, and cost of a test, to estimate the probability that a particular strategy had the greatest net benefit. Additionally, for a range of transmission scenarios (R(e) from 11 to 3), we estimated a threshold test price at which the status-quo strategy outperforms all testing strategies considered. FINDINGS: Our modelling showed that daily testing combined with a 2-week isolation period was the most costly strategy considered, reflecting increased costs with greater test frequency and length of isolation period. Assuming a societal willingness to pay of US$100 000 per YLL averted and a price of $5 per test, the strategy most likely to be cost-effective under a rapid transmission scenario (R(e) of 22) is weekly testing followed by a 2-week isolation period subsequent to a positive test result. Under low transmission scenarios (R(e) of 12), monthly testing of the population followed by 1-week isolation rather than 2-week isolation is likely to be most cost-effective. Expanded surveillance testing is more likely to be cost-effective than the status-quo testing strategy if the price per test is less than $75 across all transmission rates considered. INTERPRETATION: Extensive expansion of SARS-CoV-2 testing programmes with more frequent and rapid tests across communities coupled with isolation of individuals with confirmed infection is essential for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, resources recouped from shortened isolation duration could be cost-effectively allocated to more frequent testing.

Both cutaneous lymphoma and immunosuppressive treatment can contribute to the development of more severe COVID-19 complications. The real challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic remains the management of the advanced and aggressive forms of cutaneous lymphomas, including late-stage mycosis fungoides (MF) and Szary syndrome (SS). Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is one of those treatments. ECP is considered high risk therapy according to the United States Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium recommendations for treatment of cutaneous lymphomas during the COVID-19 pandemic because it may require travel to the clinic or hospital. Methods: In this cross-sectional retrospective study, data of patients with MF or SS who received ECP treatment were collected. ECP consisted of a two-session cycle every two to four weeks. In our group we did not carry out prophylactic interruption of the therapy, once started. In patients with stable disease (SD) or partial response (PR), ECP was administered every 4 weeks, until a 6-week maximum interval was reached, and the response maintained. During the study period, the frequency of treatments was decreased, especially for patients with severe comorbidities and/or older age. The associated therapy was considered individually, depending on the extension of the disease, comorbidities, and adverse effects of each agent. Results: 16 patients with cutaneous lymphoma received ECP (9 (56%) with SS and 7 (44%) with MF). Their median age at diagnosis was 63 (57C67) years. The median number of treatments before ECP was 2 (1C3), which was typically either phototherapy or systemic corticosteroids. Regarding the associated treatment during ECP and pandemic, INF and retinoids were the first-choice treatments. In the MF group 3 patients (2 PR and 1 relapse) required additional therapy with acitretin and topic corticosteroids. In the SS group 5 patients (1 PR, 3 progressive disease and 1 relapse) received concomitant t treatment with INF alfa 2b, bexarotene and electron beam; the relapsed patient underwent mono chemotherapy. Three patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2, all of them were from the SS group, the contagion was outside the hospital environment. Two of the patients who developed COVID infection died. Conclusion: For patients with advanced forms of LCCT, who usually have multiple risk factors for a severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection therapy. The critical patient subset includes those with advanced disease, who require treatment with polychemotherapy, ECP and checkpoint inhibitors.

Extracellular stimuli are sensed, amplified, and transduced through a dynamic cellular network of messengers converting the first signal into a proper response: production of specific mediators, cell activation, survival, or death. Several overlapping pathways are coordinated to ensure specific and timely induction of inflammation to neutralize potential harms to the tissue. Ideally, the inflammatory response must be controlled and self-limited. Resolution of inflammation is an active process that culminates with termination of inflammation and restoration of tissue homeostasis. Comparably to the onset of inflammation, resolution responses are triggered by coordinated intracellular signaling pathways that transduce the message to the nucleus. However, the key messengers and pathways involved in signaling transduction for resolution are still poorly understood in comparison to the inflammatory network. cAMP has long been recognized as an inducer of anti-inflammatory responses and cAMP-dependent pathways have been extensively exploited pharmacologically to treat inflammatory diseases.

Kerala was the first state to have the confirmed case of COVID 19 in the country and it was first confirmed in Thrissur district on 30 January 2020.Our institute being in the heart of the city had to take adequate measures to mitigate the spread and treat the required patients by keeping its staff safe & healthy. The hallmark of COVID 19 infection is high infectivity, pre symptomatic transmission and asymptomatic prevalence which could result in high cumulative numbers of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Kerala was the first state to confirm community transmission in July 2020.Health care workers being in the forefront in the war against COVID19 are very prone in acquiring the infection and are possible to be asymptomatic sources for cluster formation. Knowing the development of immunity as shown by the presence of anti COV2 antibodies in the population contributes to the epidemiological understanding of the disease. The intent of the study is to do an antibody testing in our hospital to find the serosurveillance of SARS CoV 2 among the healthcare workers in our hospital. Aim: To estimate the seropositivity of SARS CoV 2 among the healthcare workers at Jubilee Mission Medical College and Research Institute, Thrissur, Kerala, six months after revoking the lockdown Methodology: A cross sectional study among the health care workers of the medical college. Multistage Sampling was done with the hospital block as the first stage and departments as the second stage. In the final stage of sampling the test individuals were selected on a first come first served basis after the antibody test availability was declared open and free for all staff. A consent form and a Google form were given to all staff who volunteered for participating in the study. Each consented participant recruited into the investigation completed a questionnaire which covers details regarding demographics, exposure history, Residence & travel. Blood sample was collected and Anti SARS COV2 IgG antibody testing which targets the Spike Protein 1(SP1) was done using the VITROS chemiluminescence platform (Orthoclinical diagnostics, USA). Sampling & testing ranged over a time frame from September 5th to December 15th, 2020 Results: Jubilee Mission Medical College has 2785 working staff at the time of study. A total of 423 staff consented and their samples were tested. 37 staff members tested positive for COVID 19 antibody, yielding an overall prevalence of 8.75% (95% CI, 6.23 to 11.86). 86.5 % (32/37) of them were having a history of COVID-19 Antigen / RT PCR Positivity. We identified a statistically significant linear trend (p value =0.00001), between seropositivity and the degree of severity of COVID 19. Among the various factors which increase the risk of seroconversion, history of undergoing quarantine (p value < 0.001), contact with a confirmed case (p value = 0.002), contact with a caregiver for COVID 19 (p value =0.001) and history of Upper respiratory symptoms (p value =0.001), were found to be significantly associated with positive serology. Conclusions: The overall seropositivity in the current study was found to be 8.75% which is comparable to seroprevalence studies conducted in the United States and Wuhan in China. The pattern of seropositivity across the different category of health workers observed in the present study showed a higher prevalence among nurses. This result is also in agreement with a recent published report from united states. Various measures advised by the national and state health authorities were adequately adhered to. Keeping track of the pattern of development of immunity in the community is part of understanding the illness and forecasting the spread. For the tested HCW, it will boost up morale by ending uncertainty. For the hospital administration it will help in decision making about relative focusing of interventions on patients in general and HCWs. By knowing the immunity status of HCWs, the Institution will be able to contribute authentically to the development of intervention strategies and guidelines from time to time, besides following the available guidelines. Being an educational institution, it is obligatory to train all the elements of care delivery to the future generation of health care workers.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been one of the most widely tested drugs for SARS CoV2 on account of its antiviral properties. However the results so far have been far from categorical. The meta-analyses conducted till date are also lacking in precision and appropriateness. This systematic review and meta-analysis addresses the efficacy and safety of HCQ in SARS CoV2 by overcoming the limitations of earlier meta-analysis. METHODS: A total of 5 prominent medical databases were searched and fourteen studies (n = 12455) were included in the systematic review and meta-analyses. The data on survival, alleviation of symptoms, conversion of RT PCR positivity to negativity, use and efficacy in presence of co-morbidities (Hypertension, diabetes and heart disease) and cardiac and gastrointestinal side effects were extracted. Meta-analysis was applied to calculate the pooled estimates. Fixed-effects model results were chosen since I(2) was <25%.Meta-analysis was conducted using STATA version 13 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). RESULTS: The pooled estimates showed that HCQ treatment did not significantly affect survival at 14 and 28 days in COVID-19 patients with respect to the control population (RR: 1.003, 95% CI: 0.983C1.022), alleviation of symptoms at day 10 (RR: 1.044, 95% CI: 0.911 1.196), success in presence of co-morbidities (RR: 1.058, 95% CI: 1.035C1.082) and conversion from RT PCR positive to RT PCR negative on day 6 (RR:1.123, 95% CI: 1.041 1.212). There was higher risk for cardiac side effects (RR: 2.012, 95% CI: 1.428 2.833) and gastrointestinal side effects (RR: 1.318, 95% CI: 0.730 2.380) in HCQ recipients.

Though intended to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus, the lockdowns have had sweeping impacts on life in ways which were not originally planned. This study's purpose is to investigate the extent to which governmental responses to COVID-19 have impacted crime rates in the U.S. Compared to the pre-pandemic year of 2019, crime - as measured by calls for service to law enforcement - has decreased markedly. However, there are multiple indications that the crime drop is being driven by decreases in minor offenses which are typically committed in peer groups. At the same time, serious crimes which are generally not committed with co-offenders (namely homicide and intimate partner violence) have either remained constant or increased. As such, the crime drop appears to be hiding a very disturbing trend where homicides remain unchanged and intimate partner batteries are increasing. Since many offenders would presumably be committing less serious crimes in a non-pandemic world, we raise attention to the possibility that mandatory lockdown orders may have taken minor offenders and placed them into situations where there is rampant opportunity for intimate partner violence, serious batteries, and homicides. While crime in the U.S. appears to be down overall, this good news should not blind us to a troubling co-occurring reality - a reality that paints a dim picture of unintended consequences to public health and criminal justice finances as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns.","output":"Has COVID-19 Changed Crime?

METHODS : Convenience samples of oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 116 dogs, including 56 CIRDS-affected and 60 healthy dogs from various locations in New Zealand between March 2014 and February 2016. Pooled samples from CIRDS-affected (n=50) and from healthy (n=50) dogs were tested for the presence of canine respiratory viruses using next generation sequencing (NGS). Individual samples (n=116) were then tested by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and reverse transcriptase qPCR (RT-qPCR) for specific viruses. Groups were compared using Fisher's exact or 2 tests. The effect of explanatory variables (age, sex, type of household, presence of viral infection) on the response variable (CIRDS-affected or not) was tested using RR. RESULTS : Canine pneumovirus (CnPnV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), canine herpesvirus-1 (CHV-1), canine picornavirus and influenza C virus sequences were identified by NGS in the pooled sample from CIRDS-affected but not healthy dogs. At least one virus was detected by qPCR/RT-qPCR in 20/56 (36%) samples from CIRDS dogs and in 23/60 (38%) samples from healthy dogs (p=0.84). CIRDS-affected dogs were most commonly positive for CnPnV (14/56, 25%) followed by canine adenovirus-2 (CAdV-2, 5/56, 9%), canine parainfluenza virus (CpiV) and CHV-1 (2/56, 4% each), and CRCoV (1/56, 2%). Only CnPnV (17/60, 28%) and CAdV-2 (14/60, 23%) were identified in samples from healthy dogs, and CAdV-2 was more likely to be detected healthy than diseased dogs (RR 0.38; 95% CI=0.15-0.99; p= 0.045). CONCLUSIONS : The frequency of detection of viruses traditionally linked to CIRDS (CAdV-2 and CPiV) among diseased dogs was low. This suggests that other pathogens are likely to have contributed to development of CIRDS among sampled dogs. Our data represent the first detection of CnPnV in New Zealand, but the role of this virus in CIRDS remains unclear. On-going monitoring of canine respiratory pathogens by NGS would be beneficial, as it allows rapid detection of novel viruses that may be introduced to the New Zealand canine population in the future. Such monitoring could be done using pooled samples to minimise costs.

The exposure of cancer cells to hypoxic conditions, not only, increases exosomes biogenesis and secretion but also alters exosomes cargo. Under the hypoxic condition, different signaling pathways such as HIFs, Rab-GTPases, NF-B, and tetraspanin are involved in the exosomes biogenesis. Hypoxic tumor cells release exosomes that induce tumorigenesis through promoting metastasis, angiogenesis, and modulating immune responses. Exosomes from hypoxic tumor cells hold great potential for clinical application and cancer diagnosis. Besides, targeting the biogenesis of these exosomes may be a therapeutic opportunity for reducing tumorigenesis.

We examined whether the PPMP, complemented by the Gini index, could be useful for identifying cases of potential editorial bias, using all articles in a sample of 5,468 biomedical journals indexed in the National Library of Medicine.

Baicalein and genistein were chosen as model compounds to study the antiviral mechanism(s) of action for this series. Both flavonoids significantly reduced the levels of HCMV early and late proteins, as well as viral DNA synthesis. Baicalein reduced the levels of HCMV immediate-early proteins to nearly background levels while genistein did not. The antiviral effects of genistein, but not baicalein, were fully reversible in cell culture.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 156 patients treated for uveal melanoma between May 30, 2012, and March 16, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. Treatments consisted of either radioactive iodine 125 implant (RAI) or fractionated proton radiation (proton beam therapy [PBT]). Baseline characteristics were compared using a Wilcoxon rank sum test or (2) test. Outcomes were compared using Cox proportional hazards regression models or logistic regression models. RESULTS: The median length of follow-up after treatment was 2.7 years (range, 0.5 to 9.0 years). Patients who underwent treatment with RAI were older (median age, 67 vs 59 years; P<.001) and had a lower tumor classification (American Joint Commission on Cancer; P=.001) compared with those who underwent PBT. There was no significant difference between RAI and PBT in the outcomes of liver metastases, death, enucleation, tearing, vision loss, retinal detachment, tumor thickness, conjunctivitis, optic neuropathy, iris neovascularization, or neovascular glaucoma (all P>.05). Patients who underwent RAI treatment had significantly higher risk of diplopia (P<.001), cataract progression (P<.001), and maculopathy (P=.03) compared with those who received PBT. Patients who underwent RAI were at higher risk of eyelash loss (P=.006) compared with the PBT group. CONCLUSION: Treatment with PBT and RAI has similar efficacy; however, there are differences in the adverse outcomes associated with these 2 modalities.","output":"Treatment of Uveal Melanoma With Radioactive Iodine 125 Implant Compared With Proton Beam Radiotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Experimental animal models constitute a useful tool to deepen our knowledge of central nervous system disorders. In the case of multiple sclerosis, however, there is no such specific model able to provide an overview of the disease; multiple models covering the different pathophysiological features of the disease are therefore necessary. DEVELOPMENT: We reviewed the different in vitro and in vivo experimental models used in multiple sclerosis research. Concerning in vitro models, we analysed cell cultures and slice models. As for in vivo models, we examined such models of autoimmunity and inflammation as experimental allergic encephalitis in different animals and virus-induced demyelinating diseases. Furthermore, we analysed models of demyelination and remyelination, including chemical lesions caused by cuprizone, lysolecithin, and ethidium bromide; zebrafish; and transgenic models.

This study illustrates the use of direct preference elicitation methods to collect preference data from small samples in the context of early decision making to inform the development of a product for the treatment of immunoglobulin A nephropathy. METHOD: An interview-based swing weighting approach was used to elicit preferences from 40 patients in the US and China. Attributes were identified through a background review, expert engagement and patient focus groups. Participants completed a series of tasks that involved ranking, rating and scoring improvements in the attributes to obtain attribute swing weights and partial value functions. The preference results were then incorporated into a benefit-risk assessment simulation tool. RESULTS: Participants placed the greatest value on avoiding end-stage renal/kidney disease. Similar weight was given to short-term quality-of-life improvements and avoiding infections. Treatment burden (number of vaccinations) received the least weight. Heterogeneity in preferences was also observed. Consistency tests did not identify statistically significant variation in preferences, and qualitative data suggested that the elicitation exercise was sensitive to participants interpretation of attributes and that participants were able to express their preferences. CONCLUSION: Direct preference elicitation methods can be used to collect preference data from small samples. Further work should continue to test the validity of the estimate generated by such methods.

With the aim of evaluating clinical practice in specialized respiratory units, a Delphi consensus document was implemented on the use of single-inhaler fixed-dose triple therapies after 1 year of use in Spain. Methods: A scientific committee of COPD experts defined a thematic index, guided a systematic literature review and helped design the Delphi questionnaire. This was sent to the other 45 COPD experts between April and June 2019. Agreement/disagreement on 58 statements was tested in two rounds using a Likert scale. Replies were classified as a consensus when &#8805;80% of the panelists agreed; a majority when a degree of agreement of &#8805;66% was reached; and divergence if agreement was <66%. Results: After two rounds, 44.44% of the statements reached consensus, 14.81% reached majority and 40.74% were divergent. Panelists agreed that escalating from double bronchodilation should be phenotype-based and aim to prevent exacerbations but not for improving symptoms. The addition of an antimuscarinic to inhaled corticosteroids combinations achieves improvement in lung function, symptoms and exacerbation prevention. Main safety concerns included the increased risk of pneumonia as compared to bronchodilator therapies, with similar cardiovascular effects. There was no consensus agreement on patient type response based on blood eosinophil counts or obstruction severity.

We measured circulating antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), ACE2 displacement and viral neutralization activities one month following the first and second COVID-19 vaccine doses, and again 3 months following the second dose, in 100 adult PLWH and 152 controls. All PLWH were receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy, with median CD4+ T-cell counts of 710 (IQR 525C935) cells/mm(3), though nadir CD4+ T-cell counts ranged as low as <10 cells/mm(3). After adjustment for sociodemographic, health and vaccine-related variables, HIV infection was associated with lower anti-RBD antibody concentrations and ACE2 displacement activity after one vaccine dose. Following two doses however, HIV was not significantly associated with the magnitude of any humoral response after multivariable adjustment. Rather, older age, a higher burden of chronic health conditions, and dual ChAdOx1 vaccination were associated with lower responses after two vaccine doses. No significant correlation was observed between recent or nadir CD4+ T-cell counts and responses to two vaccine doses in PLWH. These results indicate that PLWH with well-controlled viral loads and CD4+ T-cell counts in a healthy range generally mount strong initial humoral responses to dual COVID-19 vaccination. Factors including age, co-morbidities, vaccine brand, response durability and the rise of new SARS-CoV-2 variants will influence when PLWH will benefit from additional doses.

However, information is lacking on symptoms that persist after recovery from COVID-19. In this study we assessed symptoms that persisted in patients even after their recovery and discharged from the hospital after one month from COVID-19. Methods: This study is an observational cohort study. Participants in this study were enrolled between 30 to 40 days after recovery from COVID-19 of the age 18 years or higher, who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RT-PCR COVID-19 disease. Outcomes from post COVID-19 participants were elicited through questionnaire that consisted of three main parts beginning from subjects demographical data, depicting about the status of COVID-19 and other co-morbidities of the subject, and about post-COVID-19 symptoms and manifestations. Results: All subjects have reported some manifestation after recovery from COVID-19 whereas numerous symptoms and diseases were experienced by a great percentage of participants. Fatigue (56.25%), dyspnea (74.3%) and disturbed sleep (64.3%) were among the most common symptoms. However, more critical manifestations like renal failure and pulmonary fibrosis were reported by only a few percent of the subjects. Rating of worse physical and mental health after post-COVID recovery was also reported by subjects. There was a strong relationship found in between the presence of other co-morbidities before infection like diabetes, hypertension and in disease severity after infection. A total of 280 patients were enrolled and 160 completed the survey. Conclusions: Post COVID-19 sufferers often experience symptoms that cause a disturbance in their physical health, mental health and their respiratory status for several weeks even after recovery from COVID-19.

METHODS: This community-based longitudinal prospective cohort study used the data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS, baseline in 2014 and a follow-up in 2018). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Social participation was assessed using a composite index by considering the frequency for the two types of social activity: organized social activities and informal activities. Pearson's (2) test was used to correlate the characteristics of participants with social participation or depressive symptoms. Log-binomial regression models were used to assess the association between social participation and the risk of depressive symptoms. RESULTS: The incidence of depressive symptoms was 28.8% among 2,200 participants in 2018 after a 4-year follow-up. Participants with no social participation (32.6%), organized social activities (30.6%), or informal social activities (31.2%) were more likely to have depressive symptoms. After the adjustment of demographic factors, socioeconomic status, lifestyle habits, and health status, in comparison with older people who often engaged in social participation, organized social activities, and informal social activities, the risk of depressive symptoms was 45% [adjusted risk ratio (aRR): 1.45, 95% CI: 1.16C1.82], 42% (aRR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.02C2.00), and 29% (aRR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.02C1.99) higher among older people with no social participation and who never engaged in organized social activities and informal social activities, respectively.

We will focus on the potential roles of camel markets, camel shows, importation, transportation and grazing in the amplification and shedding of the virus, providing some novel concepts for the control approaches for the MERS-CoV.","output":"Some One Health based control strategies for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The ability to predict epitopes plays an enormous role in vaccine development in terms of our ability to zero in on where to do a more thorough in-vivo analysis of the protein in question. Though for the past decade there have been numerous advancements and improvements in epitope prediction, on average the best benchmark prediction accuracies are still only around 60%. New machine learning algorithms have arisen within the domain of deep learning, text mining, and convolutional networks. This paper presents a novel analytically trained and string kernel using deep neural network, which is tailored for continuous epitope prediction, called: Deep Ridge Regressed Epitope Predictor (DRREP). RESULTS: DRREP was tested on long protein sequences from the following datasets: SARS, Pellequer, HIV, AntiJen, and SEQ194. DRREP was compared to numerous state of the art epitope predictors, including the most recently published predictors called LBtope and DMNLBE. Using area under ROC curve (AUC), DRREP achieved a performance improvement over the best performing predictors on SARS (13.7%), HIV (8.9%), Pellequer (1.5%), and SEQ194 (3.1%), with its performance being matched only on the AntiJen dataset, by the LBtope predictor, where both DRREP and LBtope achieved an AUC of 0.702. CONCLUSION: DRREP is an analytically trained deep neural network, thus capable of learning in a single step through regression. By combining the features of deep learning, string kernels, and convolutional networks, the system is able to perform residue-by-residue prediction of continues epitopes with higher accuracy than the current state of the art predictors.","output":"DRREP: deep ridge regressed epitope predictor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the public life in most European countries stopped almost completely due to measures against the spread of the virus. Efforts to limit the number of new infections are threatened by the advent of new variants of the SARS-COV-2 virus, most prominent the B.1.1.7 strain with higher infectivity. In this article we consider a basic two-strain SIR model to explain the spread of those variants in Germany on small time scales. For a linearized version of the model we calculate relevant variables like the time of minimal infections or the dynamics of the share of variants analytically. These analytical approximations and numerical simulations are in a good agreement to data reported by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Germany.","output":"A two-strain SARS-COV-2 model for Germany -- Evidence from a Linearization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we propose a broad conceptual model that incorporates social capital dimensions and problem-solving routines to understand the determinants behind hotel managements perception of and ability to cope with the COVID-19 pandemicand thus, to innovate their service offering.

Especially in high prevalence areas of COVID C 19, it is crucial to implement an effective vaccination strategy. In Italy, programming an efficient COVID-19 mass vaccination campaign has been the main target of the Ministry of Health. AIMS: This paper gives a comprehensive overview of how the mass vaccination campaign is performed in Milan, one of the cities that has been mostly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. We analyze the vaccination strategy implemented by Fondazione Ca Granda C Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico located in Milan. Furthermore, we compare the organization of this campaign in regards of those carried out across EU and UK. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data derive from an analysis of the different vaccination plans implemented across EU and UK from the 27/12/2020 to the 15/06/2020. In addition, we discuss the data collected from the internal data server of IRCCS Fondazione Ca Granda C Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico from the 15/02/2021 to the 15/06/2021.The collected data are examined by means of descriptive statistics. RESULTS: From the analysis of the internal data server, we observe that the modular organization of Fiera Milano City guarantees up to 5000 vaccinations/day. Moreover, the precise flow organization of users and a series of strategies adopted to avoid identification errors or vaccine type administration errors are crucial to reach the aforementioned target. CONCLUSIONS: The institution of mass vaccination centers thanks to the optimization of all the involved processes and the meticulous organization of these structures, allows to avoid crowds and guarantees the administration of elevated amounts of vaccines. All these elements assure a rapid vaccination coverage of the population in Lombardy, with a meaningful increase in daily administration doses.","output":"Italys rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations: the crucial contribution of the first experimental mass vaccination site in Lombardy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundRates of depression have increased worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. One known protective factor for depression is social support, but more work is needed to quantify the extent to which social support could reduce depression risk during a global crisis, and specifically to identify which types of support are most helpful, and who might benefit most. MethodsData were obtained from participants in the All of Us Research Program who responded to the COVID-19 Participant Experience (COPE) survey administered monthly from May 2020 to July 2020 (N=69,066, 66% female). Social support was assessed using 10 items measuring emotional/informational support (e.g., someone to confide in or talk to about yourself or your problems), positive social interaction support (e.g., someone to do things with to help you get your mind off things), and tangible support (e.g., someone to help with daily chores if sick). Elevated depression symptoms were defined based on having a moderate-to-severe ([]10) score on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to test associations across time between overall social support and its subtypes with depression, adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors. We then assessed interactions between social support and potential effect modifiers: age, sex, pre-pandemic mood disorder, and pandemic-related stressors (e.g., financial insecurity). ResultsApproximately 16% of the sample experienced elevated depressive symptoms. Overall social support was associated with significantly reduced odds of depression (adjusted odds ratio, aOR [95% CI]=0.44 [0.42-0.45]). Among subtypes, emotional/informational support (aOR=0.42 [0.41-0.43]) and positive social interactions (aOR=0.43 [0.41-0.44]) showed the largest protective associations with depression, followed by tangible support (aOR=0.63 [0.61-0.65]). Sex, age, and pandemic-related financial stressors were statistically significant modifiers of the association between social support and depression. ConclusionsIndividuals reporting higher levels of social support were at reduced risk of depression during the early COVID-19 pandemic. The perceived availability of emotional support and positive social interactions, more so than tangible support, was key. Individuals more vulnerable to depression (e.g., women, younger individuals, and those experiencing financial stressors) may particularly benefit from enhanced social support, supporting a precision prevention approach.","output":"Effects of social support on depression risk during the COVID-19 pandemic: What support types and for whom?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which impairs the functionality of several organs, represents a major threat to human health One of the hardest challenges in the fight against COVID-19 is the development of wide-scale, effective, and rapid laboratory tests to control disease severity, progression, and possible sudden worsening Monitoring patients in real-time is highly demanded in this pandemic era when physicians need reliable and quantitative tools to prioritize patients access to intensive care departments In this regard, salivary biomarkers are extremely promising, as they allow for the fast and non-invasive collection of specimens and can be repeated multiple times Methods: We compare salivary levels of immunoglobulin A subclasses (IgA1 and IgA2) and free light chains (kFLC and FLC) in a cohort of 29 SARS-CoV-2 patients and 21 healthy subjects Results: We found that each biomarker differs significantly between the two groups, with p-values ranging from 10?8 to 10?4 A Receiving Operator Curve analysis shows that FLC level is the best-suited candidate to discriminate the two groups (AUC = 0 96), with an accuracy of 0 94 (0 87C1 00 95% CI), a precision of 0 91 (0 81C1 00 95% CI), a sensitivity of 1 00 (0 96C1 00 95% CI), and a specificity of 0 86 (0 70C1 00 95% CI) Conclusion: These results suggest FLC as an ideal indicator of patient conditions This hypothesis is strengthened by the consideration that the FLC half-life (approximately 6 h) is significantly shorter than the IgA one (21 days), thus confirming the potential of FLC for effectively monitoring patients fluctuation in real-time","output":"Salivary Biomarkers in COVID-19 Patients: Towards a Wide-Scale Test for Monitoring Disease Activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Japans historically low immigration rate and monolingual culture makes it a particularly interesting setting for clarifying non-national medical care. Our study objective was to examine disease patterns and outcome differences between Japanese and non-Japanese patients in a rapidly globalizing nation. METHODS: A secondary data analysis of 325 non-Japanese and 13,370 Japanese patients requiring tertiary care or intensive-care unit or high-care unit admission to the emergency department at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University medical hospital from 2010 through 2019 was conducted. Multivariable linear and logistic regressions models were applied to examine differences in percentage of diagnosis, mortality rates, and length of stay, stratified by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores to consider the impact of language barriers. Sex and age were adjusted. RESULTS: Non-Japanese patients had more anaphylaxis, burns, and infectious disease, but less cardiovascular diagnoses prior to adjustment.

COVID-19 causes lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and hypoxia. There is a paucity of data on bacterial and fungal coinfection rates in patients with COVID-19 at low and middle income countries (LMICs). Our objective is to describe the clinical characteristics of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in the Dominican Republic (DR) METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 from March 14th to December 31st 2020, at a 296-bed tertiary care level and teaching Hospital in the Dominican Republic. Demographic and clinical information was collected and tabulated. Laboratory confirmed bacterial and fungal infections were defined as community acquired infections (CAI) if diagnosed within 48 hours of admission and hospital acquired infections (HAI) when beyond 48 hours. Microbiologic data was tabulated by source and attribution. RESULTS: Our cohort had 382 COVID-19 patients. Median age was 64 and most were male (64.3%) and 119 (31.1%) were mechanically ventilated and 200 (52%) had central venous catheters. A total of 28 (7%) laboratory confirmed community acquired infections and 55 (14%) HAIs occurred. Community acquired infections included 13 (46%) bloodstream infections (BSIs), 11 (39%) urinary tract infections (UTI) and 6 (21%) LRTIs. HAIs included 39 (70%) BSIs, 11 (20%) UTIs and 6 (11%) ventilator associated pneumonias (VAP). Causal organisms of community and hospital acquired BSI and UTI are in Figure 1 and Figure 2 respecively. All-cause mortality was 35.3% (135/382) in our cohort, and 100% mortality (76) in those with coinfections. Figure 1.

Community acquired and hospital acquired urinary tract infections in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Community and hospital acquired infections were common and in the ICU and likely contributed to patient outcomes. More than two thirds of HAIs in the ICU were BSIs. Central venous catheter device utlization and maintenance may play a role in BSIs, along with immunosuppression from COVID-19 therapeutics and translocation from mucosal barrier injury.

Three commonly proposed mechanisms for the origins of viruses are: Viruses descended from primitive precellular life forms; viruses are escaped cellular genetic elements; viruses devolved from more complex intracellular parasites. None of these theories easily explains the origins of all viruses and it is widely accepted that all viruses did not share a single common ancestor. Instead, distinct lineages of viruses probably evolved by different mechanism. There is also good evidence that viruses have shaped the evolution of their hosts, for at least hundreds of millions of years. While some virologists consider the ancient origins of viruses, others examine the forces that drive virus evolution today. Examples of ongoing virus evolution include: Cross-species jumps; decreased or increased virulence; emergence of drug resistance; escape from immune responses at the level of individuals and populations. Virus evolution is the outcome of two independent events. The first is genome mutation and the second is selection. Viruses with RNA genomes tend to have high mutation rates, but some appear to be evolutionarily stable nonetheless. Viruses have distinct phenotypes. For examples, some influenza viruses are highly virulent but others are much less so; influenza viruses also differ tremendously in their ability to be transmitted. Modern studies of virus genetics seek to correlate diverse phenotypes with specific genes and sequences. The ability to do reverse genetics is key to understanding viral genes. Reverse genetics involves cloning viral genomes, designing specific mutation, and introducing the mutated genomes back into cells to produce infectious particles whose phenotypes can then be measured.","output":"Chapter 8 Virus Evolution and Genetics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are grateful for the comments and the interesting additional novel data presented by von Meijenfeldt et al [1].

Monocytes/macrophages are considered key immune cells in infections and downregulation of the surface expression of monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR (mHLA-DR) within the major histocompatibility complex class II reflects a state of immunosuppression, also referred to as injury-associated immunosuppression. As the role of immunosuppression in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently unclear, we seek to explore the level of mHLA-DR expression in COVID-19 patients. METHODS In a preliminary prospective monocentric observational study, 16 COVID-19-positive patients (75% male, median age: 68 [interquartile range 59-75]) requiring hospitalization were included. The median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II (APACHE-II) score in 9 intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute respiratory failure was 30 (interquartile range 25-32). Standardized quantitative assessment of HLA-DR on monocytes (cluster of differentiation 14+ cells) was performed using calibrated flow cytometry at baseline (ICU/hospital admission) and at days 3 and 5 after ICU admission. Baseline data were compared to hospitalized noncritically ill COVID-19 patients. RESULTS While normal mHLA-DR expression was observed in all hospitalized noncritically ill patients (n = 7), 89% (8 of 9) critically ill patients with COVID-19-induced acute respiratory failure showed signs of downregulation of mHLA-DR at ICU admission. mHLA-DR expression at admission was significantly lower in critically ill patients (median, [quartiles]: 9280 antibodies/cell [6114, 16,567]) as compared to the noncritically ill patients (30,900 antibodies/cell [26,777, 52,251]), with a median difference of 21,508 antibodies/cell (95% confidence interval [CI], 14,118-42,971), P = .002. Reduced mHLA-DR expression was observed to persist until day 5 after ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS When compared to noncritically ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients, ICU patients with severe COVID-19 disease showed reduced mHLA-DR expression on circulating CD14+ monocytes at ICU admission, indicating a dysfunctional immune response. This immunosuppressive (monocytic) phenotype remained unchanged over the ensuing days after ICU admission. Strategies aiming for immunomodulation in this population of critically ill patients should be guided by an immune-monitoring program in an effort to determine who might benefit best from a given immunological intervention.","output":"Reduced Monocytic Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR Expression Indicates Immunosuppression in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sektor Pariwisata merupakan sektor yang membangun dan meningkatkan ekonomi masyarakat Bali.

In hospital settings, both medical staff and patients are required to wear PPE. As these facilities resume regular operations, staff will be required to wear PPE at all times while additional PPE will be mandated during medical procedures. This will put increased pressure on hospitals which have had problems predicting PPE usage and sourcing its supply. To meet this challenge, we propose an approach to predict demand for PPE. Specifically, we model the admission of patients to a medical department using multiple independent [Formula: see text] queues. Each queue represents a class of patients with similar treatment plans and hospital length-of-stay. By estimating the total workload of each class, we derive closed-form estimates for the expected amount of PPE required over a specified time horizon using current PPE guidelines. We apply our approach to a data set of 22,039 patients admitted to the general internal medicine department at St. Michaels hospital in Toronto, Canada from April 2010 to November 2019.

We also find that while demand for gloves is driven entirely by patient-practitioner interactions, 86% of the predicted demand for surgical masks can be attributed to the requirement that medical practitioners will need to wear them when not interacting with patients.","output":"Prediction of personal protective equipment use in hospitals during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyze whether and to what extent strategies employed by governments to fight the COVID-19 pandemic made a difference for GDP growth developments in 2020.

METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 20 critically ill COVID-19 patients at Innsbruck Medical University Hospital whose coagulation function was tested with ClotPro? and compared with that of 60 healthy individuals at Augsburg University Clinic. ClotPro is a viscoelastic whole blood coagulation testing device. It includes the TPA test, which uses tissue factor (TF)-activated whole blood with added recombinant tissue-derived plasminogen activator (r-tPA) to induce fibrinolysis. For this purpose, the lysis time (LT) is measured as the time from when maximum clot firmness (MCF) is reached until MCF falls by 50%. We compared COVID-19 patients with prolonged LT in the TPA test and those with normal LT. RESULTS: Critically ill COVID-19 patients showed hypercoagulability in ClotPro assays. MCF was higher in the EX test (TF-activated assay), IN test (ellagic acid-activated assay), and FIB test (functional fibrinogen assay) with decreased maximum lysis (ML) in the EX test (hypofibrinolysis) and highly prolonged TPA test LT (decreased fibrinolytic response), as compared with healthy persons. COVID-19 patients with decreased fibrinolytic response showed higher fibrinogen levels, higher thrombocyte count, higher C-reactive protein levels, and decreased ML in the EX test and IN test. CONCLUSION: Critically ill COVID-19 patients have impaired fibrinolysis.

This data is updated every day and is available for most countries from multiple sources. In this work we present a two step procedure for model fitting to Covid-19 data. In the first step, time dependent transmission coefficients are constructed directly from the data and, in the second step, measures of those (minimum, maximum, mean, median etc.,) are used to set priors for fitting models to data. We call this approach a \\"data driven approach\\" or \\"data first approach\\". This scheme is complementary to Bayesian approach and can be used with or without that for parameter estimation. We use the procedure to fit a set of SIR and SIRD models, with time dependent contact rate, to Covid-19 data for a set of 45 most affected countries. We find that SIR and SIRD models with constant transmission coefficients cannot fit Covid-19 data for most countries (mainly because social distancing, lockdown etc., make those time dependent). We find that any time dependent contact rate, which falls gradually with time, can help to fit SIR and SIRD models for most of the countries. We also present constraints on transmission coefficients and basic reproduction number R0~ as well as effective reproduction number R(t). The main contributions of our work are as follows.

Their action mechanism does not depend on the presence of protein receptors, but on their ability to target and disrupt the membranes of a wide range of pathogenic and pathologic cells which are recognized by their specific compositions, typically with a relatively high concentration of anionic lipids. Lipid profile singularities have been found in cancer, inflammation, bacteria, viral infections, and even in senescent cells, enabling the possibility to use them as therapeutic targets and/or diagnostic biomarkers. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are extraordinarily well suited to explore how HDPs interact with membrane models, providing a large amount of qualitative and quantitative information that, nowadays, cannot be assessed by wet-lab methods at the same level of temporal and spatial resolution. Here, we present SuPepMem, an open-access repository containing MD simulations of different natural and artificial peptides with potential membrane lysis activity, interacting with membrane models of healthy mammal, bacteria, viruses, cancer or senescent cells. In addition to a description of the HDPs and the target systems, SuPepMem provides both the input files necessary to run the simulations and also the results of some selected analyses, including structural and MD-based quantitative descriptors. These descriptors are expected to be useful to train machine learning algorithms that could contribute to design new therapeutic peptides. Tools for comparative analysis between different HDPs and model membranes, as well as to restrict the queries to structural and time-averaged properties are also available. SuPepMem is a living project, that will continuously grow with more simulations including peptides of different sequences, MD simulations with different number of peptide units, more membrane models and also several resolution levels.

Here, we used time series approaches to separate the direct contribution of SARS-CoV-2 infections on mortality from the indirect consequences of pandemic interventions and behavior changes in the United States. We estimated deaths occurring in excess of seasonal baselines stratified by state, age, week and cause (all causes, COVID-19 and respiratory diseases, Alzheimers disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, heart disease, and external causes, including suicides, opioids, accidents) from March 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021. Our estimates of COVID-19 excess deaths were highly correlated with SARS-CoV-2 serology, lending support to our approach. Over the study period, we estimate an excess of 666,000 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 556000, 774000) all-cause deaths, of which 90% could be attributed to the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 78% were reflected in official COVID-19 statistics. Mortality from all disease conditions rose during the pandemic, except for cancer. The largest direct impacts of the pandemic were seen in mortality from diabetes, Alzheimers, and heart diseases, and in age groups over 65 years. In contrast, the largest indirect consequences of the pandemic were seen in deaths from external causes, which increased by 45,300 (95% CI 30,800, 59,500) and were statistically linked to the intensity of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Within this category, increases were most pronounced in mortality from accidents and injuries, drug overdoses, and assaults and homicides, while the rate of death from suicides remained stable. Younger age groups suffered the brunt of these indirect effects. Overall, on a national scale, the largest consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are attributable to the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infections; yet, the secondary impacts dominate among younger age groups, in periods of stricter interventions, and in mortality from external causes.

MethodsWe conducted a phase 2/3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with JHQG in mild, nonhospitalized, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 5g/sacket of JHQG or placebo granules orally thrice daily for 10 days. The primary outcomes were the improvement in clinical symptoms and proportion tested negative on viral PCR after treatment. Secondary outcomes were the time to recovery from clinical symptoms and changes in white blood cells (WBC) and acute phase reactants (C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin) 10-15 days after treatment. ResultsA total of 300 patients were randomly assigned to receive JHQG (150 patients) and placebo (150 patients). Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, JHQG showed greater clinical efficacy (82.67%) after 10 days of treatment compared with the placebo group (10.74%) (rate difference: 71.93%; 95% CI 64.09 - 79.76). The proportion of patients with a negative PCR after treatment were comparable (rate difference: -4.67%; 95% CI -15.76 - 6.42). While all changes in WBC, ferritin, and CRP levels showed a statistically significant decline in JHQG (P[]0.044) after treatment, but not the latter in placebo (P=0.077). The median time to recovery of COVID-19 related symptoms including cough, sputum, sore throat, dyspnea, headache, nasal obstruction, fatigue, and myalgia were shorter in the JHQG group compared to the placebo group (P<0.001 for all). 3 patients experienced mild to moderate adverse events during the treatment period in the JHQG group.

METHODS: Electronic medical records were used to identify adult COVID-19 patients who received NmAbs [bamlanivimab (BAM) or casirivimab and imdevimab (REGN-COV2)] and historic COVID-19 controls. Post-index hospitalization rates were compared. RESULTS: 707 confirmed COVID-19 patients received NmAb and 1709 historic COVID-19 controls were included; 553 (78%) received BAM, 154 (22%) received REGN-COV2. Patients receiving NmAb infusion had significantly lower hospitalization rate (5.8% vs. 11.4%, p<0.0001); a shorter length of stay if hospitalized (mean 5.2 days vs. 7.4 days, p=0.02), and fewer ED visits within 30 days post-index (8.1% vs 12.3%, p=0.003) than controls.

CONCLUSION: We observed a linear rate of seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2Cpositive status among asymptomatic HCWs who underwent daily symptom surveys and temperature screens in an environment with universal source control. Rapid antibody testing may be useful for screening for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in high-risk populations, such as HCWs in the ED.","output":"Provider Antibody Serology Study of Virus in the Emergency Room (PASSOVER) Study: Special Population COVID-19 Seroprevalence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Infectious disease predictions models, including virtually all epidemiological models describing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, are rarely evaluated empirically. The aim of the present study was to investigate the predictive accuracy of a prognostic model for forecasting the development of the cumulative number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases in countries and administrative regions worldwide until the end of May 2020. METHODS: The cumulative number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases was forecasted in 251 regions with a horizon of two weeks, one month, and two months using a hierarchical logistic model at the end of March 2020. Forecasts were compared to actual observations by using a series of evaluation metrics. RESULTS: On average, predictive accuracy was very high in nearly all regions at the two weeks forecast, high in most regions at the one month forecast, and notable in the majority of the regions at the two months forecast. Higher accuracy was associated with the availability of more data for estimation and with a more pronounced cumulative case growth from the first case to the date of estimation. In some strongly affected regions, cumulative case counts were considerably underestimated. CONCLUSIONS: With keeping its limitations in mind, the investigated model may be used for the preparation and distribution of resources during the initial phase of epidemics. Future research should primarily address the model's assumptions and its scope of applicability. In addition, establishing a relationship with known mechanisms and traditional epidemiological models of disease transmission would be desirable.","output":"Predictive accuracy of a hierarchical logistic model of cumulative SARS-CoV-2 case growth until May 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abiotic stresses, including drought and salinity, negatively affect plant development and physiology at molecular and metabolic levels. Sucrose transport, mediating distribution of photosynthates in plant, is a key physiological process impacted by drought and salinity stresses, as sucrose is a prime energy and signaling molecule as well as an osmolyte. Therefore, understanding the effects of abiotic stresses on sucrose transport and transporters, and underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms, is imperative to maintain sugar homeostasis in plants under stress. Here, we investigated the effects of drought and salinity stresses on sucrose transport and distribution, and on expression levels of genes encoding Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters (SWEETs), along with a potential transcription factor regulating SWEET expression in rice. We observed that drought and salinity stresses increased the sucrose content in leaf and root tissues and in phloem sap of rice indica varieties. Expression analyses of SWEET genes and histochemical analysis of ?-glucuronidase-reporter transgenic plants suggested that OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 are major SWEET transporters regulating the sucrose transport and levels in response to the abiotic stresses. Transactivation analyses showed that an abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 directly binds to the promoters of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 and activates their expression. Taken together, the results showed that the higher expressions of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 genes, induced by binding of an ABA-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 to the promoters, potentially modulate sucrose transport and distribution in response to the abiotic stresses. The mechanism could possibly be targeted for maintaining sugar homeostasis in rice under drought and salinity stresses.","output":"Sucrose transport in response to drought and salt stress involves ABA-mediated induction of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 in rice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The impact of coronavirus disease-19 on the management of multiple myeloma (MM) has been recognized.

After many years of political and social debates, in December 2017 the first advance directive and care planning legislation was approved in Italy. Nevertheless, citizens awareness of these issues is scarce as well as the integration of the advance care planning process into clinical routine. The latest data reported to the Italian Parliament by the Ministry of Health indicated that advance directives have been completed by 62030 people, approximately 1.1% of Italian adult population. However, during the last months, the COVID-19 pandemic solicited taking steps towards promoting an advance care planning culture. Indeed, the need of proposing ACP to patients have been recently stressed both by medical associations and national and local institutional documents. METHOD: Since November 2020, our nephrology unit adopted a protocol approved by Ethical committee by Physician Order of Florence, aimed to conduct ACP interventions with dialysis patients. Firstly, all patients were informed about the possibility to taking part in one or more advance care planning conversations with their nephrologist. Secondly, a semi-structured guide to the conversation was created in order to support physicians in conducting the ACP intervention. Finally, patients along with nephrologist and their relatives, could documented their preferences for future treatments and care. RESULTS: From November to March only one patient asked to receive an ACP intervention. However, since COVID-19 spread in Italy last March, the number of patients who demanded ACP raised up. In the period from April to July, 15 out of 110 hemodialysis patients treated in our center asked for an ACP intervention and filled-in an advance directive. Specifically, no patients required an immediate discontinuation of dialysis, nevertheless 80% of them stated that would not like to continue with dialysis in case he/she was no longer able to self-determine (e.g. permanent loss of capacity to communicate with others). All patients except one have appointed a personal representative (usually their partner). In the eventuality of cardiac arrest, 60% of patients asked for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Finally, all patients expressed the wish to spend the last days of life at home. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic raised up the number of dialysis patients who required to taking part in a advance care planning intervention. In this sense, the pandemic can be an opportunity for consolidate advance care planning in Italy as well as in other countries, where these interventions are not well known by people and not yet regularly offered in the clinical routine. Using a semi-structured interview for the ACP interview can help the nephrologist to discuss future care and end-of-life topics with their patients.","output":"MO200 COVID-19 PANDEMIC INCREASED ADVANCE CARE PLANNING DEMAND"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance The recent and ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has taken an unprecedented toll on adults critically ill with COVID-19 infection. While there is evidence that the burden of COVID-19 infection in hospitalized children is lesser than in their adult counterparts, to date, there are only limited reports describing COVID-19 in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Objective To provide an early description and characterization of COVID-19 infection in North American PICUs, focusing on mode of presentation, presence of comorbidities, severity of disease, therapeutic interventions, clinical trajectory, and early outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study included children positive for COVID-19 admitted to 46 North American PICUs between March 14 and April 3, 2020. with follow-up to April 10, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Prehospital characteristics, clinical trajectory, and hospital outcomes of children admitted to PICUs with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Results Of the 48 children with COVID-19 admitted to participating PICUs, 25 (52%) were male, and the median (range) age was 13 (4.2-16.6) years. Forty patients (83%) had significant preexisting comorbidities; 35 (73%) presented with respiratory symptoms and 18 (38%) required invasive ventilation. Eleven patients (23%) had failure of 2 or more organ systems. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was required for 1 patient (2%). Targeted therapies were used in 28 patients (61%), with hydroxychloroquine being the most commonly used agent either alone (11 patients) or in combination (10 patients). At the completion of the follow-up period, 2 patients (4%) had died and 15 (31%) were still hospitalized, with 3 still requiring ventilatory support and 1 receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The median (range) PICU and hospital lengths of stay for those who had been discharged were 5 (3-9) days and 7 (4-13) days, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance This early report describes the burden of COVID-19 infection in North American PICUs and confirms that severe illness in children is significant but far less frequent than in adults. Prehospital comorbidities appear to be an important factor in children. These preliminary observations provide an important platform for larger and more extensive studies of children with COVID-19 infection.","output":"Characteristics and Outcomes of Children With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection Admitted to US and Canadian Pediatric Intensive Care Units."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: / objectives: The cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There are evidences of involvement of immune system in pathogenesis of this disease. We investigated the presence of various vasculitis-associated auto-antibodies and complement levels in a series of patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to our hospital. Methods: : Forty patients with severe or critical type of COVID 19 were evaluated for symptoms, signs and laboratory tests of vasculitis syndromes including rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti dsDNA, c and p anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (c ANCA and p ANCA) and complement levels. Descriptive statistics methods were used to describe the clinical / laboratory findings. Results: : Forty patients with severe to critical illness were enrolled in the study. The mean age of the patients was 48.5  9.8 years. All patients had pulmonary involvement in lung CT scan. Lymphopenia in 19 (47.5%), raised creatinine in 8(20%) and hyperbilirubinemia in 19(47.5%) of patients were seen. Vasculitis laboratory test results included: RF in 2 patients, ANA in 3 patients and ANCA in one patient. 17(42.5%) of patients had hypocomplementemia in one or more complement tests. Of the four patients who were expired, three had a decrease in complement. Conclusion: In 17 of patients (42.5%) we detected low complement levels. A decrease in complement levels may predict a critical state of the disease.

Significant progress has been made in recent years to improve quality, promote patient safety, and increase value and cost-effectiveness in surgical care. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) initiatives are increasing in popularity, improving outcomes, and enriching patient satisfaction. First developed for abdominal surgical cases, ERAS has increasingly established itself across all surgical subspecialities, including cardiac surgery. ERAS focuses on evidence-based initiatives in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of care to promote patient well-being and efficient care. The deliberate, judicious incorporation of technology into surgery and the periprocedural home has tremendous, revolutionary potential in all phases of care and is consistent with ERAS principles. This technology can be harnessed by physicians and the care provider team, the healthcare system, and perhaps most importantly, by patients themselves to lead to a higher level of engagement. We will explore technology's transformational capability by concentrating on cardiac surgery because of its prevalence, costs, risks, and contribution to the healthcare system's bottom line. In addition, the role that ERAS combined with technology can play in a constructive manner will be important. We discuss the disruptive effect that the COVID-19 pandemic offers to accelerate these developments. While the human cost of the pandemic has been staggering, in the post-COVID world, the lessons learned can be vital. Finally, we seek to show that the opportunities technology provides are closely related to what both patients and the physician and provider teams want. As technology inevitably becomes more integrated into healthcare, the ability to harness technology to maximize patient outcomes and well-being while promoting more efficient healthcare delivery will be critical. ?

We designed this study to examine ambulatory outpatient visit patterns and outcomes between March 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020 (pre-pandemic) and from March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021 (pandemic). MethodsWe conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of all 3.8 million adults in the Canadian province of Alberta, which has a single payer healthcare system, using linked administrative data. We examined all outpatient physician encounters (virtual or in-person) and outcomes (emergency department visits, hospitalizations, or deaths) in the next 30- and 90-days. ResultsAlthough in-person outpatient visits declined by 38.9% in the year after March 1, 2020 (10,142,184 vs. 16,592,599), the increase in virtual visits (7,152,147; 41.4% of total) meant that total outpatient encounters increased by 4.1% in the first year of the pandemic. Outpatient care and prescribing patterns remained stable for adults with ambulatory-care sensitive conditions (ACSC): 97.2% saw a primary care physician (median 6 visits), 59.0% had at least one specialist visit, and 98.5% were prescribed medications (median 9) in the year prior to the pandemic compared to 96.6% (median 3 in-person and 2 virtual visits), 62.6%, and 98.6% (median 8 medications) during the first year of the pandemic. In the first year of the pandemic, virtual outpatient visits were associated with less subsequent healthcare encounters than in-person ambulatory visits, particularly for patients with ACSC (9.2% vs. 10.4%, aOR 0.89 [95% confidence interval 0.87-0.92] at 30 days and 26.9% vs. 29.3%, aOR 0.93 [0.92-0.95] at 90 days). ConclusionsThe shifts in outpatient care patterns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic did not disrupt prescribing or follow-up for patients with ACSC and did not worsen post-visit outcomes. FundingNone RegistrationNone KEY MESSAGESO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSThere have been rapid shifts in outpatient care models during the COVID-19 pandemic but outcomes are uncertain. What this study addsTotal outpatient encounters increased by 4% in the first year of the pandemic due to a rapid increase in virtual visits (which made up 41% of all outpatient encounters). Prescribing patterns and frequency of follow-up were similar in the first year after onset of the pandemic in adults with ambulatory-care sensitive conditions. Compared to in-person visits, virtual outpatient visits were associated with less subsequent healthcare encounters, particularly for patients with ambulatory-care sensitive conditions (11% less at 30 days and 7% less at 90 days). How this study might affect research, practice or policyOur data provides reassurance that the shifts in outpatient care patterns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic did not negatively impact follow-up, prescribing, or outcomes for patients with ACSC. Further research is needed to define which patients and which conditions are most suitable for virtual outpatient visits and, as with all outpatient care, the optimal frequency of such visits.","output":"Changes in outpatient care patterns and subsequent outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective cohort analysis from a single payer healthcare system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A few months ago, we claimed that COVID-19 had the potential to be a catalyst for change and innovation (Mention et al , 2020) Undeniably, this has indeed eventuated, but to a scale that was unforeseeable and unpredictable to many Over the last few months, the world has literally changed Around the world, people and communities have seen their lives put on a standstill, experiencing and experimenting with variable levels of restrictions preventing social interactions We have learned what physical C rather than social, at least initially C distancing meant and have uncovered new ways of doing things And that applied to almost for every single aspect of life ( )","output":"The Era of Digital Enablement: A Blessing or a Curse?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Evidence on the relationship between socioeconomic position (SEP) and infections with SARS-CoV-2 is still limited as most of the available studies are ecological in nature.

METHODS: The CORONA-MONITORING bundesweit (RKI-SOEP) study is a seroepidemiological survey among a dynamic cohort of the German adult population (n=15 122; October 2020CFebruary 2021). Dried blood samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and oral-nasal swabs for viral RNA. SEP was measured by education and income. Robust logistic regression was used to examine adjusted associations of SARS-CoV-2 infections with SEP. RESULTS: 288 participants were seropositive, PCR positive or self-reported a previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The adjusted odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 1.87-fold (95% CI 1.06 to 3.29) higher among low-educated than highly educated adults.

The oral bioavailability of these agents has been limited due to rapid degradation by cytidine deaminase (CDA) in the gut and liver, hence requiring intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injections daily for 5-7 days every month (m). This parenteral administration requirement adds significant burden to older cancer patients due to daily time commitment and travel to treatment centers. It also increases exposure to and infection risk with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Oral decitabine 35 mg/cedazuridine 100 mg (ASTX727) is an oral fixed dose combination drug of decitabine and the CDA inhibitor cedazuridine that have shown 99% (90% CI 93% to 106%) equivalent exposure to standard dose IV decitabine 20 mg/m2 in a randomized cross-over study (Garcia-Manero et al, ASH 2019). Here, we present the clinical efficacy and safety results of oral decitabine/cedazuridine from 133 patient study in MDS and CMML (ASTX727-02 ASCERTAIN study). Methods: We used a randomized cross over design where patients were randomized in the first 2 cycles 1:1 to either Sequence A: decitabine 35 mg/ cedazuridine 100 mg in Cycle 1 followed by IV decitabine at 20 mg/m2 in Cycle 2, or Sequence B: IV decitabine in Cycle 1 followed by oral decitabine/cedazuridine in Cycle 2 to do an intra-patient comparison of decitabine PK (primary PK endpoint: decitabine AUC equivalence over 5 days of dosing). Cycles were repeated every 28 days. All patients received oral decitabine/cedazuridine in all subsequent cycles from Cycle 3 onwards until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients were eligible as per the FDA-approved label of IV decitabine (MDS patients by FAB classification including CMML, or MDS IPSS Intermediate-1, 2 or high-risk patients). Clinical endpoints were best response as assessed by an independent expert panel according to International Working Group (IWG) 2006 response criteria, transfusion independence for at least 8 or 16 consecutive weeks, overall survival, and safety. Adverse events (AEs) were graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.03. Results: 138 subjects were randomized, of whom 133 were treated on study. The median age was 71.0 years (range 44-88), 65% were male, 88% MDS and 12% CMML, 43% were either red blood cells (RBCs) or platelets transfusion-dependent at baseline, 25% had poor-risk cytogenetics, and 42% had baseline bone marrow blasts >5%. At the data cutoff for the response analysis, the median duration of follow up was 12.6 m (range 9.3 to 20.5 m) with median number of treatment cycles of 8 (range 1 to 18). Of the 133 treated patients the best response was complete response (CR) in 28 patients (21%; 95% CI 15-29%), marrow (m)CR with hematological improvement (HI) in 20 patients (15%), mCR without HI in 23 patients (17.3%), and HI in 10 patients (7.5%) for an overall objective response (CR+mCR+HI) in 81 patients (61%; 95% CI 52-69%). Median duration of CR was 7.5 m (range 1.6 to 17.5 m), and median time to CR was 4.3 m (range 2.1 to 15.2 m). Of the 133 treated patients 27 (20%) went on to receive allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. Of the 57 patients who were either RBCs or platelets transfusion-dependent at baseline, 30 (53%) became transfusion independent for both RBCs and platelets for at least 8 consecutive weeks, and 19 (33%) were both RBCs and platelets transfusion independent for at least 16 consecutive weeks. Median survival has not been reached. Most common Treatment-Emergent AEs of Grade 3 regardless of causality were neutropenia in 51.5%, thrombocytopenia in 50%, anemia in 40%, febrile neutropenia in 26%, leukopenia in 21%, pneumonia in 12%, and sepsis in 7% of patients treated with oral decitabine/cedazuridine (excluding the IV decitabine cycle). Summary/Conclusions: Efficacy and safety from oral decitabine 35 mg/ cedazuridine 100 mg daily for 5 days every 28 days are consistent with clinical data from standard IV decitabine 20 mg/m2 daily for 5 days. Oral decitabine/cedazuridine is the only oral HMA with systemic exposure equivalent to its injectable drug. Further investigation of oral decitabine/cedazuridine in all-oral combination studies is warranted and underway.

Four hospital centers in Northern Italy conducted an observational retrospective cohort study during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. Four hundred and fifty-six patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to medical or sub-intensive wards were enrolled. Clinical, laboratory, and respiratory parameters, for the calculation of different indices, were measured at hospital admission. In medical wards (Verona and Padua) the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, ROX index and SatO2/FiO2 ratio were able to predict intubation or death with good accuracy (AUROC for the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, ROX index and SatO2/FiO2 ratio of 75%, 75% and 74%, respectively). Regarding sub-intensive wards (Milan and Mantua), none of the three respiratory function indices was significantly associated with the composite outcome. In patients admitted to medical wards for COVID-19 pneumonia, the ROX index and the SatO2/FiO2 ratio demonstrated not only good performance in predicting intubation or death, but their accuracy was comparable to that of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio. In this setting, where repeated arterial blood gas tests are not always feasible, they could be considered a reliable alternative to the invasive PaO2/FiO2 ratio.

Expansion of this model to other states is currently being considered; therefore, it is important to evaluate whether Marylands all-payer model is achieving the desired goals among surgical patients, who are an at-risk population for most potentially preventable complications. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between the implementation of Marylands all-payer model and the incidence of avoidable complications and resource use among adult surgical patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study used hospital discharge records from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project state inpatient databases to conduct a difference-in-differences analysis comparing the incidence of avoidable complications and the intensity of health resource use before and after implementation of the all-payer model in Maryland. The analytical sample included 2 983 411 adult patients who received coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), carotid endarterectomy (CEA), spinal fusion, hip or knee arthroplasty, hysterectomy, or cesarean delivery between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2016, at acute care hospitals in Maryland (intervention state) and New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island (control states). Data analysis was conducted from July 2019 to July 2021. EXPOSURES: All-payer model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Complications (infectious, cardiovascular, respiratory, kidney, coagulation, and wound) and health resource use (ie, hospital charges). RESULTS: Of 2 983 411 total patients in the analytical sample, 525 262 patients were from Maryland and 2 458 149 were from control states. Across Maryland and the control states, there were statistically significant but not clinically relevant differences in the preintervention period with regard to patient age (mean [SD], 49.7 [19.0] years vs 48.9 [19.3] years, respectively; P < .001), sex (22.7% male vs 21.4% male; P < .001), and race (0.3% vs 0.4% American Indian, 2.8% vs 4.5% Asian or Pacific Islander, 25.9% vs 12.7% Black, 4.7% vs 11.9% Hispanic, and 63.5% vs 63.4% White; P < .001). After implementation of the all-payer model in Maryland, significantly lower rates of avoidable complications were found among patients who underwent CABG (?11.3%; 95% CI, ?13.8% to ?8.7%; P < .001), CEA (?1.6%; 95% CI, ?2.9% to ?0.3%; P = .02), hip arthroplasty (?0.8%; 95% CI, ?1.0% to ?0.5%; P < .001), knee arthroplasty (?0.4%; 95% CI, ?0.7% to ?0.1%; P = .01), and cesarean delivery (?1.0%; 95% CI, ?1.3% to ?0.7%; P < .001). In addition, there were significantly lower increases in index hospital costs in Maryland among patients who underwent CABG (?$6236; 95% CI, ?$7320 to ?$5151; P < .001), CEA (?$730; 95% CI, ?$1367 to ?$94; P = .03), spinal fusion (?$3253; 95% CI, ?$3879 to ?$2627; P < .001), hip arthroplasty (?$328; 95% CI, ?$634 to ?$21; P = .04), knee arthroplasty (?$415; 95% CI, ?$643 to ?$187; P < .001), cesarean delivery (?$300; 95% CI, ?$380 to ?$220; P < .001), and hysterectomy (?$745; 95% CI, ?$974 to ?$517; P < .001). Significant changes in patient mix consistent with a younger population (eg, a shift toward private/commercial insurance for orthopedic procedures, such as spinal fusion [4.3%; 95% CI, 3.4%-5.2%; P < .001] and knee arthroplasty [1.6%; 95% CI, 1.0%-2.3%; P < .001]) and a lower comorbidity burden across surgical procedures (eg, CABG: ?0.7% [95% CI, ?0.1% to ?0.5%; P < .001]; hip arthroplasty: ?3.0% [95% CI, ?3.6% to ?2.3%; P < .001]) were also observed.

Little is known about the relationship between EV-D68 virus and host cells. In this study, we assessed the effect of the host cell cycle on EV-D68 viral production, as well as the ability of EV-D68 to manipulate host cell cycle progression. The results suggest that synchronization in G0/G1 phase, but not S phase, promotes viral production, while synchronization in G2/M inhibits viral production. Both an early EV-D68 isolate and currently circulating strains of EV-D68 can manipulate the host cell cycle to arrest cells in the G0/G1 phase, thus providing favorable conditions for virus production. Cell cycle regulation by EV-D68 was associated with corresponding effects on the expression of cyclins and CDKs, which were observed at the level of the protein and/or mRNA. Furthermore, the viral non-structural protein 3D of EV-D68 prevents progression from G0/G1 to S. Interestingly, another member of the Picornaviridae family, EV-A71, differs from EV-D68 in that G0/G1 synchronization inhibits, rather than promotes, EV-A71 viral replication. However, these viruses are similar in that G2/M synchronization inhibits the production and activity of both viruses, which is suggestive of a common therapeutic target for both types of enterovirus.

These attacks are mediated by excessive bradykinin production, as a result of uncontrolled activation of the plasma kallikrein/kinin system, which is caused by a C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency or dysfunction in HAE types 1 and 2, respectively. For many years, treatment options were limited to therapies with substantial adverse effects, insufficient efficacy, or difficult routes of administration. Increased insights in the pathophysiology of HAE have paved the way for the development of new therapies with fewer side effects. In the last two decades, several targeted novel therapeutic strategies for HAE have been developed, for both long-term prophylaxis and on demand treatment of acute attacks. This article reviews the advances in the development of more effective and convenient treatment options for HAE and their anticipated effects on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. The emergence of these improved treatment options will presumably change current HAE guidelines, but adherence to these recommendations may become restricted by high treatment costs. It will therefore be essential to determine the indications and identify the patients that will benefit most from these newest treatment generations. Ultimately, current preclinical research into gene therapies may eventually lead the way towards curative treatment options for HAE.

Age 61-70 years (p<0.001; OR: 7.69; 95%CI: 2.93 to 20.14), age 71-80 years (p<0.001; OR: 14.99; 95%CI: 5.88 to 38.22), age >80 years (p<0.001; OR: 36.78; 95%CI: 14.42 to 93.85), male gender (p<0.001; OR: 1.84; 95%CI: 1.31 to 2.58), D-dimer levels >2 ULN (p = 0.003; OR: 1.79; 95%CI: 1.22 to 2.62), and prolonged PT (p<0.001; OR: 2.18; 95%CI: 1.49 to 3.18) were independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality. A predictive model performed with these parameters showed an AUC of 0.81 in the development cohort (n = 1270) [sensitivity of 95.83%, specificity of 41.46%, negative predictive value of 98.01%, and positive predictive value of 24.85%]. These results were then validated in an independent data sample (n = 800). Our predictive model of in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients has been developed, calibrated and validated. The model (MRS-COVID) included age, male gender, and on-admission coagulopathy markers as positively correlated factors with fatal outcome.","output":"Development and validation of a predictive model of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The best evidence-enhanced recovery care pathway is yet to be defined for patients undergoing spinal surgery. Minimally invasive surgery, multimodal analgesia, early mobilization, and early postoperative nutrition have been considered as critical components of enhanced recovery in spinal surgery (ERSS). The objective of this study will be to synthesize the evidence underpinning individual components of a proposed multidisciplinary enhanced recovery pathway for patients undergoing spinal surgery. METHODS This is the study protocol for a systematic review of complex interventions. Our team identified 22 individual care components of a proposed pathway based on clinical practice guidelines and published reviews. We will include systematic reviews and meta-analysis, randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and observational studies in adults or pediatric patients evaluating any one of the pre-determined care components. Our primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality, morbidity outcomes (e.g., pulmonary, cardiac, renal, surgical complications), patient-reported outcomes and experiences (e.g., pain, quality of care experience), and health services outcomes (e.g., length of stay and costs). We will search the following databases (1990 onwards) MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CENTRAL). Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. Potential conflicts will be resolved through discussion. The risk of bias for individual studies will be appraised using appropriate tools. A narrative synthesis will be provided with the information presented in the text and tables to summarize and explain the characteristics and findings of the included studies. Due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity, we do not anticipate to conduct meta-analyses. Confidence in cumulative evidence for each component of care will be classified according to the GRADE system. DISCUSSION This systematic review will identify, evaluate, and integrate the evidence underpinning individual components of a pathway for patients undergoing spinal surgery. The formation of an evidence-based pathway will allow for the standardization of clinical care delivery within the context of enhanced recovery in spinal surgery.

Acute myocardial injury is common in this population and is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. The focus of this review centers on the recent applications of multimodality imaging in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19-related cardiovascular conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to standard cardiac imaging techniques such as transthoracic echocardiography, other modalities including computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging have emerged as useful adjuncts in select patients with COVID-19 infection, particularly those with suspected ischemic and nonischemic myocardial injury. Data have also emerged suggesting lasting COVID-19 subclinical cardiac effects, which may have long-term prognostic implications. With the spectrum of COVID-19 cardiovascular manifestations observed thus far, it is important for clinicians to recognize the role, strengths, and limitations of multimodality imaging techniques in this patient population.","output":"Multimodality Imaging for Cardiac Evaluation in Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We highlight the need for planning for mass workforce absentees as we prepare for subsequent surges.

HK is common in older pts with cardiorenal comorbidities and often leads to increased Healthcare Resource Utilization (HRU). Here we aim to describe electrolyte-related HRU in Veterans with HK who initiated PAT or discontinued RAAS inhibitor (RAASi DC) therapy and were not receiving a KB (1/1/2016?8/30/2018). Methods: Using retrospective, observational data, pts utilizing the hospital or ED during the 6 months (mos) prior to the index date were assessed at 1, 3, and 6 mos post-index. The index date was the date of PAT initiation or the date of RAASi DC in pts not receiving a KB (RAASi DC/no KB). All pts had a baseline serum K+ 5.1mEq/L and HF, DM, or non-dialysis CKD. Pts with continuous exposure (CE) to PAT and those who did not restart RAASi were analyzed. Results: 288 and 26,543 pts were included in the PAT and RAASi DC/no KB groups, respectively. Following CE to PAT at 1, 3, and 6 mos post-index, no electrolyte related ED or hospital utilization was observed. In the RAASi DC group, 2-5% of pts reutilized the ED or hospital within 6 mos (Figure). Conclusion: Of the pts who experienced an electrolyte-related hospitalization or ED visit within the 6 mos prior to PAT dispensing, no pts reutilized these services in the following 6 mos.

Since in reality cross-community connections always survive, we can wonder how efficient is the excitation (illness) propagation through the entire clustered network which has some density of inter-cluster connections. Crucial difference between SI- and FC-networks is as follows: SI-networks are\\"adaptively grown\\"under condition of maximization of small cliques in the entire network, while FC-networks are\\"instantly created\\"by \\\\emph{ad hoc} imposed borders.

There has been a worrying increase of the number of babies that are removed shortly after birth due to care proceedings in England. The removal of a newborn baby from its parents often occurs while the mother is still recovering in hospital and is a deeply distressing, intrusive and emotionally impactful event, both for parents as well as for midwives involved in their care. Although the number of removals of newborn has risen, increasing support for those involved has not followed the same pace. These women are particularly vulnerable after the removal of a child but there is a lack of evidence and guidance to improve the experiences and the perinatal outcomes of these mothers and their infants. At a healthcare professional level, the impact of care proceedings and removals at birth on the midwifery workforce cannot be underestimated and has been described as one of the most challenging aspects of contemporary midwifery practice. In order to improve the care and outcomes of this under-researched and often stigmatized group of mothers, midwives need to have access to adequate training and supervision.

We adopted an ecologically valid approach to collect 10 experience sampling events within the same day to examine how college students regulated their emotions on a typical weekday during the pandemic and the simultaneous hedonic association of these strategies on their affective experience. Several emotion regulation strategies (including acceptance, calming, reappraisal, problem solving, and social sharing) were associated with increased positivity or reduced negativity that may be better for psychological health. In contrast, other emotion regulation strategies (including rumination, experiential avoidance, catastrophizing, lack of clarity, self-blaming, and other-blaming) were associated with increased negativity or reduced positivity that may worsen psychological health. In these findings, self-reported stress was a crucial contextual moderator to consider while understanding the relationship between emotion regulation strategies and experienced affect. The current study documents variability in affect in response to stressors experienced by college students even within a single day and provides a real-world perspective on the emotion regulation strategies that were adaptive and maladaptive in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"A day in the life of a college student during the COVID-19 pandemic: An experience sampling approach to emotion regulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mycoplasma pneumonia of swine (MPS) lung lesions and immunogenic properties were compared between a Landrace line that was genetically selected for reduced incidence of pulmonary MPS lesions, and a non\\\\selected Landrace line.

PPE effectiveness is often undermined by inappropriate doffing methods. Our knowledge of how HCWs approach doffing PPE in practice is limited. In this qualitative study, we examine HCWs perspectives about doffing PPE. METHODS: Thirty participants at a Midwestern academic hospital were recruited and assigned to 1 of 3 doffing simulation scenarios: 3 mask designs (n = 10), 2 gown designs (n = 10), or 2 glove designs (n = 10). Participants were instructed to doff PPE as they would in routine practice. Their performances were video-recorded and reviewed with participants. Semistructured interviews about their doffing approaches were conducted and audio-recorded, then transcribed and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Three overarching themes were identified in interviews: doffing strategies, cognitive processes, and barriers and facilitators. Doffing strategies included doffing safely (minimizing self-contamination) and doffing expediently (eg, ripping PPE off). Cognitive processes during doffing largely pertained to tracking contaminated PPE surfaces, examining PPE design cues (eg, straps), or improvising based on prior experience from training or similar PPE designs. Doffing barriers and facilitators typically related to PPE design, such as PPE fit (or lack of it) and fastener type. Some participants also described personal barriers (eg, glasses, long hair); however, some PPE designs helped mitigate these barriers.

Methods Study design was to international requirements including European Pharmacopoeia, Ph. Eur., v9.0 04/2013:0450, 2013. I-2 Working Seed (WS) was compared with five-times-passaged I-2 WS (5XP WS) in intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI), F (o) cleavage site sequencing and Safety tests. Results The first passage series used a 50% brain: 50% tracheal tissue challenge homogenate and was unsuccessful as I-2 was not detected after the fourth passage. A second passage series used 10% brain: 90% tracheal tissue homogenates. I-2 was isolated from tracheal tissue in each passage. However harvested titres were below the minimum challenge level (10 (7) EID (50)) specified for the ICPI and Safety tests, possibly reflecting I-2s inherently low pathogenicity (interestingly caecal tonsils yielded significant titres). Given this the WS and 5XP WS comparisons proceeded. ICPI values were 0.104 and 0.073 for the WS group and the 5XP WS group respectively confirming that I-2, whether passaged or not, expressed low pathogenicity. F (0 )amino-acid sequences for both WS and 5XP WS were identified as (112)R-K-Q-G-R--L-I-G (119) and so compatible with those of avirulent ND viruses. In safety, no abnormal clinical signs were observed in both groups except for two chicks in the 5XP WS group, where one bird was withdrawn due to a vent prolapse, and another bird died with inconclusive necropsy results. Conclusions: These data, the issue of low passage titres with little or no virus isolation from brain tissues and the genomic copy approach suggest a need to amend Ph. Eur. v9.0 04/2013:0450, 2013 for naturally attenuated, low pathogenicity vaccine viruses such as I-2.

In the traffic4cast competition, the task of short-term traffic prediction is tackled in unprecedented detail, with traffic volume and speed information available at 5 minute intervals and high spatial resolution.

Non-pharmacological approaches (e.g., listening to music, watching television, doing arts and crafts) are now considered as a first-line strategy to manage responsive behaviors in clinical practice due to the potential risks associated with the antipsychotic medications. To date, no evaluations of immersive non-head mounted virtual reality (VR) experience as a non-pharmacologic approach for people with advanced dementia living in nursing homes have been reported. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility (acceptance and safety) of VR experience. METHODS: A single site case series (nonrandomized and unblinded) with a convenience sample (Na=a24; agea=a85.88.6 years; Cognitive Performance Scale scorea=a3.40.6) measuring depression and agitation before and after the intervention. The intervention was a 30-min long research coordinator- facilitated VR experience for two weeks (10 sessions). RESULTS: The intervention was feasible (attrition ratea=a0% ; adverse eventsa=a0). A reduction in depression and in agitation was observed after the intervention. However, we suggest extreme caution in interpreting this result considering the study design and small sample size. CONCLUSION: This study provides the basis for conducting a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of VR experience on responsive behaviors in nursing homes.

The 2 groups were comparable except for median baseline NIHSS (16 local anesthesia versus 18 GA; P<0.0001). The GA group was less likely to achieve a good outcome (adjusted relative risk, 0.68; confidence interval, 0.52-0.90; P=0.0056) and had increased in-hospital mortality (adjusted relative risk, 2.84; confidence interval, 1.65-4.91; P=0.0002). Those with medically indicated GA had worse outcomes (adjusted relative risk, 0.49; confidence interval, 0.30-0.81; P=0.005) and increased mortality (relative risk, 3.93; confidence interval, 2.18-7.10; P<0.0001) with a trend for higher mortality with routine GA. There was no significant difference in the adjusted risks of subarachnoid hemorrhage (P=0.32) or symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (P=0.37). CONCLUSIONS GA was associated with worse neurological outcomes and increased mortality in the EVT arm; this was primarily true among patients with medical indications for GA. Relative risk estimates, though not statistically significant, suggest reduced risk for subarachnoid hemorrhage and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage under local anesthesia. Although the reasons for these associations are not clear, these data support the use of local anesthesia when possible during EVT. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) CT images of 87 patients (50 males, 37 females; median age, 63 years) with COVID-19 confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction were analyzed. The maximum subsegmental vascular diameter was measured on CT. Total CT lung volume (CTLV total) and lesion extent (ratio of lesion volume to CTLV total) of ground-glass opacities, reticulation, and consolidation were measured using software. Maximum pulmonary vascular diameter and lesion extent were analyzed using Spearman's correlation analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed on CT results to predict disease severity. We also assessed changes in these measures on follow-up scans in 16 patients. RESULTS: All 23 patients with severe and critical illness had vascular enlargement (> 4 mm). Pulmonary vascular enlargement (odds ratio 3.05, p = 0.018) and CT lesion extent (odds ratio 1.07, p = 0.002) were independent predictors of disease severity after adjustment for age and comorbidities. On follow-up CT, vascular diameter and CT lesion volume decreased (p = 0.001, p = 0.002; respectively), but CTLV total did not change significantly.

METHODS: The superficial (SF) and deep macular VD of 50 patients with SARS CoV2 pneumonia who had positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and who recovered after receiving treatment and 55 healthy age- and gender-matched controls were compared using OCTA. Blood inflammation parameters were also recorded. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of age and gender (p = 0.147 and p = 0.504, respectively). Nor was there a difference with respect to smokers between the two groups (p = 0.231). In COVID-19 patients, the VDs in superior hemi quadrant, superior quadrant and inferior quadrant, were significantly lower (p = 0.033, p = 0.029 and p = 0.042, respectively) in superficial plexus. It was also significantly lower in parafovea, superior hemi and superior quadrants (p = 0.026, p < 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively) in deep plexus.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This clinical retrospective study included 103 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. All patient data were obtained from the patient files and anesthesia follow-up forms. Demographic datas, intraoperative fluids, blood products requirement and blood gas parameters were recorded. RESULTS: A total 15 of 103 patients data were lack, the remaining 88 patients were evaluated. Combination of crystalloid and colloid was used for intravenous fluid management. About 11% of patients required transfusion during surgery. The mean pH and pO2 values of the patients were observed to decrease whereas pCO2 and lactate values increased. DISCUSSION: Radical Prostatectomy can be performed either using open technique as a traditional approach or laparoscopic or robot-assisted technique as a minimally invasive approach. Today, minimally invasive approaches have replaced traditional open prostatectomy. Anaesthesia management of these minimally invasive techniques is very different and challenging from open technique in many aspects. CONCLUSION: Although minimally invasive techniques have good surgical outcomes such as less blood loss, smaller surgical incision, and shorter hospitalization, these techniques bring new problems that anesthesiologists have to deal with. Increased RARP operations has led to the anesthesiologists more likely to encounter perioperative problems.

Teachers frequently face the challenge of first having to understand such bugs, and then suggest ways to fix them. In order to enable teachers to do so effectively and efficiently, it is desirable to support them in recognising and fixing bugs. Misconceptions often lead to recurring patterns of similar bugs, enabling automated tools to provide this support in terms of hints on occurrences of common bug patterns. In this paper, we investigate to what extent the hints improve the effectiveness and efficiency of teachers in debugging learners' programs using a cohort of 163 primary school teachers in training, tasked to correct buggy Scratch programs, with and without hints on bug patterns. Our experiment suggests that automatically generated hints can reduce the effort of finding and fixing bugs from 8.66 to 5.24 minutes, while increasing the effectiveness by 34% more correct solutions. While this improvement is convincing, arguably teachers in training might first need to learn debugging\\"the hard way\\"to not miss the opportunity to learn by relying on tools. We therefore investigate whether the use of hints during training affects their ability to recognise and fix bugs without hints. Our experiment provides no significant evidence that either learning to debug with hints or learning to debug\\"the hard way\\"leads to better learning effects.

For several of these pathogens, neither antivirals nor vaccines are currently available. In addition to this unmet medical need, flaviviruses are of particular interest since they constitute an excellent model for the study of spatiotemporal regulation of RNA metabolism. Indeed, with no DNA intermediate or nuclear step, the flaviviral life cycle entirely relies on the cytoplasmic fate of a single RNA species, namely the genomic viral RNA (vRNA) which contains all the genetic information necessary for optimal viral replication. From a single open reading frame, the vRNA encodes a polyprotein which is processed to generate the mature viral proteins. In addition to coding for the viral polyprotein, the vRNA serves as a template for RNA synthesis and is also selectively packaged into newly assembled viral particles. Notably, vRNA translation, replication and encapsidation must be tightly coordinated in time and space via a fine-tuned equilibrium as these processes cannot occur simultaneously and hence, are mutually exclusive. As such, these dynamic processes involve several vRNA secondary and tertiary structures as well as RNA modifications. Finally, the vRNA can be detected as a foreign molecule by cytosolic sensors which trigger upon activation antiviral signaling pathways and the production of antiviral factors such as interferons and interferon-stimulated genes. However, to create an environment favorable to infection, flaviviruses have evolved mechanisms to dampen these antiviral processes, notably through the production of a specific vRNA degradation product termed subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA). In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the fates of flavivirus vRNA and how this is regulated at the molecular level to achieve an optimal replication within infected cells.","output":"The Multiples Fates of the Flavivirus RNA Genome During Pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Continual learning, also known as lifelong learning, is an emerging research topic that has been attracting increasing interest in the field of machine learning. With human activity recognition (HAR) playing a key role in enabling numerous real-world applications, an essential step towards the long-term deployment of such recognition systems is to extend the activity model to dynamically adapt to changes in people's everyday behavior. Current research in continual learning applied to HAR domain is still under-explored with researchers exploring existing methods developed for computer vision in HAR. Moreover, analysis has so far focused on task-incremental or class-incremental learning paradigms where task boundaries are known. This impedes the applicability of such methods for real-world systems since data is presented in a randomly streaming fashion. To push this field forward, we build on recent advances in the area of continual machine learning and design a lifelong adaptive learning framework using Prototypical Networks, LAPNet-HAR, that processes sensor-based data streams in a task-free data-incremental fashion and mitigates catastrophic forgetting using experience replay and continual prototype adaptation. Online learning is further facilitated using contrastive loss to enforce inter-class separation. LAPNet-HAR is evaluated on 5 publicly available activity datasets in terms of the framework's ability to acquire new information while preserving previous knowledge.

We summarised the published data on NNV against herpes zoster to inform vaccination policies. METHODS We systematically identified studies based on a priori established and registered methods. The main outcomes were the NNV against herpes zoster infection, hospitalisation and mortality. Where appropriate, we conducted meta-analyses using inverse variance, random-effects models, pooling estimated NNV with associated 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical heterogeneity between pooled estimates was calculated using the I2 statistic. RESULTS Out of 229 unique citations, we included eight nonrandomized studies. Among 50+ year-olds, the NNV against herpes zoster infection using the recombinant subunit vaccine was 11 (95%CI 8-14; I2 = 0%; 3 studies) and variable (I2 = 94.4%; 7 studies) using live attenuated vaccine, ranging from 10 (95%CI 1-19) to 58 (95%CI 49-67). Among 65+ year-olds, the NNV against herpes zoster infection using the recombinant subunit vaccine was 12 (95%CI: 9-15; I2 = 0%; 2 studies) and variable (I2 = 98.5%; 4 studies) using live attenuated vaccine, ranging from 14 (95%CI 5-23) to 75 (95%CI 66-84). The NNV against herpes zoster hospitalisation among 65+ year-olds using the live attenuated vaccine was 280 (95%CI 209-352; I2 = 0%; 2 studies). There was a paucity of data to inform other meta-analyses. CONCLUSION Evidence on the NNV against herpes zoster is scarce. Vaccination with the recombinant subunit herpes zoster vaccine may be more effective than with the live attenuated vaccine in preventing infection among 50+ year-olds.

We evaluated the mental health impact of COVID-19 related surgical delay on patients awaiting procedures for benign, pre-malignant and malignant conditions. We sought to understand the short term impact of surgical delay and to identify potential longer term mental health affects after completion of the delayed procedure. Methods: All patients over age 18 awaiting surgery for benign, pre-malignant or malignant conditions in the gynecologic oncology, surgical oncology and colorectal services at Northwell Health were eligible. Upon enrollment, participants completed a baseline survey consisting of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7), the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), and Brief-Illness Patient Questionnaire (B-IPQ). Six weeks after their surgery, participants were sent a second survey consisting of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale in addition to the GAD-7, PSWQ, and B-IPQ. Results: 56 patients underwent their procedure and completed the follow-up survey. Patients with suspected benign conditions had a longer delay in scheduling their surgery than patients with suspected/confirmed cancer or pre-malignant conditions (101.4d vs 66.3d, p<0.05). There was no correlation of length of delay with postoperative worry, anxiety, or depression scores. There was no decrease in level of worry, as delineated by the PSWQ, among gynecologic oncology patients when comparing pre-operative to post-operative data. However, surgical oncology and colorectal patients demonstrated decreased post-operative worry. There was no difference in anxiety by surgical specialty.While the surgical delay was ongoing 79% of patients considered it to be moderately to extremely concerning, with 46% indicating the highest possible level of concern. Post-operatively, 47% of the respondents indicated moderate to extreme concern about the surgical delay, while 37% were not concerned. Initially, the surgical delay was considered to have a moderate to severe impact upon daily life by 65% of patients; which decreased to 53% at the time of post-operative follow-up. Interestingly, these relative decreases in patient concern were not significant when comparing pre-operative to post-operative values as a whole, by diagnosis or by specialty. 20% of participants qualified as depressed based on their response to the CES-D. Of these patients, 70% had a post-operatively confirmed cancer or pre-cancer. The incidence of depression was not affected by the post-operative diagnosis. Conclusions: Many patients experienced distress surrounding surgical delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This extended to their postoperative period. Gynecologic oncology patients did not experience decreased post-operative worry, while surgical oncology and colorectal patients did.

Coronary artery disease is now also characterized by chronic inflammation' notable for the buildup of atherosclerotic plaques containing immune cells in various states of activation and differentiation. Understanding how these immune cells contribute to disease progression may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. METHODS: We used single-cell technology and in vitro assays to interrogate the immune microenvironment of human coronary atherosclerotic plaque at different stages of maturity. RESULTS: In addition to macrophages, we found a high proportion of ? T cells in the coronary plaques. Most of these T cells lack high expression of CCR7 and L-selectin, indicating that they are primarily antigen-experienced memory cells. Notably, nearly one-third of these cells express the HLA-DRA surface marker, signifying activation through their TCRs (T-cell receptors). Consistent with this, TCR repertoire analysis confirmed the presence of activated ? T cells (CD4<CD8), exhibiting clonal expansion of specific TCRs. Interestingly, we found that these plaque T cells had TCRs specific for influenza, coronavirus, and other viral epitopes, which share sequence homologies to proteins found on smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, suggesting potential autoimmune-mediated T-cell activation in the absence of active infection. To better understand the potential function of these activated plaque T cells, we then interrogated their transcriptome at the single-cell level. Of the 3 T-cell phenotypic clusters with the highest expression of the activation marker HLA-DRA, 2 clusters expressed a proinflammatory and cytolytic signature characteristic of CD8 cells, while the other expressed AREG (amphiregulin), which promotes smooth muscle cell proliferation and fibrosis, and, thus, contributes to plaque progression. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings demonstrate that plaque T cells are clonally expanded potentially by antigen engagement, are potentially reactive to self-epitopes, and may interact with smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the plaque microenvironment.","output":"Human Coronary Plaque T Cells Are Clonal and Cross-React to Virus and Self"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Actions of chemokines and the interaction with specific receptors go beyond their original, defined role of recruiting leukocytes to inflamed tissues.

The analysis was based on information obtained from public sources and scientific publications and included the characteristics of the health care and cancer control prior to the pandemic, the COVID-19 pandemic and measures implemented by the governments of the region, and the regional impact of the pandemic on cancer control together with the costs of cancer care and possible impact of the pandemic on cancer expense. We compared 2019 and 2020 data corresponding to the period March 16-June 30 and found a significant reduction in the number of first-time visits to oncology services (variable depending on the country between C28% and C38%) and a corresponding reduction in pathology (between C6% and C50%), cancer surgery (between C28% and C70%), and chemotherapy (between C2% and C54%). Furthermore, a significant reduction in cancer screening tests was found (PAP smear test studies: between C46% and C100%, mammography: between C32% and C100%, and fecal occult blood test: C73%). If this situation becomes a trend, the health and economic impact will be compounded in the postpandemic period, with an overload of demand on health services to ensure diagnostic tests and consequent treatments. On the basis of this information, a set of prevention and mitigation measures to be immediately implemented and also actions to progressively strengthen health systems are proposed.","output":"Social Distancing and Economic Crisis During COVID-19 Pandemic Reduced Cancer Control in Latin America and Will Result in Increased Late-Stage Diagnoses and Expense"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reviews and categorises early policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, based on a dataset of 496 measures taken by 54 countries between January 1 and April 28 and collected by the OECD from government officials and additional sources.

Cas13a and Cas12a enzymes bound to CRISPR RNA (crRNA) recognize specific nucleic acid targets, initiating cleavage of the targets as well as non-target (trans) nucleic acids. Here, we examine the kinetics of single-turnover target and multi-turnover trans-nuclease activities of both enzymes. High-turnover, non-specific Cas13a trans-RNase activity is coupled to rapid binding of target RNA. By contrast, low-turnover Cas12a trans-nuclease activity is coupled to relatively slow cleavage of target DNA, selective for DNA over RNA, indifferent to base identity, and preferential for single-stranded substrates. Combining multiple crRNA increases detection sensitivity of targets, an approach we use to quantify pathogen DNA in samples from patients suspected of Buruli ulcer disease. Results reveal that these enzymes are kinetically adapted to play distinct roles in bacterial adaptive immunity and show how kinetic analysis can be applied to CRISPR-based diagnostics.","output":"Kinetic analysis of Cas12a and Cas13a RNA-Guided nucleases for development of improved CRISPR-Based diagnostics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Depuis le 17 mars 2020, date du dbut du confinement en France, une baisse brutale de la frquentation des urgences psychiatriques est observe, malgr une augmentation du stress directement li  la crise sanitaire.

Much remains unknown about host cells and tissues affected by coronavirus infections, including the hematopoietic system. Here, we discuss the recent findings examining effects that coronavirus infection or exposure has on hematopoietic cells and the clinical implications for these effects. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have centered on SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and mature immune cells may be susceptible to infection and are impacted functionally by exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. These findings have important implications regarding hematologic complications arising from COVID-19 and other coronavirus-induced disease, which we discuss here. SUMMARY: Infection with coronaviruses sometimes leads to hematologic complications in patients, and these hematologic complications are associated with poorer prognosis. These hematologic complications may be caused by coronavirus direct infection or impact on primitive hematopoietic cells or mature immune cells, by indirect effects on these cells, or by a combination thereof. It is important to understand how hematologic complications arise in order to seek new treatments to improve patient outcomes.","output":"Consequences of coronavirus infections for primitive and mature hematopoietic cells: new insights and why it matters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are a family of calcium-regulated enzymes that are phylogenetically conserved and cause post-translational deimination/citrullination, contributing to protein moonlighting in health and disease. PADs are implicated in a range of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, in the regulation of extracellular vesicle (EV) release, and their roles in infection and immunomodulation are known to some extent, including in viral infections. In the current study we describe putative roles for PADs in COVID-19, based on in silico analysis of BioProject transcriptome data (PRJNA615032 BioProject), including lung biopsies from healthy volunteers and SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, as well as SARS-CoV-2-infected, and mock human bronchial epithelial NHBE and adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial A549 cell lines. In addition, BioProject Data PRJNA631753, analysing patients tissue biopsy data (n = 5), was utilised. We report a high individual variation observed for all PADI isozymes in the patients tissue biopsies, including lung, in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, while PADI2 and PADI4 mRNA showed most variability in lung tissue specifically. The other tissues assessed were heart, kidney, marrow, bowel, jejunum, skin and fat, which all varied with respect to mRNA levels for the different PADI isozymes. In vitro lung epithelial and adenocarcinoma alveolar cell models revealed that PADI1, PADI2 and PADI4 mRNA levels were elevated, but PADI3 and PADI6 mRNA levels were reduced in SARS-CoV-2-infected NHBE cells. In A549 cells, PADI2 mRNA was elevated, PADI3 and PADI6 mRNA was downregulated, and no effect was observed on the PADI4 or PADI6 mRNA levels in infected cells, compared with control mock cells. Our findings indicate a link between PADI expression changes, including modulation of PADI2 and PADI4, particularly in lung tissue, in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. PADI isozyme 1C6 expression in other organ biopsies also reveals putative links to COVID-19 symptoms, including vascular, cardiac and cutaneous responses, kidney injury and stroke. KEGG and GO pathway analysis furthermore identified links between PADs and inflammatory pathways, in particular between PAD4 and viral infections, as well as identifying links for PADs with a range of comorbidities. The analysis presented here highlights roles for PADs in-host responses to SARS-CoV-2, and their potential as therapeutic targets in COVID-19.","output":"Putative Roles for Peptidylarginine Deiminases in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Les auteurs montrent que les marchs du travail ont davantage souffert des effets de la pandmie de COVID\\\\19 en 2020 que de ceux de la crise financire en 2009.

METHODS Thirty-six patients (51-82 years) with vertebral localization of MM were randomly divided into two groups: 18 patients (group A) who underwent RFA and then vertebroplasty, and 18 patients (group B) who underwent only vertebroplasty. Primary endpoints were technical success and pain relief score rate measured by the visual analogue pain scores (VAS) and Roland-Morris Questionnaire (RMQ); secondary endpoint was the amount of administered analgesia. Survival and complications were compared. RESULTS Technical success was 100 % in both groups. The VAS score (at 24 h and 6 weeks postprocedure) decreased in equal manner for both groups from a mean of 9.1-3.4 and 2.0 for group A and from a mean of 9.3-3.0 and 2.3 for group B; RMQ mean score was 19.8 for group A and 19.9 for group B and decreased to a mean of 9.6 and 8.2 for group A and 9.5 and 8.7 for group B. The amount of medication was equally decreased in the two groups. No statistically significant difference was noted. No major complication occurred and two patients died from other causes. CONCLUSIONS The use of percutaneous vertebroplasty alone appears to be effective for the pain management of the patients with vertebral involvement of multiple myeloma. The use of RFA that includes cost and time does not offer any clear added benefit on the midterm pain management of such patients.","output":"Percutaneous vertebroplasty for pain management in patients with multiple myeloma: is radiofrequency ablation necessary?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immigrants have been found to be disproportionately impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic across the world.

Herein, we assessed the impact of COVID-19 on subthreshold depressive symptoms and identified potential mitigating factors. METHODS: Participants were from Depression Cohort in China (ChiCTR registry number 1900022145). Adults (n = 1722) with subthreshold depressive symptoms were enrolled between March and October 2019 in a 6-month, community-based interventional study that aimed to prevent clinical depression using psychoeducation. A total of 1506 participants completed the study in Shenzhen, China: 726 participants, who completed the study between March 2019 and January 2020 (i.e. before COVID-19), comprised the 'wave 1' group; 780 participants, who were enrolled before COVID-19 and completed the 6-month endpoint assessment during COVID-19, comprised 'wave 2'. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia were assessed at baseline and endpoint (i.e. 6-month follow-up) using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), respectively. Measures of resilience and regular exercise were assessed at baseline. We compared the mental health outcomes between wave 1 and wave 2 groups. We additionally investigated how mental health outcomes changed across disparate stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, i.e. peak (7-13 February), post-peak (14-27 February), remission plateau (28 February-present). RESULTS: COVID-19 increased the risk for three mental outcomes: (1) depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.62); (2) anxiety (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.16-1.88) and (3) insomnia (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07-1.77). The highest proportion of probable depression and anxiety was observed post-peak, with 52.9% and 41.4%, respectively. Greater baseline resilience scores had a protective effect on the three main outcomes (depression: OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.19-0.37; anxiety: OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.14-0.33 and insomnia: OR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.11-0.28). Furthermore, regular physical activity mitigated the risk for depression (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.79-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic exerted a highly significant and negative impact on symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia. Mental health outcomes fluctuated as a function of the duration of the pandemic and were alleviated to some extent with the observed decline in community-based transmission. Augmenting resiliency and regular exercise provide an opportunity to mitigate the risk for mental health symptoms during this severe public health crisis.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on subthreshold depressive symptoms: a longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) plans to host the Euro Cup 2020 (now deferred to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) in 12 cities of 12 countries around Europe, one feature that will stand out is the conspicuous presence of players of African descent As UEFA celebrates the 60th anniversary of the tournament, it is worthwhile to reflect over the composition of the European national football teams in the twenty-first century and specifically analyse the history and dynamics that this opportunity presents to the players of African descent and the resultant national identity implications Going by the composition of European teams at the 2018 World Cup, the presence of African players is a growing phenomenon Initially, such phenomenon was confined to once colonizing and colonized nations such as Portugal and Mozambique;France and Morocco, Senegal and Algeria, among others However, recent developments show that players of African descent are turning out for countries that had no colonial links [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Soccer & Society is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Players of African descent representing European national football teams: a double-edged sword"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Association between calcium channel blockers (CCBs) or functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMAs) use and decreased mortality in people with COVID-19 has been reported in recent studies.

This retrospective cohort study used data extracted from the medical records of adult inpatients with hypertension and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 with definite outcomes (discharged from hospital or deceased) from Erasme Hospital (Brussels, Belgium). We re-analyzed the data of the retrospective cohort study using only the 184 patients (103 males, 81 females) with a mean age of 69.54 years (SD = 14.6) with hypertension. The fifty-five participants (29.9%) receiving a chronic prescription of amlodipine were compared with the 129 patients who did not receive a chronic prescription of amlodipine. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to explore the relationships between mortality and sex, age, comorbidities, smoking, and amlodipine status. Out of the 184 participants, 132 (71.7%) survived and 52 (28.3%) died. The mortality rates were, respectively, 12.73% (n = 7) and 34.88% (n = 45) for the amlodipine and non-amlodipine groups. Multivariate logistic regression was significant (Chi square (5) = 29.11; p < 0.0001). Chronic kidney disease and malignant neoplasm were significant predictors as well as amlodipine status. For chronic kidney disease and malignant neoplasm, the odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were, respectively, 2.16 (95% CI: 1.04C4.5; p = 0.039) and 2.46 (95% CI: 1.01C6.01; p = 0.047). For amlodipine status the odds ratio was 0.29 (95% CI: 0.11C0.74; p = 0.009).

However, we argue that such approaches are suboptimal because medical datasets are largely different from ImageNet and often contain limited training samples. In this work, we propose Task Agnostic Transfer Learning (TATL), a novel framework motivated by dermatologists' behaviors in the skincare context. TATL learns an attribute-agnostic segmenter that detects lesion skin regions and then transfers this knowledge to a set of attribute-specific classifiers to detect each particular attribute. Since TATL's attribute-agnostic segmenter only detects skin attribute regions, it enjoys ample data from all attributes, allows transferring knowledge among features, and compensates for the lack of training data from rare attributes. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed TATL transfer learning mechanism with various neural network architectures on two popular skin attributes detection benchmarks. The empirical results show that TATL not only works well with multiple architectures but also can achieve state-of-the-art performances, while enjoying minimal model and computational complexities.

Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) apart from being used as an effective and old vaccine against tuberculosis has some known off-target protection effect and is getting more attention in this scenario.

On samples collected from regions where Lyme disease is endemic, seroprevalence for POWV in TBD samples was 9.4% (10 of 106) versus 2% when tested with non-TBD samples (2 of 100, P = 0.034). No evidence of POWV infection was seen in samples collected from a region where Lyme disease was not endemic (0 of 22). This test panel provides a sensitive and specific platform for detecting a serologic response to POWV early in the course of infection when neutralizing antibodies may not be detectable. Combined with clinical history, the panel is an effective tool for identifying acute POWV infection. IMPORTANCE Approximately 100 cases of POWV disease were reported in the United States over the past 10 years. Most cases have occurred in the Northeast (52) and Great Lakes (45) regions (https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/statistics.html). The prevalence of POWV in ticks and mammals is increasing, and POWV poses an increasing threat in a greater geographical range. In areas of the Northeast and Midwest where Lyme disease is endemic, POWV testing is recommended for patients with a recent tick bite, patients with Lyme disease who have been treated with antibiotics, or patients with a tick exposure who have tested negative for Lyme disease or other tick-borne illnesses and have persistent symptoms consistent with posttreatment Lyme disease. Testing could also benefit patients with tick exposure and unexplained neurologic symptoms and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients with known tick exposure. Until now, diagnostic testing for Powassan virus has not been commercially available and has been limited to patients presenting with severe, neurologic complications. The lack of routine testing for Powassan virus in patients with suspected tick-borne disease means that little information is available regarding the overall prevalence of the virus and the full spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with infection. As Ixodes scapularis is the tick vector for Powassan virus and multiple other tick-borne pathogens, including the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, the clinical presentations and long-term outcomes of Powassan virus infection and concurrent infection with other tick-borne disease pathogens remain unknown.","output":"Development and Validation of a Serologic Test Panel for Detection of Powassan Virus Infection in U.S. Patients Residing in Regions Where Lyme Disease Is Endemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An infodemic caused by a rampant spread of a mixture of correct and incorrect information in a connected world creates uncertainty about and dismissal of proven public health measures. Two key factors that can influence COVID-19 preventive behaviors are information and self-efficacy. Misinformation (inaccurate or misleading information) can modify people's attitudes and behaviors and deter them from following preventive behaviors. Self-efficacy, on the other hand, has been linked to the likelihood to engaging in preventive behaviors. This cross-sectional study used a nationally representative survey of Americans from 2020 to determine the associations between (1) COVID-19 news sources and COVID-19 misinformation and (2) COVID-19 misinformation and COVID-19 prevention self-efficacy, using multivariable logistic regression. Results indicate that reliance on conservative sources for COVID-19 news is significantly associated with endorsing COVID-19 misinformation. In contrast, reliance on liberal sources, mainstream print, or social media for COVID-19 news are significantly negatively associated with endorsing COVID-19 misinformation. Furthermore, endorsing COVID-19 misinformation is related to low COVID-19 prevention self-efficacy, which, in turn, can modify COVID-19 preventive behaviors. These findings suggest that customizing health messages to debunk misinformation and increase self-efficacy for preventive behaviors can motivate individuals to comply with preventive behaviors and protect themselves from COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 News and Misinformation: Do They Matter for Public Health Prevention?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected cities particularly hard.

People living in municipalities with low socioeconomic status did not reduce their mobility during lockdowns as much as those in more affluent municipalities. Testing volumes may have been insufficient early in the pandemic in those places, and both test positivity rates and testing delays were much higher. We find a strong association between socioeconomic status and mortality, measured by either COVID-19-attributed deaths or excess deaths.

We sought to understand if: a) demographic variables of Cameroonian residents could influence KAP and symptomatology, and b) KAP could influence the risk of having COVID19.A cross-sectional KAP/symptomatology online survey was conducted between April 20 to May 20. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 23. Of all respondents (1006), 53.1% were female, 26.6% were students, 26.9% interacted face to face and 62.8% were residents in Yaound with a median age of 33. The overall high score was 84.19% for knowledge, 69% for attitude, and 60.8% for practice towards COVID 19. Age > 20 years was associated with a high knowledge of COVID 19. Women had lower practice scores compared to men (OR = 0.72; 95%CI 0.56C0.92). 41 respondents had 3 symptoms and only 9 (22.95%) of them had called 1510 (emergency number). There was no significant difference between KAP and symptomatology. The presence of  3 symptoms in 4% of respondents (with 56% of them having co-morbidities) supports the current trend in the number of confirmed cases (8681) in Cameroon. The continuous increase in the number of cases and the overall good KAP warrants further investigation to assess the effectiveness of the measures put in place to curb the spread of the disease.

The model is built on the principle that, the exponential rise and decay of the number of confirmed Covid-19 infections can be construed as a set of concurrent non-linear waves. These waves can be characterized by a linear combination of Gaussian and Cauchy Lorentz functions collectively termed as Gaussian-Lorentzian Composite (GLC) function.

This paper aims to assess and characterise SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg to identify groups at greatest risk, to establish early measures to curb transmission. We analysed all mandatory notified (i.e. laboratory-confirmed) coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks with more than two cases in Baden-Wuerttemberg from calendar weeks 18-49 (from 27 April to 6 December 2020). We used the following classification for settings: asylum and refugee accommodation, care homes, care facilities, day care child centres, hobby-related, hospitality, hospitals, households, other, residence halls, schools, supported housing, training schools, transportation, treatment facilities and workplace (occupational). We used R program version 3.6.3 for analysis. In our analysis, 3219 outbreaks with 22 238 individuals were included. About 48% were in household and hobby-related settings. Care homes accounted for 9.5% of outbreaks and 21.6% of cases. The median age across all settings was 43 (interquartile range (IQR) 24-63). The median age of cases in care homes was 81 (IQR 56-88). Of all reported cases in care homes, 72.1% were women. Over 30% (466/1511) of hospitalisations were among cases in care homes compared to 17.7% (268/1511) in households. Overall, 70% (500/715) of all deceased persons in outbreaks in the study period were in care homes compared to 4.2% in household settings (30/715). We observed an exponential increase in the number of notified outbreaks starting around the 41st week with N = 291 outbreaks reported in week 49. The median number of cases in outbreaks in care homes and care facilities after the 40th week was 14 (IQR 5-29) and 11 (IQR 5-20), respectively, compared to 3 (IQR 3-5) in households. We observed an increase in hospitalisations, and mortality associated with COVID-19 outbreaks in care homes after the 40th week.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Approval was obtained from institutional review boards, research was in compliance with HIPAA protocol. The need to obtain informed consent was waived for retrospective review of patient records. The records of patients with biopsy-proved chondroblastoma who were treated with RF ablation at two academic centers from July 1995 to July 2007 were reviewed. RF ablation was performed with a single-tip electrode by using computed tomography for guidance. Lesion characteristics were determined from imaging studies obtained at the time of the procedure. Symptoms were assessed before and 1 day after the procedure. Longer-term follow-up was obtained from medical records. RESULTS Thirteen male and four female patients were treated (mean age, 17.3 years). The lesions were located in the proximal humerus (n = 7), proximal tibia (n = 4), proximal femur (n = 3), and distal femur (n = 3). The mean volume of the lesions was 2.46 mL. All patients reported relief of symptoms on postprocedure day 1. Three patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 14 patients for whom longer-term (mean, 41.3 months; range, 4-134 months) follow-up was available, 12 had complete relief of symptoms with no need for medications and full return to all activities. The patient who had the largest lesion of the study required surgical intervention because of collapse of the articular surface in the treatment area. Residual viable tumor was found at surgery. Another patient experienced mechanical problems that were thought to be unrelated to the RF ablation and was rendered pain-free after subsequent surgical treatment. CONCLUSION Percutaneous RF ablation is an alternative to surgery for treatment of selected chondroblastomas.

People who were refugees are a unique sub-set of the CALD communities and are subject to numerous barriers preventing adequate health care, both pre- and post-migration. The barriers are accentuated during emergencies, such as a pandemic, as a result of an intersection of various social and economic inequalities. The recently resettled Ezidi refugee community in a regional area of Australia is an example of a community sitting at the intersection of various inequities and thus at greater risk from COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to describe the experiences of the Ezidi in a regional area with COVID-19 information and how this has been communicated to and shared within this group;what barriers the community may experience in accessing COVID-19 information;and how the government led COVID-19 information communication could be improved. Methods: : This qualitative study was designed to explore the perceptions and views of the Ezidi and service providers regarding COVID-19 messaging. Working within a participatory framework the Multicultural and Refugee Health staff facilitated interviews with four local service providers and ten Ezidi community members, including seven influential leaders.

METHODS This prospective study, approved by local ethical committee, enrolled 38 patients with primary OC, 2011-2014. After preoperative DCE-MRI (3.0 T), two observers measured perfusion (Ktrans, Kep, Ve, Vp) and semi-quantitative parameters (area under the curve, peak, time-to-peak) by drawing regions of interest (ROIs) covering the large solid lesion (L-ROI) and the most enhancing small area (S-ROI) (NordicICE platform). Kruskal-Wallis was used to analyze associations between MRI parameters and classified prognostic factors. RESULTS Mean Ktrans values were higher in high-grade serous OC than in other types (L-ROI, P = 0.041; S-ROI, P = 0.018), and lower mean Ktrans values predicted residual tumor (L-ROI P = 0.030; S-ROI, P = 0.012).

Among them, 116 patients recovered and were discharged, 2 patients died, and the median length of hospital stay was 22 (range: 9-41) days. On admission, 76.3% of the patients presented with fever, and the laboratory studies showed a decrease in lymphocyte (LYM) count and an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Within the studies' chest CTs, the median number of involved lung lobes was 4 (range: 0-5) and the median number of involved lung segments was 9 (range 0-20). The left lower lobe and the right lower lobe were the most likely areas to be involved (89.0% and 83.9%), and 84.7% of the patients had inflammatory changes in both lungs. The main manifestations on chest CT were ground glass opacities (31.4%), ground glass opacities and consolidation (20.3%), ground glass opacities and reticular patterns (32.2%), mixed type (13.6%), and white lungs (1.7%); common accompanying signs included linear opacities (55.9%), air bronchograms (46.6%), thick small vessel shadows (36.4%), and pleural hypertrophy (13.6%). The chest CT at discharge showed complete absorption of lesions in 19 cases (16.1%), but not in the remaining 99 cases. Lesions remained in a median of 3 lung lobes (range: 0-5). Residual lesions remained in a median of 5 lung segments (range: 0-20).

Reports of thrombotic events and autopsy findings of pulmonary thrombotic microangiopathy [1] in patients with COVID-19 are rising. Bompard et al. recently reported a cohort study of 137 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, in which retrospective review of computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) scans demonstrated a cumulative incidence of pulmonary emboli (PE) of 24% overall and 50% in intensive care [2]. Although it was initially thought that insidious venous thromboembolic events (VTE) were mainly confined to ventilated patients [3], we now understand thrombotic risk to be a wider problem in COVID-19. An overexuberant host inflammatory response, in selected patients with severe COVID-19, may contribute to the high mortality. We recently recommended screening for virally-driven hyperinflammation in COVID-19 and proposed that immunomodulation in this subgroup of patients, may improve outcomes [4]. There are several ongoing, randomised controlled trials evaluating the therapeutic potential of Janus Kinase inhibitors (JAKi) in severe COVID-19 (table 1). JAKi have a purported advantage over other immunomodulatory strategies in COVID-19, as they may exert dual anti-inflammatory (blockade of multiple, pro-inflammatory cytokines simultaneously) and anti-viral effects (impeding cellular viral endocytosis [5, 6]) and have convenient oral administration, with relatively short half-lives. JAKi may interrupt the signalling of several pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of hyperinflammation, including interleukin (IL)-6, which has been the focus of several clinical trials in COVID-19. JAKi may also inhibit the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the AT2 alveolar epithelial cells; baricitinib (a JAK1/2 inhibitor), is a numb-associated kinase (NAK) inhibitor, with a particularly high affinity for AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1), a pivotal regulator of clathrin-mediated viral endocytosis [5]. We recommend vigilance to the potentially increased thrombotic risk associated with JAKi, given the hypercoagulability of COVID-19 and our recent thromboprophylaxis recommendations for all hospitalised patients with COVID-19 [7].","output":"JAK inhibitors in COVID-19: need for vigilance regarding increased inherent thrombotic risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter focuses on analyzing the features and the functions of a civilization grounded in a worldview of modern secularity, the author calls human-immanence.

Questionnaire was sent to the HCWs, using WhatsApp Messenger, and voluntary participation was sought. We received responses from 2026 HCWs. Burnout was assessed in personal, work, and client-related (COVID-19 pandemic-related) domains. Burnout was defined at a cut-off score of 50 for each domain. RESULTS: The prevalence of personal burnout was 44.6% (903), work-related burn-out was only 26.9% (544), while greater than half of the respondents (1,069, 52.8%) had pandemic-related burnout. Younger respondents (21C30 years) had higher personal and work-related burnout. The prevalence of personal and work-related burnout was significantly (p < 0.01) higher among females. The doctors were 1.64 times, and the support staff were 5 times more likely to experience pandemic-related burnout. CONCLUSION: There is a significant prevalence of burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic among HCWs, in particular, doctors and support staff. Female respondents had higher prevalence. We suggest that the management should be proactive and supportive in improving working conditions and providing assurance to the HCWs. The long-term effects of the current pandemic need to be assessed later. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Khasne RW, Dhakulkar BS, Mahajan HC, Kulkarni AP.

Critical perspectives on these new partnerships tend to frame them as an instance of market transgressions by tech giants into the sphere of health and medicine, in line with a hostile worlds doctrine that upholds that the borders between market and non-market spheres should be carefully policed. This article seeks to outline the limitations of this common framing for critically understanding the phenomenon of the Googlization of health. In particular, the mobilization of a diversity of non-market value statements in the justification work carried out by actors involved in the Googlization of health indicates the co-presence of additional worlds or spheres in this context, which are not captured by the market vs. non-market dichotomy. It then advances an alternative framework, based on a multiple-sphere ontology that draws on Boltanski and Thevenots orders of worth and Michael Walzers theory of justice, which I call a normative pragmatics of justice. This framework addresses both the normative deficit in Boltanski and Thevenots work and provides an important emphasis on the empirical workings of justice. Finally, I discuss why this framework is better equipped to identify and to address the many risks raised by the Googlization of health and possibly other dimensions of the digitalization and datafication of society.","output":"From hostile worlds to multiple spheres: towards a normative pragmatics of justice for the Googlization of health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thrombosis is a recognized complication of Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and is often associated with poor prognosis.

We computationally examined the interaction of these with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and, in the case of VKORC1, we describe its binding to ORF7a in detail. We examined the occurrence of variants of each of these proteins across populations and interrogated their potential contribution to COVID-19 severity. Potential mechanisms, by which some of these variants may contribute to disease, are proposed. Some of these variants are prevalent in minority groups that are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19. Therefore, we are proposing that further investigation around these variants may lead to better understanding of disease pathogenesis in minority groups and more informed therapeutic approaches.","output":"Gene variants of coagulation related proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global challenge with strong medical and socioeconomic implications.

Thus, the acidic domain at the C-terminus of this protein is essential for its transcriptional activity. Indeed, deletion of amino acids from 146 to 149 (EAME) in this acidic domain lost the transcriptional activity of EV71 2A protein though still retained its protease activity. EV71 2A protease was detected both in the cytoplasm and nucleus using confocal microscopy analysis. Coxsackie virus B3 2A protease also exhibited transcriptional activity in yeast cells. As expected, an acidic domain in the C-terminus of Coxsackie virus B3 2A protease was also identified. Truncation of this acidic domain resulted in the loss of transcriptional activity.

Detection and quantification of airborne viruses is essential in order to provide information regarding public health risk assessment. FINDINGS: In this study, an optimized new, simple, low cost method for sampling of airborne viruses using Low Melting Agarose (LMA) plates and a conventional microbial air sampling device has been developed. The use of LMA plates permits the direct nucleic acids extraction of the captured viruses without the need of any preliminary elution step. Molecular detection and quantification of airborne viruses is performed using real-time quantitative (RT-)PCR (Q(RT-)PCR) technique. The method has been tested using Adenoviruses (AdVs) and Noroviruses (NoVs) GII, as representative DNA and RNA viruses, respectively. Moreover, the method has been tested successfully in outdoor experiments, by detecting and quantifying human adenoviruses (HAdVs) in the airborne environment of a wastewater treatment plant. CONCLUSIONS: The great advantage of LMA is that nucleic acids extraction is performed directly on the LMA plates, while the eluted nucleic acids are totally free of inhibitory substances. Coupled with QPCR the whole procedure can be completed in less than three (3) hours.","output":"Development of an optimized method for the detection of airborne viruses with real-time PCR analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) has been associated with coagulation dysfunction which predisposes patients to an increased risk of both venous and arterial thromboembolism, increasing the short-term morbidity and mortality.

The first known baby in prison was Henry Kable Junior (born in Norwich Castle Gaol (England) in February 1786), he lived with his mother in Norwich Castle Gaol until he and his parents were all transported to Australia. The problem persists that babies are living within prisons. Mother and baby units are presented as a solution;however, these living arrangements are not always in the best interests of children. There are no internationally consistent conditions, agreement on the age of separation or discussion about the possible choices for those who are supporting infants living in mother and baby units. It is difficult to conceive that there could be any other way of dealing with women who have young babies and it is this difficulty that has led to the creation and longevity of mother and baby units.The first section of this article provides an overview of the most salient representations of babies in prison during the current year and its COVID-19 pandemic. I will explain how a theory called, supportive choices, can be applied by prison administrations, criminal justice institutions and activists. Encouraging supportive choices is an original theoretical framework to explain that rather than re-writing legislation a first step would be that the best interests of the child should be used as a justification for change. Inevitably a theoretical framework will have problems when translated into practice, however the intention is to provide a starting point for the transformation of policies or practices that have the intended (or unintended) consequence of putting the interests of women before their babies.","output":"Putting Babies First: Supportive Choices for Mother and Baby Units"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: On 07/02/2020, French Health authorities were informed of a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in an Englishman infected in Singapore who had recently stayed in a chalet in the French Alps. We conducted an investigation to identify secondary cases and interrupt transmission. METHODS: We defined as a confirmed case a person linked to the chalet with a positive RT-PCR sample for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The index case stayed 4 days in the chalet with 10 English tourists and a family of 5 French residents; SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 5 individuals in France, 6 in England (including the index case), and 1 in Spain (overall attack rate in the chalet: 75%). One pediatric case, with picornavirus and influenza A coinfection, visited 3 different schools while symptomatic. One case was asymptomatic, with similar viral load as that of a symptomatic case. Seven days after the first cases were diagnosed, one tertiary case was detected in a symptomatic patient with a positive endotracheal aspirate; all previous and concurrent nasopharyngeal specimens were negative. Additionally, 172 contacts were monitored, including 73 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence in this cluster of one asymptomatic case with similar viral load as a symptomatic patient, suggests transmission potential of asymptomatic individuals. The fact that an infected child did not transmit the disease despite close interactions within schools suggests potential different transmission dynamics in children.

We hypothesized that students applying into plastic surgery may experience much distress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An electronic survey was developed by 3 plastic surgery residents and 2 academic plastic surgeons and later refined by 4 fourth-year medical students. Questions focused on medical education curricular changes, perceived impact on medical education, and demographics. From April-May 2020 the survey was distributed to medical students who were interested in plastic surgery. Participants were identified through plastic surgery residency program personnel and social media platforms. Results: In total, 130 of the 140 respondents reported interest in plastic surgery careers. An estimated 67% were in their clinical years or completing research year(s) before residency applications. Of the respondents, 80% believed that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on their medical education. Clinical-level students compared with preclinical-level students, and students applying to residency during the 2020-2021 match cycle compared with students not applying during the 2020-2021 match cycle were significantly more likely to perceive the COVID-19 pandemic as having a negative impact on their medical education (P = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively).

Iran was among the first countries with a major outbreak outside China. Methods We constructed a globally representative sample of 802 genomes, including 46 samples from patients inside or with a travel history to Iran. We then performed a phylogenetic analysis to identify clades related to samples from Iran and estimated the start of the epidemic and early doubling times in cases. We leveraged air travel data from 36 exported cases of COVID-19 to estimate the point-prevalence and the basic reproductive number across the country. We also analysed the province-level all-cause mortality data during winter and spring 2020 to estimate under-reporting of COVID-19-related deaths. Finally, we use this information in an SEIR model to reconstruct the early outbreak dynamics and assess the effectiveness of intervention measures in Iran. Results By identifying the most basal clade that contained genomes from Iran, our phylogenetic analysis showed that the age of the root is placed on 2019-12-21 (95 % HPD: 2019-09-07 C 2020-02-14). This date coincides with our estimated epidemic start date on 2019-12-25 (95 %CI: 2019-12-11 C 2020-02-24) based air travel data from exported cases with an early doubling time of 4.0 (95 %CI: 1.4C6.7) days in cases. Our analysis of all-cause mortality showed 21.9 (95 % CI: 16.7C27.2) thousand excess deaths by the end of summer. Our model forecasted the second epidemic peak and suggested that by 2020-08-31 a total of 15.0 (95 %CI: 4.9C25.0) million individuals recovered from the disease across the country. Conclusion These findings have profound implications for assessing the stage of the epidemic in Iran despite significant levels of under-reporting. Moreover, the results shed light on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions in Iran and central Asia. They also suggest that in the absence of border screening, there is a high risk of introduction from travellers from areas with active outbreaks. Finally, they show both that well-informed epidemic models are able to forecast episodes of resurgence following a relaxation of interventions, and that NPIs are key to controlling ongoing epidemics.","output":"Lessons for preparedness and reasons for concern from the early COVID-19 epidemic in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease affected Northern Italy, spreading from the Bergamo province to the entire country.

The mental health of police students however, has not been given the same attention. To the best of our knowledge, studies on the mental health of Swedish police recruits have not been undertaken since 2010. OBJECTIVES: The present study aims to examine whether there are differences in the mental health between two cohorts (2009 and 2020) of Swedish police recruits, as well as to compare the mental health of both cohorts with the general population data collected in 2002. METHODS: Data was collected using the SCL-90-R survey. Data was analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and independent sample T-tests. Bi-variate analyses including t-test and chi-square were used to examine differences in sociodemographic variables between the two cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 376 police recruits participated in the study. Results indicated no significant differences between the cohorts with regards to the three global indices of the SCL-90-R: Global Severity Index (GSI), Positive Symptom Total (PST), and Positive Symptom Distress Index (PSDI). Recruits with a college degree had lower scores on GSI and PSDI, similar to respondents that where in a relationship vs. singles. A total of 15 (four female) recruits had GSI scores above the Swedish patient mean. Compared with the general population, males and females from the 2009, as well as females from the 2020 cohorts had lower or insignificantly different mean scores on all global indices, with males from the 2020 cohort having a significantly lower PST score. CONCLUSIONS: While the vast majority of recruits had results that where indicative of a low prevalence and intensity with regards to mental health disorders, some recruits did score above the Swedish patient mean. While mental preparedness is part of the curriculum for Swedish police recruits, interventions targeting the stigmas of poor mental health could be of value.

There are three different modes of IL-6 signaling, classic signaling, trans-signaling, and trans-presentation, which are not functionally redundant and mediate pleiotropic effects on both physiological and pathophysiological states. Monoclonal antibodies against IL-6 or IL-6R have been successfully developed for clinical application. However, designing therapeutic interventions that block specific modes of IL-6 signaling in a pathologically relevant manner remains a great challenge. Here, we constructed a fusion protein Hyper-IL-6 (HyIL-6) composed of human IL-6 and IL-6R to develop specific blocking antibodies against the IL-6/IL-6R complex. We successfully screened the monoclonal antibody C14mab, which can bind to HyIL-6 with the binding constant 2.86  10(?10) and significantly inhibit IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 complex formation. In vitro, C14mab effectively inhibited HyIL-6-stimulated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation and related vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induction. Moreover, C14mab efficaciously suppressed HyIL-6-induced acute phase response in vivo.

Our proposed application of safe-by-design can be part of \\"responsible research and innovation\\" concepts, because they share features such as risk prevention strategies and a participatory approach. Early awareness of potential safety issues can guide the development of agricultural products towards safe options, both at the process and product level, and thus may help to reduce extensive pre-market assessment studies that might otherwise be needed further downstream for regulatory product approval. Here, it is discussed how the proposed safe-by-design approach can be introduced into the development of safe food crops using emerging technologies, such as gene editing and synthetic biology, and how this may help to safeguard the safety of our food and feed supply in the light of the ongoing global innovations in agricultural crop breeding.","output":"Application of the Safe-By-Design Concept in Crop Breeding Innovation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated health disparities, particularly among at-risk people with opioid use disorder (OUD) We sought to characterize the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on this group to understand how the pandemic has affected this group, this group's public health response to COVID-19, and whether there were differences by race/ethnicity Methods This study recruited its sample from a drug treatment setting in the northeast region of the United States We surveyed 110 individuals on methadone as treatment for OUD and assessed COVID-19-related impacts on their health behaviors and other indices of social, physical, and mental well-being, including sexual health behaviors, substance use, mental health status, health care access, income, and employment Results Our findings highlight overall increases in depression, anxiety, loneliness, and frustration among the sample of people with OUD;the study also observed decreases in financial stability Significant differences between groups indicated a greater financial burden among racial-ethnic minorities;this subgroup also reported greater direct adverse effects of COVID-19, including being more concerned about contracting COVID-19, not being able to get a COVID-19 test, and knowing someone who had died from COVID-19 A greater proportion of Whites indicated increases in alcohol consumption and nonCprescription drug use than did racial-ethnic minorities Conclusions Treatment providers must be vigilant in managing direct and indirect outcomes of COVID-19 among people with OUD Findings highlight the need to develop culturally competent, differentiated interventions in partnership with community-based organizations to meet the unique challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic presents for people in treatment for OUD","output":"Differential impacts of COVID-19 across racial-ethnic identities in persons with opioid use disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Simultaneous detection of multiple analytes from a single sample (multiplexing), particularly when done at the point of need, can guide complex decision-making without increasing the required sample volume or cost per test.

Here, we address this bottleneck with a customizable platform that integrates cell-free expression (CFE) with a polymer-based aqueous two-phase system (ATPS), producing membrane-less protocells containing transcription and translation machinery used for detection. We show that multiple protocells, each performing a distinct sensing reaction, can be arrayed in the same microwell to detect chemically diverse targets from the same sample. Furthermore, these protocell arrays are compatible with human biofluids, maintain function after lyophilization and rehydration, and can produce visually interpretable readouts, illustrating this platforms potential as a minimal-equipment, field-deployable, multi-analyte detection tool.","output":"Protocell arrays for simultaneous detection of diverse analytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the outbreak of the coronavirus and the epidemic of this deadly disease with the imposition of restrictions and the rumor that addicts are not infected, the rate of slippage among drug users in the COVID-19 period has increased to some extent and in a way, addiction has followed a secret process.

Elevated transforming growth factor ? (TGF?) signalling is implicated in cSCC development and progression in RDEB patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of exogenous and endogenous TGF? signalling in RDEB cSCC with a view to assess the potential of targeting TGF? signalling for RDEB cSCC therapy. METHODS: A panel of 11 patient derived RDEB cSCC primary tumour keratinocyte cell lines (SCCRDEBs) were tested for their signalling and proliferation responses to exogenous TGF?. Their responses to TGFBR1 kinase inhibitors (SB-431542 and AZ12601011(AZA01)) was tested using in vitro proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, 3D invasion assays and in vivo tumour xenograft assays. RESULTS: All SCCRDEBs respond to exogenous TGF? by activation of canonical SMAD signalling and proliferative arrest. Blocking endogenous signalling by treatment with SB-431542 and AZ12601011 significantly inhibited proliferation (n=7/11), clonogenicity (n=6/11), migration (n=8/11) and invasion (6/11) of SCCRDEBs. However, these TGFBR1 kinase inhibitors also promoted proliferation and clonogenicity in 2/11 SCCRDEBs. Pre-treatment of in vitro TGFBR1 addicted SCCRDEB70 cells with SB-431542 enhanced overall survival and reduced tumour volume in subcutaneous xenografts but had no effect on non-addicted SCCRDEB2 cells in these assays. CONCLUSION: Targeting TGFBR1 kinase activity may have therapeutic benefit in the majority of RDEB cSCCs, however, the potential tumour suppressive role of TGF? signalling in a subset of RDEB cSCCs necessitates biomarker identification to enable patient stratification before clinical intervention.","output":"Heterogeneous addiction to TGF? signalling in recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa associated cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In February 2021, the Peruvian 'vaccinegate' scandal broke when the media reported that nearly 500 experimental doses of an ongoing COVID-19 trial were given to key individuals not enrolled in the trial.

Prevention measures like physical distancing have burdened the general population, especially in highly urbanized areas. However, little is known about the associations between pandemic-related stressors, coping strategies, and depressive symptoms in highly urbanized vs. less urbanized environments. METHODS: Participants were recruited in a cross-sectional online survey in Germany. Propensity score matching yielded a matched sample of city (n = 453) and town (n = 453) inhabitants. Depressive symptoms, COVID-19-related stressors, and coping strategies were compared between cities and towns. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine associations between pandemic-related stressors and depressive symptoms for the two groups separately. RESULTS: City inhabitants showed significantly higher depression scores than town inhabitants (t = 2.11, df = 897.95, p = 0.035). Seven coping strategies were more often used by the city sample. Depressive symptoms were associated with restricted physical social contact and difficult housing conditions (adjusted R(2)= 0.19, F([9,443]) = 12.52, p < 0.001) in city inhabitants, and with fear of infection and difficult housing conditions (adjusted R(2)= 0.20, F([9,443]) = 13.50, p < 0.001) in town inhabitants. LIMITATIONS: The data were collected at the end of the first wave and represent a snapshot without causal inferences. Pandemic-related stressors were measured with a newly developed scale.

METHODS: A prospective observational study included consecutively hospitalized adult patients, hospitalized between March and June 2021, with severe COVID-19. Patients were screened for fatty liver by ultrasound and subsequently diagnosed with NAFLD. Patients were daily followed until discharge, and demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected and correlated to clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 216 patients included, 120 (55.5%) had NAFLD. The NAFLD group had higher C-reactive protein (interquartile range [IQR]) (84.7 [38.6C129.8] mg/L vs 66.9 [32.2C97.3] mg/L; P = .0340), interleukin-6 (49.19 [22.66C92.04] ng/L vs 13.22 [5.29C39.75] ng/L; P < .0001), aspartate aminotransferase (58 [40C81] IU/L vs 46 [29C82] IU/L; P = .0123), alanine aminotransferase (51 [32C73] IU/L vs 40 [23C69] IU/L; P = .0345), and lactate dehydrogenase (391 [285C483] IU/L vs 324 [247C411] IU/L; P = .0027). The patients with NAFLD had higher disease severity assessed by 7-category ordinal scale, more frequently required high-flow nasal cannula or noninvasive ventilation (26, 21.66%, vs 10, 10.42%; P = .0289), had longer duration of hospitalization (IQR) (10 [8C15] days vs 9 [6C12] days; P = .0018), and more frequently had pulmonary thromboembolism (26.66% vs 13.54%; P = .0191).

Presently, this has been applied for modelling the tertiary structure of highly conserved eukaryotic TCTP (translationally controlled tumour protein) which is involved in a plethora of functions during growth and development and also acts as a biomarker for many cancers like lung, breast, and prostate cancer. The modelled TCTP structures of different organisms belonging to the eukaryotic group showed similar spatial arrangement of structural units except loops and similar patterns of root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation, and radius of gyration (Rg) inspected through molecular dynamics simulations. Essential dynamics (ED) analyses revealed different domains that exhibited different motions for the assistance in its multifunctional properties. Construction of a free-energy landscape (FEL) based on Rg versus RMSD was employed to characterize the folding behaviours of structures and observe that all proteins had nearly similar conformation and topologies, indicating common thermodynamic/kinetic pathways. A physico-chemical interaction study demonstrated the helices and sheets were well stabilized with ample amounts of bonding compared to turns or loops and charged residues were more accessible to solvent molecules. Hence, the current study reveals the important structural features of TCTP that aid in diverse functions in a wide range of organisms, thus extending our knowledge of TCTP and also providing a venue for designing the potent inhibitors against it.","output":"Comparative modelling unravels the structural features of eukaryotic TCTP implicated in its multifunctional properties: an in silico approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ҪsPߤϣޤǤоǥޥȥå᥿ץƥ\`λԻͨ?ϵˤ ֢ԥȥηڤ֢ԼӑBC餫ˤƤ꣬?ϵӤ򺬤Ġ خѪƤΥ󥸥饤ӤˤĠ?MФΥץƥƥå˥åγɤȣۥ ξS֙C-󥸥饤󥷥ƥδڤʾƤ룮PߤRȼǥ ʹäѪƤϺȥꥬ\`Ȥ󥸥饤󥷥ƥƾ\`?ϵήMԣ ֢Լȡȥ󥹥ȩ\`ࡹ ޤvBΰk֢ȲBv뤷Ƥ뤳ȣ ֢Լˌ뤳Υ󥸥饤ӣϵӤ˵ĤȤӯοԤʾ ǤϣPߤоɹĤˣ߲Bˤ뾀ܤxˤĤƼιڤǸh룮 Key words: Matrix metalloproteinase, angiocrine factors, endothelium, cytokine storm, molecular targeted therapy 1֢ȥޥȥå᥿ץƥ\` 籣CˤѥǥߥåJ줿 ͥʥ륹COVID19Ⱦ֢򺬤० ԸȾԼ֢˰äƣ[ ӣTNF-䣬Fas-ligand󥿩\`-1 IL-1 IL-6 ʤɤ}֢ԥȥ󣬤  IL-10  IL-1 Ԥä֢ԥ ȥѪНȤӤ ȥ󥹥ȩ\` ࡹȺФ벡BФ뤳ȤʾƤ  1 Ρȥ󥹥ȩ\`ࡹȤ~ϣ ѪֲּˤҪʸäǤֲƬ graft-versus-host disease: GVHDβB","output":"Roles of the fibrinolytic system in inflammatory diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To review the research progress of peripheral nerve mismatch regeneration, and to provide reference for its related basic research and clinical treatment.

The contribution of our study is towards determining the predictors of severity and the outcome of liver injury among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection, including patients with a preexisting liver disease and COVID-19. METHODS: This single center retrospective cohort study included all patients &#8805;18 years, admitted in Sheba Medical Center with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were obtained using the MDClone platform and rechecked after data decryption using electronic health records. RESULTS: Of 382 patients with COVID-19, 66.4% had increased liver biochemistry. Mild increase was observed in 76.7%. The higher level of fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) at admission was independently associated with higher mortality rate. Preexisting liver disease was detected in 15.4% patients. Most common etiology was nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (78.7%). The mortality of hospitalized patients with preexisting liver disease was 16.7% compared to 6.8% in patients without preexisting liver disease (RR = 2.792, P = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, liver disease adjusted to age and BMI was associated with mortality with high statistical significance.

The second aim was to compare knowledge of food insecurity between the general body of medical students and those who participated in the service learning program. METHODS: This was a cohort study at a large medical school in southeast Michigan in 2019C2020. We administered the Food Insecurity for Health Professionals (FISHP) survey to medical student participants; higher scores on the FISHP survey suggest higher knowledge and comfort with food security topics. We administered online Qualtrics surveys to the volunteer group before and after volunteering 12 hours at an urban farm. We also administered a one-time survey to a control group of medical students. We performed univariable and bivariable statistical analyses with StataSE 16. The study was exempted by the institutional IRB. RESULTS: Medical students in the volunteer group (n = 18) and the control group (n = 66) completed online surveys.

We enrolled consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure (ARF) who did not receive IMV at ICU admission. The primary outcome was the rate of IMV after ICU admission. Secondary outcomes were death at day 28 and day 60, length of ICU stay, ventilator-free days and number of patients with ventilator-free days >14 days. Data from the HFNO group were compared with those from the standard oxygen therapy (SOT) group.ResultsAmong 138 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 62 (45%) were treated with SOT alone, and 76 (55%) with HFNO. In HFNO group, 39/76 (51%) patients were intubated and 46/62 (74%) in SOT group. After using a standard logistic regression on the original sample, HFNO was associated with significantly lower rate IMV (OR [IC-95%] 0.37 [0.18 C 0.76] p = 0.007). After propensity score application, HFNO was still associated with a lower rate of intubation (OR [IC-95%] 0.31 [0.14-0.66] p = 0.002). Length of ICU stay and mortality at day 28 and day 60 did not significantly differ between HFNO and SOT groups after propensity score application. In a univariate analysis, ventilator-free days at days 28 was higher in HNFO group (21 days vs 10 days, p=0.005).

We analysed the results of 34 indicators of the Healthcare quality standard (EQA), comprising different types: treatment (4), follow-up (5), control (10), screening (7), vaccinations (4) and quaternary prevention (4). For each PCP, we calculated each indicators percentage of change in February, March and April 2020 respective to the results of the previous month; and used the T-Student test for paired data to compare them with the percentage of change in the same month of the previous year. We defined indicators with a negative effect those with a greater negative change or a lesser positive change in 2020 in comparison to 2019; and indicators with a positive effect those with a greater positive change or a lesser negative change. RESULTS: We observed a negative effect on 85% of the EQA indicators in March and 68% in April. 90% of the control indicators had a negative effect, highlighting the control of LDL cholesterol with a reduction of ? 2.69% (95%CI ? 3.17% to ? 2.23%) in March and ? 3.41% (95%CI ? 3.82% to ? 3.01%) in April; and the control of blood pressure with a reduction of ? 2.13% (95%CI ? 2.34% to ? 1.9%) and ? 2.59% (95%CI ? 2.8% to ? 2.37%). The indicators with the greatest negative effect were those of screening, such as the indicator of diabetic foot screening with a negative effect of ? 2.86% (95%CI ? 3.33% to ? 2.39%) and ? 4.13% (95%CI ? 4.55% to ? 3.71%) in March and April, respectively.

Given the global obesity prevalence, a better understanding of the mechanisms behind obese susceptibility to infection is imperative. Altered immune cell metabolism and function are often perceived as a key causative factor of dysregulated inflammation. However, the contribution of adipocytes, the dominantly altered cell type in obesity with broad inflammatory properties, to infectious disease pathogenesis remains largely ignored. Thus, skewing of adipocyte-intrinsic cellular metabolism may lead to the development of pathogenic inflammatory adipocytes, which shape the overall immune responses by contributing to either premature immunosenescence, delayed hyperinflammation, or cytokine storm in infections. In this review, we discuss the underappreciated contribution of adipocyte cellular metabolism and adipocyte-produced mediators on immune system modulation and how such interplay may modify disease susceptibility and pathogenesis of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections in obese individuals.","output":"Adipocyte inflammation and pathogenesis of viral pneumonias: an overlooked contribution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hierarchical nanoflowers of zinc oxide (ZnO) have been synthesized in the hexagonal wurtzite structure by a facile hydrothermal method.

OBJECTIVE: Using data from the 2007-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), we examined the associations between food insecurity, SNAP participation and ultra-processed food consumption. DESIGN: The study population was comprised of 9,190 adults, ages 20-65 years, with incomes 300% of the federal poverty level. Food insecurity was assessed using the Household Food Security Survey Module and SNAP participation over the past 12 months was self-reported. Dietary intake was measured from two 24-hour dietary recalls. Ultra-processed food consumption (% of total energy intake) was defined using the NOVA food classification system. Linear regression models were used to examine the associations between food insecurity, SNAP participation, and ultra-processed food consumption, adjusting for sociodemographic and health characteristics. RESULTS: More severe food insecurity was associated with higher intakes of ultra-processed foods (P-trend=0.003). The adjusted means of ultra-processed food intake ranged from 52.6% for adults with high food security to 55.7% for adults with very low food security. SNAP participation was also associated with higher intakes of ultra-processed foods (adjusted mean: 54.7%), compared to income-eligible participants (adjusted mean: 53.0%). Furthermore, the association between food insecurity and ultra-processed foods was modified by SNAP participation (P-interaction=0.02). Among income-eligible non-participants and income-ineligible non-participants, more severe food insecurity was associated with higher consumption of ultra-processed foods. Among SNAP participants, the association between food insecurity and consumption of ultra-processed foods was non-significant.

SUBJECTS: Case\\\\residents of the two nursing homes who met clinical and laboratory criteria for Legionella infection. Control\\\\residents were defined as those who were in the homes during the outbreaks and were asymptomatic. MEASUREMENTS: Active surveillance was conducted in both nursing homes to identify symptomatic residents. Residents with fever or respiratory tract symptoms had nasopharyngeal swabs taken for viral antigen detection and culture, urine for Legionella antigen detection, and acute and convalescent serology for viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella. Chest X\\\\rays were performed, and an attempt was made to obtain blood and sputum cultures.

We aimed to investigate transmission and viral load kinetics in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with mild delta variant infection in the community. METHODS: Between Sept 13, 2020, and Sept 15, 2021, 602 community contacts (identified via the UK contract-tracing system) of 471 UK COVID-19 index cases were recruited to the Assessment of Transmission and Contagiousness of COVID-19 in Contacts cohort study and contributed 8145 upper respiratory tract samples from daily sampling for up to 20 days. Household and non-household exposed contacts aged 5 years or older were eligible for recruitment if they could provide informed consent and agree to self-swabbing of the upper respiratory tract. We analysed transmission risk by vaccination status for 231 contacts exposed to 162 epidemiologically linked delta variant-infected index cases. We compared viral load trajectories from fully vaccinated individuals with delta infection (n=29) with unvaccinated individuals with delta (n=16), alpha (B.1.1.7; n=39), and pre-alpha (n=49) infections. Primary outcomes for the epidemiological analysis were to assess the secondary attack rate (SAR) in household contacts stratified by contact vaccination status and the index cases vaccination status. Primary outcomes for the viral load kinetics analysis were to detect differences in the peak viral load, viral growth rate, and viral decline rate between participants according to SARS-CoV-2 variant and vaccination status. FINDINGS: The SAR in household contacts exposed to the delta variant was 25% (95% CI 18C33) for fully vaccinated individuals compared with 38% (24C53) in unvaccinated individuals. The median time between second vaccine dose and study recruitment in fully vaccinated contacts was longer for infected individuals (median 101 days [IQR 74C120]) than for uninfected individuals (64 days [32C97], p=0001). SAR among household contacts exposed to fully vaccinated index cases was similar to household contacts exposed to unvaccinated index cases (25% [95% CI 15C35] for vaccinated vs 23% [15C31] for unvaccinated). 12 (39%) of 31 infections in fully vaccinated household contacts arose from fully vaccinated epidemiologically linked index cases, further confirmed by genomic and virological analysis in three index caseCcontact pairs. Although peak viral load did not differ by vaccination status or variant type, it increased modestly with age (difference of 039 [95% credible interval C003 to 079] in peak log(10) viral load per mL between those aged 10 years and 50 years). Fully vaccinated individuals with delta variant infection had a faster (posterior probability >084) mean rate of viral load decline (095 log(10) copies per mL per day) than did unvaccinated individuals with pre-alpha (069), alpha (082), or delta (079) variant infections. Within individuals, faster viral load growth was correlated with higher peak viral load (correlation 042 [95% credible interval 013 to 065]) and slower decline (C044 [C067 to C018]). INTERPRETATION: Vaccination reduces the risk of delta variant infection and accelerates viral clearance. Nonetheless, fully vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections have peak viral load similar to unvaccinated cases and can efficiently transmit infection in household settings, including to fully vaccinated contacts. HostCvirus interactions early in infection may shape the entire viral trajectory.

This inherent feature often leads to altered virulence, infectivity and transmissibility, and antigenic shifts to escape host immunity, which might compromise the efficacy of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Therefore, we carried out a genome-wide analysis of circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains to detect the emergence of novel co-existing mutations and trace their geographical distribution within India. Comprehensive analysis of whole genome sequences of 837 Indian SARS-CoV-2 strains revealed the occurrence of 33 different mutations, 18 of which were unique to India. Novel mutations were observed in the S glycoprotein (6/33), NSP3 (5/33), RdRp/NSP12 (4/33), NSP2 (2/33), and N (1/33). Non-synonymous mutations were found to be 3.07 times more prevalent than synonymous mutations. We classified the Indian isolates into 22 groups based on their co-existing mutations. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the representative strains of each group were divided into various sub-clades within their respective clades, based on the presence of unique co-existing mutations. The A2a clade was found to be dominant in India (71.34%), followed by A3 (23.29%) and B (5.36%), but a heterogeneous distribution was observed among various geographical regions. The A2a clade was highly predominant in East India, Western India, and Central India, whereas the A2a and A3 clades were nearly equal in prevalence in South and North India.

Methods: We conducted a cluster randomized pilot trial at a quaternary care teaching hospital. Five inpatient medical service teams were randomly allocated to two treatment arms: 1) usual care (UC), consisting of current, standard management of hypoxia and COVID-19; or 2) the Awake Prone Positioning Strategy (APPS) plus UC. Included patients had positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia and oxygen saturation less than 93% or new oxygen requirement of 3 L per minute or greater and no contraindications to prone positioning. Oxygenation measures were collected within 48 hours of eligibility and included nadir oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (S/F) ratio and time spent with S/F ratio less than 315. Concurrently, we conducted an embedded implementation evaluation using semistructured interviews with clinician and patient participants to determine contextual factors relevant to the successful conduct of a future clinical trial. The primary outcomes were drawn from an implementation science framework including acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, effectiveness, equity, feasibility, fidelity, and penetration. Results: Forty patients were included in the cluster randomized trial. Patients in the UC group (n = 13) had a median nadir S/F ratio over the 48-hour study period of 216 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 95C303) versus 253 (95% CI, 197C267) in the APPS group (n = 27).

In pursuing its mission, the Associazione Italiana Oncologia Medica (AIOM) has made every possible effort to support cancer patients, health care professionals and institutions in the decision-making processes the pandemic has engendered within this scenario. The relevant documents as well as the educational and institutional initiatives the AIOM has taken are reported in this article.","output":"COVID-19 infection in cancer patients: what has been the contribution of Associazione Italiana Oncologia Medica (AIOM) to oncological care since the beginning of the first pandemic wave?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential antiviral properties of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) against SARS-CoV-2 suggested that these drugs could be the appropriate therapeutic candidates. However, their side effects directed clinical tests towards optimizing safe utilization strategies. The noble metal nanoparticles (NP) are promising materials with antiviral and antibacterial properties that can deliver the drug to the target agent, thereby reducing the side effects. In this work, we applied both the quantum mechanical and classical atomistic molecular dynamics approaches to demonstrate the adsorption properties of HCQ/CQ on Ag, Au, AgAu, and Pt nanoparticles. We found the adsorption energies of HCQ/CQ towards nanoparticles have the following trend: PtNP > AuNP > AuAgNP > AgNP. This shows that PtNP has the highest affinity in comparison to the other types of nanoparticles.

METHODS: Of 148 survivors who consented to be registered and underwent assessments at 12 months (T1) and 18 months (T2) after the MERS outbreak, 72 (48.65%) were evaluated for chronic fatigue, depressive symptoms, and PTSSs based on the Impact of Event ScaleRevised (IES-R), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Data from 52 subjects, who completed both assessments, were analyzed using a regression-based serial multiple mediation model (PROCESS Model 6). RESULTS: Bootstrap analyses indicated no direct effects of T1 FSS on T2 IES-R but significant positive indirect effects of T1 FSS on T2 IESR through T1 PHQ-9 and T2 PHQ-9 (B=2.1601, SE=1.3268, 95% confidence interval=0.4250C6.1307). In other words, both T1 PHQ-9 and T2 PHQ-9 fully mediated the relationship between T1 FSS and T2 IES. CONCLUSION: Chronic fatigue 12 months after MERS had indirect effects on prolonged PTSSs 18 months after MERS via persisting depression in MERS survivors. This finding supports the need to promote interventional programs for emerging infectious disease survivors with chronic fatigue to reduce depression and prevent prolonged PTSSs.","output":"Depression as a Mediator of Chronic Fatigue and Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms in Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the year, the worlds attention has rightly been focused on the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the implementation of drastic mitigation strategies to limit disease transmission.

No severe complications were observed during surgery. The button remained functional for 10 days in 40 out of 48 pigs. No significant differences in body temperature or white blood cell count were observed during the trial. Three control pigs showed signs of inflammation indicating a NSAID might be warranted. Autopsy revealed minimal signs of major inflammation in the abdominal cavity or the stomach. A limited number of pigs showed mucosal inflammation, ulcers or abscesses in the stomach or around the fistula.

Although 56% of respondents replied that they could continue to visit the department if a SARS patient was admitted to the unit in the hospital before they read the information, the proportion of those who intended to continue outpatient care significantly increased by 15% after they read it.

In the Competence Network Public Health COVID-19, founded by representatives of several scientific societies in March 2020, rapid reviews are often conducted to generate evidence-based answers that are useful for policy makers. The aim of this paper is to reflect on the practical experience with rapid reviews in the context of the Competence Network Public Health. Methods for high-quality and practicable implementation of rapid reviews were developed, which are particularly helpful for rapid evidence generation based on observational studies. Methods Using the 8-step approach proposed by Tricco et al.

The 8 steps are: 1. conceptualization of the research question, 2. literature search, 3. title/abstract and full text screening, 4. data extraction, 5. risk of bias assessment, 6. evidence synthesis, 7. dissemination, 8. update. We develop a methodological approach for conducting rapid reviews by expert consensus of the members (n=42 as of 01/28/2021) of the Rapid Reviews Working Group in the Competence Network Public Health COVID-19.

All pigs of groups A and C became infected with PRRSV, according to virological techniques used (immunohistochemistry, virus isolation and virus serology). Lung, heart and tonsils were the most frequently immunolabeled tissues, and monocyte/macrophage lineage cells were the target for PRRSV in all tissues. All pigs in groups A and B also became infected with H. parasuis based on immunohistochemical and bacterial isolation results. Serosal surfaces, lung and tonsils were the most frequently immunolabeled tissues, and bacteria were found in monocyte/macrophage lineage cells as well as within neutrophil cytoplasm.

In this study, we aimed to improve the intranasal delivery of stem cells to the brain. Methods: Human neural stem cells (hNSCs) were identified using immunofluorescence, morphological, and flow cytometry assays before transplantation, and cell migration capacity was examined using the transwell assay. Cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (HI) was induced in 7-day-old rats, followed by the intranasal transplantation of CM-Dil-labeled hNSCs. We examined various experimental conditions, including preconditioning hNSCs with hypoxia, catheter method, multiple low-dose transplantation, head position, cell appropriate concentration, and volume. Rats were sacrificed 1 or 3 days after the final intranasal administration, and parts of the nasal tissue and whole brain sections were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope. Results: The isolated hNSCs met the characteristics of neural stem cells. Hypoxia (5% O2, 24 h) enhanced the surface expression of CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) (9.21  1.9% ~ 24.76  2.24%, P < 0.01) on hNSCs and improved migration (toward stromal cell-derived factor 1 [SDF-1], 0.54  0.11% ~ 8.65  1.76%, P < 0.001; toward fetal bovine serum, 8.36  0.81% ~ 21.74  0.85%, P < 0.0001). Further improvement increased the number of surviving cell distribution with increased uniformity on the olfactory epithelium and allowed the cells to stay in the nasal cavity for at least 72 h, but they did not survive for longer than 48 h. Optimization of pre-transplantation conditions augmented the success rate of intranasally delivered cells to the brain (0-41.6%). We also tentatively identified that hNSCs crossed the olfactory epithelium into the tissue space below the lamina propria, with cerebrospinal fluid entering the cribriform plate into the subarachnoid space, and then migrated toward injured areas along the brain blood vessels.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) describes the severe lung injury, which is pathologically associated with alveolar damage, inflammation, non-cardiogenic edema, and hyaline membrane formation. Because proteostatic pathways play central roles in cellular protection, immune modulation, protein degradation and tissue repair, we examined the pathological features for the unfolded protein response (UPR) using the surrogate biomarker glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2. At autopsy, immunostaining of COVID-19 lungs showed highly elevated expression of GRP78 in both pneumocytes and macrophages compared to non-COVID control lungs. GRP78 expression was detected in both SARS-CoV-2 infected and un-infected pneumocytes as determined by multiplexed immunostaining for nucleocapsid protein. In macrophages, immunohistochemical staining for GRP78 from deceased COVID-19 patients was increased but overlapped with GRP78 expression taken from surgical resections of non-COVID-19 controls. In contrast, the robust in situ GRP78 immunostaining of pneumocytes from COVID-19 autopsies exhibited no overlap and was independent of age, race/ethnicity and gender compared with non-COVID-19 controls.

The framework consists of two main engines. Wavelet transform is proposed as the framework front-end for transforming 1-D noise Raman spectrum to two-dimensional data. This two-dimensional data will be fed to the framework back-end which is a classifier. The optimum classifier is chosen by implementing several traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, and then we investigated their classification accuracy and robustness performances. The four MLs we choose included a Naive Bayes (NB), a Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Random Forest (RF) and a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) where a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) was chosen for a DL classifier. Noise-free, Gaussian noise, baseline noise, and mixed-noise Raman spectrums were applied to train and validate the ML and DCNN models. The optimum back-end classifier was obtained by testing the ML and DCNN models with several noisy Raman spectrums (10-30 dB noise power). Based on the simulation, the accuracy of the DCNN classifier is 9% higher than the NB classifier, 3.5% higher than the RF classifier, 1% higher than the KNN classifier, and 0.5% higher than the SVM classifier. In terms of robustness to the mixed noise scenarios, the framework with DCNN back-end showed superior performance than the other ML back-ends. The DCNN back-end achieved 90% accuracy at 3 dB SNR while NB, SVM, RF, and K-NN back-ends required 27 dB, 22 dB, 27 dB, and 23 dB SNR, respectively.

Participants (N = 85) dysfunction with peers was assessed in adolescence (M(age) = 13.21, SD = 3.47) by self- and parent-report, and adult depressive symptoms were assessed up to five times, up to 38 years later. Multilevel modeling was used to examine the effect of adolescent peer dysfunction on adult depressive symptoms after adjusting for familial confounds and/or individual characteristics in adolescence (e.g., baseline depressive symptoms, dysfunctional relations with siblings/parents). Both self-reported (b = 1.28, p < 0.001) and parent-reported (b = 0.56, p = 0.032) adolescent peer dysfunction were associated with greater depressive symptom severity in adulthood in unadjusted models.

METHODS: Wild-type (WT) RGCs and WT or S1R knockout (S1R KO) ONHAs were cocultured for 2, 4, or 7 days. Total and maximal neurite length, neurite root, and extremity counts were measured. Cell death was measured using a TUNEL assay. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation levels were evaluated in ONHA-derived lysates by immunoblotting. RESULTS: The coculture of WT RGCs with WT or S1R KO ONHAs increased the total and maximal neurite length. Neurite root and extremity counts increased at 4 and 7 days when WT RGCs were cocultured with WT or S1R KO ONHAs. At all timepoints, the total and maximal neurite length decreased for WT RGCs in coculture with S1R KO ONHAs compared with WT ONHAs. Root and extremity counts decreased for WT RGCs in coculture with S1R KO ONHAs compared with WT ONHAs at 2 and 7, but not 4 days.

STUDY DESIGN: We offered the study at 10 sites that provided the service in 13 states and Washington DC. Interested individuals obtained any needed preabortion tests locally and had a videoconference with a study clinician. Sites sent study packages containing mifepristone and misoprostol by mail and had remote follow-up consultations within one month by telephone (or by online survey, if the participant could not be reached) to evaluate abortion completeness. The analysis was descriptive. RESULTS: We mailed 1390 packages between May 2016 and September 2020. Of the 83% (1157/1390) of abortions for which we obtained outcome information, 95% (1103/1157) were completed without a procedure. Participants made 70 unplanned visits to emergency rooms or urgent care centers for reasons related to the abortion (6%), and 10 serious adverse events occurred, including 5 transfusions (0.4%). Enrollment increased substantially with the onset of COVID-19. Although a screening ultrasound was required, sites determined in 52% (346/669) of abortions that occurred during COVID that those participants should not get the test to protect their health. Use of urine pregnancy test to confirm abortion completion increased from 67% (144/214) in the 6 months prior to COVID to 90% (602/669) in the 6 months during COVID. Nearly all satisfaction questionnaires (99%, 1013/1022) recorded that participants were satisfied with the service. CONCLUSIONS: This direct-to-patient telemedicine service was safe, effective, and acceptable, and supports the claim that there is no medical reason for mifepristone to be dispensed in clinics as required by the Food and Drug Administration. In some cases, participants did not need to visit any facilities to obtain the service, which was critical to protecting patient safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Expansion of a direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion service in the United States and experience during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article discusses the institutional spaces, both large and small, where academic libraries may become embedded in research-related activities throughout the university It then goes on to consider some of the possible changes and outcomes as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic It outlines current research on opportunities for change in libraries, researcher demands, collaboration and the need for more research about working together It concludes by suggesting that libraries and individuals should embrace principles of 'planned happenstance' so as to expand what may be possible with our new working spaces and realities","output":"Every nook and cranny: making the library central to research and engagement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This essay explores the multifaceted underpinning that spaces provide to social affairs, in particular, educating It does this by examining a particular episode, involving spaces of educating, that reveals this support through its undermining: the sudden rushes to home and online teaching that university instructors in the US underwent in the spring of 2020 Part one of the essay outlines a practice theoretical account of the spaces of social life according to which there are three principal spaces of sociality: material spaces, activity spatialities, and places Part Two uses this account to diagnose spatial challenges that instructors faced that spring when they suddenly found themselves at home teaching The contrast between what happened then and normal educating at universities makes clear just how crucial diverse spatial features of social life can be to the successful carrying on of education practices The conclusion points out that this episode also affirms that one form of continuing education for educators is becoming conscious of, better appreciating, and acting on things they already know [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Studies in Continuing Education is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Spatial troubles with teaching under COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Circulating cell-free DNA is a possible marker of not only apoptosis, but also COVID-19 in pregnant, which can also be a trigger factor for premature birth and predicts prenatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy injury in newborns.

Methods: This retrospective review included 46 patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection. Basic clinical characteristics and detailed CT features were evaluated and compared between patients who recovered (n = 40) from coronavirus and those who expired (n = 6). Chest CT examinations for ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, and fibrosis were scored by two reviewers. The total CT score comprised the sum of lung involvement (5 lobes, scores 1-5 for each lobe, range;0, none;25, maximum) was determined. Results: We analyzed clinical data from 46 patients (26 males and 20 females;age 9-82 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. The chest CTs showed 27 (58.7%) patients had ground-glass opacity, 19 (41.3%) had ground glass and consolidation, and 35 (76.1%) patients had crazy-paving pattern. None of the patients who expired had fibrosis, in contrast to six (15%) patients who recovered from coronavirus. Most patients had subpleural lesions (89.0%), bilateral (87.0%) and lower (93.0%) lung lobe involvement. Diffuse lesions were present in four (67%) patients who succumbed to coronavirus, but only one (2.5%) patient who recovered (p = 0.000). CT identified a greater area of lung lobe involvement in patients who died (p = 0.000). In the group of patients who expired, the total CT score was higher than that of the recovery group (17.2  7.8 vs. 7.1  4.3, p = 0.005). Patients in the death group had lower lymphocyte count and higher C-reactive protein than those in the recovery group (p = 0.011 and p = 0.041, respectively). Conclusion: The CT of patients with COVID-19 mainly showed ground-glass opacity and ground-glass opacity plus consolidation, with a peripheral lower lobe preference. Early fibrosis may correlate with well prognosis. Lymphopenia, elevated C-reactive protein, and high CT score in conjunction with diffuse distribution of lung lesions are indicative of disease severity and short- term mortality.","output":"Correlation between CT findings and outcomes in 46 Patients with Coronavirus Disease-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a central eukaryotic organelle with a tubular network made of hairpin proteins linked by hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate nucleotides. Among posttranslational modifications initiated at the ER level, glycosylation is the most common reaction. However, our understanding of the impact of glycosylation on the ER structure remains unclear. Here, we show that exostosin-1 (EXT1) glycosyltransferase, an enzyme involved in N-glycosylation, is a key regulator of ER morphology and dynamics. We have integrated multiomics and superresolution imaging to characterize the broad effect of EXT1 inactivation, including the ER shape-dynamics-function relationships in mammalian cells. We have observed that inactivating EXT1 induces cell enlargement and enhances metabolic switches such as protein secretion. In particular, suppressing EXT1 in mouse thymocytes causes developmental dysfunctions associated with the ER network extension.

Unmasking the state-wise variation in the effect of the nationwide lockdown on the progression of the pandemic could inform dynamic policy interventions towards containment and mitigation. METHODS: Using data on confirmed COVID-19 cases across 20 states that accounted for more than 99% of the cumulative case counts in India till May 31, 2020, we illustrate the masking of state-level trends and highlight the variations across states by presenting evaluative evidence on some aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak: case-fatality rates, doubling times of cases, effective reproduction numbers, and the scale of testing. RESULTS: The estimated effective reproduction number R for India was 3.36 (95% confidence interval (CI): [3.03, 3.71]) on March 24, whereas the average of estimates from May 25 - May 31 stands at 1.27 (95% CI: [1.26, 1.28]). Similarly, the estimated doubling time across India was at 3.56 days on March 24, and the past 7-day average for the same on May 31 is 14.37 days. The average daily number of tests have increased from 1,717 (March 19C25) to 131,772 (May 25C31) with an estimated testing shortfall of 4.58 million tests nationally by May 31. However, various states exhibit substantial departures from these national patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of change over lockdown periods indicate the lockdown has been effective in slowing the spread of the virus nationally. The COVID-19 outbreak in India displays large state-level variations and identifying these variations can help in both understanding the dynamics of the pandemic and formulating effective public health interventions.

In late 2020, several variants of concern emerged globally, including the UK variant (B.1.1.7), the South Africa variant (B.1.351), Brazil variants (P.1 and P.2), and two related California variants of interest (B.1.429 and B.1.427). These variants are believed to have enhanced transmissibility. For the South Africa and Brazil variants, there is evidence that mutations in spike protein permit it to escape from some vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. On the basis of our extensive genome sequencing program involving 20,453 coronavirus disease 2019 patient samples collected from March 2020 to February 2021, we report identification of all six of these SARS-CoV-2 variants among Houston Methodist Hospital (Houston, TX) patients residing in the greater metropolitan area. Although these variants are currently at relatively low frequency (aggregate of 1.1%) in the population, they are geographically widespread. Houston is the first city in the United States in which active circulation of all six current variants of concern has been documented by genome sequencing. As vaccine deployment accelerates, increased genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understanding the presence, frequency, and medical impact of consequential variants and their patterns and trajectory of dissemination.","output":"Sequence Analysis of 20,453 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Genomes from the Houston Metropolitan Area Identifies the Emergence and Widespread Distribution of Multiple Isolates of All Major Variants of Concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Animal models for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus infection of humans are needed to elucidate SARS pathogenesis and develop vaccines and antivirals. We developed transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a functional receptor for the virus, under the regulation of a global promoter. A transgenic lineage, designated AC70, was among the best characterized against SARS coronavirus infection, showing weight loss and other clinical manifestations before reaching 100% mortality within 8 days after intranasal infection. High virus titers were detected in the lungs and brains of transgene-positive (Tg+) mice on days 1 and 3 after infection. Inflammatory mediators were also detected in these tissues, coinciding with high levels of virus replication. Lower virus titers were also detected in other tissues, including blood. In contrast, infected transgene-negative (Tg-) mice survived without showing any clinical illness. Pathologic examination suggests that the extensive involvement of the central nervous system likely contributed to the death of Tg+ mice, even though viral pneumonia was present. Preliminary studies with mice of a second lineage, AC63, in which the transgene expression was considerably less abundant than that in the AC70 line, revealed that virus replication was largely restricted to the lungs but not the brain. Importantly, despite significant weight loss, infected Tg+ AC63 mice eventually recovered from the illness without any mortality. The severity of the disease that developed in these transgenic mice--AC70 in particular--makes these mouse models valuable not only for evaluating the efficacy of antivirals and vaccines, but also for studying SARS coronavirus pathogenesis.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection of mice transgenic for the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 virus receptor."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Chinese Ministry of Education put forward the requirement of turning offline education into online teaching to universities.

It is transmitted by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and affects the respiratory tract as well as extra-pulmonary systems, including the pancreas, that express the virus entry receptor, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Importantly, the endocrine and exocrine pancreas, the latter composed of ductal and acinar cells, express high levels of ACE2, which correlates to impaired functionality characterized as acute pancreatitis observed in some cases presenting with COVID-19. Since acute pancreatitis is already one of the most frequent gastrointestinal causes of hospitalization in the U.S. and the majority of studies investigating the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the pancreas are clinical and observational, we utilized human iPSC technology to investigate the potential deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures containing endocrine and exocrine cells. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting iPSC-derived pancreatic cells, thus perturbing their normal molecular and cellular phenotypes. The infection increased a key inflammatory cytokine, CXCL12, known to be involved in pancreas dysfunction. Transcriptome analysis of infected pancreatic cultures confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the ribosomal machinery in these cells. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of the pancreas is confirmed in post-mortem tissues from COVID-19 patients, which showed co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 in pancreatic endocrine and exocrine cells and increased the expression of some pancreatic ductal stress response genes. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect human iPSC-derived pancreatic cells with supporting evidence of presence of the virus in post-mortem pancreatic tissue of confirmed COVID-19 human cases. This novel model of iPSC-derived pancreatic cultures will open new avenues for the comprehension of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially establish a platform for endocrine and exocrine pancreas-specific antiviral drug screening.","output":"Deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human pancreatic cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Few data are available on the prognosis of older patients who received corticosteroids for COVID-19.

METHODS: We conducted a multicentric retrospective cohort study in 15 acute COVID-19 geriatric wards in the Paris area from March to April 2020 and November 2020 to May 2021. We included all consecutive patients aged 70 years and older who were hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 in these wards. Propensity score and multivariate analyses were used. RESULTS: Of the 1 579 patients included (535 received corticosteroids), the median age was 86 (interquartile range 81C91) years, 56% of patients were female, the median Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was 2.6 (interquartile range 1C4), and 64% of patients were frail (Clinical Frailty Score 5C9). The propensity score analysis paired 984 patients (492 with and without corticosteroids). The in-hospital mortality was 32.3% in the matched cohort. On multivariate analysis, the probability of in-hospital mortality was increased with corticosteroid use (odds ratio [OR] = 2.61 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63C4.20]).

Reasons for not having a manipulation were cited a possibility child would not tolerate procedure under entonox and intranasal diamorphine and not having a sedation trained practitioner free to administer intravenous sedation instead. This resulted in the remainder requiring admission for manipulation under anaesthetic. Given the concerns re noscomial COVID 19 transmission as well as lack of theatre capacity in the first wave of the pandemic, a change was made to our forearm fracture guideline in partnership with the Orthopaedic team with emphasis on attempt at manipulation in the emergency department with entonox and intranasal diamorphine prior to admission to actively avoid as many admissions as possible. Given this change is practice we wanted to ascertain parent/patient satisfaction with this and see if this reduced hospital admission. Objectives . Ascertain if promoting manipulation of forearm fracture as first line treatment is effective at avoiding hospital admission and subsequent further manipulation in theatre and reduces admission rates compared to previous audit data . Ascertain if using entonox and intranasal diamorphine for the manipulation of forearm fractures was perceived by parents to be satisfactory pain relief for the procedure . Ascertain if using entonox and intranasal diamorphine for the manipulation of forearm fractures provides a satisfactory patient experience Methods A specially designed parental/patient experience survey was developed and given out to patients requiring a forearm manipulation in CED between June - October 2020. Retrospective case notes review of all patients <16 years attending CED with a forearm fracture during the same period to identify management and outcome. Results During the survey period 47 children attended CED with a forearm fracture requiring manipulation. Of these 21 parents completed the survey. Overall 85% of all patients attending CED with a forearm fracture requiring manipulation had it done in CED compared to 34% in 2018. 100% of survey respondents felt their child's pain was well managed during the procedure.

This study aims to provide an updated review of pharmacological agents that have been developed and/or repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19. To this end, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Google Scholar, and LitCovid databases. Relevant clinical studies on drugs used in the management of COVID-19 were identified and evaluated in terms of evidence of efficacy and safety. To date, the FDA has approved three therapies for the treatment of COVID-19 Emergency Use Authorization: convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and casirivimab/imdevimab (REGN-COV2). Drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir, umifenovir, favipiravir, anakinra, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, interferons, tissue plasminogen activator, intravenous immunoglobulins, and nafamosat have been used off-label with mixed therapeutic results. Adjunctive administration of corticosteroids is also very common. The clinical experience with these approved and repurposed drugs is limited, and data on efficacy for the new indication are not strong. Overall, the response of the global scientific community to the COVID-19 pandemic has been impressive, as evident from the volume of scientific literature elucidating the molecular biology and pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and the approval of three new drugs for clinical management. Reviewed studies have shown mixed data on efficacy and safety of the currently utilized drugs. The lack of standard treatment for COVID-19 has made it difficult to interpret results from most of the published studies due to the risk of attribution error.

Immunologically, in tracheobronchial lymph nodes (TBLN) detected enhanced H1N2-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) in Nano-11-KAg+Poly(I:C) vaccinates, and in commercial vaccinates detected CTLs with mainly IL-17A(+) and early effector phenotypes specific to both H1N2 and H1N1 SwAIV. In commercial vaccinates, activated H1N2- and H1N1-specific IFN(+)&TNF(+), IL-17A(+) and central memory T-helper/Memory cells, and in Nano-11-KAg+Poly(I:C) vaccinates H1N2-specific central memory, IFN(+) and IFN(+)&TNF(+), and H1N1-specific IL-17A(+) T-helper/Memory cells were observed.

Different types of stress are affecting diverse organizational outcomes, including the employees voluntary turnover. This is the case of cognitive stress, a type of stress that affects how individuals process information, which can influence employees turnover intentions. In this study, we look at the mechanisms that can reduce the adverse effects of cognitive stress on turnover intentions, particularly the role of employees perceived psychological safety (i.e., how safe they perceive the interactions with their colleagues are). We hypothesize that psychological safety mediates the relationship between cognitive stress and turnover intentions, and COVID-19 worry and supervisor support moderate the relationship between cognitive stress and psychological safety. To test our hypothesis, we invited two public health care organizations in Chile to join this study. In total, we obtained a sample of 146 employees in 21 different teams. Using a multilevel model, we found that psychological safety prevents the harmful effects of cognitive stress on employees turnover intentions. In addition, while COVID-19 worry can worsen the relationship between cognitive stress and psychological safety, supervisor support only directly affects psychological safety. This study contributes to expanding the stress and psychological safety literature and informs practitioners in healthcare organizations about how to deal with cognitive stress in the new normality that the pandemic has brought.","output":"Stress and Turnover Intentions Within Healthcare Teams: The Mediating Role of Psychological Safety, and the Moderating Effect of COVID-19 Worry and Supervisor Support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The corona pandemic has changed the learning method from conventional to a more flexible one, such as through the internet.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 305 adolescents with chronic immunocompromised conditions and 82 healthy adolescents. Online surveys were completed, which included questions on socio-demographic data and self-rated healthcare routine during COVID-19 quarantine and the following validated questionnaires: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL4.0), and Pediatric Outcome Data Collection Instrument (PODCI). RESULTS: The median current age [14 (10-18) vs. 15 (10-18) years, p=0.847] and frequency of female sex (62% vs. 58%, p=0.571) were similar in adolescents with chronic conditions compared with healthy adolescents. The frequency of poor sleep quality was similar in both groups (38% vs. 48%, p=0.118). Logistic regression analysis, including both healthy adolescents and adolescents with chronic conditions (n=387), demonstrated that self-reported increase in screen time (odds ratio [OR] 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-6.8; p=0.008) and intrafamilial violence report (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2-3.5; p=0.008) were independently associated with poor sleep quality in these adolescents. However, the PODCI global function score was associated with a lower OR for poor sleep quality (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.94-0.99; p=0.001). Further logistic regression, including only adolescents with chronic conditions (n=305), demonstrated that self-reported increase in screen time (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.4-6.8; p=0.006) and intrafamilial violence report (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.2-3.4; p=0.011) remained independently associated with poor quality of sleep, whereas a lower PODCI global function score was associated with a lower OR for sleep quality (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.94-0.98; p<0.001).

Unusual thrombotic events have also been reported, e.g., cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, mesenteric artery and vein thrombosis. Several hematology abnormalities have been observed in COVID-19 patients, including lymphopenia, neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia (usually mild), thrombocytosis, elevated prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin times (the latter abnormality often indicating lupus anticoagulant phenomenon), hyperfibrinogenemia, elevated von Willebrand factor levels, and elevated fibrin d-dimer.

Following the outbreak, we find an unprecedented drop in maritime mobility, across all categories of commercial shipping. The reduced activity is observable from March to June, when the most severe restrictions were in force, producing a variation of mobility quantified between -5.62% and -13.77% for container ships, between 2.28% and -3.32% for dry bulk, between -0:22% and -9.27% for wet bulk, and between -19.57% and -42.77% for passenger shipping.

We used a Bayesian evolutionary model, to infer phylogenetic trees and migration rates between two pathogen populations defined by their host-species. In order to account for sampling bias, sub-population structure was inferred using the marginal approximation of the structured coalescent (Mascot) implemented in BEAST2. We included 167 SB0821 strains (21 isolated from badgers and 146 from cattle) and identified 171 single nucleotide polymorphisms. We selected a HKY model and a strict molecular clock. We estimated a badger-to-cattle transition rate (median: 2.2 transitions/lineage/year) 52 times superior to the cattle-to-badger rate (median: 0.042 transitions/lineage/year). Using the maximum clade credibility tree, we identified that over 75% of the lineages from 1989 to 2000 were present in badgers. In addition, we calculated a median of 64 transition events from badger-to-cattle (IQR: 10C91) and a median of zero transition event from cattle-to-badger (IQR: 0C3).

During the Covid-19 emergency, home PCPs presented a lower burnout frequency (p<.001) and higher level of personal accomplishment than in 2016 (p=.047). Conversely, the risk for psychological morbidity was significantly higher during the pandemic (p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: In the age of Covid-19, the awareness of being at the forefront of containing the pandemic along with the sense of responsibility toward their high-risk patients may arouse PCPs psychological distress, but, on the other hand, this condition may improve their sense of professional satisfaction and personal accomplishment.","output":"CARING ADVANCED CANCER PATIENTS AT HOME DURING COVID-19 OUTBREAK: BURNOUT AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MORBIDITY AMONG PALLIATIVE CARE PROFESSIONALS IN ITALY"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social scientists and psychologists take interest in understanding how people express emotions and sentiments when dealing with catastrophic events such as natural disasters, political unrest, and terrorism. The COVID-19 pandemic is a catastrophic event that has raised a number of psychological issues such as depression given abrupt social changes and lack of employment. Advancements of deep learning-based language models have been promising for sentiment analysis with data from social networks such as Twitter. Given the situation with COVID-19 pandemic, different countries had different peaks where rise and fall of new cases affected lock-downs which directly affected the economy and employment. During the rise of COVID-19 cases with stricter lock-downs, people have been expressing their sentiments in social media. This can provide a deep understanding of human psychology during catastrophic events. In this paper, we present a framework that employs deep learning-based language models via long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks for sentiment analysis during the rise of novel COVID-19 cases in India. The framework features LSTM language model with a global vector embedding and state-of-art BERT language model. We review the sentiments expressed for selective months in 2020 which covers the major peak of novel cases in India. Our framework utilises multi-label sentiment classification where more than one sentiment can be expressed at once. Our results indicate that the majority of the tweets have been positive with high levels of optimism during the rise of the novel COVID-19 cases and the number of tweets significantly lowered towards the peak. We find that the optimistic, annoyed and joking tweets mostly dominate the monthly tweets with much lower portion of negative sentiments. The predictions generally indicate that although the majority have been optimistic, a significant group of population has been annoyed towards the way the pandemic was handled by the authorities.","output":"COVID-19 sentiment analysis via deep learning during the rise of novel cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is widely regarded as one of the most important global public health challenges of the twenty-first century. The overuse and the improper use of antibiotics in human medicine, food production, and the environment as a whole have unfortunately contributed to this issue. Many major international scientific, political, and social organizations have warned that the increase in AMR could cost the lives of millions of people if it is not addressed on a global scale. Although AMR is already a challenge in clinical practice today, it has taken on a new importance in the face of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While improved handwashing techniques, social distancing, and other interventional measures may positively influence AMR, the widespread use of antibiotics to treat or prevent bacterial coinfections, especially in unconfirmed cases of COVID-19, may have unintended negative implications with respect to AMR. Although the exact number of bacterial coinfections and the rate at which patients with COVID-19 receive antibiotic therapy remain to be accurately determined, the pandemic has revived the discussion on antibiotic overuse and AMR.

METHODS Prospective longitudinal study of 103 patients with inadequate glycaemic control who underwent gastric bypass surgery at Soonchunhyang University, Seoul, Korea (n = 66) and Min-Sheng General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan (n = 37). Procedures were performed August 2009 to January 2011. Key outcome measures were excellent glycaemic control of Type 2 diabetes defined as HbA1c < 42 mmol/mol (6%); inadequate response defined as HbA1c > 53 mmol/mol (> 7%). Analysis was conducted using binary logistic regression, and cut-points obtained from receiver operator characteristics. RESULTS Excellent glycaemic control was achieved in 31 (30%) at 1 year. Diabetes duration of < 7 years and BMI > 27 kg/m(2) provided independent predictors and useful cut-points. Likelihood of excellent glycaemic control for an individual could be estimated using loge (Odds) = -6.7 + (0.26  BMI) + (-1.2  diabetes duration). Baseline BMI of < 27 kg/m(2) and baseline C-peptide of < 2.0ng/ml, best predicted a poor glycaemic response. In those with favourable baseline characteristics percentage weight loss (%WL) had a dominant influence on glycaemic outcomes. Baseline C-peptide (> 2.4 ng/ml) and subsequent percentage weight loss (> 16%) were associated with excellent glycaemic control. Higher BMI was associated with greater percentage weight loss. CONCLUSION In patients with Type 2 diabetes and BMI < 30 kg/m(2) , glycaemic response to gastric bypass is predicted by higher baseline BMI, shorter disease duration and higher fasting C-peptide. Post-surgery weight loss has a dominant effect. Baseline BMI and weight loss have a major influence on outcomes.","output":"Gastric bypass in Type 2 diabetes with BMI < 30: weight and weight loss have a major influence on outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of duloxetine when added to oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee with pain of moderate or greater severity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This was a 10-week randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose (duloxetine 60/120 mg/day), placebo-controlled trial that enrolled adult outpatients who had persistent moderate pain (4 on a 0-10 numerical rating scale) due to OA of the knee, despite, per protocol, having received optimized oral NSAID therapy (specific drug, dose, and frequency at investigator discretion). CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT01018680. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Patients entered daily pain ratings in a telephone-based diary. The primary efficacy outcome was the weekly mean of the daily average pain rating at week 8. Safety outcomes were assessed during the entire 10-week study. RESULTS A total of 524 patients randomly received duloxetine 60/120 mg/day (N = 264) or placebo (N = 260). In total, 74% of the patients completed the study. Mean age was 61 years (SD 9.2), 57% were female, and 81% were white. Duloxetine-treated patients had significantly greater pain reduction at week 8 (p < 0.001) than placebo-treated patients. In addition, relative to placebo at week 8, duloxetine-treated patients had significant improvements in physical function as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (p < 0.001), and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (p < 0.001). Compared to placebo, significantly more nausea, dry mouth, constipation, fatigue and decreased appetite were reported by patients taking duloxetine (each p < 0.05). Discontinuation due to adverse events occurred more commonly in the duloxetine group than the placebo group (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION Duloxetine added to oral NSAID therapy provided additional significant pain reduction, improved function, and patient-rated impression of improvement. Adverse events were consistent with those seen in previous duloxetine trials. The short duration of the study may not reflect the longer term efficacy and safety of NSAID/duloxetine cotherapy.","output":"Duloxetine added to oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment of knee pain due to osteoarthritis: results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the causal relationship between social and political trust in a low trust society, a setting where this topic has received very little attention.

Our empirical analysis is based on a 4-wave panel survey applied to a representative sample of 2000 Chilean adults interviewed face to face each year between 2016 and 2019. Based on statistical models with varying specifications and assumptions, we find support for the institutionalist view that claims that political trust exercises a positive influence over social trust. However, contrary to recent findings for some European democracies (S?nderskov & Dinesen 2016, Seifert 2018), we also find that social trust positively affects political trust.

This data was combined with information about industries according to whether they were likely or possibly essential during the COVID-19 pandemic and the frequency of exposure to infections and close proximity to others by occupation. The percentage of workers employed in essential industries and occupations with a high risk of infection and close proximity to others by race and ethnicity was calculated. RESULTS: People of color were more likely to be employed in essential industries and in occupations with more exposure to infections and close proximity to others. Black workers in particular faced an elevated risk for all of these factors. CONCLUSION: Occupational segregation into high-risk industries and occupations likely contributes to differential risk with respect to COVID-19.

However, while many traditional dieting, food tracking and weight loss coaching programs result in short-term weight loss, there is less evidence of their effectiveness on sustaining weight loss over time. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1,740 adults with obesity who used Foodsmart, a digital personalized dietary assessment, meal planning and food purchasing platform. Participants reported age, gender, at least three measures of weight, and their diet using a food frequency questionnaire. We defined sustained weight loss as participants who lost 5 % of initial weight between their first and second reported weights and lost weight or maintained weight between second and third reported weights. A healthy eating score, Nutriscore, was calculated to assess overall diet quality. We used multivariate logistic regression models to examine the association between user characteristics and odds of sustained weight loss. RESULTS: Over a median of 25 months, the mean (standard deviation) change in weight among participants was ? 6.2 (19.8) pounds. In total, 39.3 % (684/1,740) of participants lost at least 5 % of their initial weight, and 22.4 % percent (389/1,740) of participants sustained weight loss. In the fully-adjusted logistic regression model, we found that obesity class 2 (odds ratio, OR: 1.69, 95 % confidence interval, CI: 1.27C2.24, P < 0.001), obesity class 3 (OR: 2.23, 95 % CI: 1.68C2.97, P < 0.001), baseline diet quality (OR: 1.06, 95 % CI: 1.02C1.09, P < 0.001), and greater change in diet quality (OR: 1.10, 95 % CI: 1.07C1.14, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with sustained weight loss.

Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals as the outbreak evolves. On the basis of a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R(0)), and the per day infection mortality and recovery rates. By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the total population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged. Based on the reported data, the expected value of R(0) as computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be 4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be 3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R(0) was found to be 2.6 based on confirmed cases and 2 based on the second scenario. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 180,000 (with a lower bound of 45,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February reported data, the death toll might exceed 2,700 (as a lower bound) by February 29. Our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio from January 26 to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly because of the fact that the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population most likely are much higher than the reported ones. Thus, in a scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around 0.15% in the total population. Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February.","output":"Data-based analysis, modelling and forecasting of the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To transfer the viral genome into the host cell cytoplasm, internalized influenza A virus (IAV) particles depend on the fusion of the IAV envelope with host endosomal membranes.

Physical therapists were uniquely challenged during the pandemic, requiring a reassessment of techniques and strategies in order to best support patients. The purpose of this case report is to describe a musculoskeletal institution's experience with implementing telehealth physical therapy. METHODS (CASE DESCRIPTION): Previous telehealth experience enabled the infrastructure of a wide-scale adoption across institutions response to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, to fill in training gaps for HSS outpatient physical therapists, HSS Rehabilitation developed a robust education and implementation program. This training was influenced by clinician and patient surveys as well as the development of a published HSS Rehabilitation telehealth guide. Prior to performing telehealth physical therapist visits, clinicians were required to complete all training material to ensure comfortability and confidence. RESULTS: The adoption of telehealth among clinicians was born out of necessaity, however the speed in which HSS rehabilitation pivoted was critical to avoid lapses in care. In a four week period after the NYC shelter in-place orders, 173 therapists were trained and performing virtual visits. HSS rehabilitation determined telehealth physical therapy had quicker access to care, similar patient satisifaction, and increase geographical outreach when compared to in-person care. CONCLUSIONS: The tranisition to telehealth physical therapy included a multi-step process that provided clinician training, establishment of protocols and guidelines, and obtaining a better understanding of the patient experience.

However, because OSD is incapable of signal amplification, the signal-to-noise ratio or the observable signal change may be usually not significant enough to satisfy practical usage. With the purpose to overcome this challenge, herein a more advanced and practical sensing principle is developed with the OSD replaced by an amplifiable nucleic acid circuit, hybridization chain reaction (HCR). The very contagious norovirus (NoV) was employed as the model target. Compared with LAMP-OSD, the LAMP-HCR can detect as few as 30 copies of NoV gene in 2% fecal samples with significantly enlarged signal change and signal-to-background ratio. Therefore, more reliable detection is achieved. Moreover, due to the high compatibility of HCR, the final LAMP-HCR products can be flexibly transduced into different types of readouts, including fluorescence, flow cytometer (FCM) and even a personal glucose meter (PGM). This further enlarges the operating environments for the detection from hospital labs, bedsides, to potential off-the-shelf devices in local pharmacies.

A major clinical question is whether it is safe to undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) shortly after COVID-19 infection. A total of 21 patients received HSCT following a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection at our institution between 7/30/2020 and 4/14/2021. The majority (n=13, 62%) received an allogeneic (ALLO) HSCT from an HLA-matched related (n=5), -matched unrelated (n=6), or haploidentical (n=2) donor. The remaining 8 patients received autologous (AUTO) HSCT. Among ALLO-HSCT recipients, 4 (31%), 5 (38%), 3 (23%), and 1 (8%) patients had grade 1, 2, 3, and 4, manifestations respectively, scored according to the WHO COVID-19 infection severity grading system. Among AUTO-HSCT recipients, 5 (62%), 1 (12%), and 2 (25%) patients had grade 0, 1, and 2 manifestations, respectively. All patients had resolution of COVID-19 symptoms before HSCT. In recipients of ALLO-SCT, the median time from diagnosis of the COVID infection to HSCT was 134 (range: 55-311) days. Median age of recipients was 53 (range: 17-71) years and the majority (69%) of patients were male. Only one patient was <18 years old, and 38% were >60 years. Patients received ALLO-HSCT for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (n=7, 54%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=2, 15%), chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (n=2, 15%), and Hodgkin's (n=1, 8%) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=1, 15%). Most (62%) patients were not in remission at the time of HSCT. The median hematopoietic cell transplant-co-morbidity index (HCT-CI) score was 3 (range 0-6);one patient had a history of diabetes and another of hypertension before HSCT. Conditioning regimen was myeloablative in 61%, and stem cell source was peripheral blood (PB) in 92% of transplants. Median time to neutrophils engraftment was 15 (range: 10-20) days. With a median follow-up of 3.5 (range: 0.4-8) months since ALLO-HSCT, two patients died and another two experienced progression of the underlying malignancy. Three patients were diagnosed with grade 2 and none with grade 3 or 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). The deaths occurred among patients with COVID-19 infection grade 2 and 3. The primary cause of death was attributed to alveolar hemorrhage/pneumonitis (no organism identified) and acute GvHD, respectively. Overall survival was 89% (95% confidence interval [CI]:43-98) and 76% (95% CI 33-93) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. In recipients of AUTO-HSCT, the median time from diagnosis of the COVID-19 infection to HSCT was 55 (range: 20-157) days. Median age of recipients was 55 (range: 34-75) years, and the majority (62%) of patients were male. One (12%) patient was >60 years. Patients received AUTO-HSCT for treatment of Hodgkin's (n=1, 15%) or non-Hodgkin's (n=4, 50%) lymphoma, or multiple myeloma (n=3, 37%). Six (75%) patients were in remission at the time of HSCT. The median HCT-CI score was 2 (range 0-6). None of the patients had a history of diabetes or hypertension before transplant. Conditioning regimen was myeloablative and stem cell source was PB for all patients. Median time to neutrophils engraftment was 10 (range: 9-13) days. With a median follow-up of 4 (range: 0.8-9) months since AUTO-HSCT, one patient with grade 1 COVID infection died as a result of a candida/cytomegalovirus infection, and none of the patients experienced progression of the underlying malignancy. Overall survival was 100% and 75% (95% CI 13-96) at 3 and 6 months respectively. After HSCT, one ALLO and two AUTO asymptomatic patients had a positive nasal swab COVID-19 PCR assay possibly due to delayed shedding of the virus. None of the 21 patients developed active COVID infections post-transplant. In conclusion, allogeneic and autologous hematopoietic transplantation can be performed in patients after COVID-19 infection. Two of 13 allogeneic and one of 8 autologous recipients experienced non-relapse mortality, none directly related to COVID-19 infection.

Few days after the event an aerial survey operated by an RGB camera Sony ILCE-7RM2-a7R II was done with the aim of testing a digital photogrammetry-based 3D rapid mapping of fire effects. Flight altitude was about 800 m above ground level (AGL) determining an average image GSD of about 0.2 m. Image block adjustment was performed in Agisoft PhotoScan vs 1.2.4 using 18 ground control points that were recognized over true color orthoimages (GSD = 0.4 m). Height values of GCPs were obtained from a 5 m grid size DTM. Both orthoimages and DTM were obtained for free from the Piemonte Region Cartographic Office (ICE dataset 2010). A point cloud, having an average density of 7 pt/m(2) and covering 14 km(2) was generated, filtered and regularized to generate the correspondent DSM (Digital Surface Model) with a grid size of 0.5 m. With reference to the above-mentioned ICE DTM, a Canopy Height Model (CHM) was generated by grid differencing with a grid size of 0.5 m. A true-orthoimage was also generated having a GSD of 0.5 m. The latter was used to map burned areas by a pixel based unsupervised classification approach operating with reference to the pseudo GNDVI image, previously computed from the native red and green bands (no radiometric calibration was applied aimed at converting back the raw digital numbers to reflectance). Results were compared with 2 official datasets that were generated after the event from satellite data, one produced by the Piemonte Region and the other one by the Copernicus Emergency System. In order to test differences between burned and not-burned areas, point density, point spacing and canopy heights were computed and compared looking for evidences of geometrical differences possibly characterizing burned areas in respect of the not burned ones. Results showed that no significant differences were found between point density and point spacing in burned and not burned area. There was a significant difference in CHM minimum values distribution between burned and not-burned areas while maximum values distribution does not change significantly, proving that fire change crown structure but tree height remain unchanged.

Theoretically, pay transparency represents an information shock that alters the bargaining power of male and female employees vis-\\\\\`a-vis the firm in an asymmetric way. As women are currently underpaid, this shock may improve women's relative outcomes. We test these theoretical predictions using a difference-in-difference strategy that exploits the variation in the UK mandate across firm size and time. Our results show that pay transparency increases the probability that women are hired in above-median-wage occupations by 5 percent compared to the pre-policy mean. Additionally, it leads to a 2.8 percent decrease in male real hourly pay in treated firms compared to control ones. Combining the difference-in-difference strategy with a text analysis of job listings, we also find suggestive evidence that treated firms in industries with a high gender pay gap become more likely to post wage information than firms in the control group.","output":"Pay Transparency and Cracks in the Glass Ceiling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: Palliative care access is fundamental to the highest attainable standard of health and a core component of universal health coverage. Forging universal palliative care access is insurmountable without strategically optimizing the nursing workforce and integrating palliative nursing into health systems at all levels. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored both the critical need for accessible palliative care to alleviate serious health-related suffering and the key role of nurses to achieve this goal. OBJECTIVES: 1) Summarize palliative nursing contributions to the expansion of palliative care access; 2) identify emerging nursing roles in alignment with global palliative care recommendations and policy agendas; 3) promote nursing leadership development to enhance universal access to palliative care services. METHODS: Empirical and policy literature review; best practice models; recommendations to optimize the palliative nursing workforce. RESULTS: Nurses working across settings provide a considerable untapped resource that can be leveraged to advance palliative care access and palliative care program development. Best practice models demonstrate promising approaches and outcomes related to education and training, policy and advocacy, and academic-practice partnerships. CONCLUSION: An estimated 28 million nurses account for 59% of the international healthcare workforce and deliver up to 90% of primary health services. It has been well-documented that nurses are often the first or only healthcare provider available in many parts of the world. Strategic investments in international and interdisciplinary collaboration, as well as policy changes and the safe expansion of high-quality nursing care, can optimize the efforts of the global nursing workforce to mitigate serious health-related suffering. KEY MESSAGE: Achieving universal palliative care access is a global social justice priority. Nurses are critical to strategically realizing this vision. Health system leaders, interdisciplinary partners, and policy makers must support nurses to practice to the full extent of their education and licensure to provide high-quality palliative care services for populations worldwide.","output":"Optimizing the Global Nursing Workforce to Ensure Universal Palliative Care Access and Alleviate Serious Health-Related Suffering Worldwide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic vomiting in cats is a common presenting problem seen in veterinary practice today.

Acute kidney injury was defined and staged according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. The cohort included 152 patients; 97 acute-COVID-19 and 55 with MIS-C associated with COVID-19. Acute kidney injury occurred in 8 with acute-COVID-19 and in 10 with MIS-C. Acute kidney injury, in unadjusted models, was associated with a lower serum albumin level (odds ratio 0.17; 95% confidence interval 0.07, 0.39) and higher white blood cell counts (odds ratio 1.11; 95% confidence interval 1.04, 1.2). Patients with MIS-C and acute kidney injury had significantly greater rates of systolic dysfunction, compared to those without (80% vs 49%). In unadjusted models, patients with acute kidney injury had 8.4 days longer hospitalizations compared to patients without acute kidney injury (95% confidence interval, 4.4-6.7).

To simplify clinical translation, we sought a superior drug delivery method that circumvents risks associated with IVT injections. Methods We compared the pharmacokinetics of a single 40 g subconjunctival (SCJ) depot to the reported effective 5 g IVT injections of THX-B. We quantified therapeutic efficacy, with endpoints of inflammation, edema, and neuronal death. Results The subconjunctival depot affords retinal exposure equal to IVT injection, without resulting in detectable drug in circulation. At week 2 of diabetic retinopathy, the SCJ depot provided therapeutic efficacy similar to IVT injections, with reduced inflammation, reduced edema, reduced neuronal death, and a long-lasting protection of the retinal structure. Conclusions Subconjunctival injections are a safe and effective route for retinal delivery of p75NTR antagonists.

Using cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, we assessed the impact of malnutrition risk on healthcare utilization and costs in a cohort of older adults living in Spanish community. Patients and Methods Data from 1660 older (range 66-98 years), community-living adults participating in the Toledo Study on Healthy Ageing, waves 2 (year 2011-2013) and 3 (year 2015), were analyzed. Nutritional status categories were defined according to the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria, using a two-step approach. First, screening for malnutrition risk. Once positive, individuals were classified as malnourished according to some phenotypic (body mass index, grip strength, and unintentional weight loss) and etiologic (disease burden/inflammation and reduced food intake or assimilation) criteria. Outcomes assessed included healthcare resources (hospital admissions, number of hospitalizations, length of hospital stay per hospitalization, and number of medications). Results Fifteen percent of the population was found to be at risk of malnutrition, while 12.6% was malnourished. Overall, patients from both groups were older, had lower functional status, and had more comorbidities compared to well-nourished counterparts (p<0.05). Results of our cross-sectional analysis showed that being at-risk/malnourished was associated with greater medication utilization, higher rates of hospital admission and longer stays, and higher hospitalization costs. However, when adjusting for covariates, malnutrition/risk was associated only with higher hospitalization costs (range: 11-13%). Longitudinal analysis results indicated that malnutrition/risk was significantly associated with more frequent hospitalizations, longer lengths of stay, higher hospitalization costs, and polypharmacy at follow-up. Conclusion Malnutrition or its risk, found in over one of four older adults in the Toledo community, was associated with higher healthcare resource use and increased costs. Such findings suggest that malnutrition risk-screening for older adults, and provision of nutrition counseling and care when needed, hold potential to improve their health and to lower costs of care in the Spanish healthcare system.","output":"Malnutrition Prevalence and Burden on Healthcare Resource Use Among Spanish Community-Living Older Adults: Results of a Longitudinal Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has already had a devastating impact on economic and social development and people's life all over the world Up to September 22nd, 2020, more than 30 million people have been infected Finding out how to predict and estimate the pandemic trend precisely is of huge necessity because COVID-19 has made the world economy in a recession and deprived over 700 thousand lives This paper is dedicated to making a comparison between conventional machine learning regression models, including ridge regression and lasso regression, and multivariate polynomial regression Besides, we attempt to use statewide data to fit nationwide data in the US, proposing a novel aspect to forecast pandemic trend Under the current situation, insufficient data limit the use of machine learning To address the issue of data deficiency, a classification model based on neural network with Twitter data is applied This gives out an alternative approach to estimate daily increase of infected people We discovered that in a different period, specific models would outweigh another models' performance Also, our result showed that the data of Georgia and Massachusetts could represent the whole nation data with linear transformations And this paper verified that using alternative data that relate to the COVID-19 situation to alleviate data deficiency is feasible ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Machine Learning Methods on COVID-19 Situation Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The gastrointestinal helminth, Teladorsagia circumcincta, is one of the major health risks and production-limiting diseases in small ruminant populations, particularly in temperate regions. With the increasing importance of disease management and recruited anthelmintic resistant types, accurate approaches are needed for the diagnosis of the infection in the host. Due to uncertain results using faecal examinations, the ELISA method was indicated for the detection of nematode antigenic materials. Despite some promising results, problems were described in terms of test specificity and cross-reactions. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the IgG response to worm somatic and excretory/secretory (ES) products using western blot analysis and an indirect ELISA for the detection of T. circumcincta infection in sheep. RESULTS: Based on the immuno-reactivity analysis, immunogenic fractions with molecular weights (MWs) of approximately 60, 75 and 100 kDa were detected in somatic content and two antigens of about 63 and 75 kDa in ES material. Accordingly, a specific product at 75 kDa had the strongest reaction and appeared as the most common antigenic protein. In ELISA, all the sera from the infected sheep revealed the OD rates above the calculated cut-off value with about two-fold greater average. Negative control samples were also specifically recognized with the mean OD rate of about 1/3 of the estimated cut-off value. The cross-reaction test, using rabbit anti-T. circumcincta IgG, did not show reactivity with the ES antigens of other prevalent nematodes including Haemonchus contortus, Protostrongylus rufescens and Marshallagia marshalli. In contrast, a strong positive reaction was observed with the somatic antigens of M. marshalli. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicated that the indirect ELISA method using the ES content enables distinguishing the T. circumcincta infected sheep with high specificity. Those antigenic ES peptides with 63 and particularly 75 kDa MWs should be further investigated due to the potential for serological diagnostic methods and immunoprotective targets in the host.

METHODS: This mixed method study included two qualitative and quantitative phases. In the qualitative phase, triangulation approach was applied by using semi-structured interviews with key informants, documents review and direct observation. Data content analysis was conducted through policy analysis triangle framework. In the quantitative phase, food items available in 64 canteens of primary schools of Tehran province were gathered. The food's nutrient data were evaluated using their nutrition facts label. The number and proportion of foods that met the criteria based on Iran's HSC guideline and the World Health Organization nutrient profile model for the Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO-EMR) were determined. RESULTS: The main contextual factors that affected adoption of HSC policy included health (nutritional transition, high prevalence of non-communicable diseases and unhealthy food environment in and around the schools), political (upstream supportive policies and joint memorandums about health children between the Ministry of Health and Medical Education and Ministry of Education), structural (the lack of unified stewardship, inadequate human resource capacity, poor inter-sectional cooperation), economic (school financial problems, poor fiscal supportive of food policies), and socio-cultural (mothers working outside the home, the role of children's peer group, low nutrition knowledge of school principals) factors. Assessment of the school canteens showed that a large proportion of available foods did not comply with the national guidelines (54.7  2.54%) and WHO-EMR model (85.6  2.34%). The main reasons identified for incomplete implementation of the policy were inadequate physical and economic infrastructure to set up standard school canteens, lack of scientific criteria for food categorization, poor monitoring, high price of healthy foods, and conflict of interest among the actors. CONCLUSION: The majority of foods and beverages available in the school canteens did not comply with national and regional standards. Iran HSC policy needs to be improved by using an evidence-based approach and active interaction between all key actors.","output":"Scrutinize of healthy school canteen policy in Iran's primary schools: a mixed method study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current study, conceived with the contribution of the Commission for Epilepsy Surgery of the Italian League Against Epilepsy (LICE) and the Epilepsy Study Group of the Italian Neurological Society (SIN), aimed to assess potential physician-related barriers to refer subjects for epilepsy surgery. All the members of SIN and LICE were invited by email to complete a 28-item online questionnaire. The survey items included: (1) individual and medical practice characteristics, (2) knowledge of current indications to select candidates for epilepsy surgery, (3) factors potentially affecting the attitude toward epilepsy surgery. Overall, 210 physicians completed the survey. More than half (63.3%) of the participants showed proper knowledge of the ILAE drug-resistance. Definition and almost two-thirds of them (71.9%) considered themselves adequately informed about indications, risks, and benefits of epilepsy surgery. Surgery was regarded as a valid option to be used as early as possible by 84.8% of the interviewees, and 71% of them estimated its complication rate to be low. However, more than half (63%) of the respondents reportedly referred patients for surgery only after the failure of 3C5 antiseizure medications. Overestimation of risks/complications of surgery and inadequate healthcare resources were identified as the main factor contrasting the patient referral for surgery by 43% and 40.5% of the participants, respectively. In conclusion, this survey confirms the existence of knowledge gap within both physicians and the healthcare system, as well as an educational need regarding epilepsy surgery.

The numerous netizens and residents drew on a wide-ranging repertoire of discourses, symbols, and narratives to heighten public spectacles of suffering and sympathy, which placed extensive blame on the lies, negligence, and censorship of the government. Nonetheless, within the short span of three months, the conflictive, cacophonous social drama was overshadowed and subsumed by a hegemonic political performance of national victory, unity, and patriotism, framed and channeled by state propaganda, censorship, ritual, and practical policies.

UVC light has been suggested as a potential option for decontamination of FFRs by the Centers for Disease Control. There has been a lack of publications characterizing UVC dose distribution across FFRs. METHODS: A UVC light box and FFR rack system was assembled utilizing low pressure mercury lamps peaked at 254 nm and aluminum flashing to reduce shadowing effect. Dose was characterized with the use of UV intensity labels and a UVGI (ultraviolet germicidal irradiation) NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) traceable meter. Ozone production was evaluated after extended bulb run time. RESULTS: Calibration of UV intensity labels were noted to have color-change saturation at 100 mJ/cm (2). Dose measurements with the UV intensity labels on the FFR demonstrated symmetric dose to all surfaces but symmetry not supported by measurements with the UVGI meter. There was substantial dose fall off on the lateral aspects of the FFR. No ozone production was noted in the UVC system. CONCLUSIONS: UV intensity labels for characterization of dose provided a false suggestion of symmetry when compared to UVGI meter. Estimates of appropriate exposure times to reach 1000 mJ/cm(2) should be significantly increased to account for geometry of FFR and lateral dose fall off.","output":"Evaluating a UVC System for Use During SARS-CoV2 Pandemic and Personal Protective Equipment Shortage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in China, December 2019. The clinical features and treatment of COVID-19 patients remain largely elusive. However, accurate detection is required for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis. We aimed to evaluate the antibodies-based test and nucleic acid-based test for SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 133 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, China, from January 23 to March 1, 2020. Demographic data, clinical records, laboratory tests, and outcomes were collected. Data were accessed by SARS-CoV-2 IgM-IgG antibody test and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) detection for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Of 133 COVID-19 patients, there were 44 moderate cases, 52 severe cases, and 37 critical cases with no differences in gender and age among three subgroups. In RT-PCR detection, the positive rate was 65.9%, 71.2%, and 67.6% in moderate, severe, and critical cases, respectively. Whereas the positive rate of IgM/IgG antibody detection in patients was 79.5%/93.2%, 82.7%/100%, and 73.0%/97.3% in moderate, severe, and critical cases, respectively. Moreover, the IgM and IgG antibodies concentrations were also examined with no differences among three subgroups. CONCLUSION: The IgM-IgG antibody test exhibited a useful adjunct to RT-PCR detection, and improved the accuracy in COVID-19 diagnosis regardless of the severity of illness, which provides an effective complement to the false-negative results from a nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis after onsets.","output":"Analysis of adjunctive serological detection to nucleic acid test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prevention programs often are directed at either parents or children separately, thereby ignoring the intergenerational aspect of health and well-being. Engaging the family is likely to improve both the uptake and long-term impact of health behavior change. We integrated an intergenerational approach into a frequently used shared assessment tool for children's care needs. The current study's aim was 2-fold: to monitor this family-engagement tool's effects on both children and their parents' health behaviors and well-being, and to examine the different dynamics of health behavioral change within a family. Method: We followed 12 children ages 10-14 years and their parents for 12 weeks using an explanatory mixed-methods design comprising interviews, questionnaires, and an n-of-1 study. During home visits at the beginning and end of the study, we interviewed children and their parents about their expectations and experiences, and measured their height and weight. Furthermore, we collected secondary data, such as notes from phone and email conversations with parents, as well as evaluation forms from professionals. In the n-of-1 study, families were prompted three times a week to describe their day and report on their vegetable intake, minutes of exercise, health behavior goals, and psychosomatic well-being. The interviews, notes, and evaluation forms were analyzed using qualitative content analyses. For the n-of-1 study, we performed multi-level time-series analyses across all families to assess changes in outcomes after consulting the family-engagement tool. Using regression analyses with autocorrelation correction, we examined changes within individual families. Results: Five child-mother dyads and three child-mother-father triads provided sufficient pre- and post-data. The mean minutes of children's physical activity significantly increased, and mothers felt more energetic, but other outcomes did not change. In consultations related to overweight, the family-engagement tool often was used without setting specific or family goals. Conclusions: The family-engagement approach elicited positive effects on some families' health and well-being. For multifaceted health problems, such as obesity, family-engagement approaches should focus on setting specific goals and strategies in different life domains, and for different family members.","output":"The Evaluation of a Family-Engagement Approach to Increase Physical Activity, Healthy Nutrition, and Well-Being in Children and Their Parents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In April 1989, the UK Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, convened a full cabinet meeting on climate change addressed by leading scientists. The presentation on mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions was made by the Head of the Energy Technology Support Unit (ETSU), Ken Currie, and identified the key potential options for mitigation by 2020. In this paper, we compare the mitigation potential identified for each proposed option with the 2019 outturn. The largest mitigation options identified were improved end use energy efficiency across the economy and the generation and use of low carbon electricity. Our analysis finds that these have been the key options adopted. Reductions in primary energy use, resulting from improvements in energy efficiency were concentrated in the period 2005C2012 which in 1989 were widely considered to be ambitious. Decarbonisation of electricity has been achieved by the displacement of coal, initially by gas and more recently by renewable electricity. Renewable electricity has exceeded 1989 expectations in the last 5 years and is now the biggest source of CO(2) reductions from electricity generation. The contribution envisaged by nuclear electricity has not occurred, largely due its failure to compete in liberalised generation markets. In all cases, the policy environment has been important. We draw lessons for mitigation options to achieve the goal of net zero emissions in the next 30 years. The contribution of demand side and other modular options will remain crucial, as mass-produced technologies tend to improve more quickly than those requiring large construction projects. Environmental, social and political factors will be important, so analysis should not be a purely techno-economic assessment.","output":"Thirty years of climate mitigation: lessons from the 1989 options appraisal for the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE As health inequities during the pandemic have been magnified, we evaluated how use of SARS-CoV-2 testing differed by race or ethnicity in a large cohort of breast cancer survivors and examined the correlates of testing positive. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 22,481 adult breast cancer survivors who were active members of a large California integrated healthcare plan in 2020. We collected data on their breast cancer diagnosis, comorbidity, and demographic characteristics. We examined SARS-CoV-2 testing utilization between March 2020 and September 2020 by race or ethnicity, comorbidity, and other patient characteristics. We also examined the correlates of a having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. We conducted bivariable and multivariable logistic regression to identify correlates of testing utilization and test positivity. RESULTS Of these 22,481 women, 3,288 (14.6%) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. The cohort included 51.8% women of color. Of the 3,288 tested, 264 (8.0%) women had a positive test result. In multivariable analyses, Latinx survivors were more likely (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.34) to undergo testing than White survivors; however, Asian or Pacific Islander survivors were 16% less likely to get tested (adjusted OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.94). Compared to White survivors, Latinx survivors were 3.5 times (adjusted OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 2.52 to 4.77) and Asian or Pacific Islander or Other survivors were 2.2-fold (adjusted OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.49 to 3.34) more likely to test positive.

The effects of some structural characteristics of gambling activities that increase gambling behavior were studied among disordered gamblers in treatment in this unique scenario. In fact, studies investigating the effects of the lockdown on problem gamblers (PGs) under treatment are missing. The aims of this study were to analyze patients' gambling behavior and craving during the lockdown and to conduct a comparison between gambling disorder (GD) symptoms at the beginning of the treatment and during lockdown. The study was conducted in Italy, the European country with the largest gambling market and the first to be affected by the virus. Data were collected through a semi-structured telephone interview conducted by healthcare professionals. Participants were 135 PGs under treatment (109 males, mean age = 50.07). Results showed that most PGs achieved a significant improvement in their quality of life, with less gambling behavior, GD symptoms, and lower craving. No shift toward online gambling and very limited shift towards other potential addictive and excessive behaviors occurred. The longer the treatment, the more monitoring is present and the better the results in terms of symptoms reduction.

We performed an epidemiological investigation and SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing to define the source and scope of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a cluster of hospitalized patients METHODS: We conducted an outbreak investigation after identifying hospital-onset COVID-19 in patients receiving hemodialysis in January 2021. Electronic medical record review, staff interviews, review of employee schedule logs, and contact tracing were used to determine the outbreak timeline and identify exposed healthcare workers (HCW). SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced from residual nasopharyngeal swab samples from 6 individuals in the outbreak investigation and compared to sequences from 14 patients in the same facility, 54 patients in nearby facilities, and 375 publicly available sequences from individuals in the state of Georgia. RESULTS: Eight patients with hospital-onset COVID-19 were identified (Cases 1-8); all were receiving hemodialysis and 5 were bedded in a single inpatient nursing unit. Among 53 potentially exposed HCW, 29 underwent testing and 5 were positive (Cases 9-13). The suspected index patient (Case 1) was found to have been coughing and inconsistently wearing a mask during a hemodialysis session on the same day that 6 of the 7 other patients and one HCW (Case 10) were in close proximity in the hemodialysis unit (Figure 1A). Further investigation revealed lack of use of curtain barriers in the hemodialysis bays, inconsistent use of personal protective equipment by HCW, and overcrowding of staff breakrooms. Among the 6 samples available for phylogenetic analysis, SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 5 (4 patients and 1 HCW, Case 9) were identical and at least 4 SNPs removed from the next closest sequence in this study, supporting a transmission cluster (Figure 1B). The sequence from the sixth sample (HCW Case 10) was phylogenetically distinct, indicating an independent source of infection. Figure 1 [Image: see text] Exposure and onset of symptoms for the 6 cases in the outbreak with samples available for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. Four patients with hospital-onset COVID-19 (Cases 1-4) were receiving hemodialysis and bedded in a single inpatient nursing unit, with two exposed healthcare workers (Cases 9-10). (A). Phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from individuals in this outbreak investigation (red), as well as 14 patients in the same facility and 54 patients in nearby facilities between 12/12/2020 and 1/13/2021 (blue).

A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated under a generalized time-reversible model with 1,000 bootstrap replicates using IQtree v2.0.3 and visualized and annotated using Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL) v4 (B). CONCLUSION: Lack of appropriate respiratory hygiene led to SARS-CoV-2 transmission during a single hemodialysis session, based on clinical and genomic epidemiology. Use of appropriate PPE for both patients and HCW and other infection prevention measures are critical to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Nowadays, when integration into the international educational space with the simultaneous existence in the context of the implementation of the European policy of sanctions against Russia and the policy of import-substitution, teaching the language of the specialty of future lawyers, however, remains one of the key tasks in achieving the strategic goal of language education at the university, namely, the training of highly qualified lawyers in the field of international law, able to work with the latest regulatory framework both in the domestic labor market and in the international arena. The purpose of this study was to conduct a comparative analysis of the latest trends in teaching ESP for law students, studying international legal direction of training in higher education institutions in Russia and Europe. Furthermore we viewed the language portfolios of European countries, materials and documents of UNESCO, the Council of Europe and current Internet resources on the topic of the study in order to study the experience of teaching and monitoring the results of teaching the specialty language. We analyzed the prospects for the development of the language higher education system, which is traditionally based on domestic socio-cultural realities and foundations. From the point of view of the historical retrospective of teaching the language of the specialty in Russian universities today, it is necessary to observe and maintain a certain balance between the relevant historically established priorities and trends in the development of Russian pedagogy and methods of teaching the language of the specialty and the national education system. It is established that the current state policy in the field of active and accelerated import substitution (which cannot but affect the development of the specifics of teaching the language of the specialty at the university), as well as the prolongation of the sanctions policy, the COVID-19 pandemic and the actual state's bet on Russian self-sufficiency and reliance on its own potential and strength (which is recognized as traditional for our education and culture), obviously actualizes the dynamic development of domestic higher education, and integration into the international space with a parallel detailed study of the accumulated methodological experience in the field of teaching the specialty language both in Russia and abroad. It is revealed that the issues of studying a foreign language specialty (ESP) in Russian and foreign universities, theoretical scientists and practical teachers began to deal with relatively recently. The analysis of scientific literature and federal standards and work programs allowed us to record that only at the beginning of the XXI century (approximately in 2015-2018) an independent discipline began to appear, aimed at learning the language of the specialty, the content of which was based on and partially reflected other disciplines of the professional block. Previously, in the course of studying a foreign language in universities, only the general foreign language (General English) was studied, in which the topics of professional orientation were studied in fragments. The European Community somewhat earlier turned to the issues of studying the specialty language at the professional B2-C1 levels, when in 2005 the University of Cambridge (with the support of the European Union) developed and implemented the international ILEC and TOLES exams. This was the historical impetus for the development of a new direction in the methods of teaching a foreign language and was the birth of an independent discipline-the specialty language (ESP). It is proved that in 2018, the European documents introduce a new type of speech activity for Russian pedagogy and didactics: language mediation, aimed at solving applied issues of multi-level (pre- A-C2) multicultural and bilingual language education. The study of European competencies and the works of Russian scientists allowed us to establish uniformity in the understanding of the types of language mediation: interactive (involves the transfer of information from the communicator to the recipient and back);non-interactive (semantic transmission-periphrasis, adaptation of the text, etc., information from the communicator (i.e., the primary source) to the recipient (i.e., the recipient), when feedback is not important), and hybrid (mixed). Today, a general range of forms of mediation is recorded: mediation in negotiations, translation, conversation, ing, ing, writing letters, reviewing, conducting correspondence, retelling, etc. The development of language mediation of law students is recognized as a professionally important aspect in the process of mastering the future profession.

It is proved that the modern European and domestic pedagogical community is developing in a single direction, which is facilitated by the integration of the international educational space and the permanent exchange of accumulated experience in teaching the specialty language among teaching staff through participation in various international conferences and webinars.","output":"Teaching ESP for law students at universities in Russia and abroad"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused taste loss at a rate higher than that of influenza. ACE2, the entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, has been identified in the oral epithelium; however, it is unclear at what developmental stage ACE2 expression emerges and whether ACE2 is expressed in taste buds. To identify the specific developmental stage, we analyzed RNA-Seq data from embryonic and newborn mouse oral tissue. We found that robust ACE2 expression was observed in the newborn oral epithelium. In contrast, only extremely low levels, if any, of ACE2 transcripts in the embryonic stage oral tissue were found (E12.5 and E14.5). Analyses of three public scRNA-seq data sets of adult mouse tongue epithelial cells showed that receptors for various viruses were enriched in distinct clusters of tongue epithelial cells. ACE2 was enriched in a subpopulation of epithelial cells in the basal region of nongustatory filiform papillae but not in the taste papillae or taste buds. Expression of ACE2 was detected in a small proportion of type III taste cells. Our results indicate that when applied across species, nongustatory papilla epithelial cells are the prime targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the tongue; thus, taste loss in COVID-19 patients is likely not caused by a direct infection of SARS-CoV-2 to taste bud cells. Additionally, fetuses at different stages of development may have distinct susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Receptor ACE2 Is Enriched in a Subpopulation of Mouse Tongue Epithelial Cells in Nongustatory Papillae but Not in Taste Buds or Embryonic Oral Epithelium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper argues that data-driven medicine gives rise to a particular normative challenge.

At the same time, such acts of sharing could-especially considering current developments in big data and artificial intelligence-compromise the right by leading to injustices and affecting concrete modes of individual self-determination.

Using publicly available weekly crime count data from 29 of the 70 largest cities in the U.S. from January 2018 through December 2020, three different linear regression model specifications are used to detect changes. One detects whether crime trends in four 2020 pre- and post-pandemic periods differ from those in 2018 and 2019. A second looks in more detail at the spring 2020 lockdowns to detect whether crime trends changed over successive biweekly periods into the lockdown. The third uses a city-level openness index that we created for the purpose of examining whether the degree of openness was associated with changing crime rates. For homicide and auto theft, we find significant increases during all or most of the pandemic. By contrast, we find significant declines in robbery and larceny during all or part of the pandemic and no significant changes in burglary over the course of the pandemic. Only larceny rates fluctuated with the degree of each city's lockdown. It is unusual for crime rates to move in different directions, and the reasons for the mixed findings for these five Part 1 Index crimes, one with no change, two with sustained increases, and two with sustained decreases, are not yet known. We hypothesize that the reasons may be related to changes in opportunity, and the pandemic provides unique opportunities for future research to better understand the forces impacting crime rates.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study assessing the attitude of EMS providers to work during disease outbreaks. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were performed to assess attitudes toward reporting for duty and factors that influence providers decisions. RESULTS: Of the 500 surveys distributed, 466 (93.2%) were complete and included for analysis. The majority of participants (70.2%) are male with a mean age of 27 (SD 4.3) years. The study found that the majority (71.1%) of participants are willing to come to work during disease outbreaks. The study found 7 predictors of reporting for duty. Confidence that employer will provide adequate protective gear was the most significant predictor (odds ratio [OR], 3.95; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.31-5.42). Concern for family safety was the most important barrier against coming to work (OR, 0.40; 95% CI = 0.21-0.73).

The aim of the current study was to assess MHD history, attitudes toward MHDs and stress-coping strategies in FPs. An additional goal was to estimate their comprehensive well-being and investigate connections with resilience and a healthy lifestyle. A total of 483 FPs submitted their responses via online survey. MHD attitudes were assessed with the according questionnaires, while burnout levels, healthy lifestyle, resilience, job and life satisfaction were estimated with validated scales. Results have shown that 32.5% of FPs disclosed positive MHD history, while 68.7% used professional help. Resilience and healthy lifestyle levels were significantly higher in MHD negative FPs (p < 0.001), while burnout levels were lower (p < 0.001). Moreover, healthy lifestyle ( = 0.03, p < 0.001) was an independent correlate of resilience, while healthy lifestyle ( = ?0.35, p < 0.001, and resilience ( = ?1.82, p < 0.001) were of burnout levels.

However, as the field matures and long-term outcomes begin to emerge, FT teams around the world are now facing new challenges. Data for this review were identified by searches of the PubMed/MEDLINE database from inception through August 2020. All English-language articles pertaining to FT were included. Significant advances in candidate selection, technology, operative technique, posttransplant care, and immunosuppressive management have contributed to the tremendous expansion of the field, culminating in the execution in the past 3 years of 2 facial re-transplantations, and most recently the world's first successful combined face and double hand transplant in August 2020. Despite these achievements, the allograft donor pool remains limited, with long wait times, requiring surgical experimentation with cross-sex FT. Immunosuppressive management has improved, but significant adverse events continue to be reported. Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented strain on the healthcare system, with various implications for the practice of reconstructive transplantation. In this article, we provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date FT review, highlighting fundamental lessons learned and recent advancements, while looking toward the challenges ahead. Over the past 15 years, extensive multidisciplinary efforts have been instrumental to the establishment of FT as a feasible reconstructive option.

The country has attracted a lot of attention not only because of its importance as a tourism destination but also due to its rather controversial management of the pandemic at least in its early stages. Design/methodology/approach Fifteen semi-structured interviews based on ten open-ended questions were conducted with North East of England-based hotel managers of international brands on the level of their hotels' preparedness to effectively deal with pandemic cases. The interviews took place in August and September 2020 with participants kept anonymous. Findings Meeting new operational and bureaucratic requirements added to the cost structure and proved a major challenge for managers who saw their hotel occupancy rates and revenue collapsing within a short period of time. Innovative and aggressive pricing strategies were introduced to lure especially younger travelers in the absence of business clientele. Staff were made redundant and/or asked to work overtime making effective human resource management very difficult. Originality/value This is one of the first research attempts to highlight the importance of the COVID-19 pandemic for the hotel sector in a major region of the UK. The paper also attempts some generalization by discussing managerial implications and suggesting a possible way forward for the hotel sector. Developing resilience by building on previously used successful business practices proves of essence.","output":"Tourism in the post(?)

Therefore, this study determined the safety and effects of very low carbohydrate (VLCBD) in addition to low protein diet (LPD) on renal outcomes, anthropometric, metabolic and inflammatory parameters in patients with T2DM and underlying mild to moderate kidney disease (DKD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an investigator-initiated, single-center, randomized, controlled, clinical trial in patients with T2DM and DKD, comparing 12-weeks of low carbohydrate diet (<20g daily intake) versus standard low protein (0.8g/kg/day) and low salt diet. Patients in the VLCBD group underwent 2-weekly monitoring including their 3-day food diaries. In addition, Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was performed to estimate body fat percentages. RESULTS: The study population (n = 30) had a median age of 57 years old and a BMI of 30.68kg/m2. Both groups showed similar total calorie intake, i.e. 739.33 (IQR288.48) vs 789.92 (IQR522.4) kcal, by the end of the study. The VLCBD group showed significantly lower daily carbohydrate intake 27 (IQR25) g vs 89.33 (IQR77.4) g, p<0.001, significantly higher protein intake per day 44.08 (IQR21.98) g vs 29.63 (IQR16.35) g, p<0.05 and no difference in in daily fat intake. Both groups showed no worsening of serum creatinine at study end, with consistent declines in HbA1c (1.3(1.1) vs 0.7(1.25) %) and fasting blood glucose (1.5(3.37) vs 1.3(5.7) mmol/L). The VLCBD group showed significant reductions in total daily insulin dose (39(22) vs 0 IU, p<0.001), increased LDL-C and HDL-C, decline in IL-6 levels; with contrasting results in the control group. This was associated with significant weight reduction (-4.0(3.9) vs 0.2(4.2) kg, p = <0.001) and improvements in body fat percentages. WC was significantly reduced in the VLCBD group, even after adjustments to age, HbA1c, weight and creatinine changes. Both dietary interventions were well received with no reported adverse events. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that dietary intervention of very low carbohydrate diet in patients with underlying diabetic kidney disease was safe and associated with significant improvements in glycemic control, anthropometric measurements including weight, abdominal adiposity and IL-6. Renal outcomes remained unchanged. These findings would strengthen the importance of this dietary intervention as part of the management of patients with diabetic kidney disease.","output":"Safety and efficacy of very low carbohydrate diet in patients with diabetic kidney diseaseA randomized controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a highly contagious viral disease. The anxiety, misinformation about COVID-19, and the fear of being infected by the virus have led to widespread stigma in local communities. Thus, we conducted a study to evaluate the status of patients and disease-associated stigma of patients who recovered from COVID-19. METHODS: Status of discharged/ improved COVID-19 individuals were followed after their discharge within 2 months after COVID-19 status through telephonic interview. Data of interview was recorded in excel sheets, which was imported in Stata v. 15. Simple descriptive analysis performed and finding presented in appropriate tabulation. Further binomial logistic regression analysis was performed for post-treatment stigmatization. RESULTS: Among 365 case details retrieved, 262 cases contained contact details. Among them, 221 total phone calls were made, of which only 94 could reach for phone interview. 50 (53.19%) were male; 59 (62.77%) were married; and 85 (90.43%) were Hinduism by religion. Majority (n=74, 78.72%) were asymptomatic. The average hospital/isolation stay of patients was 11.234.75 days. Among interviewed individuals, 24 (25.81%) reported some type of stigmatization. Individuals with comorbidities and tested for travel purpose has less chance of stigmatization comparing than others. Higher the age in years and longer the duration of hospital/isolation stay; higher the odds of having stigmatization. CONCLUSIONS: High level of stigma was seen among COVID-19 survivors.
