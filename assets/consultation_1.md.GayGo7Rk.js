Using four subspecies of Drosophila mojavensis as a model, we identify two behaviorally active male-specific pheromones. One functions as a conserved male anti-aphrodisiac in all subspecies and acts via gustation. The second induces female receptivity via olfaction exclusively in the two subspecies that produce it. Genetic analysis of the cognate receptor for the olfactory pheromone indicates an important role for this sensory pathway in promoting sexual isolation of subspecies, in collaboration with auditory signals. Surprisingly, the peripheral sensory pathway detecting this pheromone is conserved molecularly, physiologically and anatomically across subspecies. These observations imply that subspecies-specific behaviors arise from differential interpretation of the same peripheral cue, reminiscent of sexually conserved detection but dimorphic interpretation of male pheromones in D. melanogaster. Our results reveal that, during incipient speciation, pheromone production, detection and interpretation do not necessarily evolve in a coordinate manner.","output":"Mate discrimination among subspecies through a conserved olfactory pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose During the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency department (ED) volumes have fluctuated We hypothesized that natural language processing (NLP) models could quantify changes in detection of acute abdominal pathology (acute appendicitis (AA), acute diverticulitis (AD), or bowel obstruction (BO)) on CT reports Methods This retrospective study included 22,182 radiology reports from CT abdomen/pelvis studies performed at an urban ED between January 1, 2018 to August 14, 2020 Using a 2448 subset of manually annotated reports, we trained random forest NLP models to classify the presence of AA, AD, and BO in report impressions Performance was assessed using 5-fold cross validation The NLP classifiers were then applied to all reports Results The NLP classifiers for AA, AD, and BO demonstrated cross-validation classification accuracies between 0 97 and 0 99 and F1-scores between 0 86 and 0 91 When applied to all CT reports, the estimated numbers of AA, AD, and BO cases decreased 43C57% in April 2020 (first regional peak of COVID-19 cases) compared to 2018C2019 However, the number of abdominal pathologies detected rebounded in MayCJuly 2020, with increases above historical averages for AD The proportions of CT studies with these pathologies did not significantly increase during the pandemic period Conclusion Dramatic decreases in numbers of acute abdominal pathologies detected by ED CT studies were observed early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, though these numbers rapidly rebounded The proportions of CT cases with these pathologies did not increase, which suggests patients deferred care during the first pandemic peak NLP can help automatically track findings in ED radiology reporting","output":"Automated tracking of emergency department abdominal CT findings during the COVID-19 pandemic using natural language processing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La pandemia de SARS-CoV-2 es una emergencia sanitaria sin precedentes, que ha implicado un reordenamiento en la priorizacin de procedimientos mdicos electivos, frente a un potencial colapso del sistema de salud a nivel mundial y riesgo de contagio del personal y pacientes.

Thyroid cancer patients were obtained from the universal health insurance claims from Taiwan between 2001 and 2017. We compared these patients with control subjects matched for age, gender, and baseline conditions to assess the risk of mortality. Of the 30,778 patients with thyroid cancer, the overall mortality rate was 1.29% and the leading causes of death were thyroid cancer (31.2%), other cancers (29.9%), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality (12.3%), respectively. We found patients with thyroid cancer had excellent overall survival and lower CVD mortality risk. ABSTRACT: The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased substantially worldwide. However, the overall mortality risk and actual causes of death in thyroid cancer patients have not been extensively evaluated. In this study, patients with thyroid cancer diagnosed between 2001 and 2017 were analyzed from Taiwans National Health Insurance Research Database. We compared these patients with control subjects matched for age, gender, history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and occupation to assess the risk of overall mortality and cause-specific mortality. Finally, our cohort comprised 30,778 patients with thyroid cancer. Three hundred and ninety-eight deaths (1.29%) occurred during a median follow-up of 60.0 months (range: 30.3 to 117.6 months). The primary cause of death was thyroid cancer mortality (31.2%), followed by other malignancy-related mortality (29.9%) and CVD mortality (12.3%). The overall mortality risk was similar between the thyroid cancer and control groups (unadjusted hazard ratio (HR): 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88C1.10); the adjusted HR was 1.07 (95% CI: 0.95C1.20) after multivariate adjustment for age, gender, history of CVD, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and occupation. The risk of other malignancy-related mortality was comparable between two groups. CVD mortality risk was lower in the thyroid cancer group, with an unadjusted HR of 0.51 (95% CI: 0.38C0.69) and adjusted HR of 0.56 (95% CI: 0.42C0.76). In conclusion, patients with thyroid cancer had excellent overall survival. Thyroid cancer-specific mortality was the leading cause of death, highlighting the importance of thyroid cancer management. Thyroid cancer patients had lower CVD mortality risk than the general population.","output":"Survival and Death Causes in Thyroid Cancer in Taiwan: A Nationwide CaseCControl Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose an adaptation of Urie Bronfenbrenners bioecological theory, neo-ecological theory. As bioecological theory was developed in the 20(th) century, it requires significant modifications to reflect some of the most ubiquitous contexts in which adolescents learn, play, and growthe technological and virtual ones. Although several scholars have developed laudable theories related to youth development in virtual contexts, the field lacks an overarching theory to address the intersection of development and technology. In developing neo-ecological theory, we hold true to the tenets of bioecological theory, but suggest key modifications to reflect our technologized world. We delineate a key alteration to the microsystem, namely the existence of two types of microsystemsphysical and virtual. In addition, we emphasize the importance of macrosystemic influences (i.e., the influences of culture and within-society subcultural variation) in understanding development in the digital age. The implications of these modifications cascade across the Process-Person-Context-Time (PPCT) model; proximal processes, person characteristics, context, and time are all reexamined. In the digital age, virtual microsystems are central contexts in which youth engage in proximal processes. As such, we believe that all scholars of development, regardless of their specific research interests, should consider the ways digital contexts influence their outcomes of interest.

Connectivity matrices derived from MNOs at EU scale can help the understanding of the initial dynamics of the spread. This work is expected to provide input to epidemiological modelling in informing policies on de-escalation of control measures and recovery. Connectivity data between administrative areas can also be used to estimate impacts and spread of future outbreaks. A case study of France shows that mobility alone can explain from 52% up to 92% of the initial spread of the virus, while there is no effect before the outbreak, and has a slow decay effect after lockdown measures are effective.

Tumour resistance to immune checkpoint blockades in most cancers due to immune escape from host surveillance, along with the initiation of metastasis through immunosuppressive cells in the tumour microenvironment, remains a significant challenge for cancer immunotherapy. aCD47, an agent for CD47/SIRP axis blockade, induces modest phagocytic activity and a low response rate for monotherapy, resulting in failures in clinical trials. We showed that BP-mediated ablation of tumours through photothermal effects could serve as an effective strategy for specific immunological stimulation, improving the inherently poor immunogenicity of tumours, which is particularly useful for enhancing cancer immunotherapy. BP in combination with aCD47 blockade activates both innate and adaptive immunities and promotes local and systemic anticancer immune responses, thus offering a synergistically enhanced effect in suppression of tumour progression and in inducing abscopal effects for inhibition of metastatic cancers. Our combination strategy provides a promising platform in which photothermal agents could help to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy.","output":"Black phosphorus-based photothermal therapy with aCD47-mediated immune checkpoint blockade for enhanced cancer immunotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is usually dormant and becomes apparent when body conditions decline. We investigated the anti-HSV activity of various natural and synthetic compounds for future clinical application. Methods: Mock- and HSV-infected Vero cells were treated for three days with various concentrations of samples. For short exposure, 100-fold concentrated virus were preincubated for 3 min with samples, diluted to normal multiplicity of infection (MOI), before the addition to the cells. Anti-HSV activity was evaluated by the chemotherapy index. Results: Alkaline extracts of the leaves of Sasa sp.

Exposure of HSV to SE or PCE for 3 min almost completely eliminated the infectivity of HSV, whereas much longer exposure time was required for Kakkonto, the most active Kampo formulae. Anti-HSV activity of PCE and Kakkonto could be detected only when they were dissolved by alkaline solution (pH 8.0), but not by neutral buffer (pH 7.4).

In our research study, we aimed to examine the levels of perceived stress and health anxiety as well as coping styles among university students amid the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online-based survey at the University of Debrecen during the official lockdown in Hungary when dormitories were closed, and teaching was conducted remotely. Our questionnaire solicited data using three assessment tools, namely, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WCQ), and the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI). RESULTS: A total of 1320 students have participated in our study and 31 non-eligible responses were excluded. Among the remaining 1289 participants, 948 (73.5%) and 341 (26.5%) were Hungarian and international students, respectively. Female students predominated the overall sample with 920 participants (71.4%). In general, there was a statistically significant positive relationship between perceived stress and health anxiety. Health anxiety and perceived stress levels were significantly higher among international students compared to domestic ones. Regarding coping, wishful thinking was associated with higher levels of stress and anxiety among international students, while being a goal-oriented person acted the opposite way. Among the domestic students, cognitive restructuring as a coping strategy was associated with lower levels of stress and anxiety. Concerning health anxiety, female students (domestic and international) had significantly higher levels of health anxiety compared to males. Moreover, female students had significantly higher levels of perceived stress compared to males in the international group, however, there was no significant difference in perceived stress between males and females in the domestic group. CONCLUSION: The elevated perceived stress levels during major life events can be further deepened by disengagement from home (being away/abroad from country or family) and by using inadequate coping strategies. By following and adhering to the international recommendations, adopting proper coping methods, and equipping oneself with the required coping and stress management skills, the associated high levels of perceived stress and anxiety could be mitigated.","output":"Health anxiety, perceived stress, and coping styles in the shadow of the COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite seasonal influenza vaccines having been routinely used for many decades, influenza A virus continues to pose a global threat to humans, causing high morbidity and mortality each year.

These mAbs reduce the risk of hospitalization in the general population. However, its efficacy and safety in immunocompromised hematology patients are not known. Methods: From November 9th, 2020, until February 28th, 2021, all adult hematology patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease who received monoclonal antibodies within 10 days of symptoms onset were included. Patients who were asymptomatic, had severe or critical COVID-19 disease, or were hospitalized at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis were excluded. Baseline demographic, clinical outcomes, and hematologic-related data were extracted. All statistical analysis was performed using SAS statistical software. Results: Thirty-eight hematology patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease who received mAb therapy under EUA were included in this study. Thirty (79%) patients received bamlanivimab and 8 (21%) casirivimab-imdevimab. Baseline characteristics prior to mAB administration include: 53% female, median age of 51 years (range: 21-80), with 18% above 65 years old. Twenty-eight (74%) patients received cellular therapy: 18 (47%) had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), 9 (24%) autologous HCT, and 1 (3%) chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T) therapy. Among the 17 patients who had COVID-19 disease after HCT, the median time to COVID-19 diagnosis was 22.8 months (range: 2.6-274.4) from HCT to COVID-19 diagnosis. Twelve out of 17 (71%) alloHCT patients were being managed for active graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis (chronic GVHD: n=11 [mild: 4, moderate: 4, severe: 3], acute GVHD (grade 2): n=1). Ten (59%) alloHCT patients were on immunosuppressant therapy at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Fifteen (39%) patients were on active treatment for their hematologic malignancy (HM) at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis with a mean of 3 previous lines of treatment (range: 1-6). Additional patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. mAb therapy under EUA was well tolerated in this patient population with only 1 (3%) patient having experienced an adverse reaction characterized as headache. Four (11%) patients were hospitalized due to COVID-19, and 2 (5%) progressed to severe disease. All four patients had received bamlanivimab. The median time for hospitalization from diagnosis of COVID-19 to admission date was 8 days (range: 1-20) while median time from mAB infusion to hospitalization was 7.5 days (range: 0-17). One patient (3%) died within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis; the cause of death was COVID-19 disease. Most patients (n=34, 89%) ultimately tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR after mAb infusion. 34% of patients (n=13) cleared the virus within 2 weeks of receiving mAb infsuion. The median time to clearance of viral shedding was 25.5 days (range: 7-138). After mAb infusion, most patients (10/15; 67%) who were previously on active treatment for HM prior to diagnosis of COVID-19 resumed therapy for their HM with a median delay of 21.5 days (range: 12-42). We observed a significant difference in hospitalization was amongst patients who received a HCT vs. non-HCT (0%, 0/26 and 36%, 4/11 respectively; p<0.01). None of the other patient characteristics, which included: gender, ethnicity, age, BMI, smoking, obesity, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary vascular disease, and lung disease, were associated with significantly increased rate of hospitalization. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that SARS-COV2 specific mAb use in malignant hematology patients under EUA was safe and may reduce hospitalization as reported in the literature amongst those at high risk for disease progression. Thus, the access to SARS-COV2 mAb in this population who is at increased risk for complications from SARS-COV2 infection is critical in reducing progression to severe COVID-19 disease and hospitalization.

Very lowCcarbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diets have been suggested to have superior metabolic and weight loss effects. Keyto is a low-cost, highly scalable mobile health (mHealth) app paired with a noninvasive biofeedback tool aimed at facilitating weight loss through a personalized healthy and predominantly plant- and fish-based ketogenic diet. OBJECTIVE: This protocol describes a randomized trial comparing the efficacy of the Keyto mHealth app and device intervention to that of Weight Watchers WW app in individuals who are overweight or obese. The primary outcome is weight loss after 12 weeks. Secondary and exploratory outcomes, including metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, will be assessed at 12, 24, and 48 weeks. METHODS: A total of 144 participants will be recruited and randomized to either the Keyto program or Weight Watchers program. Study participants will be guided through the study via video conference or phone calls and will undergo a fasting blood analysis performed by a third-party diagnostic lab at weeks 0 and 12 to assess metabolic and cardiovascular risk markers. All participants will be asked to weigh themselves daily on a study-provided Bluetooth-enabled scale. Participants randomized to the Keyto arm will also be asked to measure their breath acetone levels, a measure of ketosis, with the Keyto device 3 times per day.

Main funding source(s): Study sponsored by DiA Imaging Analysis BACKGROUND: The assessment of the right ventricular (RV) function is an essential part of every transthoracic echocardiographic examination. It plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of many diseases and conditions. In covid-19 patients, there is evidence showing that enlarged RV and abnormal Free Wall Strain (FWS) correlate with high mortality. Assessment of the RV in the Point of Care settings can assist the differential diagnosis and provide important clinical information in early stages, close to the onset of symptoms, however, it is done qualitatively by visual estimation and thus subjective and requires high level of expertise. The presented study aims to validate the use of a novel artificial intelligence tool (LVivo RV by DiA imaging analysis) that uses deep learning and image processing algorithms to automatically evaluate RV size and function from apical 4 chamber (4CH) focused or modified ultrasound clips. METHODS: A retrospective study of 100 patients who underwent routine echocardiographic examination was conducted in three medical centers in US and Israel. The apical 4CH focused or modified clips were interpreted by experts to evaluate RV size and function. The End Diastolic Area (EDA) measured manually by two sonographers and the FWS measured by semi-automated Velocity Vector Imaging software (VVI by Siemens) were compared to the same parameters obtained automatically by the LVivo RV, using linear regression and Bland Altman analysis. RESULTS: 100 cases were included, 39% females and 61% males. Mean age was 64.7 [19-92]. Mean BMI was 28.1 [6.8-17.6]. 74% had pulmonary hypertension and 19% had lung disease. 36% were considered abnormal by their fractional area change values and 64% were considered normal. Three cases were non-interpretable by the physicians thus excluded from the analysis. The LVivo RV was able to process 99% of the cases. Excellent correlation was obtained for EDA between the sonographers\\" average of manual measurements and the automated EDA by LVivo RV with r = 0.92 (p < 0.0001, 95%CI 0.88-0.94). The bias and limits of agreement for EDA were 0.87  5.76cm^2. For FWS, 4 cases were manually excluded due to insufficient image quality. The Bland Altman analysis for FWS showed small bias and limits of agreement of 0.7  12.2%. A very good correlation of r= 0.78, (95% CI 0.69-0.85) was found, indicating good compatibility between the methods. The specificity and sensitivity for FWS were 80% and 77% respectively, using an optimal cutoff value of -16%, and the overall agreement was 79%.

The ligature/LPS method was used to induce periodontitis in rats. LPS was employed to cause inflammation in Human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). The transfections with FGFR1 SiRNA, NLRP3 SiRNA and the selective TLR4 inhibitor TAK242 were used to investigate the mechanism of Fisetin-mediated inflammatory reaction in LPS-induced HGF. As a result, Fisetin reduced the alveolar bone gap, reversed histopathological lesion and inhibited serum inflammatory cytokine concentration in periodontitis rats. Fisetin decreased the inflammatory cytokine contents in the supernatant of LPS-induced HGF. The inhibitory effect of Fisetin might be attributed to FGFR1/TLR4/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway both in vivo and in vitro. The suppressions of FGFR1, TLR4 and NLRP3 proved that FGFR1/TLR4/NLRP3 signaling was involved in the Fisetin-mediated inflammatory response. Fisetin also inhibited NLRP3 priming.

Rapid analysis identified three themes: (1) coaching both facilitates and prevents mHealth adoption and engagement by promoting accountability but leading to guilt among those not meeting goals; (2) preferences regarding the mode of treatment delivery, usability, and treatment content were barriers to mHealth appropriateness and adoption, including preferences for in-person care and a dislike of self-monitoring; and (3) a single invitation was not sufficient to facilitate adoption of a new mHealth program. Themes were unrelated to participants age, race, or ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: In a study assessing real-world use of mHealth in a group of middle-aged and older adults, we found thatdespite free access to mHealth with a live coachmost did not complete the registration process. Our findings suggest that implementing mHealth for weight management requires more than one information session. Findings also suggest that focusing on the coaching relationship and how users lives and goals change over time may be an important way to facilitate engagement and improved health. Most participants thought mHealth was appropriate for weight management, with some nevertheless preferring in-person care. Therefore, the best way to guarantee equitable care will be to ensure multiple routes to achieving the same behavioral health goals. Veterans Health Administration patients have the option of using mHealth for weight management, but can also attend group weight management programs or single-session nutrition classes or access fitness facilities. Health care policy does not allow such access for most people in the United States; however, expanded access to behavioral weight management is an important long-term goal to ensure health for all.","output":"Adoption and Appropriateness of mHealth for Weight Management in the Real World: A Qualitative Investigation of Patient Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Continuity and security includes people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) not only having resources to meet their basic needs, but also includes the amount of change and disruption people have in their lives and the control they have over that change.

The coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM (MHV-JHM), causes acute encephalomyelitis and acute and chronic demyelinating diseases and is an important model system for virus-induced neurological disease. Suckling C578L/6 mice infected intranasally with MHV-JHM develop either the acute encephalomyelitis or a late onset, symptomatic demyelinating encephalomyelitis, depending on whether they are nursed by unimmunized or immunized dams. Analysis by in situ hybridization was used to determine the route of entry of MHV-JHM into the CNS in these mice. At early times, viral RNA was detected only in the trigeminal and olfactory nerves and in their immediate connections in all mice. A few days later, MHV-JHM RNA was found throughout the brain in mice dying of the acute encephalomyelitis, but remained confined to the entry sites in mice which did not develop acute disease. These results suggest that MHV-JHM enters the CNS via an interneuronal route in all mice, but that the presence of maternal antibody prevents the dissemination of virus via extracellular fluid. In addition, MHV-JHM may establish low-level persistence in the trigeminal or olfactory nerve or in one of its connections in mice that do not develop acute encephalomyelitis.","output":"Spread of a neurotropic murine coronavirus into the CNS via the trigeminal and olfactory nerves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wir verfgen ber ein hochwirksames Arsenal an Antibiotika, wir k?nnen auf der Suche nach einem Fokus mit bildgebenden, diagnostischen Verfahren jeden Bereich des menschlichen K?rpers darstellen und ggf. punktieren, und doch sind unsere therapeutischen Erfolge bei der Sepsis nach wie vor entt?uschend.

Additionally, wild animals play an important role in the transmission of zoonoses. Despite this importance, information on GI parasites of tropical wild mammals is critically lacking.

Fresh faecal samples (n = 56) collected from the Wasgomuwa National Park, Sri Lanka were subjected to coprological examination using faecal smears, and the brine floatation technique followed by microscopic identification; quantitative data were accrued using the formol-ether method. The survey revealed a high prevalence of GI parasites, where 86% (48/56) of faecal samples screened positive for parasitic infections. Faecal samples of the civet, buffalo and Leopard recorded 100% prevalence, while the lowest (40%) was recorded for the Grey langur. Eight types of GI parasites were documented: protozoan cysts, platyhelminth ova (three types of digenean and a single cyclophillidean type), nematode ova (strongyle, strongyloid, ascarid, and trichuroid types) and rhabditiform larvae. The buffaloes and civets had a comparatively high number and diversity of GI parasites (buffalo: 7 types, H = 1.02; civet: 6 types, H = 1.52), whilst only a single type (digenean) was detected in the Grey langur. Likewise, parasite loads were also highly variable; highest in the bear (486 per g faeces) and lowest in the monkey (10 per g faeces).

This was followed approximately 10 min later by the addition of both galactose and sialic acid to give the mature oligosaccharides. This sequence of additions was confirmed by analyzing the 3H-labeled oligosaccharides bound to each of the E1 forms using gel filtration on P4 columns.

To reduce pesticide use in crop cultivation, the application of priming-active compounds (PrimACs) is a welcome alternative. PrimACs strengthen the plant immune system and could thus help to protect plants with lower amounts of pesticides. PrimACs can be identified, for example, by their capacity to enhance the respiratory activity of parsley cells in culture as determined by the oxygen transfer rate (OTR) using the respiration activity monitoring system (RAMOS) or its miniaturized version, RAMOS. The latter was designed for with suspensions of bacteria and yeast cells in microtiter plates (MTPs). So far, RAMOS or RAMOS have not been applied to adult plants or seedlings, which would overcome the limitation of ()RAMOS to plant suspension cell cultures. RESULTS In this work, we introduce a modified RAMOS for analysis of plant seedlings. The novel device allows illuminating the seedlings and records the respiratory activity in each well of a 48-well MTP. To validate the suitability of the setup for identifying novel PrimAC in Arabidopsis thaliana, seedlings were grown in MTP for seven days and treated with the known PrimAC salicylic acid (SA; positive control) and the PrimAC candidate methyl 1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-oxocyclopentane-1-carboxylate (Tyr020). Twenty-eight h after treatment, the seedlings were elicited with flg22, a 22-amino acid peptide of bacterial flagellin. Upon elicitation, the respiratory activity was monitored. The evaluation of the OTR course reveals Tyr020 as a likely PrimAC. The priming-inducing activity of Tyr020 was confirmed using molecular biological analyses in A. thaliana seedlings. CONCLUSION We disclose the suitability of RAMOS for identifying PrimACs in plant seedlings. The difference in OTR during a night period between primed and unprimed plants was distinguishable after elicitation with flg22. Thus, it has been shown that the RAMOS device can be used for a reliable screening for PrimACs in plant seedlings.","output":"An illuminated respiratory activity monitoring system identifies priming-active compounds in plant seedlings."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBCs) signify a potent source of stem cells that have demonstrated advantageous outcomes across a diverse array of conditions.

The aim of this study is to demarcate the imaging features of novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (NCIP) in different age groups and outline the relation between radiological aspect, including CT severity, and clinical aspect, including age, oxygen saturation, and fatal outcome. We implemented a prospective observational study enrolled 299 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (169 males and 130 females; age range = 2C91 years; mean age = 38.4  17.2). All patients were submitted to chest CT with multi-planar reconstruction. The imaging features of NCIP in different age groups were described. The relations between CT severity and age, oxygen saturation, and fatal outcome were evaluated. RESULTS: The most predominant CT features were bilateral (75.4%), posterior (66.3%), pleural-based (93.5%), lower lobe involvement (89.8%), and ground-glass opacity (94.7%). ROC curve analysis revealed that the optimal cutoff age that was highly exposed to moderate and severe stages of NCIP was 38 years old (AUC = 0.77, p < 0.001). NCIP was noted in 42.6% below 40-year-old age group compared to 84% above 40-year-old age group. The CT severity was significantly related to age and fatal outcome (p < 0.001). Anterior, centrilobular, hilar, apical, and middle lobe involvements had a significant relation to below 90% oxygen saturation. A significant negative correlation was found between CT severity and oxygen saturation (r = ? 0.49, p < 0.001). Crazy-paving pattern, anterior aspect, hilar, centrilobular involvement, and moderate and severe stages had a statistically significant relation to higher mortality. CONCLUSION: The current study confirmed the value of CT as a prognostic predictor in NCIP through demonstration of the strong relation between CT severity and age, oxygen saturation, and the fatal outcome.

OBJECTIVES This study proposes an association of clioquinol, an inhibitor of fungal cells with antifungal drugs prescribed to combat fusariosis in humans. METHODS Susceptibility was assessed by microdilution in broth. Formation of biofilm by staining with violet crystal. Inhibition and removal of biofilm using the MTT colorimetric reagent. Time-kill combination, hypoallergenicity test, cytotoxicity test, and toxicity prediction by computer analysis were also performed. RESULTS Clioquinol associated with voriconazole and with ciclopirox inhibited biofilm formation. Possibly, clioquinol acts in the germination and elongation of hyphae, while voriconazole prevents cell adhesion and ciclopirox the formation of the extracellular polymeric matrix. The CLIO-VRC association reduced the biofilm formation by more than 90%, while the CLIO-CPX association prevented over 95%. None association was irritating, and over 90% of the leukocytes remained viable. Computational analysis does not reveal toxicity relevant to CLIO, whereas VRC and CPX showed some risks for systemic use, but suitable for topical formulations.

The beneficial effects of C-Phycocyanin seem likely to be primarily attributable to its covalently attached chromophore Phycocyanobilin (PCB). Within cells, biliverdin is generated from free heme and it is subsequently reduced to bilirubin. Although bilirubin can function as an oxidant scavenger, its potent antioxidant activity reflects its ability to inactivate some isoforms of NADPH oxidase. Free bilirubin can also function as an agonist for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR); this may explain its ability to promote protective Treg activity in cellular and rodent models of inflammatory disease. AhR agonists also promote transcription of the gene coding for Nrf-2, and hence can up-regulate phase 2 induction of antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1. Hence, it is proposed that C-Phycocyanin/PCB chiefly exert their protective effects via inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity, as well as by AhR agonism that both induces Treg activity and up-regulates phase 2 induction. This simple model may explain their potent antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, PCB might mimic biliverdin in activating anti-inflammatory signaling mediated by biliverdin reductase.

We sought to evaluate common mortality-based SPC triggers and determine whether these triggers reflect actual use of SPC consultation. We additionally aimed to characterize the population of patients who receive SPC without meeting mortality-based triggers. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all adult ICU admissions from 2012C2017 at an academic medical center with five subspecialty ICUs to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the five most common SPC triggers for predicting receipt of SPC. Among ICU admissions receiving SPC, we assessed differences in patients who met any SPC trigger compared to those who met none. RESULTS: Of 48,744 eligible admissions, 1,965 (4.03%) received SPC; 979 (49.82%) of consultations met at least 1 trigger. The sensitivity and specificity for any trigger predicting SPC was 49.82% and 79.61%, respectively. Patients who met no triggers but received SPC were younger (62.71 years vs 66.58 years, mean difference (MD) 3.87 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.44C5.30) p<0.001), had longer ICU length of stay (11.43 days vs 8.42 days, MD -3.01 days (95% CI -4.30 C-1.72) p<0.001), and had a lower rate of in-hospital death (48.68% vs 58.12%, p<0.001).

Facility-wide, serial testing in SNFs has been used to identify residents with asymptomatic and presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection to inform mitigation efforts, including cohorting of residents with positive test results and exclusion of infected HCP from the workplace (2,3). During April-June 2020, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), with CDC assistance, conducted weekly serial testing at two SNFs experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks. Among 259 tested residents, and 341 tested HCP, 64% and 33%, respectively, had positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 test results. Continued SARS-CoV-2 transmission was potentially facilitated by lapses in infection prevention and control (IPC) practices, up to 12-day delays in receiving HCP test results (53%) at one facility, and incomplete HCP participation (71%). Genetic sequencing demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from HCP and resident specimens were clustered by facility, suggesting facility-based transmission. Residents and HCP working in SNFs are at risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2. As part of comprehensive COVID-19 preparation and response, including early identification of cases, SNFs should conduct serial testing of residents and HCP, maximize HCP testing participation, ensure availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), and enhance IPC practices?

METHODS: The study consisted of two phases: questionnaire and laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The questionnaire included 30 questions related to risk factors, knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, and methods of infection prevention. RESULTS: Data were obtained from 5082 police employees. The most common source of knowledge for a daily update on SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention was the Internet (42.6%), television (40.3%), and radio (39.7%). The most commonly used methods of SARS-CoV-2 infection included washing one's hands for at least 20 seconds (95.8%), wearing facemasks (82.9%), and physical distancing (74.9%). Results of IgG tests were lower in police units where the overall compliance with the preventive measures was higher (p < 0.01). Women were more likely to exercise SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention behaviors compared to men. Compliance with the recommended protective measures increased with age. CONCLUSIONS: Lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity rates were observed in police units with better overall compliance with the preventive measures, suggesting the key importance of group rather than individual behaviors.","output":"Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Police Officers in Poland-Implications for Public Health Policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report six cases of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), for whom bone marrow aspirate revealed hemophagocytosis.

Emerging concepts in nucleolar biology include the nucleolar stress response (NSR), whereby a series of cell insults have a special impact on the nucleolus. These insults include, among others, ultra-violet radiation (UV), nutrient deprivation, hypoxia and thermal stress. While these stresses might influence nucleolar biology directly or indirectly, other perturbances whose origin resides in the nucleolar biology also trigger nucleolar and systemic stress responses. Among the latter, we find mutations in nucleolar and ribosomal proteins, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing inhibitors and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription inhibition. The p53 protein also mediates NSR, leading ultimately to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence or differentiation. Hence, NSR is gaining importance in cancer biology. The nucleolar size and ribosome biogenesis, and how they connect with the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signalling pathway, are also becoming important in the biology of aging and cancer. Simple model organisms like the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, easy to manipulate genetically, are useful in order to study nucleolar and rDNA structure and their relationship with stress.

S protein, that is recognized by the cellular receptor, has been proposed that plays an essential role in controlling the dominant tropism. The genetic relationship of S gene from different enteric strains and non-enteropathogenic porcine respiratory coronaviruses (PRCVs) was determined. A correlation between tropism and the genetic structure of the S gene was established. PRCVs, derived from enteric isolates have a large deletion at the N-terminus of the S protein. Interestingly, two respiratory isolates, attenuated Purdue type virus (PTV-ATT) and Toyama (TOY56) have a full-length S gene. PTV-ATT has two specific amino acid differences with the S protein of the enteric viruses. One is located around position 219, within the deleted area, suggesting that alterations around this amino acid may result in the loss of enteric tropism. To study the role of different genes in tropism, a cluster of viruses closely related to PUR46 strain was analyzed. All of them have been originated by accumulating point mutations from a common, virulent isolate which infected the enteric tract. During their evolution these viruses have lost, virulence first, and then, enteric tropism. Sequencing analysis proved that enteric tropism could be lost without changes in ORFs 3a, 3b, 4, 6, and 7, and in 3'-end untranslated regions (3'-UTR). To study the role of the S protein in tropism recombinants were obtained between an enteric and a respiratory virus of this cluster.

However, the use of full dose anticoagulation as prophylaxis and evidence of the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation on COVID-19 patients remains to be a topic of interest. This study aimed to explore the aspects of anticoagulation applied in a tertiary hospital in the Philippines and to further elucidate on its outcomes and development of complications among COVID-19 patients. METHODS In this retrospective, observational study, we collected data from the case record forms of 945 patients with COVID-19 from two tertiary centers. Patients given anticoagulant therapy were classified as treated with standard, intermediate and therapeutic dose anticoagulation. The incidence of mortality and venous thromboembolism (VTE) among the three groups were compared as well as the risk for bleeding complications. Categorical variables were analyzed using the Chi-squared test and logistic regression analysis was done to quantify odds for mortality and complications among the treatment groups. RESULTS Among available agents, Enoxaparin was the anticoagulant of choice in 96.1% of cases. The percentage of patients given anticoagulation was noted to increase with increasing severity. Overall, there were 168 (17.8%) inpatient deaths wherein 128 received anticoagulation. 51.3% of those who received therapeutic anticoagulation were intubated at any time during their hospital stay (p value 0.00). In-hospital survival for patients given prophylactic anticoagulation was 78.3% with the highest mortality among patients given therapeutic anticoagulation at 53.8%. Using binary logistic regression, there was increasing odds of mortality as anticoagulant dosage increased with an odds ratio of 2.818 for therapeutic anticoagulation (p = 0.00, b = 1.036). There was significantly lower incidence of pulmonary embolism and among patients given standard prophylactic therapy. The odds of incurring VTE (OR = 3.38, p = 0.001) and PE (OR = 4.315, p = 0.000) were found to increase as dosage increased. Major bleeding after given anticoagulant therapy was recorded in 4.7% of patients. Although half of the patients who presented with bleeding were given standard dose prophylaxis, the incidence of bleeding was highest within the intermediate dose category at 9.2%. CONCLUSION: Therapeutic dose anticoagulation was associated with higher odds of mortality. The incidence of recorded venous thromboembolism was low but still showed increasing odds as dosage of anticoagulation increased. In lieu of these findings, we recommend that therapeutic dose anticoagulation be given with caution to patients diagnosed with COVID-19, especially among those with severe to critical disease. Patients with the highest risks for VTE and requiring higher anticoagulant dosages should be monitored closely due to higher odds of bleeding.

RESULTS: Majority consensus sequences were identical in most of the samples (5/7) and differed with one synonymous mutation from the Wuhan reference sequence. We identified 233 variants; each sample harbored in median 38 different minority variants and only 4 were shared by different samples. The frequency of mutation was similar between genes and correlated to the gene length (r=0.93, p=0.0002).

METHODS: This qualitative inductive interview study included 18 participants. Individual interviews were conducted approximately one year after the surgery. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The analysis identified one theme, and five subthemes describing recovery after bariatric surgery. Participants described being at a crossroads before surgery and having to make a change. After surgery, they had to learn to handle their new situation, which included getting to know their new body, handling thoughts about themselves, and managing social relations. To enhance their situation, support and information were essential. Social relations, support, successes, and challenges influenced their self-efficacy, and thoughts about adopting lifestyle changes, maintaining motivation, and handling setbacks. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery one year after bariatric surgery is an ongoing process that involves challenges encountered in lifestyle changes and physical and psychological transformations. Self-efficacy is not static and is influenced during the recovery process. Support and information are essential to enhance patient recovery after bariatric surgery.","output":"An endeavour for change and self-efficacy in transition: patient perspectives on postoperative recovery after bariatric surgeryCa qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, England went into its first lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions eased temporarily, followed by second and third waves in October 2020 and January 2021. Recent data showed that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced transmission of some invasive diseases. We assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pertussis incidence and on the immunisation programme in England. METHODS: We assessed trends in pertussis cases from 2012 to 2020 by age group and month. Incidence from the time that England eased its initial lockdown measures in July 2020 through to summer 2021 was calculated and the incidence rate ratios of pertussis cases from five years prior to the pandemic (July 2014 C June 2019) compared to the same time period during the pandemic (July 2020 C June 2021). Vaccine coverage estimates for pertussis containing vaccines were reviewed for the maternal and childhood programmes. RESULTS: A substantial decline in pertussis cases was observed from April 2020 onwards, marking the lowest number of cases in the last decade. Pertussis incidence dropped in all age groups, particularly among infants less than one year old (0.50 / 100,000 during July 2020 to June 2021 compared to 24.49/ 100,000 from July 2014 to June 2019). The incidence rate ratio was 0.02 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.02) for July 2014 to June 2019 (pre-pandemic) compared to the pandemic period of July 2020 to June 2021. None of the cases had a co-infection with SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine coverage for infants born between January to March 2020 with three doses of pertussis vaccine by 12 months of age decreased by 1.1% points compared to infants born between January to March 2019 (91.6% and 92.7%, respectively). Prenatal pertussis coverage for the 2020 to 2021 financial year was 2.7% points lower than the year prior to the pandemic (70.5% and 76.8%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic have had a significant impact on pertussis transmission. With the easing of restrictions it is important to continue monitoring pertussis cases in England alongside coverage of the maternal and childhood immunisation programmes.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Bordetella pertussis infections in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the past 20 years, infections caused by coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have posed a threat to public health since they may cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans.

Here, we report some interactions between these three coronaviruses and the Complement System, highlighting the central role of C3 with the severity of these infections. Although it can be protective, its role during coronavirus infections seems to be contradictory. For example, during SARS-CoV-2 infection, Complement System can control the viral infection in asymptomatic or mild cases; however, it can also intensify local and systemic damage in some of severe COVID-19 patients, due to its potent proinflammatory effect. In this last condition, the activation of the Complement System also amplifies the cytokine storm and the pathogenicity of coronavirus infection.

Using data on daily incidences of mental disorders in Taiwan over 4000 days from 1998 through 2009 to assess the time-series relation between stock price movements and mental disorders, we observe that stock price fluctuation clearly affects the hospitalization of mental disorders. We find that during a 12-year follow-up period, a low stock price index, a daily fall in the stock price index and consecutive daily falls in the stock price index are all associated with greater of mental disorders hospitalizations. A 1000-point fall in the TAIEX (Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index) increases the number of daily mental disorders hospitalizations by 4.71%. A 1% fall in the TAIEX in one single day increases daily hospitalizations for mental disorders by 0.36%. When the stock price index falls one consecutive day, it causes a daily increase of approximately 0.32% hospitalizations due to mental disorders on that day.

Since March 2020, the COVID-19 Health System Response Monitor, a joint initiative of the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, the WHO Regional Office for Europe, and the European Commission, has documented country responses to COVID-19 using a structured template which includes a section on provision of care. Using the information available on the platform, this paper analyzes how countries planned services for potential surge capacity, designed patient flows ensuring separation between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, and maintained routine services in both hospital and ambulatory settings. Despite very real differences in the organization of health and care services, there were many similarities in country responses. These include transitioning the management of COVID-19 mild cases from hospitals to outpatient settings, increasing the use of remote consultations, and cancelling or postponing non-urgent services during the height of the first wave. In the immediate future, countries will have to continue balancing care for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients to minimize adverse health outcomes, ideally with supporting guidelines and COVID-19-specific care zones.

DESIGN: Single-center, consecutive case series with historical controls. SUBJECTS: Consecutive patients presenting with primary RRD in a 50-day period during the USA COVID-19 pandemic (March 9(th) - April 27(th), 2020) and the corresponding 50-day period in the previous year (March 4(th) - April 22(th), 2019). METHODS: The cohorts were compared to assess demographic variables and clinical presentations. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors predictive of presenting macular attachment status. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with macula-on RRD at presentation. Secondary outcomes included visual acuity (VA), duration of symptoms prior to presentation, proportion presenting within one day of symptom onset, and presence of primary proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were included in the 2020 cohort compared to 111 patients in the 2019 primary control cohort. Demographic factors were similar between the groups. Significantly fewer patients presented with macula-on RRD in the 2020 cohort (20/82 patients, 24.4%) than in 2019 (55/111 patients, 49.5%, p = 0.001). Patients in the 2020 cohort had worse median VA at presentation (LogMAR 1.00, Snellen 20/200 in 2020 versus LogMAR 0.48, Snellen 20/60 in 2019, p = 0.008), fewer patients presenting within one day of symptoms (16/80 patients [19.5%] in 2020 versus 41/106 patients [36.9%] in 2019, p = 0.005), and a greater proportion with primary PVR (11/82 patients [13.4%] in 2020 versus 5/111 patients [4.5%] in 2019, p = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, younger age (p = 0.03) and established patient status (p = 0.02) were independent predictors of macula-on status in the 2020 cohort.

In mammals, AHCY is the only enzyme capable of performing this reaction. Controlled subcellular localization of AHCY is believed to facilitate local transmethylation reactions, by removing excess of SAH. Accordingly, AHCY is recruited to chromatin during replication and active transcription, correlating with increasing demands for DNA, RNA, and histone methylation.

For more than five decades, the search for new antibiotics has relied heavily upon the chemical modification of natural products (semi-synthesis), a method ill-equipped to combat rapidly evolving resistance threats. Semi-synthetic modifications are typically of limited scope within polyfunctional antibiotics, usually increase molecular weight, and seldom permit modifications of the underlying scaffold. When properly designed, fully synthetic routes can easily address these shortcomings. Here we report the structure-guided design and component-based synthesis of a rigid oxepanoproline scaffold which, when linked to the aminooctose residue of clindamycin, produces an antibiotic of exceptional potency and spectrum of activity, here named iboxamycin. Iboxamycin is effective in strains expressing Erm and Cfr rRNA methyltransferase enzymes, products of genes that confer resistance to all clinically relevant antibiotics targeting the large ribosomal subunit, namely macrolides, lincosamides, phenicols, oxazolidinones, pleuromutilins, and streptogramins. X-ray crystallographic studies of iboxamycin in complex with the native 70S bacterial ribosome, as well as the Erm-methylated 70S ribosome, uncover the structural basis for this enhanced activity, including an unforeseen and unprecedented displacement of upon antibiotic binding. In mice, iboxamycin is orally bioavailable, safe, and effective in treating bacterial infections, testifying to the capacity for chemical synthesis to provide new antibiotics in an era of rising resistance.","output":"A Synthetic Antibiotic Scaffold Effective Against Multidrug-Resistant Bacterial Pathogens (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than one million individuals all over the world and caused more than 55,000 deaths, as of April 3 in 2020.

The total number of study participants was 582, subdivided into two groups: (i) non-athlete university population (NA) without constant practice in physical activity or sports training (n = 470);and (ii) martial arts athletes (n = 122) with a sports career (A), 7.4 3.4 years of experience, at different levels (advanced belts and black belts). Results: Sports practice, normal BMI levels and high levels of physical activity translated into absence of distress (ND) in the psychological well-being of populations. The variance between the factors could be explained by the general health dimension (2.4% population;4.2% sex;12% physical activity;2.6% age). A moderate correlation between vitality and MET was found (r = 0.33;p < 0.001). Conclusions: The practice of a sport such as martial arts, normal body mass index and high levels of physical activity were factors that positively reduced levels of distress, translated into better psychological well-being in populations, and the general health dimension presented important contributions to psychological well-being.

In Chapter 1, I provide initial demonstrations of this thick skin bias, rule out multiple alternative explanations, and show that the bias extends to judgments about children as young as five and to judgments made by several professional populations and a nationally representative sample of the U.S. In Chapter 2, I investigate one mechanism underlying the thick skin bias: an overgeneralization of the sometimes accurate intuition that perceptions adapt to prior levels of exposure (as in psychophysical adaptation). Chapter 3 extends the thick skin bias to the context of gender-based violence, and Chapter 4 extends it to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Chapter 4 also tests the efficacy of providing people with an informational prime as a method of reducing the thick skin bias: information reduces, but does not fully reverse, the perception that people in poverty are less harmed by negative events. A brief conclusion charts future directions for research on the causes and consequences of and potential cures for the thick skin bias.

The development of laparoscopic techniques in recent years, introduced yet another method of treatment, considering patients with rectal cancer- laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection of the rectum. The aim of the study was to present initial treatment results considering the above-mentioned patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study group comprised 25 patients (16 male and 9 female) diagnosed with low-rectal cancer, subjected to surgery by means of the above-mentioned method. Mean patient age amounted to 66 years. Three (12%) patients required conversion to classical surgery (laparotomy), while one patient required reoperation, due to presacral vascular bleeding. Complications were observed in 10 (40%) patients. Average hospitalization was 7 days. In case of all patients the radial margin was negative, and mean number of removed lymph nodes amounted to 9.6. Mortality was not observed during the perioperative period. Due to the initial character of the study analysis (mean observation period in case of 68% of patients was shorter than 2 years), oncological results were not subject to evaluation.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals are regarded as sites with increased risk of infection. Therefore, patient contacts are often limited to urgent indications, which could negatively affect disease monitoring. However, data regarding actual infection rates in cirrhotic patients is limited. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the incidence of COVID-19 in patients with LC with/without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with physical presentation at our University Medical Center. METHODS: Patients were enrolled between 1st April and 30th June 2020 at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany. Symptoms of upper airway infection at baseline and presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG/IgM/IgA) were assessed at baseline and follow-up (FU) using an Electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche Elecsys). FU visits, including liver function test, clinical assessment and symptom questionnaire, were conducted after 6C8 weeks (FU-1) and 6 months (FU-2). Prior to inclusion of the first patient, obligatory face masks and personal distance were implemented as protective measures. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients were enrolled, 23% (n = 35) also had diagnosis of HCC (median age: 64 years, range: 19C86), 69% were male. Liver function according to Child-Pugh score (CPS) was: CPS A: 46% (n = 62); CPS B: 37% (n = 50); CPS C: 17% (n = 23). Clinical symptoms indicating upper airway infection were present in 53% (n = 77): shortness of breath (n = 40) and coughing (n = 28) were the most frequent. For the 150 patients enrolled, 284 outpatient visits were registered and 33 patients were admitted to the University Medical Center during the follow-up period. After a median of 52 days, n = 110 patients completed FU-1 and n = 72 completed FU-2 after a median of 6.1 months. Only in one patient, an 80-year-old man with stable liver function (CPS A) and advanced HCC, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected at baseline and FU-1, while antibody testing was negative in the remaining patients at baseline, FU-1 and FU-2. CONCLUSION: The incidence of COVID-19 at our tertiary medical center during the pandemic was low in LC and HCC patients, when simple protective measures were implemented.

This study investigates the degree to which South Africans complied with social distancing during the country's COVID-19 lockdown and identifies the determinants associated with being in close contact with large numbers of people. Materials and Methods: Data was collected from a South African national online survey on a data free platform, supplemented with telephone interviews. The survey was conducted from 8 to 29 April 2020. The primary outcome was the number of people that participants came into close contact with (within a 2-metre distance) the last time they were outside their home during the COVID-19 lockdown. Multivariate multinomial regression investigated the socio-demographic, psychosocial and household environmental determinants associated with being in contact with 1-10, 11-50 and more than 50 people. Results: Of the 17,563 adult participants, 20.3% reported having not left home, 50.6% were in close physical distance with 1-10 people, 21.1% with 11-50 people, and 8.0% with >50 people. Larger household size and incorrect knowledge about the importance of social distancing were associated with being in contact with >50 people. Male gender, younger age and being in the White and Coloured population groups were significantly associated with being in contact with 1-10 people but not with larger numbers of people. Employment, at least secondary school education, lack of self-efficacy in being able to protect oneself from infection, and moderate or high risk perception of becoming infected, were all associated with increased odds of close contact with 1-10, 11-50, and >50 people relative to remaining at home. Conclusion: The findings identify subgroups of individuals that are less likely to comply with social distancing regulations. Public health communication, interventions and policy can be tailored to address these determinants of social distancing.","output":"Determinants of Social Distancing Among South Africans From 12 Days Into the COVID-19 Lockdown: A Cross Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The general public is subject to triage policies that allocate scarce lifesaving resources during the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the worst public health emergencies in the past 100 years. However, public attitudes toward ethical principles underlying triage policies used during this pandemic are not well understood. Three experiments (preregistered; online samples; N = 1,868; U.S. residents) assessed attitudes toward ethical principles underlying triage policies. The experiments evaluated assessments of utilitarian, egalitarian, prioritizing the worst-off, and social usefulness principles in conditions arising during the COVID-19 pandemic, involving resource scarcity, resource reallocation, and bias in resource allocation toward at-risk groups, such as the elderly or people of color. We found that participants agreed with allocation motivated by utilitarian principles and prioritizing the worst-off during initial distribution of resources and disagreed with allocation motivated by egalitarian and social usefulness principles. At reallocation, participants agreed with giving priority to those patients who received the resources first. Lastly, support for utilitarian allocation varied when saving the greatest number of lives resulted in disadvantage for at-risk or historically marginalized groups. Specifically, participants expressed higher levels of agreement with policies that shifted away from maximizing benefits to one that assigned the same priority to members of different groups if this mitigated disadvantage for people of color. Understanding these attitudes can contribute to developing triage policies, increase trust in health systems, and assist physicians in achieving their goals of patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Public attitudes toward allocating scarce resources in the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid\\\\19 outbreak was declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization in January 2020.

Our study estimated the prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder and insomnia among the residents of the informal settlements of Dhaka, Bangladesh, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional phone-based survey was conducted from October to November 2020 among adult residents of five informal settlements of Dhaka city randomly chosen from an existing Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (UHDSS) run by icddr,b. Data on Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were collected. A multinomial logistic regression was performed to assess the associated factors of anxiety and insomnia. Results: Of the total 586 participants, the prevalence of mild to severe anxiety and insomnia were 53% and 43%, respectively. As per the multinomial regression analysis, participants with mild anxiety were significantly more likely to be older (>50 years) and afraid of COVID-19 infection. Likewise, participants with moderate/severe anxiety were significantly more likely to share less household facilities (e.g., toilet, kitchen, water) (OR: 2.23; 95% CI: 1.31C3.79), to have difficulties in food availability (OR: 2.76; 95% CI: 1.10C6.93), to be afraid of self (OR: 5.27; 95% CI: 2.82C9.88), and to worry about the family members (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.23C4.17) getting infected. Participants with mild insomnia were significantly more likely to share fewer household facilities and be afraid of being infected with COVID-19 infection. Moreover, participants with moderate/severe insomnia were significantly more likely to be female (OR: 1.90; 95% CI: 1.02C3.56), to receive food aid (OR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.29C0.88), to be afraid of self (OR: 3.85; 95% CI: 1.81C8.19), and to worry about someone like friends or neighbors (OR: 2.45; 95% CI: 1.07C5.58) getting infected with COVID-19.

Owing to the increased posttransplant morbidity and mortality associated with complete PVT, the presence of PVT is a relative contraindication to liver transplantation at many centers. Our group began performing portal vein (PV) recanalization and transjugular intrahepatic portostystemic shunt placement (PVR-TIPS) several years ago to optimize the transplant candidacy of patients with PVT. The procedure has evolved to include transsplenic access to assist with recanalization, which is now our preferred method due to its technical success without significant added morbidity. Here, we describe in detail our approach to PVR-TIPS with a focus on the transsplenic method. The procedure was attempted in 61 patients and was technically successful in 60 patients (98%). After transitioning to transsplenic access to assist with recanalization, the technical success rate has improved to 100%. The recanalized portal vein and TIPS have maintained patency during follow-up, or to the time of transplant, in 55 patients (92%) with a mean follow-up of 16.7 months. In total, 23 patients (38%) have undergone transplant, all of whom received a physiologic anastomosis (end-to-end anastomosis in 22 of 23 patients, 96%).

This is a pilot study of remote coaching and assessment of Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) manual skills in obstetrics and gynecology residents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PGY-3 obstetrics and gynecology residents participated in remote assessment of FLS manual skills using a live streaming platform. Learners who showed deficiencies in proficiency participated in live-streamed coaching sessions. The coaching sessions continued until the learner and coach mutually agreed that the learner was prepared for the skills portion of the FLS certification exam. The primary outcome was learner performance on skills assessment with external validation through the FLS manual skills exam pass rate. RESULTS: One learner demonstrated proficiency at baseline and the remaining nine underwent remote coaching sessions. Learners received a mean of two coaching sessions to reach mutually agreed readiness for the FLS exam as per learner and coach. All residents performed significantly better at the conclusion of the remote coaching series (11.3  0.82) as compared to their baseline scores (8.8  2.82) (P < .03; 95% CI, 0.31-4.69). Proficiency was externally validated through the FLS exam taken by each resident 1-2 weeks following their final assessment, with all learners passing the manual portion. The average satisfaction of learners with remote coaching was 77/100 (range 50-100). 100% of learners felt prepared for their FLS certification exam and 100% would recommend this remote training program to a colleague.

Using a murine orthotopic 4T1 breast cancer model, in which multiple thrombi are generated in the lungs at the late stage of cancer development, we investigated the effects of regulating the cellular NAD(+) levels on cancer-associated thrombosis. In this study, we show that dunnione (a strong substrate of NQO1) attenuates the prothrombotic state and lung thrombosis in tumor-bearing mice by inhibiting the expression of tissue factor and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Dunnione increases the cellular NAD(+) levels in lung tissues of tumor-bearing mice to restore the declining sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activity, thus deacetylating nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) and preventing the overexpression of tissue factor in bronchial epithelial and vascular endothelial cells. In addition, we demonstrated that dunnione abolishes the ability of neutrophils to generate NETs by suppressing histone acetylation and NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity.

Social media platforms have been recognized as important tools for health-promoting practices in public health, and the use of social media is widespread among the public. However, little is known about the effects of social media use on health promotion during a pandemic such as COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to explore the predictive role of social media use on public preventive behaviors in China during the COVID-19 pandemic and how disease knowledge and eHealth literacy moderated the relationship between social media use and preventive behaviors. METHODS: A national web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted by a proportionate probability sampling among 802 Chinese internet users (\\"netizens\\") in February 2020. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations, and hierarchical multiple regressions were employed to examine and explore the relationships among all the variables. RESULTS: Almost half the 802 study participants were male (416, 51.9%), and the average age of the participants was 32.65 years. Most of the 802 participants had high education levels (624, 77.7%), had high income >5000 (US $736.29) (525, 65.3%), were married (496, 61.8%), and were in good health (486, 60.6%). The average time of social media use was approximately 2 to 3 hours per day (mean 2.34 hours, SD 1.11), and the most frequently used media types were public social media (mean score 4.49/5, SD 0.78) and aggregated social media (mean score 4.07/5, SD 1.07). Social media use frequency (?=.20, P<.001) rather than time significantly predicted preventive behaviors for COVID-19. Respondents were also equipped with high levels of disease knowledge (mean score 8.15/10, SD 1.43) and eHealth literacy (mean score 3.79/5, SD 0.59). Disease knowledge (?=.11, P=.001) and eHealth literacy (?=.27, P<.001) were also significant predictors of preventive behaviors. Furthermore, eHealth literacy (P=.038) and disease knowledge (P=.03) positively moderated the relationship between social media use frequency and preventive behaviors, while eHealth literacy (?=.07) affected this relationship positively and disease knowledge (?=-.07) affected it negatively. Different social media types differed in predicting an individual's preventive behaviors for COVID-19. Aggregated social media (?=.22, P<.001) was the best predictor, followed by public social media (?=.14, P<.001) and professional social media (?=.11, P=.002). However, official social media (?=.02, P=.597) was an insignificant predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Social media is an effective tool to promote behaviors to prevent COVID-19 among the public. Health literacy is essential for promotion of individual health and influences the extent to which the public engages in preventive behaviors during a pandemic.

METHODS: A prospective follow-up cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted between 10/08/2020 to 01/09/ 2020, five months after the initial Phase 1 survey. The survey was sent to the same 231 intensivists across the six Asia-Pacific countries (Australia, Hong Kong, India, New Zealand, Philippines, and Singapore) that participated in Phase 1. The main outcome measure was to identify any changes in PPE-preparedness between Phases 1 and 2. FINDINGS: Phase 2 had responses from 132 ICUs (57%). Compared to Phase 1 respondents reported increased use of PPE-based practices such as powered air-purifying respirator (40.2% vs. 6.1%), N95-masks at all times (86.4% vs. 53.7%) and double-gloving (87.9% vs. 42.9%). The reported awareness of PPE stocks (85.6% vs. 51.9%), mandatory showering policies following PPE-breach (31.1% vs. 6.9%) and safety perception amongst HCWs (60.6% vs. 28.4%) improved significantly during Phase 2.

CONCLUSIONS: Overall reported PPE-preparedness improved between the two survey periods, particularly in PPE use, PPE inventory and HCW perceptions of safety. However, the uptake of HCW training and implementation of low-cost safety measures continued to be low and the awareness of PPE breach management policies were suboptimal. Therefore, the key areas for improvement should focus on regular HCW training, implementing low-cost buddy-system and increasing awareness of PPE-breach management protocols.","output":"Personal protective equipment preparedness in intensive care units during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: An Asia-Pacific follow-up survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus with the NA-H275Y mutation, which confers oseltamivir resistance, must be monitored, especially in patients undergoing neuraminidase inhibitor treatment.

Hand hygiene, social distancing, and the usage of personal protective equipment are considered the most vital tools in controlling the primary transmission of the virus. Converging evidence indicated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and its persistence over several days, which may create secondary transmission of the virus via waterborne and wastewater pathways. Although, researchers have started focusing on this mode of virus transmission, limited knowledge and societal unawareness of the transmission through wastewater may lead to significant increases in the number of positive cases. To emphasize the severe issue of virus transmission through wastewater and create societal awareness, we present a state of the art critical review on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and the potential remedial strategies to effectively control the viral spread and safeguard society. For low-income countries with high population densities, it is suggested to identify the virus in large scale municipal wastewater plants before following up with one-to-one testing for effective control of the secondary transmission. Ultrafiltration is an effective method for wastewater treatment and usually more than 4 logs of virus removal are achieved while safeguarding good protein permeability. Decentralized wastewater treatment facilities using solar-assisted disinfestation methods are most economical and can be effectively used in hospitals, isolation wards, and medical centers for reducing the risk of transmission from high local concentration sites, especially in tropical countries with abundant solar energy. Disinfection with chlorine, sodium hypochlorite, benzalkonium chloride, and peracetic acid have shown potential in terms of virucidal properties. Biological wastewater treatment using micro-algae will be highly effective in removal of virus and can be incorporated into membrane bio-reaction to achieve excellent virus removal rate. Though promising results have been shown by initial research for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater using physical, chemical and biological based treatment methods, there is a pressing need for extensive investigation of COVID-19 specific disinfectants with appropriate concentrations, their environmental implications, and regular monitoring of transmission.

We remain hopeful that the current crisis can serve as a guide for aligning our principles as a just and democratic society with a health agenda that explicitly recognizes that social inequities in health for some impacts all members of society.","output":"Incorporating Health Equity and Community Perspectives During COVID-19: Commonalities with Cardiovascular Health Equity Research."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several workers have studied the effect of harvest time on chemical and nutritional composition of almonds, but the results are partly conflicting, probably due to differences in the cultivars considered and to different agronomic and climatic conditions in the growing areas. In this paper, the influence of harvest time and cultivar on the chemical and nutritional composition of almonds (Prunus dulcis (Mill). D.A. Webb) were evaluated. Ten cultivars were considered, grown in the same orchard and subjected to the same agronomical regime. Almonds were collected at two different harvest times: (i) when the fruits were unripe, but already edible, and showed green and moist hull; and (ii) when the fruits were ripe, with dry brown hull. The analyses of proximate composition, fatty acid profile, total phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activity were carried out. RESULTS: Lipid content increased (P < 0.001) during ripening, while both protein and carbohydrate content decreased (P < 0.01). Fatty acid composition showed a not univocal behavior during ripening and was highly influenced by cultivar. Total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity varied among cultivars but increased during ripening with the exception of cv Marcona. The Genco and Francol cultivars were found to be phenolic rich. CONCLUSION: Harvest time and cultivar significantly influenced the chemical and nutritional composition of almonds. Genotype strongly influenced fatty acid composition and total phenolic compounds. The changes of bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity suggest that the synthesis of antioxidants also occurs in the last stage of ripening. Unripe almonds, a valuable niche product, showed interesting nutritional value. ? 2018 Society of Chemical Industry","output":"Evaluation of the chemical and nutritional characteristics of almonds (Prunus dulcis (Mill).

The sector definition was based on the OECD sector classification. For core funding to multilateral agencies that do not specialize in each aid sector, we estimated ODA and its flows based on the OECD methodology for calculating imputed multilateral ODA.Results: For all 29 countries, during the period of 2014-2018 where data were available for all the countries, the sector with the highest average annual ODA contribution was health at 20.34 billion USD (13.21%), followed by humanitarian aid at 18.04 billion (11.72%). Humanitarian aid has increased in the sectoral share rankings in both bilateral and multilateral aid, and the sectoral share for refugees in donor countries has increased in bilateral aid. While the 29 countries show relatively similar trends for sectoral shares, some countries and sectors display unique trends. For instance, infrastructure and energy sectors in bilateral aid of Japan are particularly high accounts for 48.48% of the total bilateral ODA of the country in 2018.Conclusions: This paper evaluated ODA trends by major donors of DAC countries in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic periods.

We hypothesized that engagement in these behaviors could provoke obsessions and phobias in vulnerable individuals in the community. METHODS: A total of 2117 participants, systematically selected to represent the age, gender, and race distributions of the US population, completed an online survey that assessed demographic characteristics, clinical features, COVID-19 risks, and COVID-19 contamination-prevention behaviors. Logistic regression was used to estimate the magnitude of the relationships between the COVID-19 behavior score and clinically significant contamination obsessions, contamination compulsions, and pre-COVID-19 to current change in obsessive-compulsive symptom scores. RESULTS: The COVID-19 behavior score was significantly associated with contamination obsessions (odds ratio (OR) = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.12-1.16; p < 0.001) and contamination phobias (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.12-1.16; p < 0.001). The COVID-19 behavior score also was associated with pre-pandemic to current increase in the overall obsessive-compulsive symptom score (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.09-1.23; p < 0.001), as well as increase in obsessive-compulsive symptom score excluding washing items (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.07-1.19; p < 0.001). The magnitude of these relationships did not appreciably change, after adjustment for other variables associated with the outcomes.

However, most of the research on the use of Ecofonts focuses on Latin alphabets. Moreover, texts printed with Ecofonts can be perceived as being less legible than those printed with the original typefaces. This study (a) assesses toner use reductions in documents printed with English and Thai Ecofonts, and (b) studies the observers perception of texts printed either with Ecofonts or with original typefaces. To achieve this, black pixels were removed from 10 English and 13 Thai typefaces widely used in academia and other media. Visibility and legibility tests, as well as mass analyses tests, were then performed on texts printed with some such typefaces. Results from instrumental measurements and digital image analyses show that the use of Ecofonts reduces toner use of an inkjet printer by up to 28%. The study also proposes a new Ecofont typeface for the Thai language. Visual tests showed that the visual experience of text printed using this Thai Ecofont is satisfactory. Awareness of the benefits of using Ecofonts changes the users attitudes towards the printing quality of Ecofont.

Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is adopted as biopsy tool for confirmation of virus infection. However, its accuracy is as low as 60-70%, which is inefficient to uncover the infected. In comparison, the chest CT has been considered as the prior choice in diagnosis and monitoring progress of COVID-19 infection. Although the COVID-19 diagnostic systems based on artificial intelligence have been developed for assisting doctors in diagnosis, the small sample size and the excessive time consumption limit their applications. To this end, this paper proposed a diagnosis prototype system for COVID-19 infection testing. The proposed deep learning model is trained and is tested on 2267 CT sequences from 1357 patients clinically confirmed with COVID-19 and 1235 CT sequences from non-infected people. The main highlights of the prototype system are: (1) no data augmentation is needed to accurately discriminate the COVID-19 from normal controls with the specificity of 0.92 and sensitivity of 0.93; (2) the raw DICOM image is not necessary in testing. Highly compressed image like Jpeg can be used to allow a quick diagnosis; and (3) it discriminates the virus infection within 6 seconds and thus allows an online test with light cost.

OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Leadership training is of growing importance and prevalence in medical education. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique insight into the qualities students value in leaders. Our qualitative study examined these leadership themes and provides a grounding for future development of leadership programs. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: A conventional qualitative approach was used in order to allow open expression of ideas related to leadership in a pandemic. The authors developed a 5 free-text question survey instrument aimed to uncover student perceptions of leadership both during the current pandemic and in crises in general. A participant pilot was performed in order to ensure readability and ease of understanding. We used thematic analysis to examine the content of the survey responses, and inductive coding of the responses allowed identification of emerging themes. Medical students at the University of Michigan were surveyed. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: In total, 162 students completed the survey. The demographic characteristics of participants are shown in Table 1. Median age was 25 years old (range, 22-39). There was good representation from the 4 classes in the medical school with 20-30% from each medical school class and 5% of dual degree students. Thematic analysis demonstrated that students value personal characteristics of excellence in their leaders with an orientation towards helping other people. Students believe that leaders must know how to interpret and use information and then that these leaders must be able to communicate expertly to guide organizations. The final theme that emerged is that effective leaders must commit to decisive action.

It was announced as a pandemic disease by The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2020 for its devastating impact on humans. With the advancements in computer science algorithms, the detection of this type of virus in the early stages is urgently needed for the fast recovery of patients. In this paper, a neutrosophic with a deep learning model for the detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray medical digital images is presented. The proposed model relies on neutrosophic theory by converting the medical images from the grayscale spatial domain to the neutrosophic domain. The neutrosophic domain consists of three types of images and they are, the True (T) images, the Indeterminacy (I) images, and the Falsity (F) images. Using neutrosophic images has positively affected the accuracy of the proposed model. The dataset used in this research has been collected from different sources as there is no benchmark dataset for COVID-19 chest X-ray until the writing of this research. The dataset consists of four classes and they are COVID-19, Normal, Pneumonia bacterial, and Pneumonia virus. After the conversion to the neutrosophic domain, the images are fed into three different deep transfer models and they are Alexnet, Googlenet, and Restnet18. Those models are selected as they have a small number of layers on their architectures and they have been used with related work. To test the performance of the conversion to the neutrosophic domain, four scenarios have been tested. The first scenario is training the deep transfer models with True (T) neutrosophic images only. The second one is training on Indeterminacy (I) neutrosophic images, while the third scenario is training the deep models over the Falsity (F) neutrosophic images. The fourth scenario is training over the combined (T, I, F) neutrosophic images. According to the experimental results, the combined (T, I, F) neutrosophic images achieved the highest accuracy possible for the validation, testing and all performance metrics such Precision, Recall and F1 Score using Resnet18 as a deep transfer model.

We compared the surgical outcomes between robotic liver surgery and laparoscopic liver surgery during the same period. Only patients who underwent left hemihepatectomy or left lateral sectionectomy were included in this study. RESULTS The robotic group consisted of 13 patients who underwent robotic liver resection including 10 left lateral sectionectomies and three left hemihepatectomies. The laparoscopic group consisted of 17 patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resection during the same period including six left lateral sectionectomies and 11 left hemihepatectomies. The groups were similar with regard to age, gender, tumor type, and tumor size. There were no significant differences in perioperative outcome such as operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative liver function tests, complication rate, and hospital stay between robotic liver resection and laparoscopic liver resection. However, the medical cost was higher in the robotic group. CONCLUSIONS Robotic liver resection is a safe and feasible option for liver resection in experienced hands.

A retrospective review was performed of all patients who underwent scalp incision closure at a single institution by a single plastic surgeon between 2006 and 2013. Sixty patients (83 procedures) were included in the study. Fifty-seven patients (95.0 %) underwent previous craniotomy, craniectomy, or other trans-galeal procedure. Of the total 60 patients, 35 patients received preoperative radiation. Sixteen patients received bevacizumab prior to their index case, while 12 received bevacizumab postoperatively. Ten patients (16.7 %) required additional plastic surgical intervention for wound complications after their index plastic surgery procedure. Plastic surgery was consulted prophylactically in 34 patients (38 procedures). When plastic surgery was consulted prophylactically, 4 patients (11.8 %) required further wound revision.

The City of Semarang has public transportation such as the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), called the Bus Trans Semarang. The opening of the Bus Trans Semarang in 2009 continues to grow and increase the number of passengers. However, the number of passengers is still far below the expected target, even though the Bus Trans Semarang service continues to be improved. The decrease in the number of passengers further exacerbated by the existence of restrictions on community activities in Semarang City due to the pandemic COVID-19. Bus Trans Semarang services during the COVID-19 Pandemic need handled or minimized to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 to passengers when using the Bus Trans Semarang. This study aspires to determine what service variables are based on passenger preference that needs improvement, especially in the new normal era. The hope is that by knowing these variables, services can be made on the Bus Trans Semarang to increase public transportation use while reducing private vehicles use. Thus, Bus Trans Semarang can be suitable public transportation since users safety and comfort are essential for the success of public transportation in breaking the COVID-19 chain.

Intensity and type of health effects depend on many factors such as the type, density, and diversity of bioaerosols in hospital environments. Therefore, identifying and determining their distribution in hospital environment contribute to reduce their adverse effects and maintain the physical health of patients and staff, as well as find the source of infections and possible allergies due to the presence of bioaerosols. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine the type and concentration of the bacterial and fungal bioaerosols, and their distribution in the indoor and outdoor air of a teaching hospital to establish a reference for future studies or measures. The air samples were collected with a one-stage Anderson sampler and particle mass counter for a period of four months in the fall and winter of 2019. In total, 262 bacterial and fungal samples were collected from the air of the wards of Tohid Hospital, Sanandaj, Iran. Antibiotic resistance test, bacterial identification by PCR method, and modeling the dispersion of concentrations of bio-aerosols were also conducted. In order to identify bacteria and fungi, some biochemical and molecular tests and microscopic and macroscopic characteristic methods were applied, respectively. The results showed that the highest and lowest densities of the bioaerosols were observed in lung and operating wards (336.67 and 15.25 CFU/m(3)). Moreover, the highest and least concentrations of particles were seen in the emergency and operating wards, respectively. The most common fungi isolated from the hospital air were Penicillium (24.7%), Cladosporium (23. 4%), Aspergillus niger (13.3%), and Aspergillus Flavus (11.4%). Furthermore, the highest concentration of the isolated bacterium was Staphylococcus hemolyticus (31.84%). Most bacteria showed the highest resistance to gentamicin. The overall average hospital air pollution to bioaerosols was slightly higher than the standards proposed by international organizations. Due to the high concentration of bioaerosols and particles in the studied hospital, providing suitable conditions such as temperature, humidity, proper ventilation, and intelligent air conditioning system using efficient ventilation systems, and restricting the entrance of wards can reduce airborne particles in hospital environment.","output":"Evaluation of bio-aerosols type, density, and modeling of dispersion in inside and outside of different wards of educational hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cognitive impairments contribute to difficulty obtaining employment for people with severe mental illness (SMI).

To minimize the spread of the virus and to gain trust from the public in the airport operations safety, airports implemented measures, e.g., physical distancing, entry/exit temperature screening and more. However, airports do not know what the impact of these measures will be on the operations performance and the passengers safety when passenger demand increases back. The goal of this research is twofold. Firstly, to analyze the impact of current (COVID-19) and future pandemic-related measures on airport terminal operations. Secondly, to identify plans that airport management agents can take to control passengers flow in a safe, efficient, secure and resilient way. To model and simulate airport operations, an agent-based model was developed. The proposed model covers the main airports handling processes and simulates local interactions, such as physical distancing between passengers. The obtained results show that COVID-19 measures can significantly affect the passenger throughput of the handling processes and the average time passengers are in contact with each other. For instance, a 20% increase in check-in time (due to additional COVID-19 related paperwork at the check-in desk) can decrease passenger throughput by 16% and increase the time that passengers are in contact by 23%. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation of Airport Terminal Operations Under COVID-19-Related Restrictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In managing patients with cancer in the COVID-19 era, clinical oncologists and palliative care practitioners had to face new, disrupting and complex medical situations, challenging the quality of the shared decision-making process During the first lockdown in France, we developed an onco-palliative ethics meeting to enhance the quality of the decision-making process for patients with advanced cancer treated for COVID-19 METHODS: A least one of the institutional ethics committee members was present along with oncologists, palliative care teams, psycho-oncologists, radiologists and intensive care specialists Specific medical parameters were systematically collected to form a standardised framework for the discussions RESULTS: The main raised issues were the definition of new criteria for the implementation of invasive resuscitation techniques, optimal ways to adapt or delay anticancer treatment and best procedures to address terminal respiratory failure and end-of-life care The main clinical and ethical guidelines that emerged during these debates are presented The palliative care team played a major role in assessing and reporting patients' awareness of cancer-related prognosis and their wishes concerning invasive therapies or transfer to intensive care units, enabling an individualised benefit-risk balance assessment The ethics committee members ensured continuous monitoring during the discussions Their function was to recall the main ethical principles including dignity, which is conferred on people when there are treated as having equal status CONCLUSIONS: The onco-palliative ethics meeting provided a powerful avenue for improvement of collegiality and reinforcement of teamwork, which could be a major protection against burnout for healthcare professionals facing an epidemic onslaught","output":"Advanced cancer and COVID-19 comorbidity: medical oncology-palliative medicine ethics meetings in a comprehensive cancer centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the unprecedented development and integration of infectious disease dynamic transmission models into policy making and public health practice.

We used Mendelian randomization using genetic determinants of serum-ACE levels to test whether decreased ACE levels increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or Covid-19 severity, while reducing potential bias from confounding and reverse causation in observational studies. METHODS: Genetic variants strongly associated with ACE levels, which were nearby the ACE gene, were identified from the ORIGIN trial and a separate genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ACE levels from the AGES cohort. The ORIGIN trial included 4147 individuals of European and Latino ancestries. Sensitivity analyses were performed using a study of 3200 Icelanders. Cohorts from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative GWAS of up to 960 186 individuals of European ancestry were used for Covid-19 susceptibility, hospitalization and severe-disease outcome. RESULTS: Genetic variants were identified that explain between 18% and 37% of variance in ACE levels. Using genetic variants from the ORIGIN trial, a standard-deviation decrease in ACE levels was not associated with an increase in Covid-19 susceptibility [odds ratio (OR): 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.90, 1.15], hospitalization (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.68, 1.08) or severe disease (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.51, 1.06).

ZSL is known for having minimal human intervention by relying only on previously known or trained concepts plus currently existing auxiliary information. This makes the ZSL applicable in many real-world scenarios, from unknown object detection in autonomous vehicles to medical imaging and unforeseen diseases such as COVID-19 Chest X-Ray (CXR) based diagnosis. We introduce a novel and broaden solution called Few/one-shot learning, and present the definition of the ZSL problem as an extreme case of the few-shot learning.

According to the results, the mean score of negative emotional reactions towards COVID-19 was 3.45 (standard deviation 1.11, range 1C5), meaning that the score was relatively high. Higher levels of negative emotional reactions towards COVID-19 were associated with higher perceived susceptibility, greater knowledge about COVID-19 and a lower sense of mastery.

The papain-like protease (PLpro) domain is part of the SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein (nsp)-3, and represents an essential protease and validated drug target for preventing viral replication. PLpro moonlights as a deubiquitinating (DUB) and deISGylating enzyme, enabling adaptation of a DUB high throughput (HTS) screen to identify PLpro inhibitors. Drug repurposing has been a major focus through the COVID-19 pandemic as it may provide a fast and efficient route for identifying clinic-ready, safe-in-human antivirals. We here report our effort to identify PLpro inhibitors by screening the ReFRAME library of 11,804 compounds, showing that none inhibit PLpro with any reasonable activity or specificity to justify further progression towards the clinic. We also report our latest efforts to improve piperidine-scaffold inhibitors, 5c and 3k, originally developed for SARS-CoV PLpro. We report molecular details of binding and selectivity, as well as in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies of this scaffold. A co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro bound to inhibitor 3k guides medicinal chemistry efforts to improve binding and ADME characteristics. We arrive at compounds with improved and favorable solubility and stability characteristics that are tested for inhibiting viral replication. Whilst still requiring significant improvement, our optimized small molecule inhibitors of PLpro display decent antiviral activity in an in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection model, justifying further optimization.","output":"Insights Into Drug Repurposing, as Well as Specificity and Compound Properties of Piperidine-Based SARS-CoV-2 PLpro Inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Adjuvant chemotherapy after hepatectomy is controversial in liver-only metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). We conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine if adjuvant modified infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) is superior to hepatectomy alone for liver-only metastasis from CRC. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this phase II or III trial (JCOG0603), patients age 20-75 years with confirmed CRC and an unlimited number of liver metastatic lesions were randomly assigned to hepatectomy alone or 12 courses of adjuvant mFOLFOX6 after hepatectomy. The primary end point of phase III was disease-free survival (DFS) in intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS Between March 2007 and January 2019, 300 patients were randomly assigned to hepatectomy alone (149 patients) or hepatectomy followed by chemotherapy (151 patients). At the third interim analysis of phase III with median follow-up of 53.6 months, the trial was terminated early according to the protocol because DFS was significantly longer in patients treated with hepatectomy followed by chemotherapy. With median follow-up of 59.2 months, the updated 5-year DFS was 38.7% (95% CI, 30.4 to 46.8) for hepatectomy alone compared with 49.8% (95% CI, 41.0 to 58.0) for chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.92; one-sided P = .006). However, the updated 5-year overall survival (OS) was 83.1% (95% CI, 74.9 to 88.9) with hepatectomy alone and 71.2% (95% CI, 61.7 to 78.8) with hepatectomy followed by chemotherapy. In the chemotherapy arm, the most common grade 3 or higher severe adverse event was neutropenia (50% of patients), followed by sensory neuropathy (10%) and allergic reaction (4%). One patient died of unknown cause after three courses of mFOLFOX6 administration. CONCLUSION DFS did not correlate with OS for liver-only metastatic CRC. Adjuvant chemotherapy with mFOLFOX6 improves DFS among patients treated with hepatectomy for CRC liver metastasis. It remains unclear whether chemotherapy improves OS.","output":"Hepatectomy Followed by mFOLFOX6 Versus Hepatectomy Alone for Liver-Only Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (JCOG0603): A Phase II or III Randomized Controlled Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Household energy constitutes an important share of affordable housing. Unaffordable housing and inadequate household energy represent a new dimension of poverty. Connections between energy, housing affordability and well-being are still under-researched. Building on housing affordability framework, this study explores the magnitude in changes in affordability of acquisition and use of an apartment between January 2018 and January 2022. Over the last four years, the real estate market in Europe has changed significantly. This paper deals with primary data for the Czech Republic, where acquisition prices of residential real estate increased depending on the region in the range of 50 to 120%. Since January 2022, there has been a sharp rise in energy prices and a tightening of conditions for the acquisition of mortgage loans. All these factors affect the standard of living in the Czech Republic. The article quantifies the magnitude of this change by calculating shares of total housing costs to total average net household income for the period January 2018 and January 2022. It is found that the affordability of owner-occupied housing in the Czech Republic has deteriorated and part of the middle class will be forced to move to the rental housing sector, multifamily housing and sharing. Finally, we argue that energy poverty needs to be considered in addressing the government housing policies. The aim of the article is to analyze the changes that have taken place in the real estate market over the last four years in relation to the growth of total housing costs and energy costs associated with housing.","output":"Change in the Affordability of Owner-Occupied Housing in the Context of Rising Energy Prices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When five partners from Austria, Netherlands, Hungary, Denmark, Sweden and Portugal came together three years ago to create a joint project for Social Entrepreneurship/Entrepreneurship in Education, they did not imagine that in late 2019/1st semester of 2020 this would be so relevant Indeed, the occurrence of a pandemic called COVID-19 has largely destroyed, if not all, the objectives of the global and capitalist society where the western world lived Previously, bodies like the United Nations (UN) had already stressed the urgent need for joint work by all societies worldwide for Sustainable Development This concept encompasses many realities from environmental issues, to the eradication of hunger and poverty in the world, to gender equality or the need to create sustainable cities and communities Two documents stand out and guide human behaviors until 2030 and 2063, respectively the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2063 Agenda for Africa The child of today is the adult of tomorrow;therefore, the programs and teaching activities of Basic Education must educate for the world that you want to have in 2030 and 2063 The present work presents the new teaching strategies followed and the technologies of education support used in the implementation of the UKIDS pilot project ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"Reinventing Basic Education After COVID: Technologies for Entrepreneurship in Education at the Ukids Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chest computed tomography (CT) imaging has become indispensable for staging and managing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and current evaluation of anomalies/abnormalities associated with COVID-19 has been performed majorly by the visual score. The development of automated methods for quantifying COVID-19 abnormalities in these CT images is invaluable to clinicians. The hallmark of COVID-19 in chest CT images is the presence of ground-glass opacities in the lung region, which are tedious to segment manually. We propose anamorphic depth embedding-based lightweight CNN, called Anam-Net, to segment anomalies in COVID-19 chest CT images. The proposed Anam-Net has 7.8 times fewer parameters compared to the state-of-the-art UNet (or its variants), making it lightweight capable of providing inferences in mobile or resource constraint (point-of-care) platforms. The results from chest CT images (test cases) across different experiments showed that the proposed method could provide good Dice similarity scores for abnormal and normal regions in the lung. We have benchmarked Anam-Net with other state-of-the-art architectures, such as ENet, LEDNet, UNet++, SegNet, Attention UNet, and DeepLabV3+. The proposed Anam-Net was also deployed on embedded systems, such as Raspberry Pi 4, NVIDIA Jetson Xavier, and mobile-based Android application (CovSeg) embedded with Anam-Net to demonstrate its suitability for point-of-care platforms.

We also suggested a novelty called output neuron keeping, which changes the twice transfer learning technique. In order to clarify the modus operandi of the models, we used Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to generate heatmaps. RESULTS: We were able to reach test accuracy of 100% on our test dataset. Twice transfer learning and output neuron keeping showed promising results improving performances, mainly in the beginning of the training process. Although LRP revealed that words on the X-rays can influence the networks predictions, we discovered this had only a very small effect on accuracy. CONCLUSION: Although clinical studies and larger datasets are still needed to further ensure good generalization, the state-of-the-art performances we achieved show that, with the help of artificial intelligence, chest X-rays can become a cheap and accurate auxiliary method for COVID-19 diagnosis.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients, who already were confirmed with COVID-19 using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), were admitted to our hospital due to chest pain with STEMI. The median patient age was 66 years (range: 27-84 years). Female/male ratio was 22/15. We performed a second RT-PCR test in all patients. We investigated myocardial enzymes (creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB), cardiac troponin-I (c-TnI), and C-reactive protein (CRP), and liver enzymes (alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) also were measured. Blood d-dimer, thromboplastin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and fibrinogen were investigated. Transcutaneous oxygen saturation was monitored for each patient in the emergency department (ED). To evaluate myocardial wall abnormalities, transthoracic echocardiography was performed. RESULTS: Coronary artery disorders requiring revascularization were detected in 25 patients (67.5%). There was no evidence of coronary artery disease in the remaining 12 patients. Out of 25, nine coronary artery disease patients had a history of coronary intervention (24.3%). All patients had high levels of myocardial enzyme release. Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) were performed in patients with culprit lesion(s). Success rate of PCI was 87.5% (N = 21). The median number of stent use was 2.90.7 (range: 1-4). Because PCI failed in four patients, we suggested elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery after medical treatment. Six patients required re-intervention owing to early stent thrombosis (30%). Seven patients died after PCI (33.3%). For patients with negative or positive RT-PCR test results, we performed thoracic computed tomography (CT), which is a sensitive diagnostic method for COVID-19. Interlobular septal and pleural thickening with patchy bronchiectasis in the bilateral or unilaterally lower and/or middle lobe(s) were the main pathologies in 24 patients. D-dimer, fibrinogen, and CRP levels were high in 11 PCI patients with bilaterally pulmonary involvement by COVID-19 (52.3%), while fibrin degradation products did not significantly change. For three patients with normal coronary arteries with a transient hypokinesia or hypokinesia as result of myocarditis, we decided to perform atypical Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. We medically treated using inodilator (levosimendan), diuretic, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. To prevent the risk of thromboembolism, we also administered a heparin drip. The myocardial contractility of the apex did improve, and patients were discharged from the hospital, with the exception of one young female patient. She is following in the ICU with stabil hemodynamics. CONCLUSION: Chest pain with STEMI can develop in patients with confirmed COVID-19. Nearly one-third of patients had COVID-19 with chest pain and concomitant STEMI and normal coronary angiography (32.4%). Urgent PCI may be performed in hemodynamically unstable patients with high mortality.

MERS was first reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012. Every year, the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca attracts more than two million pilgrims from 184 countries, making it one of the largest annual religious mass gatherings (MGs) worldwide. MGs in confined areas with a high number of pilgrims movements worldwide continues to elicit significant global public health concerns. MERCURIAL was designed by adopting a seroconversion surveillance approach to provide multiyear evidence of MG-associated MERS-CoV seroconversion among the Malaysian Hajj pilgrims. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: MERCURIAL is an ongoing multiyear prospective cohort study. Every year, for the next 5 years, a cohort of 1000 Hajj pilgrims was enrolled beginning in the 2016 Hajj pilgrimage season. Pre-Hajj and post-Hajj serum samples were obtained and serologically analysed for evidence of MERS-CoV seroconversion. Sociodemographic data, underlying medical conditions, symptoms experienced during Hajj pilgrimage, and exposure to camel and untreated camel products were recorded using structured pre-Hajj and post-Hajj questionnaires. The possible risk factors associated with the seroconversion data were analysed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The primary outcome of this study is to better enhance our understanding of the potential threat of MERS-CoV spreading through MG beyond the Middle East.

Here, we report hematite, an earth-abundant material, to be highly effective and thermally stable to catalyze methane combustion at low temperatures (< 500C) with a low light-off temperature of 230C and 100% selectivity to CO2. The reported performance is impressive and comparable to those of precious-metal-based catalysts, with a low apparent activation energy of 17.60 kcalmol-1. Our theoretical analysis shows that such superior activity stems from a tetra-iron center with an antiferromagnetically coupled iron dimer on the hematite (110) surface, analogous to that of the methanotroph enzyme methane monooxygenase that activates methane at ambient conditions in nature. Isotopic oxygen tracer experiments support a Mars van Krevelen redox mechanism where CH4 is activated by reaction with a hematite surface oxygen first, followed by a catalytic cycle through a molecular-dioxygen-assisted pathway. Surface studies with in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the evolution of reaction intermediates from a methoxy CH3-O-Fe, to a bridging bidentate formate b-HCOO-Fe, to a monodentate formate m-HCOO-Fe, before CO2 is eventually formed via a combination of thermal hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) and proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes. The elucidation of the reaction mechanism and the intermediate evolutionary profile may allow future development of catalytic syntheses of oxygenated products from CH4 in gas-phase heterogeneous catalysis.","output":"In situ Identification of Reaction Intermediates and Mechanistic Understandings of Methane Oxidation over Hematite: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systemic blood distribution is an important factor involved in regulating cerebral blood flow (CBF). However, the effect of an acute change in central blood volume (CBV) on CBF regulation remains unclear. To address our question, we sought to examine the CBF and systemic hemodynamic responses to microgravity during parabolic flight. Twelve healthy subjects were seated upright and exposed to microgravity during parabolic flight. During the brief periods of microgravity, mean arterial pressure was decreased (-26  1%, P < 0.001), despite an increase in cardiac output (+21  6%, P < 0.001). During microgravity, central arterial pulse pressure and estimated carotid sinus pressure increased rapidly. In addition, this increase in central arterial pulse pressure was associated with an arterial baroreflex-mediated decrease in heart rate (r = -0.888, P < 0.0001) and an increase in total vascular conductance (r = 0.711, P < 0.001). The middle cerebral artery mean blood velocity (MCA Vmean) remained unchanged throughout parabolic flight (P = 0.30). During microgravity the contribution of cardiac output to MCA Vmean was gradually reduced (P < 0.05), and its contribution was negatively correlated with an increase in total vascular conductance (r = -0.683, P < 0.0001). These findings suggest that the acute loading of the arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreceptors by increases in CBV during microgravity results in acute and marked systemic vasodilation. Furthermore, we conclude that this marked systemic vasodilation decreases the contribution of cardiac output to CBF. These findings suggest that the arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreflex-mediated peripheral vasodilation along with dynamic cerebral autoregulation counteracts a cerebral overperfusion, which otherwise would occur during acute increases in CBV.","output":"Effect of an acute increase in central blood volume on cerebral hemodynamics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), being highly virulent and contagious in piglets, has caused significant damage to the pork industries of many countries worldwide.

Here, site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate the role of nsp3 in more detail. Liberation of the hydrophobic N terminus of nsp3, which is normally achieved by cleavage of the nsp2/3 junction by the nsp2 protease, was nonessential for the formation of DMVs. However, the substitution of each of a cluster of four conserved cysteine residues, residing in a predicted luminal loop of nsp3, completely blocked DMV formation. Some of these mutant nsp3 proteins were also found to be highly cytotoxic, in particular, exerting a dramatic effect on the endoplasmic reticulum. The functionality of an engineered N glycosylation site in the cysteine-containing loop confirmed both its presence in the lumen and the transmembrane nature of nsp3. This mutant displayed an interesting intermediate phenotype in terms of DMV formation, with paired and curved membranes being formed, but DMV formation apparently being impaired. The effect of nsp3 mutations on replicase polyprotein processing was investigated, and several mutations were found to influence processing of the region downstream of nsp3 by the nsp4 main protease.

Although both viruses are poorly cytopathic, persistence of either virus carries a risk of chronic liver inflammation, potentially resulting in liver steatosis, liver cirrhosis, end-stage liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. Virus-specific T cells are a major determinant of the outcome of hepatitis, as they contribute to the early control of chronic hepatitis viruses, but they also mediate immunopathology during persistent virus infection. We have analyzed the role of platelet-derived vasoactive serotonin during virus-induced CD8(+) T cell-dependent immunopathological hepatitis in mice infected with the noncytopathic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. After virus infection, platelets were recruited to the liver, and their activation correlated with severely reduced sinusoidal microcirculation, delayed virus elimination and increased immunopathological liver cell damage. Lack of platelet-derived serotonin in serotonin-deficient mice normalized hepatic microcirculatory dysfunction, accelerated virus clearance in the liver and reduced CD8(+) T cell-dependent liver cell damage. In keeping with these observations, serotonin treatment of infected mice delayed entry of activated CD8(+) T cells into the liver, delayed virus control and aggravated immunopathological hepatitis.

Here, we report that afucosylated IgG which are of minor abundance in humans (6% of total IgG) are specifically formed against surface epitopes of enveloped viruses after natural infections or immunization with attenuated viruses, while protein subunit immunization does not elicit this low fucose response. This can give beneficial strong responses, but can also go awry, resulting in a cytokine-storm and immune-mediated pathologies. In the case of COVID-19, the critically ill show aggravated afucosylated-IgG responses against the viral spike protein. In contrast, those clearing the infection unaided show higher fucosylation levels of the anti-spike protein IgG. Our findings indicate antibody glycosylation as a potential factor in inflammation and protection in enveloped virus infections including COVID-19.","output":"Afucosylated immunoglobulin G responses are a hallmark of enveloped virus infections and show an exacerbated phenotype in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Although prefabricated construction (PC) technology has attracted considerable attention worldwide because of its significant role in the global fight against COVID-19, market-driven adoption is still limited. The mechanisms for PC technology adoption have yet to be defined, which inhibits its diffusion in the construction market. This study aims to reveal the intrinsic motivation and action mechanism for PC technology adoption. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the technology acceptance model (TAM), the study integrates characteristics from the diffusion of innovation theory to propose a multifaceted model for explaining practitioners PC technology adoption behavior from technology, organization and environment contexts. The proposed theoretical model was empirically examined via a survey of 234 professionals in mainland China using the partial least squares-structural equation modeling technique. Findings: The outcomes indicated that relative advantage, corporate social responsibility and market demand are significantly positively related to practitioners perceived usefulness from PC technology. Regulatory support and trading partner support have noticeable positive effects on practitioners perceived ease of use from PC technology. Perceived ease of use is found to positively influence perceived usefulness, and both of them have a positive influence on the attitude toward adopting PC technology. Attitude is further confirmed as an important predictor of adoption intention, which would lead to actual PC technology adoption behavior. Originality/value: To the best of the authors knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to explore industry perceptions toward PC technology adoption, providing valuable guidance for the effective diffusion of PC technology and laying a reliable foundation for research on other construction innovation adoption in post-COVID-19. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Proposing a multifaceted model for adopting prefabricated construction technology in the construction industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Whilst Covid prevented so many of the year's promised commemorative activities, one positive outcome was the delay of the original live Lucca event scheduled for March and its transformation into an online event in Beethoven's birth month. (Edited by his daughter Margaret O'Sullivan, this was part of his project Beethoven's Irish Songs Revisited, which sought to reconstruct those folksongs for which George Thomson never got around to supplying texts.) In his stimulating address, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony as a Disputed Symbol of Community: From Thomas Mann's Doctor Faustus to the Brexiteers of 2019, William Kinderman cast a wide intellectual net, developing themes from the final chapter of his most recent book, Beethoven: A Political Artist in Revolutionary Times (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2020).

Method and Results Since February 2020, we enrolled all 47 cases (79% male) in a first cohort of patients, with a mean age of 61.8  14.5 years, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, out of 2676 heart transplant recipients alive before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic at 7 heart transplant centers in Northern Italy. To date, 38 patients required hospitalization while 9 remained self-home quarantined and 14 died. Compared to the general population, prevalence (18 vs 7 cases per 1000) and related case fatality rate (29.7 vs 15.4%) in heart transplant recipients were doubled. Univariable analysis showed older age (p=0.002), diabetes mellitus (p=0.040), extracardiac arteriopathy (p=0.040), previous PCI (p=0.040), CAV score (p=0.039), lower GFR (p=0.004), and higher NYHA classes (p=0.023) were all significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. During the follow-up two patients died and a third patient has prolonged viral-shedding alternating positive and negative swabs. Since 1st July 2020, we had 6 new patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 5 patients asymptomatic were self-quarantined, while 1 is still hospitalized for pneumonia. A standard therapy was maintained for all, except for the hospitalized patient.

The purpose of this paper is to design a model that will have general applicability beyond the wine industry. Design/methodology/approach The research uses regression-based additive decomposition of time series data to predict the trajectory of the market share for the digital distribution channel. The study develops a statistical prediction model using time series data between 2007 and 2020, inclusive, sourced from US Annual Wine Reports and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms databases. Findings The results show an increasing trajectory of wine sales through the online distribution channel with predictable seasonality. The disruptive effects of consumer switching behavior point to a steady increase in sales due both to increasing demand and accelerating switching. Nevertheless, the model shows that bricks and mortar purchases will remain strong and continue to account for the bulk of wine sales. COVID-19 has caused a step function increase in online sales but this should moderate after the crisis subsides and can be tested further. Originality/value This study is original in developing a model for an industry where bricks and mortar sales are growing and are expected to remain strong while there is still identifiable switching to online sales. The wine industry presents a classic case of accelerating switching behavior where there is still a strong franchise for in-store purchases. The model should have general applicability to distribution channels beyond the wine industry where steady growth, marked seasonality and disruptive consumer switching are in evidence.","output":"A time series projection model of online seasonal demand for American wine and potential disruption in the supply channels due to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Fort McMurray, a city in northern Alberta, Canada, has experienced multiple traumas in the last five years, including the 2016 wildfire, the 2020 floods, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Eighteen months after the wildfire, major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms were elevated among school board employees in the city. Objective: This study aimed to compare employees of the school board and other employees of Fort McMurray in respect to the impact the 2016 wildfires, the 2019 COVID pandemic, and the 2020 floods had on their mental health. Methodology: A quantitative cross-sectional survey was conducted in Fort McMurray from 24 April to 2 June 2021. Online questionnaires were administered through REDCap and were designed to capture socio-demographic characteristics, clinical as well as wildfire, COVID-19, and flooding-related variables. Mental health outcome variables were captured using self-reported standardized assessment scales. Data were analysed with descriptive statistics, Chi-square/Fishers Exact tests, and binary regression analysis. Results: Of the 249 residents who accessed the online survey, 186 completed the survey, giving a response rate of 74.7%. Of these respondents, 93.5% (174) indicated their employment status and were included in the Chi-square analysis. Most of the respondents were female (86.2%, (150)), above 40 years (53.4%, (93)), and were in a relationship (71.3%, (124)). The prevalence values for MDD, GAD and PTSD among respondents were 42.4%, 41.0, and 36.8%, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between employees of the school board and other employees with respect to likely PTSD prevalence (28% vs. 45%, respectively, p < 0.05), although with other factors controlled for, in a binary logistic regression model, employer type did not significantly predict likely PTSD. Conclusions: The study has established that likely PTSD symptoms were significantly higher in other employees compared to those of school board employees. Greater exposure to the traumatic events and a greater perceived lack of support from other employers might have contributed to the significantly higher prevalence of PTSD in other employees.","output":"Mental Health Impacts of Wildfire, Flooding and COVID-19 on Fort McMurray School Board Staff and Other Employees: A Comparative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has now spread worldwide, and various governments are attempting to control the disease's spread before it becomes a global health crisis.

To this end, lower limb functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycling holds promise. OBJECTIVE: To investigate pain reduction in a sample of patients with SCI by means of lower limb rehabilitation using FES cycling. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen patients with incomplete and complete SCIs, attending the Neurorobotic Unit of our research institute and reporting pain at or below the level of their SCI were recruited to this exploratory study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients undertook two daily sessions of FES cycling, six times weekly, for 6 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain outcomes were measured using the 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS), the Multidimensional Pain Inventory for SCI (MPI-SCI), and the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36). Finally, we assessed the features of dorsal laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) to objectively evaluate A? ber pathways. RESULTS: All participants tolerated the intervention well, and completed the training without side effects. Statistically significant changes were found in pain-NRS, MPI-SCI, and SF-36 scores, and LEP amplitudes. Following treatment, we found that three patients experienced high pain relief (an NRS decrease of at least 80%), six individuals achieved moderate pain relief (an NRS decrease of about 30-70%), and five participants had mild pain relief (an NRS decrease of less than 30%). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that FES cycling training is capable of reducing the pain reported by patients with SCI, regardless of American Spinal Injury Association scoring, pain level, or the neurological level of injury.

A quantitative survey was administered to 188 nurses dealing with COVID-19?s patients in Indonesia. Data were analyzed using Process v3.5 Andrew F. Hayes in SPSS. This study revealed that mindful leadership reduces turnover intention, and empathetic leadership increases resilience, while mindful leadership does not increase resilience, and empathetic leadership does not lessen turnover intention. We also conclude that self-regulation mediates the relationship between mindful leadership/empathetic leadership and turnover intention/resilience. Despite being limited to the Indonesian context, this research offers several contributions from both theoretical and practical perspectives. First, this research established the importance of mindful and empathetic leadership to promote resilience and reduce the turnover intention of nurses in the time of crisis. Second, we confirmed self-regulation as the mediating variable for those relationships.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization has reported a substantial psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare professionals to date. Evidence is lacking, however, regarding university nursing and midwifery students of the pandemic and its impact on their educational preparation and/or clinical placement during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of nursing and midwifery undergraduate students enrolled in the Bachelor of Nursing suite of courses from the study institution in August- September 2020. METHODS: A cross-sectional self-administered anonymous online survey was distributed to current nursing and midwifery undergraduate students. The survey included three open-ended questions; responses were thematically analysed. RESULTS: Of 2,907 students invited, 637 (22%) responded with 288 of the respondents (45%) providing a response to at least one of the three open-ended questions. Three major themes associated with the impact of the pandemic on psychosocial well-being and learning were identified: psychosocial impact of the pandemic, adjustment to new modes of teaching and learning, and concerns about course progression and career. These themes were underpinned by lack of motivation to study, feeling isolated, and experiencing stress and anxiety that impacted on students well-being and their ability to learn and study. CONCLUSIONS: Students were appreciative of different and flexible teaching modes that allowed them to balance their study, family, and employment responsibilities. Support from academic staff and clinical facilitators/mentors combined with clear and timely communication of risk management related to personal protective equipment (PPE) in a healthcare facility, were reported to reduce students stress and anxiety.

Intriguingly, several developed countries with a higher quality of life have relatively higher mortality with COVID-19, compared to the middle- or low-income countries. Moreover, certain ethnic groups have shown a higher predilection to contract COVID-19, with heightened mortality. We sought to review the available literature with regards to impact of COVID-19 and comorbidities on the health and economics, especially in context to the developing countries including India. METHODS: A Boolean search was carried out in PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar databases up till August 23, 2020 using the specific keywords, to find the prevalence of comorbidities and its outcome in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: All available evidence consistently suggests that presence of comorbidities is associated with a poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. Diabetes prevalence is highest in Indian COVID-19 patients, compared to other countries. Majority of the patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic ranging from 26 to 76%.

We found that levels of mobility before COVID-19 were slightly higher in areas with lower deprivation. The economic hibernation period resulted in very strong declines in mobility, most acutely in low deprivation areas. These differences weakened during the re-opening, and levels of mobility were similar by deprivation once the lockdown was completely lifted.

However, feeling neutral about an issue might be consequential. The COVID-19 pandemic was a major issue during the 2020 U.S. presidential election. We examined whether feeling neutral about COVID-19 was associated with attitudes about the top 2 presidential candidates (Trump vs. Biden) and behavior (i.e., whether a person voted and who they voted for). Data were collected at 2 critical time points: Study 1 was conducted immediately after the U.S. presidential election and Study 2 was conducted prior to the second Senate impeachment trial of Trump. Because feeling neutral about COVID-19 might indicate that a person views the issue as unworthy of attention, a perspective more aligned with Trump's approach, we hypothesized that feeling neutral about COVID-19 would be associated with more pro-Trump attitudes and behaviors. Even after accounting for other affects about COVID-19, in both studies, neutrality was associated with more favorable attitudes toward Trump, less favorable attitudes toward Biden, being less likely to vote, and if a person did vote, being more likely to vote for Trump. In Sudy 2, neutrality was associated with less support for impeaching Trump.

Application of behavior change techniques (BCTs) and persuasive system design (PSD) principles in eHealth development may contribute to the design of technologies that positively influence behavior and motivation to support the sustainable health behavior change needed. OBJECTIVE This review aimed to identify BCTs and PSD principles applied in eHealth interventions to support weight loss and weight loss maintenance, as well as techniques and principles applied to stimulate motivation and adherence for long-term weight loss maintenance. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE (including PubMed), EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and AMED, from January 1, 2007 to June 30, 2018. Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review methodology was applied. Publications on eHealth interventions were included if focusing on weight loss or weight loss maintenance, in combination with motivation or adherence and behavior change. RESULTS The search identified 317 publications, of which 45 met the inclusion criteria. Of the 45 publications, 11 (24%) focused on weight loss maintenance, and 34 (76%) focused on weight loss. Mobile phones were the most frequently used technology (28/45, 62%). Frequently used wearables were activity trackers (14/45, 31%), as well as other monitoring technologies such as wireless or digital scales (8/45, 18%). All included publications were anchored in behavior change theories. Feedback and monitoring and goals and planning were core behavior change technique clusters applied in the majority of included publications. Social support and associations through prompts and cues to support and maintain new habits were more frequently used in weight loss maintenance than weight loss interventions. In both types of interventions, frequently applied persuasive principles were self-monitoring, goal setting, and feedback. Tailoring, reminders, personalization, and rewards were additional principles frequently applied in weight loss maintenance interventions. Results did not reveal an ideal combination of techniques or principles to stimulate motivation, adherence, and weight loss maintenance. However, the most frequently mentioned individual techniques and principles applied to stimulate motivation were, personalization, simulation, praise, and feedback, whereas associations were frequently mentioned to stimulate adherence. eHealth interventions that found significant effects for weight loss maintenance all applied self-monitoring, feedback, goal setting, and shaping knowledge, combined with a human social support component to support healthy behaviors. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first review examining key BCTs and PSD principles applied in weight loss maintenance interventions compared with those of weight loss interventions. This review identified several techniques and principles applied to stimulate motivation and adherence. Future research should aim to examine which eHealth design combinations can be the most effective in support of long-term behavior change and weight loss maintenance.","output":"Persuasive System Design Principles and Behavior Change Techniques to Stimulate Motivation and Adherence in Electronic Health Interventions to Support Weight Loss Maintenance: Scoping Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) initiated in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.

The results of the qualitative analysis of the verses of the Qur'an and the hadiths of the Prophet's noble Sunnah have resulted in four concepts that constitute a broad conceptual theory of crisis management according to the Islamic approach. These concepts are: Crisis management strategies in Islam, the stages of crisis management, the characteristics of a leader who manages crises, and the roles of a leader during the crisis management process. A number of assumptions have been made of this generated theory about Islamic crisis management model. In light of the results of this study, recommendations were formulated that indicate the necessity of training leaders in the Islamic approach to crisis management, its strategies and its scientific steps in crisis management. These results have wide applications in the field of training leaders, and also recommend future studies to verify the assumptions of the theory that emerged from the data in this study on crisis management in Islam (COVID-19 pandemic crisis as a model).","output":"Crisis and disaster management in the light of the Islamic approach: COVID-19 pandemic crisis as a model (a qualitative study using the grounded theory)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: With the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, concerns have been raised about the risk to children with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We aimed to collate global experience and provide provisional guidance for managing paediatric IBD (PIBD) in the era of COVID-19. METHODS: An electronic reporting system of children with IBD infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been circulated among 102 PIBD centres affiliated with the Porto and Interest-group of ESPGHAN. A survey has been completed by major PIBD centres in China and South-Korea to explore management during the pandemic. A third survey collected current practice of PIBD treatment. Finally, guidance points for practice have been formulated and voted upon by 37 PIBD authors and Porto group members. RESULTS: Eight PIBD children had COVID-19 globally, all with mild infection without needing hospitalization despite treatment with immunomodulators and/or biologics. No cases have been reported in China and South Korea but biologic treatment has been delayed in 79 children, of whom 17 (22%) had exacerbation of their IBD. Among the Porto group members, face-to-face appointments were often replaced by remote consultations but almost all did not change current IBD treatment. Ten guidance points for clinicians caring for PIBD patients in epidemic areas have been endorsed with consensus rate of 92% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data for PIBD patients during COVID-19 outbreak are reassuring. Standard IBD treatments including biologics should continue at present through the pandemic, especially in children who generally have more severe IBD course on one hand, and milder SARS-CoV-2 infection on the other.","output":"Corona Virus Disease 2019 and Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Global Experience and Provisional Guidance (March 2020) from the Paediatric IBD Porto Group of European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions have been known as characteristic symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the study of the clinical features of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in COVID-19 is still insufficient. Subjects and Method Mild COVID-19 patients who complained of olfactory or gustatory dysfunctions in the telephone monitoring from March 8 to April 8, 2020 were included in this study. Patient information was collected using a Google questionnaire. COVID-19 symptoms, severity and improvement of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions of patients were investigated. Results A total of 228 patients participated in this study. The number of male and female were 76 and 152, and the average age was 32.111.5 years. There were 210 patients (92.1%) of olfactory dysfunction, 179 patients (78.5%) of gustatory dysfunction, and 165 patients (71.4%) who complained of both symptoms. The 18.4% of patients complained only olfactory or gustatory dysfunction without other symptoms of COVID-19, and 51.1% of patients presented olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions as the first symptoms. Most of the patients (95.6%) improved olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions within several months, but only 79.8% of patients were normalized. Conclusion Since olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are the first symptoms in the numerous COVID-19 patients, and continued research on these patients play an important role in the screening and prevention of COVID-19.

RESULTS: The study included 811 (67.2%) men and 396 (32.8%) women. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 56 (40-64). A total of 173 (14.3%) patients developed respiratory distress syndrome, while 70 (5.8%) developed circulatory shock and hypotension; 190 (15.7%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Acute cardiac injury occurred in 27 (2.2%) patients, and 45 (3.7%) developed arrhythmia. Acute kidney injury occurred in 44 (3.6%) patients. Of the patients admitted during the study period, 149 (12.3%) died.

A G-CSF treatment used in neutropenic cancer with SARS-CoV-2 infections is related to a higher rate of respiratory failure according to progressive and growing evidence. In this small retrospective non-randomized study, we found an association between G-CSF treatment and the parameters predisposing for worse infections with COVID-19 and neutropenia compared with patients not treated with G-CSF. We also found that the number of days on G-CSF treatment was related to a higher risk of mortality in a multivariable analysis among patients treated with G-CSF. ABSTRACT: Background: Approximately 15% of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 develop a distress syndrome secondary to a host hyperinflammatory response induced by a cytokine storm. Myelosuppression is associated with a higher risk of infections and mortality. There are data to support methods of management for neutropenia and COVID-19. We present a multicenter experience during the first COVID-19 outbreak in neutropenic cancer patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Clinical retrospective data were collected from neutropenic cancer patients with COVID-19. Comorbidities, tumor type, stage, treatment, neutropenia severity, G-CSF, COVID-19 parameters, and mortality were analyzed. A bivariate analysis of the impact on mortality was carried out. Additionally, we performed a multivariable logistic regression to predict respiratory failure and death. Results: Among the 943 cancer patients screened, 83 patients (11.3%) simultaneously had neutropenia and an infection with COVID-19. The lungs (26%) and breasts (22%) were the primary locations affected, and most patients had advanced disease (67%). In the logistic model, as adjusted covariates, sex, age, treatment (palliative vs. curative), tumor type, and the lowest level of neutrophils were used. A significant effect was obtained for the number of days of G-CSF treatment (OR = 1.4, 95% CI [1,1,03,92], p-value = 0.01). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a prolonged G-CSF treatment could be disadvantageous for these cancer patients with infections by COVID-19, with a higher probability of worse outcome.","output":"A Multicenter Analysis of the Outcome of Cancer Patients with Neutropenia and COVID-19 Optionally Treated with Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF): A Comparative Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak and its containment through public health strategies has resulted in a parallel pandemic of psychological distress.

As MCs cause general damage to the vertebrate liver and immune system and trigger an inflammatory response, and the gut microbiota is closely related to host metabolism and immunity, we speculated that MCs can cause changes in the immune system and gut microbiota of amphibians. To verify this, we examined the intestinal and liver injury of Xenopus laevis exposed to different microcystin-leucine-arginine (MC-LR) concentrations and the effects on the gut microbiota through high-throughput sequencing of 16S rDNA of the gut microbiota combined with histopathological analysis, enzyme activity determination, and qRT-PCR. Our results showed that MC-LR caused focal infiltration of inflammatory cells and increased the number of T cells and local congestion and vacuolization in X. laevis liver, but reduced the number, density, height, and regularity of villi. These liver and intestinal injuries became more obvious with an increase in MC-LR concentration. MC-LR significantly decreased the activities of malondialdehyde and alkaline phosphatase and the expression of TGF- in the liver. Moreover, MC-LR significantly altered the gut microbiota of X. laevis. The relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in high-concentration MC-LR groups was significantly reduced compared to that in low-concentration MC-LR groups, whereas Fusobacteria was significantly enriched. The metabolic gene composition of the gut microbiota in low-concentration MC-LR (5 g/L) groups was significantly different from that in high-concentration MC-LR (20 g/L) groups.

A substantial part of this comprises prescriptions in case of non-specific symptoms or asymptomatic bacteriuria, for which the latest guidelines promote restrictiveness with antibiotics. We aim to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use for UTIs through an antibiotic stewardship intervention (ASI) that encourages to prescribe according to these guidelines. To develop an effective ASI, we first need a better understanding of the complex decision-making process concerning suspected UTIs in frail elderly. Moreover, the implementation approach requires tailoring to the heterogeneous elderly care setting. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: First, we conduct a qualitative study to explore factors contributing to antibiotic prescribing for UTIs in frail elderly, using semi-structured interviews with general practitioners, nursing staff, patients and informal caregivers. Next, we perform a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial in elderly care organisations. A multifaceted ASI is implemented in the intervention group; the control group receives care as usual. The ASI is centred around a decision tool that promotes restrictive antibiotic use, supported by a toolbox with educational materials. For the implementation, we use a modified participatory-action-research approach, guided by the results of the qualitative study. The primary outcome is the number of antibiotic prescriptions for suspected UTIs. We aim to recruit 34 clusters with in total 680 frail elderly residents 70 years. Data collection takes place during a 5-month baseline period and a 7-month follow-up period. Finally, we perform a process evaluation. The study has been delayed for 6 months due to COVID-19 and is expected to end in July 2021.

Houston, located in the Harris County of Texas, is becoming the next hotspot of this pandemic. With a severe decline in international and inter-state travel, a model at the county level is needed as opposed to the state or country level. Existing approaches have a few drawbacks. Firstly, the data used is the number of COVID-19 positive cases instead of positivity. The former is a function of the number of tests carried out while the number of tests normalizes the latter. Positivity gives a better picture of the spread of this pandemic as, with time, more tests are being administered. Positivity under 5% has been desired for the reopening of businesses to almost 100% capacity. Secondly, the data used by models like SEIRD (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered, and Deceased) lacks information about the sentiment of people concerning coronavirus. Thirdly, models that make use of social media posts might have too much noise and misinformation. On the other hand, news sentiment can capture long-term effects of hidden variables like public policy, opinions of local doctors, and disobedience of state-wide mandates. The present study introduces a new artificial intelligence (i.e., AI) model, viz., Sentiment Informed Time-series Analyzing AI (SITALA), trained on COVID-19 test positivity data and news sentiment from over 2750 news articles for Harris county. The news sentiment was obtained using IBM Watson Discovery News. SITALA is inspired by Google-Wavenet architecture and makes use of TensorFlow. The mean absolute error for the training dataset of 66 consecutive days is 2.76, and that for the test dataset of 22 consecutive days is 9.6. A cone of uncertainty is provided within which future COVID-19 test positivity has been shown to fall with high accuracy. The model predictions fare better than a published Bayesian-based SEIRD model. The model forecasts that in order to curb the spread of coronavirus in Houston, a sustained negative news sentiment (e.g., death count for COVID-19 will grow at an alarming rate in Houston if mask orders are not followed) will be desirable.

EVs are secreted by almost all cell types; they can transfer information between nearby or distant cells, and they are highly abundant in body fluids. In this review, we describe the general characteristics of EVs, as well as isolation and characterization approaches. Then, we focus on one of the most relevant sources of EVs: the blood. Indeed, apart from EVs secreted by blood cells, EVs of diverse origins travel in the bloodstream. We present the numerous types of EVs that have been found in circulation. Besides, the implications of blood-derived EVs in both physiological and pathological processes are summarized, highlighting their potential as biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and prognosis of several diseases, and also as indicators of physiological modifications. Finally, the applications of EVs introduced in the circulatory system are discussed. We describe the use of EVs from distinct origins, naturally produced or engineered, autologous, allogeneic, or even from different species and the effects they have when introduced in circulation.

On an urban scale, people move daily to workplaces, schools, among others. Here, we are interested in exploring the effect of the daily local stay on the variations of some characteristics of dengue dynamics such as the transmission rates and local basic reproductive numbers. For this, we use a two-patch mathematical model that explicitly considers the daily mobility of people and real data from the 2010 dengue outbreak in Hermosillo, Mexico. Based on a preliminary cluster analysis, we divide the city into two regions, the south and north sides, which determine each patch of the model. We use a Bayesian approach to estimate the transmission rates and local basic reproductive numbers of some urban mobility scenarios where residents of each patch spend daily the 100% (no human movement between patches), 75% and 50% of their day at their place of residence. For the north side, estimates of transmission rates do not vary and it is more likely that the local basic reproductive number to be greater than one for all three different scenarios. On the contrary, tranmission rates of the south side have more weight in lower values when consider the human movement between patches compared to the uncoupled case. In fact, local basic reproductive numbers less than 1 are not negligible for the south side.

OBJECTIVE: For each of the most frequent clinical scenarios, the authors reached a consensus on how should be timing and indications be optimized to reduce risk while maintaining the expected outcomes under the Covid-19 pandemics. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The organization of health care has been changed by the Covid-19 pandemic with a direct impact on Spine Oncology Surgery. Emergency surgery is still a priority, but in case of spinal tumors it should be better defined which conditions require emergency treatment. METHODS: An expert panel with general spine surgeons, oncological spine surgeons, and radiation oncologists was formed to analyze the most frequent scenarios in spinal musculoskeletal oncology during Covid-19 pandemics. RESULTS: Spine metastases can be found incidentally during follow-up or can clinically occur by increasing pain, pathologic fracture, and/or neurological symptoms. Primary spine tumors are much more rare and very rarely present with acute onset. The first step is to suspect this rare condition, to avoid to treat a primary tumor as it were a metastasis. Most complex surgery, like en bloc resection, associated with high morbidity and mortality rate for the treatment of low grade malignancy like chordoma or chondrosarcomas, if intensive care unit availability is reduced, can be best delayed some weeks, as not impacting on prognosis, due to the slow growth rate of these conditions. The currently accepted protocols for Ewing sarcoma (ES) and osteogenic sarcoma must be performed for local and systemic disease control. For ES, after the first courses of chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be selected instead of surgery, during Covid-19, to the end of the full course of chemotherapy. In immunocompromised patients, (treated by chemotherapy), it is necessary to avoid contact with affected or exposed people.

Owing to this, clinicians have had to switch to other means of consultation, to maintain continuity of care. This survey was done to see how surgeons perceive telemedicine as part of their surgical consultations. METHODS A questionnaire was piloted and re-designed following which an improved questionnaire was circulated among all users of telemedicine in surgical specialties through social media platforms. The results were analysed using smart survey software. RESULTS Seventy per cent of the respondents had never used telemedicine before the COVID-19 pandemic. Three-quarters of the respondents found difficulty in assessing patients preoperatively. A significant proportion were worried about confidentiality and data security. The other concerns expressed were difficulty in building a rapport and the absence of a legal framework to support the surgeons in the transition. Despite some concerns, most of them were in favour of using telemedicine in the future with some improvements. CONCLUSION As the pandemic prevented people from attending face-to-face appointments, remote consultations were stepped up to help overcome the difficulties. Screening services were suspended and treatment accumulated. Telemedicine will be a corner-stone service as healthcare systems attempt to tackle this backlog. The already existing software need to be further explored. Future studies must address the use of telemedicine in preoperative consultations.

Thematic analysis identified three key themes behind immunization disruption: \\"access\\" issues, e.g., logistical barriers, \\"provider\\" issues, e.g., staff shortages and user \\"concern\\" about attending immunization appointments due to COVID-19 fear. Access and provider issues were more commonly reported by LMIC respondents. Overall, respondents reported uncertainty among parents and healthcare providers regarding routine immunization. We conclude that further quantification of routine vaccination disruption is needed, alongside health service prioritization, logistical support and targeted communication strategies to reinforce routine immunizations during the COVID-19 response.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Immunization Services for Maternal and Infant Vaccines: Results of a Survey Conducted by Imprint-The Immunising Pregnant Women and Infants Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To systematically review the clinical literature reporting the use of Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 to assess the efficacy of LPV/r for the treatment of Cornonavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).

Dynamic tracking of variant frequencies revealed a recurrent pattern of G614 increase at multiple geographic levels: national, regional and municipal. The shift occurred even in local epidemics where the original D614 form was well established prior to the introduction of the G614 variant. The consistency of this pattern was highly statistically significant, suggesting that the G614 variant may have a fitness advantage. We found that the G614 variant grows to higher titer as pseudotyped virions. In infected individuals G614 is associated with lower RT-PCR cycle thresholds, suggestive of higher upper respiratory tract viral loads, although not with increased disease severity. These findings illuminate changes important for a mechanistic understanding of the virus, and support continuing surveillance of Spike mutations to aid in the development of immunological interventions.","output":"Tracking changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike: evidence that D614G increases infectivity of the COVID-19 virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To compare intraoperative and postoperative outcomes, pathologic findings, cancer recurrence, and death rates in normal-weight, overweight, obese, and morbidly obese women undergoing radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy for early-stage cervical cancer. METHODS A review of patients who underwent radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy for invasive cervical cancer between 1990 and 2006 was performed. On the basis of body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight [kg]/[height (m)](2)), women were categorized as normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9), obese (BMI 30.0-34.9), or morbidly obese (BMI at least 35.0). RESULTS Four hundred eight women met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 155 (38%) were normal weight, 126 (31%) were overweight, 77 (19%) were obese, and 50 (12%) were morbidly obese. There were no statistically significant differences between these four groups in age, Charlson comorbidity score, smoking history, stage, histologic grade or subtype, tumor size, depth of invasion, transfusion rate, operative time, or intraoperative complications. Higher BMI was significantly correlated with higher estimated operative blood loss (P=.001). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in pathologic findings, length of postoperative hospital stay, postoperative complications, readmission rate, or proportion of women receiving adjuvant radiotherapy. At a median follow-up time of 64 months, there were no differences between groups in rates of recurrence or death from disease. CONCLUSION Radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy is feasible for obese and morbidly obese women with cervical cancer. Obesity alone should not be a contraindication to radical hysterectomy in women with cervical cancer.","output":"Radical hysterectomy in obese and morbidly obese women with cervical cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To summarize the outcomes of the coronavirus disease 2019 infections in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) in the first 4 months of the pandemic. METHODS: A meta-analysis approach was used in this context. We used the aggregate data from the World Health Organization Regional Office for the EMRO (until 26 May 2020) to generate this report. RESULTS: An analysis of official data from all 22 countries and territories in the Middle East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and Central Asia K=22 (a total of 438,717 cases) was performed.

We explored how changes in alcohol use at the beginning of the pandemic impacted the health and wellbeing of people with and without mental health and neurodevelopmental conditions (MHDCs). METHODS: Data came from the Global Drug Survey Special Edition on COVID-19 conducted in May-June 2020. Measured were; changes in drinking compared to February 2020 (pre-COVID-19 restrictions), reasons for changes, and impact on physical health, mental health, relationships, finances, work/study, and enjoyment. This study included 38,141 respondents (median age = 32 IQR 25-45; 51.9% cis man; 47.8% cis woman; 1.2% trans/non-binary; 30.2% with MHDCs e.g. depression 20.0%, anxiety 16.3%, ADHD 3.8%, PTSD 3.3%). RESULTS: A third (35.3%) of respondents with MHDCs and 17.8% without MHDCs indicated that increased drinking affected their mental health negatively (p<.001); 44.2% of respondents with MHDCS compared to 32.6% without MHDCs said it affected their physical health negatively (p<.001). Reduced drinking was associated with better mental health among a fifth (21.1%) of respondents with MHDCS and 14.4% without MHDCs (p<.001). Age, relationship status, living arrangements, employment, coping and distress were significant predictors of increases in drinking. CONCLUSION: Among people with MHDCS, reduced alcohol consumption was associated with better mental health, while the negative effects of increased drinking were more pronounced when compared to people without MHDCS. When supporting people in reducing alcohol consumption during uncertain times, people with MHDCS may need additional support, alongside those experiencing greater levels of distress.","output":"Impacts of changes in alcohol consumption patterns during the first 2020 COVID-19 restrictions for people with and without mental health and neurodevelopmental conditions: A cross sectional study in 13 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The application process for Core Surgical Training (CST) in the United Kingdom (UK) is competitive and hence, careful preparation is required for trainees to obtain their posts of choice. There are multiple resources for preparation for selection including face-to-face courses and online question banks, however there is a paucity of webinars to educate trainees. With the cancellation of such courses due to social distancing restrictions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, this cross-sectional study aims to evaluate the usefulness of a webinar to educate trainees on CST selection in the UK. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A free online webinar was held on a single day by a second year core surgical trainee and was attended by 111 junior doctors. Beforehand, all attendees were invited to complete a survey on Google Forms (Google, USA) to ascertain their level of experience with webinars, obtain demographic information and elicit their level of knowledge about CST selection using a 1C5 Likert scale. RESULTS: Most attendees were in Foundation Year 2 (38.7%) and many had not previously attended a webinar as part of CST application preparation (93.7%). Over half of respondents (55.0%) preferred a webinar over a face-to-face tutorial, appreciating the flexibility, convenience and zero financial cost associated. Many candidates received minimal advice on CST application by their Foundation School (47.7%) and 50.5% of respondents rated their confidence on the application process at 3 out of 5. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests webinars have been underused in preparation for CST applications. Traditional courses and advice from colleagues are more popular ways in which applicants prepare for selection. However, given the degree of uncertainty surrounding the return of face-to-face courses due to the Covid-19 pandemic, preparation for CST application may become increasingly reliant on online materials, which may result in an increased demand for high quality, engaging and informative webinars.","output":"Utility of a webinar to educate trainees on UK core surgical training (CST) selection C A cross sectional study and future implications amidst the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The importance of vaccine-induced protection was repeatedly demonstrated over the last three decades and emphasized during the recent COVID-19 pandemic as the safest and most effective way of preventing infectious diseases.

Low user rates for these apps can affect contact tracing and, thus, its usefulness in controlling the spread of the novel coronavirus. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the early perceptions of people living in the German-speaking countries and compare them with the frames portrayed in the newspapers during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews with 159 participants of the SolPan project. Of those, 110 participants discussed contact tracing apps and were included in this study. We analyzed articles regarding contact tracing apps from 12 newspapers in the German-speaking countries. RESULTS: Study participants perceived and newspaper coverage in all German-speaking countries framed contact tracing apps as governmental surveillance tools and embedded them in a broader context of technological surveillance. Participants identified trust in authorities, respect of individual privacy, voluntariness, and temporary use of contact tracing apps as prerequisites for democratic compatibility. Newspapers commonly referenced the use of such apps in Asian countries, emphasizing the differences in privacy regulation among these countries. CONCLUSIONS: The uptake of digital contact tracing apps in German-speaking countries may be undermined due to privacy risks that are not compensated by potential benefits and are rooted in a deeper skepticism towards digital tools. When authorities plan to implement new digital tools and practices in the future, they should be very transparent and proactive in communicating their objectives and the role of the technologyand how it differs from other, possibly similar, tools.

As a part of these transformations, video conferencing services (e.g. Zoom, Whereby) have emerged as popular mediums for socialising and AOD consumption. In this article, we adopt a more-than-human theoretical framework to explore how these online contexts re-shape experiences of AOD consumption. METHODS: Data were gathered using a case-study approach, guided by principles of digital ethnography. We 'staged' the online gatherings of three established friendship clusters of adults in Melbourne, Australia, and drew on a discussion guide to elicit accounts of past online AOD encounters during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our thematic analysis was sensitised to the dynamic composition of these encounters and the kinds of relations, practices and affects they enabled and constrained. RESULTS: Composed via video conferencing services, AOD consumption afforded distinct pleasures, including enhanced sociality, excitement and momentary reprieves from isolation. Importantly, these effects were not uniform or stable. Participants also navigated various constraints of online AOD consumption while establishing for themselves what substances and associated practices 'fit' within these novel encounters. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study conveys the importance of digitally-mediated AOD consumption as a site of socialising and pleasure. In so doing, it demonstrates the ways in which AOD consumption was drawn on in the everyday negotiation of health and wellbeing under lockdown conditions. We call for research and policy approaches that are sensitive to the affirmative potentials of digitally=mediated AOD encounters.","output":"'Super googs on a Zoom, are you kidding me?': The pleasures and constraints of digitally-mediated alcohol and other drug consumption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Automated lobar segmentation allows regional evaluation of lung disease and is important for diagnosis and therapy planning. Advanced statistical workflows permitting such evaluation is a needed area within respiratory medicine;their adoption remains slow, with poor workflow accuracy. Diseased lung regions often produce high-density zones on CT images, limiting an algorithm's execution to specify damaged lobes due to oblique or lacking fissures. This impact motivated developing an improved machine learning method to segment lung lobes that utilises tracheobronchial tree information to enhance segmentation accuracy through the algorithm's spatial familiarity to define lobar extent more accurately. The method undertakes parallel segmentation of lobes and auxiliary tissues simultaneously by employing multi-task learning (MTL) in conjunction with V-Net-attention, a popular convolutional neural network in the imaging realm. In keeping with the model's adeptness for better generalisation, high performance was retained in an external dataset of patients with four distinct diseases: severe lung cancer, COVID-19 pneumonitis, collapsed lungs and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), even though the training data included none of these cases. The benefit of our external validation test is specifically relevant since our choice includes those patients who have diagnosed lung disease with associated radiological abnormalities. To ensure equal rank is given to all segmentations in the main task we report the following performance (Dice score) on a per-segment basis: normal lungs 0.97, COPD 0.94, lung cancer 0.94, COVID-19 pneumonitis 0.94 and collapsed lung 0.92, all at p<0.05. Even segmenting lobes with large deformations on CT images, the model maintained high accuracy.

OBJECTIVE: We seek to determine if an online virtual format is an effective way to train additional trainers while overcoming these barriers. METHODS: The BEC Training-of-Trainers (ToT) course was adapted to a virtual format and delivered entirely online. Participants were assessed with a multiple choice pre- and post-test and completed a course feedback form upon completion. Results from the virtual course were then compared to the results from an in-person ToT course. FINDINGS: The in-person course pre- and post-tests were completed by 121 participants with a pre-test mean of 87% (range 60C100%) and a post-test mean of 95% (range: 75C100; p < 0.05).

For children who face socio-economic disadvantage, middle ear disease is more prevalent, access to primary health care is more difficult, and psychosocial and education supports are limited. Because of this, the consequences may be amplified. Understanding the risks associated with hearing loss and middle ear dysfunction in underserved populations can enable an earlier, more targeted and cost-effective approach to identifying those with hearing loss and effectively connecting them to systems of care. STUDY TYPE Retrospective study. METHOD This study describes the outcomes of an ear and hearing screening program for children from lower socio-economic backgrounds (n = 2489; mean age 11.0 years, standard deviation 1.74 years) in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, between 2013 and 2016. Screening was conducted in a quiet room, and the test protocol included otoscopy, 226 Hertz (Hz) tympanometry, and pure tone screening at octave frequencies from 500 Hz to 4000 Hz with a referral criterion of 20 decibels hearing level (dB HL) at any one frequency. Outcomes were categorised into 1) pass; 2) middle ear dysfunction only; and 3) did not pass hearing screen (with or without middle ear dysfunction). Multinomial logistic regression was used to investigate risk factors for hearing loss and middle ear dysfunction. The factors examined were age, gender, socio-educational advantage, quarter of year assessed, non-English speaking background (NESB), Aboriginal status and region. RESULTS Higher risks of middle ear dysfunction were associated with younger age and seasonal variation, with higher risk in winter and spring months (July-September and October-December, compared with January-March). There were no differences between those from NESB and those with English as a first language, between the Aboriginal population and non-Aboriginal population, or between those who resided within or outside a major city.

The factor associated with mortality in patients with RID was advanced age (OR [95% CI], 1.1 [1.0-1.2]; p = 0.025), while the factors associated with hospitalization were advanced age (OR [95% CI], 1.1 [1.0-1.1]; p = 0.007) and hypertension (OR [95% CI], 3.9 [1.5-6.7]; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Mortality and hospital admission due to COVID-19 do not seem to increase in RID. Advanced age was associated with mortality in RID and, in addition, HTN was associated with hospital admission.","output":"Hospitalization and Mortality from COVID-19 of Patients with Rheumatic Inflammatory Diseases in Andalusia./ Hospitalizaciones y mortalidad por COVID-19 en pacientes con enfermedades inflamatorias reumticas en Andaluca"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent work has proven the existence of extreme inbreeding in a European ancestry sample taken from the contemporary UK population \\\\cite{nature_01}.

Groups with a finite number of individuals could give a variety of genetic relationships. { In previous works \\\\cite{PhysRevE.92.052132, PhysRevE.90.022125, JARNE20191}, we have addressed the issue of building inbreeding trees for biparental reproduction using Markovian models. Here, we extend these studies by presenting an algorithm to generate and represent inbreeding trees with no overlapping generations. We explicitly assume a two-gender reproductory scheme, and we pay particular attention to the links between nodes. We show that even for a simple case with a relatively small number of nodes in the tree, there are a large number of possible ways to rearrange the links between generations. We present an open-source python code to generate the tree graph, the adjacency matrix, and the histogram of the links for each different tree representation. We show how this mapping reflects the difference between tree realizations, and how valuable information may be extracted upon inspection of these matrices. The algorithm includes a feature to average several tree realizations, obtain the connectivity distribution, and calculate the average and mean value. We used this feature to compare trees with a different number of generations and nodes. The code presented here, available in Git-Hub, may be easily modified to be applied to other areas of interest involving connections between individuals, extend the study to add more characteristics of the different nodes, etc.","output":"An algorithm to represent inbreeding trees"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Persistent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has given rise to a COVID-19 pandemic. Several vaccines, conceived in 2020, that evoke protective spike antibody responses are being deployed in mass public health vaccination programs. Recent data suggests, however, that as sequence variation in the spike genome accumulates, some vaccines may lose efficacy. Methods: Using a macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we tested the efficacy of a peptide-based vaccine targeting MHC class I epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. We administered biodegradable microspheres with synthetic peptides and adjuvants to rhesus macaques. Unvaccinated control and vaccinated macaques were challenged with 1  10(8) TCID(50) units of SARS-CoV-2, followed by assessment of clinical symptoms and viral load, chest radiographs, and sampling of peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid for downstream analysis. Results: Vaccinated animals were free of pneumonia-like infiltrates characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection and presented with lower viral loads relative to controls. Gene expression in cells collected from BAL samples of vaccinated macaques revealed a unique signature associated with enhanced development of adaptive immune responses relative to control macaques. Conclusions: We demonstrate that a room temperature stable peptide vaccine based on known immunogenic HLA class I bound CTL epitopes from the nucleocapsid protein can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in nonhuman primates.","output":"A Synthetic Peptide CTL Vaccine Targeting Nucleocapsid Confers Protection from SARS-CoV-2 Challenge in Rhesus Macaques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: Land use change drives a host of sustainability challenges on Earths grasslands. To understand the relationship between changing land use patterns, human well-being, and ecosystem services, research is needed into land use transitions on privately-owned grasslands. Such inquiry lies at the intersection of land system science, landscape sustainability science and environmental governance. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated land use change in a mountain ranching community in the Sierra Nevada, California. The research objective was to highlight factors influencing land use transitions and corollary ecological outcomes on privately-owned grasslands in the Western US. METHODS: This mixed methods case study integrated participant observation, 30 semi-structured interviews, and analysis of land cover and real estate data. Interviews were conducted with ranchers, public agencies, and conservation and real estate industry representatives, and analyzed with the constant comparison method using NVivo 12. RESULTS: Land use transitions in the case study region include agricultural intensification, residential and solar development, and disintensification. These transitions were influenced by many factors including decreasing land access and water availability, amenity migration, intergenerational succession, and conservation policy. CONCLUSIONS: By highlighting factors influencing land use transitions on working lands, this study can be applied to improve the uptake of environmental policies. For the future, several approaches may support grasslands conservation: ensuring grazing lands access, income diversification, groundwater regulations, agriculture-compatible conservation easements, and land use policies supporting ownership transition to amenity purposes rather than low-density residential development.

However, the unsatisfactory survival rates of hospitalized patients limit its application to the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, improvement of antiviral efficacy of RDV is urgently needed. As a typical nucleotide analog, the activation of RDV to bioactive triphosphate will affect the biosynthesis of endogenous ribonucleotides (RNs) and deoxyribonucleotides (dRNs), which are essential to RNA and DNA replication in host cells. The imbalance of RN pools will inhibit virus replication as well. In order to investigate the effects of RDV on cellular nucleotide pools and on RNA transcription and DNA replication, cellular RNs and dRNs concentrations were measured by the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method, and the synthesis of RNA and DNA was monitored using click chemistry. The results showed that the IC(50) values for BEAS-2B cells at exposure durations of 48 and 72 h were 25.3  2.6 and 9.6  0.7 M, respectively. Ten (10) M RDV caused BEAS-2B arrest at S-phase and significant suppression of RNA and DNA synthesis after treatment for 24 h. In addition, a general increase in the abundance of nucleotides and an increase of specific nucleotides more than 2 folds were observed. However, the variation of pyrimidine ribonucleotides was relatively slight or even absent, resulting in an obvious imbalance between purine and pyrimidine ribonucleotides. Interestingly, the very marked disequilibrium between cytidine triphosphate (CTP) and cytidine monophosphate might result from the inhibition of CTP synthase. Due to nucleotides which are also precursors for the synthesis of viral nucleic acids, the perturbation of nucleotide pools would block viral RNA replication. Considering the metabolic vulnerability of endogenous nucleotides, exacerbating the imbalance of nucleotide pools imparts great promise to enhance the efficacy of RDV, which possibly has special implications for treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Profiling Ribonucleotide and Deoxyribonucleotide Pools Perturbed by Remdesivir in Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study aimed to analyze the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rates of periodontal procedures, and provide a comparison with general dental care and primary medical care procedures carried out in the Brazilian Public Health System.

Methods: National Readmission Database (NRD) 2017 was searched for patients less than 18 years of age who were diagnosed with PH based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software v25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was used for statistical analysis. Results: Of 5.52 million pediatric encounters, 10,501 patients met the selection criteria. The 30-day readmission rate of 14.43% (p < 0.001) was higher than hospitalizations from other causes {Odds Ratio (OR) 4.02 (3.84-4.20), p < 0.001}. The comorbidities of sepsis {OR 0.75 (0.64-0.89), p < 0.02} and respiratory infections {OR 0.75 (0.67-0.85), p < 0.001} were observed to be associated with lower 30-day readmissions.

Inflammasome activation has been reported to play a critical role in the initiation and progression of ALI. The molecular mechanisms involved in regulating the activation of inflammasome in ALI remains unresolved, although increases in mitochondrial derived reactive oxygen species (mito-ROS) are involved. Our previous work has shown that the mitochondrial redistribution of uncoupled eNOS impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics and increases mito-ROS generation. Thus, the focus of our study was to determine if lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammasome activation involves the mitochondrial redistribution of uncoupled eNOS. Our data show that the increase in mito-ROS involved in LPS-mediated inflammasome activation is associated with the disruption of mitochondrial bioenergetics in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC) and the mitochondrial redistribution of eNOS. These effects are dependent on RhoA-ROCK signaling and are mediated via increased phosphorylation of eNOS at Threonine (T)-495. A derivative of the mitochondrial targeted Szeto\\\\Schiller peptide (SSP) attached to the antioxidant Tiron (T-SSP), significantly attenuated LPS-mediated mito-ROS generation and inflammasome activation in HLMVEC. Further, T-SSP attenuated mitochondrial superoxide production in a mouse model of sepsis induced ALI. This in turn significantly reduced the inflammatory response and attenuated lung injury. Thus, our findings show that the mitochondrial redistribution of uncoupled eNOS is intimately involved in the activation of the inflammatory response in ALI and implicate attenuating mito-ROS as a therapeutic strategy in humans.","output":"The mitochondrial redistribution of eNOS is involved in lipopolysaccharide induced inflammasome activation during acute lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exposure to air pollution has been linked to the development of neurodegenerative diseases and anosmia, but the underlying mechanism is not known.

In the present study, a retrospective analysis was conducted to compare the clinical outcomes when different management strategies were used to terminate pregnancy in the patients with placenta previa and PAS. METHODS: A total of 51 patients who underwent pregnancy termination in the second trimester in Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital between June 2013 and December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed in this study. All patients having previous caesarean delivery (CD) were diagnosed with placenta previa status and PAS. RESULTS: a? Among the 51 patients, 16 cases received mifepristone and misoprostol medical termination, 15 cases received mifepristone and Rivanol medical termination, but 1 of them was transferred to hysterotomy due to failed labor induction, another 20 cases were performed planned hysterotomy. There was no placenta percreta cases and uterine artery embolization (UAE) was all performed before surgery.a?? There were 31 cases who underwent medical termination and 30 cases were vaginal delivery. Dilation and evacuation (D&E) were used in 20 cases of medical abortion failure and in all 30 cases of difficult manual removal of placental tissue. a? A statistically significant difference was found among the three different strategies in terms of gestational weeks, the type of placenta previa status, main operative success rate and ?-HCG regression time (P < 0.05). a? There were 4(7.8%) cases who were taken up for hysterectomy because of life-threatening bleeding or severe bacteremia during or after delivery and hysterotomy.

From the ones reporting being confident in the local health system, 38.4% were willing to be vaccinated, and from those not confident, only 23.5% were willing to be vaccinated. CONCLUSION: The decision to get vaccinated in the midst of a contagious outbreak involves many considerations. Trust in the government's technical and organization skill to deal with the infectious outbreak along with trust in medical organizations predict the adoption of recommended protection measures. The results indicate that public compliance with vaccination plans in health crisis requires the development of social and institutional trust.","output":"Social and political determinants of vaccine hesitancy: Lessons learned from the H1N1 pandemic of 2009-2010"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies and vaccines have shown improvement in lowering viral burden and hospitalization. However, emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants contain neutralizing antibody-escape mutations. Therefore, several reports have suggested the administration of recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (rACE2) as a soluble receptor trap to block SARS-CoV-2 infection and limit viral escape potential. Several strategies have been implemented to enhance the efficacy of rACE2 as a therapeutic agent. Fc fusions have been used to improve pharmacokinetics and boost the affinity and avidity of ACE2 decoys for the virus spike protein. Furthermore, the intrinsic catalytic activity of ACE2 can be eliminated by introducing point mutations on the catalytic site of ACE2 to obtain an exclusive antiviral activity. This review summarizes different evolution platforms that have been used to enhance ACE2-Fc (i.e., immunoadhesins) as potential therapeutics for the current pandemic or future outbreaks of SARS-associated betacoronaviruses.","output":"David versus goliath: ACE2-Fc receptor traps as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Right now, the only Industry that may not do well in the post COVID scenario is the hospitality Industry.

KANOPEE is a smartphone-based application, providing an interaction with a virtual agent dedicated to screen and deliver behavioral interventions to fight sleep disorders. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the feasibility study of this application, during the context of COVID-19 confinement in France. METHODS: The virtual agent is an AI program using decision tree architecture, and interacting through natural body motion and natural voice. 2,069 users aged 18 years and over downloaded the app during the inclusion period (between 22 April and 5 May 2020). Users first answered a screening interview based on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) that was conducted by the virtual agent. If participants were positive for insomniac complaints (ISI > 14), they could join a two-stage intervention program: a) complete an electronic sleep diary for one week, and b) follow personalized sleep recommendations for 10 days. Measures collected included socio-demographic information, ISI and sleep/wake schedules; and acceptance and trust of the agent. RESULTS: 80% of users who downloaded the app (N=1,574) completed the screening interview with the virtual agent. The virtual agent was well accepted by the 431 users who answered acceptance and trust questionnaires, regarding its usability, satisfaction, benevolence, and credibility. Of the 773 screened subjects who reported sleep complaints (ISI>14), 166 of them followed the first step of the intervention (21.5%). Of these, 47 (28.3%) followed the second step. Users who completed step one found that their insomnia complaints (mean scores: baseline ISI: 18.56; ISI after step one: 15.99; P<.001) and nocturnal sleep improved significantly after one week. Subjects who completed step 2 also showed an improvement compared to the initial measure (mean scores: baseline ISI: 18.87; ISI after step two: 14.68; P<.001). The most severely affected subjects (ISI >21) did not respond to either intervention. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that KANOPEE is a promising solution to screen populations for sleep complaints, and that it provides acceptable and practical behavioral advice for subjects reporting moderately severe insomnia.","output":"Smartphone-Based Virtual Agents to Help the General Population Concerned by Sleep Complaints During COVID-19 Confinement: A Feasibility Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Renin angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) are largely prescribed in hypertensive patients. As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) penetrates respiratory epithelium through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding, the association between RASi and poorer outcomes has been questioned. Purpose This study aimed to provide insight on the impact of RASi on SARS-CoV-2 outcomes in a population of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of consecutively hospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive rtPCR) admitted to the University Hospital of Strasbourg from the 25th Feb, 2020 to the 1st Apr, 2020. Patients hospitalized for less than 24h were excluded and the observation period ended at hospital discharge. Results During the study period, 943 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in our institution, of whom 772 were included in this analysis. Among them, 431 patients had previously known hypertension. The median age was 68 (56C79). The cohort was divided into two subgroups based on RASi treatment on admission: RASi (n =282) and RASi-free (n =490). Both groups had similar clinical presentations and equivalent recourse to endotracheal intubation, high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Overall, 220 patients were placed under mechanical ventilation of whom 30% died. Severe pneumonia (defined as either leading to death, and/or requiring intubation, HFNO, NIV and/or requiring an oxygen rate flow 5l/min) and death occurred more frequently in RASi treated patients (63% vs. 53% and respectively 27.3% versus 18.2%). In a multivariate logistic-regression model, neither severe pneumonia nor death were associated with RASi treatment.

Viroporins interact with cell membranes, triggering membrane permeabilization and promoting release of viral particles. In vitro electrophysiological methods have revealed changes in membrane ion currents when Vpu is present; however, in vivo the molecular mechanism of Vpu at the plasma membrane is still uncertain. We used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a genetic model system to analyze how Vpu ion channel impacts cellular homeostasis. Inducible expression of Vpu impaired cell growth, suggesting that this viral protein is toxic to yeast cultures. This toxicity decreased with extracellular acidic pH. Also, Vpu toxicity diminished as the extracellular K(+) concentration was increased. However, expression of the Vpu protein suppresses the growth defect of K(+) uptake-deficient yeast (trk1,2). The phenotype rescue of these highly hyperpolarized cells was almost total when they were grown in medium supplemented with high concentrations of KCl (100 mM) at pH 7.0 but was significantly reduced when the extracellular K(+) concentration or pH was decreased. These results indicate that Vpu has the ability to modify K(+) transport in both yeast strains. Here, we show also that Vpu confers tolerance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic hygromycin B in trk1,2 yeast. Our results suggest that Vpu interferes with cell growth of wild-type yeast but improves proliferation of the hyperpolarized trk1,2 mutant by inducing plasma membrane depolarization. Furthermore, evaluation of the ion channel activity of the Vpu protein in trk1,2 yeast could aid in the development of a high-throughput screening assay for molecules that target the retroviral protein.","output":"HIV-1 Vpu protein mediates the transport of potassium in Saccharomyces cerevisiae."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic (caused by the SARS-CoV-2) is a public health emergency of international concern that particularly affects older people.

Although statewide stay-at-home orders in the United States received a large degree of media and political attention, relatively little peer-reviewed research has examined the impacts of such orders on social distancing behaviors. METHOD: This study used daily GPS-derived movement from 2858 counties in the United States from March 1 to May 7, 2020, to test the degree to which changes in state-level stay-at-home orders were associated with movement outside the home. RESULTS: From early March to early April, people in counties with state-level stay-at-home orders decreased their movement significantly more than counties without state-level stay-at-home orders; 3.1% more people stayed within 1 mile of home, and 1.6% fewer vehicle miles were driven per day. From early April to early May, people in counties within states that ended their stay-at-home orders increased their movement significantly more than counties in states whose stay-at-home orders remained in place; 1.2% fewer people remained within 1 mile of home, and 6.2% more vehicle miles were driven per day. The magnitude of changes associated with state-level stay-at-home orders was many times smaller than the total changes in movement across all counties over the same periods. CONCLUSIONS: Stay-at-home orders were associated with greater social distancing but accounted for only part of this behavioral change.

The mechanism underlying such toxicity remains poorly understood, hence the absence of effective intervention strategies. In the present study, we show that vascular endothelial cells are the primary cellular target of sorafenib-induced HFSR wherein soluble heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (s-HBEGF) mediates the crosstalk between vascular endothelial cells and keratinocytes. Mechanistically, s-HBEGF released from vascular endothelial cells activates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on keratinocytes and promotes the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2), which stabilizes sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an essential keratinization inducer, and ultimately gives rise to HFSR. The administration of s-HBEGF in vivo could sufficiently induce hyper-keratinization without sorafenib treatment. Furthermore, we report that HBEGF neutralization antibody, Sirt1 knockdown, and a classic SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide could all significantly reduce the sorafenib-induced HFSR in the mouse model. It is noteworthy that nicotinic acid, a prodrug of nicotinamide, could substantially reverse the sorafenib-induced HFSR in ten patients in a preliminary clinical study. Collectively, our findings reveal the mechanism of vascular endothelial cell-promoted keratinization in keratinocytes and provide a potentially promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of sorafenib-induced HFSR.","output":"s-HBEGF/SIRT1 circuit-dictated crosstalk between vascular endothelial cells and keratinocytes mediates sorafenib-induced handCfoot skin reaction that can be reversed by nicotinamide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Patients and families want their healthcare to be delivered by healthcare providers that are both competent and compassionate.

METHODS: Rapid lateral flow tests and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) that detect Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were carried out using 1150 stored human serum samples that had been collected in 2018 and 2019. The tests were also run using samples from 15 control patients who had positive or negative oral swab test results, as assessed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). The urea dissociation test was employed to rule out false-positive reactivity in the two antibody detection methods. RESULTS: The lateral flow tests revealed 21 positive samples from the stored sera: 12 for IgM, four for IgG, and five for IgM/IgG.

METHODS: This is an ecological study involving identified and active LTCFs in Bahia, monitored by the Intersectoral Monitoring Commission of LTCFs. Data analysis included COVID-19 incidence among older residents and workers and COVID-19 hospitalization, fatality, and mortality rates among older residents. In addition to a global analysis of data from Bahia, a stratified analysis compared (i) the East macroregion with the rest of Bahia, and (ii) private LTCFs with philanthropic ones. RESULTS: Our sample consisted of 175 LTCFs, more than half located in the East macroregion (n = 99). Most facilities declared themselves as philanthropic (n = 94) or private (n = 59). From April/2020 to June/2021, COVID-19 incidence was 30.71% among residents and 19.86% among LTCF workers. Considering older residents, mortality was 3.57% and fatality was 11.63%. Incidence was lower in the East macroregion, for older residents (relative risk [RR] = 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-0.87) and LTCF workers (RR = 0.70; 95%CI 0.59-0.83).

We present a case of a 37-year-old man with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) to portray this complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old man with a prior medical history of obesity and mild COVID-19 infection one month prior to admission was evaluated for persistent headaches, fever, and myalgias. The patient presented with leukocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers, a positive COVD-19 PCR, and a chest x-ray that was negative for pulmonary disease. Once admitted, he developed hypotension due to cardiogenic shock with vasoplegia, and decompensated into multiorgan system failure requiring vasopressor and ventilatory support. Corticosteroids and antibiotics were started, and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% with global hypokinesis. The patient was transferred to a tertiary care center, where a follow up TTE revealed an EF of 20%, requiring ionotropic therapy and left ventricular mechanical support with an Impella. The patient's inflammatory markers continued to rise, with a D-Dimer greater than 20 ug/mL, lactate dehydrogenase greater than 4,000 U/L, and ferritin greater than 40,000 U/L, and progressed to acute renal failure. The patient underwent continuous veno-venous hemofiltration, plasma exchange, and tocilizumab, eventually requiring veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for further hemodynamic support. However, due to continued decompensation, the patient expired despite maximal mechanical and pharmacologic support. DISCUSSION: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) has been described as cardiogenic shock with elevated inflammatory markers in the setting of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test without severe respiratory illness(1). While SARS-CoV-2 infections have been known to cause myocarditis on initial presentation(2), such a significant cardiogenic and vasodilatory shock refractory to both mechanical and pharmacologic support 1-month post-infection is extremely rare in adults, especially in this acuity. However, this presentation has been documented in children (MIS-C) who have had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (3) with multi-organ inflammation. Treatment is supportive, including the use of corticosteroids, tocilizumab, intravenous immunoglobulin, and circulatory support, but further research is necessary to determine the pathophysiology behind this inflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults is a rare and severe inflammatory complication for those post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further research needs to be completed to distinguish the pathophysiology behind this response to optimize treatment. REFERENCE #1: Morris SB, Schwartz NG, Patel P, et al.

Materials and Methods: On the basis of initial treatment, 81 patients were divided into two groups: DOAC after UFH bolus infusion group (group D; n=32) and conventional therapy group (group C; n=49). The frequency of recurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and bleeding within 6 months were compared. In addition, hospitalization length and thrombus reduction rate in the pulmonary artery on computed tomography (CT) at the chronic phase were assessed. Results: Recurrence of VTE was found in one (3.1%) and three patients (6.1%) (P=1.00) in groups D and C, respectively, whereas no bleeding events was found in group D and 8.2% of patients in group C (P=0.15). Group D showed shorter hospitalization (7.22.3 days) than group C (15.79.9 days; P<0.001). In the subset of patients with serial CT assessment (group D, n=20; group C, n=38), almost all thrombus of pulmonary artery were disappeared and the thrombus reduction rates were similar between the two groups (group D, 99.5%; group C, 97.1%; P=0.59). Conclusion: DOAC administration immediately after UFH bolus treatment has the same efficacy and safety, whereas hospitalization days were significantly shorter than the conventional treatment group.","output":"Administration of Direct Oral Anticoagulant Immediately after Unfractionated Heparin Bolus for the Treatment of IntermediateCHigh-Risk Pulmonary Thromboembolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The inflammatory cascade is the main cause of death in COVID-19 patients. Corticosteroids (CS) and tocilizumab (TCZ) are available to treat this escalation but which patients to administer it remains undefined. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory therapy in COVID-19, based on the degree of inflammation. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study with data on patients collected and followed up from March 1st, 2020, to May 1st, 2021, from the nationwide Spanish SEMI-COVID-19 Registry. Patients under treatment with CS vs. those under CS plus TCZ were compared. Effectiveness was explored in 3 risk categories (low, intermediate, high) based on lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and d-dimer values. PATIENTS: A total of 21,962 patients were included in the Registry by May 2021. Of these, 5940 met the inclusion criteria for the present study (5332 were treated with CS and 608 with CS plus TCZ). MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome of the study was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were the composite variable of in-hospital mortality, requirement for high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), or intensive care unit (ICU) admission. KEY RESULTS: A total of 5940 met the inclusion criteria for the present study (5332 were treated with CS and 608 with CS plus TCZ). No significant differences were observed in either the low/intermediate-risk category (1.5% vs. 7.4%, p=0.175) or the high-risk category (23.1% vs. 20%, p=0.223) after propensity score matching. A statistically significant lower mortality was observed in the very highCrisk category (31.9% vs. 23.9%, p=0.049). CONCLUSIONS: The prescription of CS alone or in combination with TCZ should be based on the degrees of inflammation and reserve the CS plus TCZ combination for patients at high and especially very high risk.

BACKGROUND: The number of positive and death cases from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still increasing until now. One of the most prone individuals, even in normal situations is patients with HIV. Currently, the evidence regarding the link between HIV and COVID-19 is still limited and conflicting. This study aims to analyze the relationship between HIV and poor outcomes of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed and Europe PMC database using specific keywords related to our aims until January 12th, 2021. All articles published on COVID-19 and HIV were retrieved. The quality of the study was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) tool for observational studies. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3 software. RESULTS: A total of 38 studies with 18,271,025 COVID-19 patients were included in this meta-analysis. This meta-analysis showed that HIV was not associated with composite poor outcome [OR 1.08 (95% CI 0.95 - 1.23), p = 0.26, I2 = 68%, random-effect modelling]. Meta-regression showed that the association with composite poor outcome was influenced by hypertension (p < 0.00001) and diabetes (p = 0.0007). Subgroup analysis which involves only studies from African region showed that HIV was associated with composite poor outcomes [OR 1.11 (95% CI 1.03 - 1.21), p = 0.01, I2 = 0%, random-effect modelling]. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HIV should still be considered as a population for whom precautions are needed to prevent the COVID-19. The availability of antiretroviral therapy should be ensured.","output":"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and outcomes from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia: A Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the case of a 49-year-old man with underlying hypertension who developed diplopia lasting 2 months. Magnetic resonance imaging and digital subtraction angiography showed multi-lobular unruptured aneurysms in the P2 portion of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) migrating into the interpeduncular cistern of the midbrain. Because the shapes of the aneurysms were serpentine fusiform and the posterior communicating artery (PCoA) was the fetal type, we planned anastomosis of the occipital artery to the P4 portion of the PCA followed by endovascular obliteration of the parent artery including the aneurysms. Endovascular treatment was performed via a femoral approach one week after the anastomosis. Super-selective balloon test occlusion (BTO) of the PCoA was performed by using an occlusion balloon microcatheter before endovascular treatment. Occlusion of the proximal segment of the PCoA induced disturbance of consciousness of the patient. Occlusion of the distal segment other than the first point of the PCoA did not induce any neurological symptoms. The information from this super-selective BTO helped us to perform precise endovascular obliteration. The aneurysm was successfully obliterated, and the diplopia almost disappeared in a few months.

Technology and patents are linked to each other in that patents have been conceived also as a tool for rewarding and motivating the inventors endeavors. Patents have been subject to critical views, especially in the era of software where the innovation might be based on non-technological improvements, sometimes arising from new business models, social behavior or trends. For patents to support innovation in its beneficial contribution to society and avoid abuse, a high-quality patent system should be ensured. Many people believe that this requires in the first place to exclude from patent protection those inventions that are purely non-technical. In this paper, the authors analyze the legal situation at the European Patent Office (EPO), considered as setting amongst the worldwide strictest standards in terms of software patentability, and wherein patents are granted only to technology advances. Within this context, the case of software simulators is discussed, since this is directly linked to intangible software inventions and since it is the subject of a case on a point of law pending before the EPO highest instance, such that its outcome may impact patentability of modern software technologies. In conclusion, the authors argue in favor of maintaining the present EPO practice on simulators, as this is seen as a fair balance in Europe between patent protection for intangible inventions based on technology while excluding from patent protection those inventions that are non-technical arrangements.","output":"Advanced Software and Patents: A Patentability Balance for Fostering Technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has increased childhood food insecurity rates The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia collaborated with Food Connect and Common Market to deliver produce boxes to food-insecure families Food Connect leveraged technology to use texting, scale delivery integrations, and optimize routing to deliver 95,000 pounds of food over a 16-week period COVID-19 has increased childhood food insecurity rates The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia collaborated with Food Connect and Common Market to deliver produce boxes to food-insecure families Food Connect leveraged technology to use texting, scale delivery integrations, and optimize routing to deliver 95,000 pounds of food over a 16-week period","output":"Tech Led Solutions to Address Food Insecurity during a Global Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As part of our search for botanical sources of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibitors, we selected Torreya nucifera, which is traditionally used as a medicinal plant in Asia.

In addition to storage of microbes, the crop is also involved in depositing the microbes via a process known as regurgitation. Various aspects of crop regulation are discussed and specific examples of crop involvement with microorganisms are discussed.

Yet, insufficient information on transmission dynamics has been presented to elucidate the precise risk factors for contracting SARS-CoV-2 in this group. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we investigated association between questionnaire answers on potential exposure situations and SARS-CoV-2-positivity. Health care workers with and without COVID-19-patient contact at nine units at Sk?ne University Hospitals in Malm? and Lund, Sweden and university employees from Lund University, Sweden were enrolled. To limit impact of health care worker to health care worker transmission, units with known outbreaks were excluded. A SARS-CoV-2-positive case was defined by a previous positive PCR or anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in the ZetaGene COVID-19 Antibody Test. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-positivity was detected in 11/51 (22%) health care workers in COVID-19-units, 10/220 (5%) in non-COVID-19-units and 11/192 (6%) University employees (p = .001, Fischer's exact).

The unexpected number of people who have been infected with and died from coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is evidence that the pandemic has affected families and societies. The strong shock wave that has resulted in the international response has focused more on medical rather than psychosocial interventions. Little has been written or studied about the impact of COVID-19 on families. This article explores the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on the mental health of families. We conducted 20 in-depth interviews with Jordanian families through snowball sampling. FINDINGS: The results show that 20 interviewees described varied and new experiences. Many of the families we interviewed displayed symptoms of mental health problems, including disrupted sleep patterns, changes in eating habits, excessive digital media use, anxiety, depression, excessive smoking, stomach aches, bedwetting among children, and persistent headaches. The study also demonstrated the psychological stress partners felt during the lockdown due to their worries about job security. They also communicated their hope that renewed family commitments might bring more stability to their relationships. During the lockdown, family members spent more time together, and it became harder to conceal any issues from each other. APPLICATIONS: The findings of this research demonstrate a critical need for social workers, and it is hoped that future legislation will include a role for social workers in various fields of crisis.

The WHO published a global strategic plan in 2001 to contain antimicrobial resistance. In the following year, a workshop identified crucial barriers to the implementation of the strategy, e.g., underdeveloped health infrastructures and the scarcity of valid data as well as a lack of implementation of antibiotic stewardship (ABS) programs in medical curricula. Here, we show that interprofessional learning and education can contribute to the optimization of antibiotic use and preserving antibiotic effectiveness. We have initiated interprofessional rounds on a medical intensive care unit (MICU) with a focus on gastroenterology, hepatology, infectious diseases, endocrinology, and liver transplantation. We integrated ICU physicians, hospital pharmacists, nursing staff, and medical students as well as students of pharmacy to broaden the rather technical concept of ABS with an interprofessional approach to conceptualize awareness and behavioral change in antibiotic prescription and use. Methods: Clinical performance data and consumption figures for antibiotics were analyzed over a 10-year period from 2012 to 2021. The control period covered the years 2012C2014. The intervention period comprised the years 2015C2021, following the implementation of an interprofessional approach to ABS at a MICU of a German university hospital. Data from the hospital pharmacy, hospital administration, and hospital information system were included in the analyses. A specific electronic platform was developed for the optimization of documentation, interprofessional learning, education, and sustainability. The years 2020 and 2021 were analyzed independently due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the care of numerous COVID-19 patients at the MICU. Results: Implementation of an interprofessional ABS program resulted in the optimization of antibiotic management at the MICU. The suggestions of the hospital pharmacist for optimization can be divided into the following categories (i) indication for and selection of therapy (43.6%), (ii) optimization of dosing (27.6%), (iii) drug interactions (9.4%), (iv) side effects (4.1%), and (v) other pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacoeconomic topics (15.3%). These suggestions were discussed among the interprofessional team at the MICU; 86.1% were consequently implemented and the prescription of antibiotics was changed. In addition, further analysis of the intensive care German Diagnosis Related Groups (G-DRGs) showed that the case mix points increased significantly by 31.6% during the period under review. Accordingly, the severity of illness of the patients treated at the ICU as measured by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II increased by 21.4% and the proportion of mechanically ventilated patients exceeded 50%. Antibiotic spending per case mix point was calculated. While spending was EUR 60.22 per case mix point in 2015, this was reduced by 42.9% to EUR 34.37 per case mix point by 2019, following the implementation of the interprofessional ABS program on the MICU. Through close interprofessional collaboration between physicians, hospital pharmacists, and staff nurses, the consumption of broad-spectrum antibiotics, e.g., carbapenems, was significantly reduced, thus improving patient care. In parallel, the case mix and case mix index increased. Thus, the responsible use of resources and high-performance medicine are not contradictory. In our view, close interprofessional and interdisciplinary collaboration between physicians, pharmacists, and nursing staff will be of outstanding importance in the future to prepare health care professionals for global health care to ensure that the effectiveness of our antibiotics is preserved.","output":"Interprofessional Collaboration between ICU Physicians, Staff Nurses, and Hospital Pharmacists Optimizes Antimicrobial Treatment and Improves Quality of Care and Economic Outcome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The public sector primary care facilities in Cape Town serve a large number of patients with chronic diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis, diabetes, hypertension, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Prior to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, stable patients with chronic conditions attended the facility or support groups to obtain their medication. During the COVID-19 epidemic, these patients would be put at risk if they had to travel and gather in groups to receive medication. The Metropolitan Health Services, therefore, decided to offer home delivery of medication. A system of home delivery was rapidly established by linking the existing chronic dispensing unit system with the emerging approach to community-orientated primary care in the Metro. Medication was delivered as usual to primary care pharmacies, but then a variety of means were used to disseminate the parcels to local non-profit organisations, where they could be delivered by a city-wide network of community health workers (CHWs). Innovations included various ways of delivering the parcels, including via Uber, bicycles and electric scooters, as well as Google forms to monitor the success of the initiative. It was estimated that up to 200 000 parcels per month could be delivered in this way via 2500 CHWs.

The polyprotein is proposed to be processed by viral proteinases to generate the functional replicase complex. To date, only the MHV-JHM amino-terminal proteins p28 and p72, which is processed to p65, have been identified. To further elucidate the biogenesis of the MHV-JHM replicase, we cloned and expressed five regions of ORF1a in bacteria and prepared rabbit antisera to each region. Using the immune sera to immunoprecipitate radiolabeled proteins from MHV-JHM infected cells, we determined that the MHV-JHM ORF1a is initially processed to generate p28, p72, p250, and p150. PulseCchase analysis revealed that these intermediates are further processed to generate p65, p210, p40, p27, the MHV 3C-like proteinase, and p15. A putative replicase complex consisting of p250, p210, p40, p150, and a large protein (>300 kDa) coprecipitate from infected cells disrupted with NP-40, indicating that these proteins are closely associated even after initial proteolytic processing.

We compared the accuracy of PtcCO2 with that of PaCO2 measurements in critically ill children, and we investigated whether clinical conditions associated with low cardiac output or increased subcutaneous tissue affect this accuracy. METHODS We performed a single-center prospective study of critically ill children placed on transcutaneous monitoring. RESULTS There were 184 children enrolled with paired PaCO2 and PtcCO2 values. Subjects had a median age of 31.8 mo (interquartile range 3.5-123.3 mo). Most children were mechanically ventilated (n = 161, 87.5%), and many had cardiac disease (n = 76, 41.3%). The median PaCO2 was 44 mm Hg (interquartile range 39-51 mm Hg). The mean bias between PaCO2 and PtcCO2 was 0.6 mm Hg with 95% limits of agreement from -13.6 to 14.7 mm Hg. The PtcCO2 and PaCO2 were within 5 mm Hg in 126 (68.5%) measurements. In multivariable modeling, cyanotic heart disease (odds ratio 3.5, 95% CI 1.2-10, P = .02) and monitor number 2 (odds ratio 3.8 95% CI 1.3-10.5, P = .01) remained associated with PtcCO2  5 mm Hg higher than PaCO2 . Serum lactate, fluid balance, renal failure, obesity, vasoactive-inotrope score, and acyanotic heart disease were not associated with high or low PtcCO2 values. In 130 children with a second paired PtcCO2 and PaCO2 measurement, predicting the second measured PaCO2 by subtracting the initial observed difference between the PtcCO2 and PaCO2 from the subsequent measured PtcCO2 decreased the mean bias between observed and predicted PaCO2 to 0.2 mm Hg and the 95% limits of agreement to -9.4 to 9.7 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS PtcCO2 provides an acceptable estimate of PaCO2 in many critically ill children, including those with clinical conditions that may be associated with low cardiac output or increased subcutaneous tissue, although it does not perform as well in children with cyanotic heart disease. PtcCO2 may be a useful adjunct monitoring method, but it cannot reliably replace PaCO2 measurement.","output":"Accuracy of Transcutaneous Carbon Dioxide Levels in Comparison to Arterial Carbon Dioxide Levels in Critically Ill Children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) compared with conventional mechanical ventilation on outcomes of patients with covid-19 associated respiratory failure. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: 30 countries across five continents, 3 January 2020 to 29 August 2021. PARTICIPANTS: 7345 adults admitted to the intensive care unit with clinically suspected or laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. INTERVENTIONS: ECMO in patients with a partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) ratio <80 mm Hg compared with conventional mechanical ventilation without ECMO. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was hospital mortality within 60 days of admission to the intensive care unit. Adherence adjusted estimates were calculated using marginal structural models with inverse probability weighting, accounting for competing events and for baseline and time varying confounding. RESULTS: 844 of 7345 eligible patients (11.5%) received ECMO at any time point during follow-up. Adherence adjusted mortality was 26.0% (95% confidence interval 24.5% to 27.5%) for a treatment strategy that included ECMO if the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio decreased <80 mm Hg compared with 33.2% (31.8% to 34.6%) had patients received conventional treatment without ECMO (risk difference C7.1%, 95% confidence interval C8.2% to C6.1%; risk ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.75 to 0.82). In secondary analyses, ECMO was most effective in patients aged <65 years and with a PaO(2)/FiO(2) <80 mm Hg or with driving pressures >15 cmH(2)O during the first 10 days of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: ECMO was associated with a reduction in mortality in selected adults with covid-19 associated respiratory failure. Age, severity of hypoxaemia, and duration and intensity of mechanical ventilation were found to be modifiers of treatment effectiveness and should be considered when deciding to initiate ECMO in patients with covid-19.","output":"Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with acute covid-19 associated respiratory failure: comparative effectiveness study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Memories are not always accurately recalled, and one factor that influences memory is the goal of retrieval. Evidence suggests that retrieving a memory to fit a social goal affects the content that is recollected, yet the nature of this effect, and whether this effect remains stable over time, is not fully understood. To this end, we compared the effect of retrieving a complex event (i.e., a narrative) motivated by a social versus an accuracy goal both immediately and after a 24-hour consolidation period. Three groups of young adults encoded audio narratives and recalled these narratives immediately (Session 1) and again after a 24-hour delay (Session 2). One group recalled the narratives to meet a social goal across both sessions (social); another group recalled the narratives for an accuracy goal across both sessions (accuracy); and a final group initially recalled the narratives for a social goal (Session 1) and then for an accuracy goal (Session 2; mixed). We found no effect of group on the number of details that described the overall theme (central details); however, a social goal significantly reduced the number of specific (episodic) details and altered the order in which the details were described. When the goal of retrieval changed across session (i.e., mixed group), the reduction in specific details remained but not the effect on detail order. These results demonstrate that socially motivated memory retrieval selectively alters the specific episodic content contained in the memory, leaving intact the thematic knowledge and overall structure of the memory.","output":"The effect of retrieval goals on the content recalled from complex narratives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the early COVID-19 pandemic travel in Uganda was tightly restricted which affected demand for and access to care for pregnant women and small and sick newborns. In this study we describe changes to neonatal outcomes in one rural central Ugandan newborn unit before and during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We report outcomes from admissions captured in an electronic dataset of a well-established newborn unit before (September 2019 to March 2020) and during the early COVID-19 period (AprilCSeptember 2020) as well as two seasonally matched periods one year prior. We report excess mortality as the percent change in mortality over what was expected based on seasonal trends. FINDINGS: The study included 2,494 patients, 567 of whom were admitted during the early COVID-19 period. During the pandemic admissions decreased by 14%. Patients born outside the facility were older on admission than previously (median 1 day of age vs. admission on the day of birth). There was an increase in admissions with birth asphyxia (22% vs. 15% of patients). Mortality was higher during COVID-19 than previously [16% vs. 11%, p = 0.017]. Patients born outside the facility had a relative increase of 55% above seasonal expected mortality (21% vs. 14%, p = 0.028). During this period patients had decreased antenatal care, restricted transport and difficulty with expenses and support. The hospital had difficulty with maternity staffing and supplies. There was significant community and staff fear of COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: Increased newborn mortality during the early COVID-19 pandemic at this facility was likely attributed to disruptions affecting maternal and newborn demand for, access to and quality of perinatal healthcare. Lockdown conditions and restrictions to public transit were significant barriers to maternal and newborn wellbeing, and require further focus by national and regional health officials.","output":"Impact of the early COVID-19 pandemic on outcomes in a rural Ugandan neonatal unit: A retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: This article describes the development and implementation of a virtual Consensus development project to address current challenges in adult nursing care in the UK.

Here, we used whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNASeq) and ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) to delineate gene expression in the IBV M41-CK and Beau-R strains at subcodon resolution. RNASeq facilitated a comparative analysis of viral RNA synthesis and revealed two novel transcription junction sites in the attenuated Beau-R strain, one of which would generate a sgmRNA encoding a ribosomally occupied open reading frame (dORF) located downstream of the nucleocapsid coding region. RiboSeq permitted quantification of the translational efficiency of virus gene expression and identified, for the first time, sites of ribosomal pausing on the genome. Quantification of reads flanking the programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signal at the genomic RNA ORF1a/ORF1b junction revealed that PRF in IBV is highly efficient (33 to 40%). Triplet phasing of RiboSeq data allowed precise determination of reading frames and revealed the translation of two ORFs (ORF4b and ORF4c on sgmRNA IR), which are widely conserved across IBV isolates. Analysis of differential gene expression in infected primary chick kidney cells indicated that the host cell response to IBV occurs primarily at the level of transcription, with global upregulation of immune-related mRNA transcripts following infection and comparatively modest changes in the translation efficiencies of host genes. Cellular genes and gene networks differentially expressed during virus infection were also identified, giving insights into the host cell response to IBV infection. IMPORTANCE IBV is a major avian pathogen and presents a substantial economic burden to the poultry industry. Improved vaccination strategies are urgently needed to curb the global spread of this virus, and the development of suitable vaccine candidates will be aided by an improved understanding of IBV molecular biology. Our high-resolution data have enabled a precise study of transcription and translation in cells infected with both pathogenic and attenuated forms of IBV and expand our understanding of gammacoronaviral gene expression. We demonstrate that gene expression shows considerable intraspecies variation, with single nucleotide polymorphisms being associated with altered production of sgmRNA transcripts, and our RiboSeq data sets enabled us to uncover novel ribosomally occupied ORFs in both strains. The numerous cellular genes and gene networks found to be differentially expressed during virus infection provide insights into the host cell response to IBV infection.","output":"Comparative Analysis of Gene Expression in Virulent and Attenuated Strains of Infectious Bronchitis Virus at Subcodon Resolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With continually improving treatment strategies and patient care, the overall mortality of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been significantly reduced. However, this success is a double-edged sword, as many patients who survive cardiovascular complications will progress towards a chronic disorder over time. A family of adiponectin paralogs designated as C1q complement/tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-associated proteins (CTRPs) has been found to play a role in the development of CVD. CTRPs, which are comprised of 15 members, CTRP1 to CTRP15, are secreted from different organs/tissues and exhibit diverse functions, have attracted increasing attention because of their roles in maintaining inner homeostasis by regulating metabolism, inflammation, and immune surveillance. In particular, studies indicate that CTRPs participate in the progression of CVD, influencing its prognosis. This review aims to improve understanding of the role of CTRPs in the cardiovascular system by analyzing current knowledge. In particular, we examine the association of CTRPs with endothelial cell dysfunction, inflammation, and diabetes, which are the basis for development of CVD. Additionally, the recently emerged novel coronavirus (COVID-19), officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been found to trigger severe cardiovascular injury in some patients, and evidence indicates that the mortality of COVID-19 is much higher in patients with CVD than without CVD. Understanding the relationship of CTRPs and the SARS-CoV-2-related damage to the cardiovascular system, as well as the potential mechanisms, will achieve a profound insight into a therapeutic strategy to effectively control CVD and reduce the mortality rate.","output":"C1q Complement/Tumor Necrosis Factor-Associated Proteins in Cardiovascular Disease and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The current global pandemic has created unprecedented challenges in the blood supply network. Given the recent shortages, there must be a civilian plan for massively bleeding patients when there are no blood products on the shelf. Recognizing that the time to death in bleeding patients is less than 2 h, timely resupply from unaffected locations is not possible. One solution is to transfuse emergency untested whole blood (EUWB), similar to the extensive military experience fine-tuned over the last 19 years. While this concept is anathema in current civilian transfusion practice, it seems prudent to have a vetted plan in place. METHODS AND MATERIALS: During the early stages of the 2020 global pandemic, a multidisciplinary and international group of clinicians with broad experience in transfusion medicine communicated routinely. The result is a planning document that provides both background information and a high-level guide on how to emergently deliver EUWB for patients who would otherwise die of hemorrhage. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Similar plans have been utilized in remote locations, both on the battlefield and in civilian practice. The proposed recommendations are designed to provide high-level guidance for experienced blood bankers, transfusion experts, clinicians, and health authorities. Like with all emergency preparedness, it is always better to have a well-thought-out and trained plan in place, rather than trying to develop a hasty plan in the midst of a disaster.

Evidence on the isolation experience, facilitating and complicating factors is needed to mitigate negative effects. Methods and findings This observational, population-based cohort study enrolled 1547 adults from the general population with SARS-CoV-2 infection reported to authorities between 27 February 2020 and 19 January 2021 in Zurich, Switzerland. We assessed the proportion of individuals reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety before, during and after isolation (by DASS-21), and queried worries, positive experiences, and difficulties. We analyzed the association of these outcomes with socio-demographics using ordinal regression. Additionally, we report free-text statements by participants to capture most important aspects of isolation. The proportion of participants affected by depression or anxiety increased during isolation from 100% to 171% and 91% to 176%, respectively. Ordinal regression showed that taking care of children increased the difficulty of isolation (OR 210, CI 143C308) and risk of non-compliance (OR 163, CI 105C253), especially in younger participants. A facilitating factor that individuals commonly expressed was receiving more support during isolation. Conclusion Isolation due to SARS-CoV-2 presents a mental burden, especially for younger individuals and those taking care of children. Public health authorities need to train personnel and draw from community-based resources to provide targeted support, information, and guidance to individuals during isolation. Such efforts could alleviate the negative impact isolation has on the mental and physical health of individuals and ensure compliance of the population with recommendations.","output":"Mental health

The purpose of this study is to focus on identifying the appropriate determinants of the proposed urban travel behavior model to develop Smart Mobility in Smart Cities to protect the environment. Potential to realize Smart Cities with infrastructure development has been explored in this study if road users are keen to combat climatic change which is clear from the challenges of flattening the infection rate through the enforcement of rules and regulations by the various government. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed urban travel behavior model includes sub-drivers for each of the main drivers in the theory of interpersonal behavior (TIB). These sub-drivers emphasize in forming intentions to perform the behavioral changes while driving on urban roads during COVID-19 and post-pandemic periods. A primary online survey was conducted among road commuters in the most crowded place in Malaysia, the Greater Kuala Lumpur. A total of 383 respondents who frequently drive on road during the past one year were surveyed for this study. This data analysis of this quantitative study applied a partial least squares-structural equation modeling approach to determine the significant findings and results. Findings: The significant findings of the study reveal that environmental consciousness and timely deviation in driving during traffic congestion are positively and significantly influencing the travel behavior performance (TBP) of commuters on urban roads. On the other hand, wet conditions due to weather, narrow road infrastructure and habits of road commuters are negatively influencing TBP. Social responsibility is positively and significantly influencing TBP through the mediating effect of the intention of road commuters behavior. Research limitations/implications: The current environmental concerns and societal adherence efforts in breaking the chain of the infectious COVID-19 among people can be manifested to develop Smart Cities with less air and noise pollution in the future. In this context, the present study proposes an urban travel behavior model and tests for its suitability of a greener and cleaner environment for the benefit of future generations. The limitation of the present study is that travel hazards are not included in the framework, as it is a topic of its own volume. Originality/value: It is timely to implement Smart Mobility on road business models for Smart Cities as the consequences of the pandemic make us to realize the importance of environmental concerns and the social responsibilities of everyone. TIB considers four drivers, namely, attitude, subjective norm, affect and habit which induce intention to perform behavioral decisions. The novelty of the present study is the development of sub-drivers for these four drivers in the context of the urban travel behavior model. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Smart cities

The authors recently identified a racial disparity in access to a laparoscopic approach to inguinal hernia repair, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and colectomy. The present study further evaluates this patient cohort to assess the relationship between the race and postoperative complications and test the mediating effect of the selected surgical approach. METHODS: After institutional review board approval, patients in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database who underwent inguinal hernia repair, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, or colectomy in 2016 were identified. Patient demographics, including the self-reported race and ethnicity, as well as clinical, operative, and postoperative variables were recorded. After the exclusion of cases associated with diagnoses of cancer, a 4:1 propensity score matching algorithm generated a clinically balanced cohort of patients of white and black self-reported race. The mediating effect of an open approach to surgery on the relationship between black self-reported race and postoperative complications was evaluated via a series of regressions. RESULTS: There were 41,340 unilateral inguinal hernia repairs, 3182 bilateral inguinal hernia repairs, 60,444 cholecystectomies, 50,523 appendectomies, and 58,012 colectomies included in the database in 2017. Exclusion of cases associated with cancer and subsequent propensity score matching returned 17,540 unilateral hernia repairs, 890 bilateral hernia repairs, 23,865 cholecystectomies, 11,660 appendectomies, and 12,320 colectomies. On mediation analysis, any complication, severe complication, and death were significant when regressed on black self-reported race (any: odds ratio [OR] = 1.210, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.132-1.291, P < 0.001; severe: OR = 1.352, 95% CI = 1.245-1.466, P < 0.001; death: OR = 1.358, 95% CI = 1.000-1.818, P = 0.044), and open surgery was a significant mediator in the incidence of any complication and severe complication (any: OR = 1.180, 95% CI = 1.105-1.260, P < 0.001 and severe: OR = 1.307, 95% CI = 1.203-1.418, P < 0.001).

The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of LigaSure vs. Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) for LH in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with cirrhosis. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 135 HCC patients with background cirrhosis who underwent pure LH using CUSA (n = 55) or LigaSure (n = 80) for parenchymal transection between January 2015 and May 2017 at West China Hospital of Sichuan University. We performed 1:1 propensity score matching between the LigaSure and CUSA groups. Subsequently, 48 patients were included in each group. RESULTS The mean parenchymal transection time (74.3  23.6 vs. 86.3  25.8 min, P = 0.019) in the LigaSure group was obviously shorter than that in the CUSA group. The LigaSure did not increase the intraoperative blood loss or blood transfusion requirement when compared with CUSA. Moreover, the degree of postoperative reperfusion injury and complications were not significantly different between the two groups. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the two groups regarding 2-year overall survival rate or disease-free survival rate. In addition, the total hospitalization costs (P = 0.032) and intraoperative costs (P = 0.006) per case were significantly lower in the LigaSure group than those in the CUSA group. CONCLUSION The two devices were safe and effective for LH in patients with cirrhosis. The LigaSure method may be a simple, feasible, and cost-effective surgical technique for LH in selected HCC patients with cirrhosis.","output":"LigaSure versus CUSA for parenchymal transection during laparoscopic hepatectomy in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with cirrhosis: a propensity score-matched analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The implementation of the Movement Control Order (MCO) due to the spread of COVID-19 outbreak has affected business continuity, especially Muslimpreneurs involved in small-scale business.

It has to be done in Class II biological safety laboratory. However, it may lack sensitivity, particularly in the advanced phase of infection, and depends closely on the samples' quality. Rapid PCR by cartridge system reduces response times but is not suitable for laboratories with high throughput of requests. Detection of virus antigens on respiratory samples is a quick and easy to use technique; however it has not good specificity and sensitivity and cannot be used for diagnosis and patient management.

PPE usage causes headache in majority of users. We evaluated changes in cerebral hemodynamics among healthcare-workers using PPE. METHODS: Frontline healthcare-workers donning PPE at our tertiary center were included. Demographics, co-morbidities and blood-pressure were recorded. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring of middle cerebral artery was performed with 2-MHz probe. Mean flow velocity (MFV) and pulsatility index (PI) were recorded at baseline, after donning N95 respirator-mask, and after donning powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), when indicated. End-tidal carbon-dioxide (ET-CO2) pressure was recorded for participants donning PAPR in addition to the N95 respirator-mask. RESULTS: A total of 154 healthcare-workers (mean age 29  12 years, 67% women) were included. Migraine was the commonest co-morbidity in 38 (25%) individuals while 123 (80%) developed de-novo headache due to N95 mask. Donning of N95 respirator-mask resulted in significant increase in MFV (4.4  10.4 cm/s, p < 0.001) and decrease in PI (0.13  0.12; p < 0.001) while ET-CO2 increased by 3.1  1.2 mmHg (p < 0.001). TCD monitoring in 24 (16%) participants donning PAPR and N95 respirator mask together showed normalization of PI, accompanied by normalization of ET-CO2 values within 5-min. Combined use of N95 respirator-mask and PAPR was more comfortable as compared to N95 respirator-mask alone. CONCLUSION: Use of N95 respirator-mask results in significant alterations in cerebral hemodynamics. However, these effects are mitigated by the use of additional PAPR.

Such codes often use a low-Mach number approximation, that require the iterative solution of a large system of linear equations at every time step. While the discretization routines in such a code can be improved by the use of, say, OpenMP or Cuda Approaches, it is important that the linear solver be able to perform well too. For Uintah the Hypre iterative solver has proved to solve such systems in a scalable way. The use of Hypre with OpenMP leads to at least 2x slowdowns due to OpenMP overheads, however. This behavior is analyzed and a solution proposed by using the MPI Endpoints approach is implemented within Hypre, where each team of threads acts as a different MPI rank. This approach minimized OpenMP synchronization overhead, avoided slowdowns, performed as fast or (up to 1.5x) faster than Hypres MPI only version, and allowed the rest of Uintah to be optimized using OpenMP. Profiling of the GPU version of Hypre showed the bottleneck to be the launch overhead of thousands of micro-kernels. The GPU performance was improved by fusing these micro kernels and was further optimized by using Cuda-aware MPI. The overall speedup of 1.26x to 1.44x was observed compared to the baseline GPU implementation.","output":"Improving Performance of the Hypre Iterative Solver for Uintah Combustion Codes on Manycore Architectures Using MPI Endpoints and Kernel Consolidation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Nursing homespreparedness in managing a public health crisis has been fragile, with effects on safety culture.

HBV core protein (HBc) contains an arginine-rich domain (ARD) at its carboxyl terminus. This ARD domain of HBc 149-183 is known to be important for viral replication but not known to have a structure. Recently, nucleocapsid proteins of several viruses have been shown to contain nucleic acid chaperone activity, which can facilitate structural rearrangement of viral genome. Major features of nucleic acid chaperones include highly basic amino acid residues and flexible protein structure. To test the nucleic acid chaperone hypothesis for HBc ARD, we first used the disassembled full-length HBc from Escherichia coli to analyze the nucleic acid annealing and strand displacement activities. To exclude the potential contamination of chaperones from E. coli, we designed synthetic HBc ARD peptides with different lengths and serine phosphorylations. We demonstrated that HBc ARD peptide can behave like a bona fide nucleic acid chaperone and that the chaperone activity depends on basic residues of the ARD domain. The loss of chaperone activity by arginine-to-alanine substitutions in the ARD can be rescued by restoring basic residues in the ARD. Furthermore, the chaperone activity is subject to regulation by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at the HBc ARD. Interestingly, the HBc ARD can enhance in vitro cleavage activity of RNA substrate by a hammerhead ribozyme. We discuss here the potential significance of the HBc ARD chaperone activity in the context of viral DNA replication, in particular, at the steps of primer translocations and circularization of linear replicative intermediates. IMPORTANCE Hepatitis B virus is a major human pathogen. At present, no effective treatment can completely eradicate the virus from patients with chronic hepatitis B. We report here a novel chaperone activity associated with the viral core protein.

In this sense, in this article, we focus implementing an IoT-based System for safer mobility in the age of COVID-19 using machine learning called SafeMobility. This system has been designed to monitor in real-time the social distancing between people and control the capacity in common interior spaces via a multilayer architecture that integrates IoT, fog, and cloud solutions. To control the capacity safely, we have detected the location of people using machine learning models. We have trained and evaluated these models from a data set containing the RSSI signals of the different surrounding WiFi networks obtained via a portable IoT device. Besides, this portable device integrated with a high precision laser sensor has also been used to detect the distance between people, thus avoiding potential infections. Also, we have exploited the advantages of fog computing to perform data processing and analysis in a fog node using the machine learning model that presented the highest accuracy in the evaluation. In case of non-compliance with the allowed social distance or the established peak capacity, alert messages are sent via a lightweight and optimal protocol in using IoT applications. A web application hosted on a cloud server receives the information from the fog node in real-time and dynamically displays the congestion sites in the environment.

RCCs to date were generated in mice, but rats are thought to be optimal for addiction genetic studies. Based on past literature, one inbred Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat substrain, SHR/NCrl, is predicted to exhibit a distinct behavioral profile as it relates to cocaine self-administration traits relative to another substrain, SHR/NHsd. Direct substrain comparisons are a necessary first step before implementing an RCC. We evaluated model traits for cocaine addiction risk and cocaine self-administration behaviors using a longitudinal within-subjects design. Impulsive-like and compulsive-like traits were greater in SHR/NCrl than SHR/NHsd, as were reactivity to sucrose reward, sensitivity to acute psychostimulant effects of cocaine, and cocaine use studied under fixed-ratio and tandem schedules of cocaine self-administration. Compulsive-like behavior correlated with the acute psychostimulant effects of cocaine, which in turn correlated with cocaine taking under the tandem schedule. Compulsive-like behavior also was the best predictor of cocaine seeking responses. Heritability estimates indicated that 22 %-40 % of the variances for the above phenotypes can be explained by additive genetic factors, providing sufficient genetic variance to conduct genetic mapping in F2 crosses of SHR/NCrl and SHR/NHsd.

Although the etiology and pathogenesis of IBD are largely unknown, studies with animal models of colitis indicate that dysregulation of host/microbial interactions are requisite for the development of IBD. Patients with long-standing IBD have an increased risk for developing colitis-associated cancer (CAC), especially 10 years after the initial diagnosis of colitis, although the absolute number of CAC cases is relatively small. The cancer risk seems to be not directly related to disease activity, but is related to disease duration/extent, complication of primary sclerosing cholangitis, and family history of colon cancer. In particular, high levels and continuous production of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines and chemokines, by colonic epithelial cells (CECs) and immune cells in lamina propria may be strongly associated with the pathogenesis of CAC.

We will thoroughly read and code selected studies to extract both raw and contextual data for the synthesis. The relation of the studies will be determined according to the elements of the frameworks, models, or theories the studies applied. We will translate these elements between each other and intend to synthesize holistic principles for eHealth development for the case at hand. RESULTS The search strategy has been completed, data extraction is almost finalized, and the first synthesis approaches are underway. The search yielded 1224 citations and, after we applied the selection criteria, 17 articles remained. We expect to submit the final results for publication in 2019. CONCLUSIONS This review is important because it aims to create a holistic understanding of a multidisciplinary topic at the crossroads of eHealth, cardiovascular diseases, and self-management. The value of metaethnography in contrast to other systematic review methods is that its synthesis approach seeks to generate a new understanding of a topic, while preserving the social and theoretical contexts in which findings emerge. Our results will show how useful this method can be in bridging the multidisciplinary gap of eHealth research and development, to inform and advance the importance of holistic approaches, while showcasing this approach for the case of self-management in cardiovascular diseases.

In this commentary, we argue that actions on health equity to date have been insufficient despite significant scholarship to guide both practice and policy. To move from talk to action on health equity, we propose the following five approaches: (1) reversing the erosion of publicly funded health systems; (2) creating broad economic means to support health; (3) moving health action upstream; (4) challenging ageist and/or ableist discourses; and (5) decolonizing approaches and enacting solidarity. Engaging in these actions will help close the gaps and address disparities made more evident during this global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic reinforces the need for us to move from discussion to action if we are to achieve health for all.

The survey was distributed via the WhatsApp application for smartphones among subjects across the Argentine territory using a combination of convenience and snowball sampling. We received 6176 responses. Almost 70% of respondents manifested fear of visiting a physician. One third of respondents manifested having a desire or need in at least one occasion of visiting a physician but, of these, 48% avoided it. The main reasons for avoiding visits were: 1) a recommendation of staying home (40%); 2) lack of access to the physician (35%); and 3) fear of contagion (26%). The most common form of consultation was through unconventional means (e-mail, telephone, or WhatsApp). One of 5 respondents had difficulties to obtain a medication prescription and 5% stopped the use of at least one medication.

Here, using mice sensitized for infection with SARS-CoV-2 by transduction with an adenovirus expressing the human receptor (Ad5-hACE2), we identified SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell epitopes recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice.

Using the technology acceptance model (TAM) as a foundation, this study introduces three new variables, namely, perceived risk, social pressure, and social image, to establish an extended model for investigating the factors that influence if residents wear masks. A total of 1200 questionnaires were distributed in China, from 1 February to 30 May 2020, through Chinas largest online platform. The results indicate the following: 1. Residents positive attitude towards mask wearing promotes their behavioral intention to wear masks. 2. Perceived risk, social pressure, and social image have a positive impact on attitude towards mask wearing. 3. The intention to wear masks and attitude were both positively influenced by perceived usefulness. 4. The perceived usefulness is more influential in rural than urban groups, in terms of behavioral intention.

Herein, we show that the application of two strategies, cloning of the cDNAs into a bacterial artificial chromosome and nuclear expression of RNAs that are typically produced within the cytoplasm, is useful for the engineering of large RNA molecules. A cDNA encoding an infectious coronavirus RNA genome has been cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome. The rescued coronavirus conserved all of the genetic markers introduced throughout the sequence and showed a standard mRNA pattern and the antigenic characteristics expected for the synthetic virus. The cDNA was transcribed within the nucleus, and the RNA translocated to the cytoplasm. Interestingly, the recovered virus had essentially the same sequence as the original one, and no splicing was observed. The cDNA was derived from an attenuated isolate that replicates exclusively in the respiratory tract of swine. During the engineering of the infectious cDNA, the spike gene of the virus was replaced by the spike gene of an enteric isolate. The synthetic virus replicated abundantly in the enteric tract and was fully virulent, demonstrating that the tropism and virulence of the recovered coronavirus can be modified.

From the literature, we find that only nine (20%) of the Latin America and the Caribbean countries have developed guidelines for early detection of CRC, and also with a low adherence. We describe a genetic profile of LS, including a total of 2,685 suspected families, where confirmed LS ranged from 8% in Uruguay and Argentina to 60% in Peru.

Salmonella Typhimurium (STm), which causes severe systemic disease in most inbred mice, has been used as a model for disseminated disease. To screen for new infection phenotypes across a range of host genetics, we orally infected 32 Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse strains with STm and monitored their disease progression for seven days by telemetry. Our data revealed a broad range of phenotypes across CC strains in many parameters including survival, bacterial colonization, tissue damage, complete blood counts (CBC), and serum cytokines. Eighteen CC strains survived to day 7, while fourteen susceptible strains succumbed to infection before day 7. Several CC strains had sex differences in survival and colonization. Surviving strains had lower pre-infection baseline temperatures and were less active during their daily active period. Core body temperature disruptions were detected earlier after STm infection than activity disruptions, making temperature a better detector of illness. All CC strains had STm in spleen and liver, but susceptible strains were more highly colonized. Tissue damage was weakly negatively correlated to survival. We identified loci associated with survival on Chromosomes (Chr) 1, 2, 4, 7. Polymorphisms in Ncf2 and Slc11a1, known to reduce survival in mice after STm infections, are located in the Chr 1 interval, and the Chr 7 association overlaps with a previously identified QTL peak called Ses2.

However, the field lacks methodology to assess synergistic or antagonistic interactions for drugs with non-traditional dose response curves. Specifically, our goal was to assess small-molecule modulators of antioxidant response element (ARE)-driven gene expression, which is largely regulated by the Nrf2 transcription factor. Known as Nrf2 activators, this class of compounds upregulates a battery of cytoprotective genes and shows significant promise for prevention of numerous chronic diseases. For example, sulforaphane sourced from broccoli sprouts is the subject of over 70 clinical trials. Nrf2 activators generally have non-traditional dose response curves that are hormetic, or U-shaped. We introduce a method based on the principles of Loewe Additivity to assess synergism and antagonism for two compounds in combination. This method, termed Dose-Equivalence/Zero Interaction (DE/ZI), can be used with traditional Hill-slope response curves, and it also can assess interactions for compounds with non-traditional curves, using a nearest-neighbor approach. Using a Monte-Carlo method, DE/ZI generates a measure of synergy or antagonism for each dosing pair with an associated error and p-value, resulting in a 3D response surface. For the assessed Nrf2 activators, sulforaphane and di-tert-butylhydroquinone, this approach revealed synergistic interactions at higher dosing concentrations consistently across data sets and potential antagonistic interactions at lower concentrations. DE/ZI eliminates the need to determine the best fit equation for a given data set and values experimentally-derived results over formulated fits.","output":"Solving the Problem of Assessing Synergy and Antagonism for Non-Traditional Dosing Curve Compounds Using the DE/ZI Method: Application to Nrf2 Activators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analysed a carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) outbreak in the coronavirus disease (COVID) ICU.

(L. japonica) has the functions of clearing away heat and detoxifying, broad-spectrum antibacterial and anti-virus, etc. More than 70% of anti-inflammatory and cold Chinese patent medicines contain L. japonica. Trichomes comprise specialized multicellular structures that have the capacity to synthesize and secrete secondary metabolites and protect plants from biotic and abiotic stresses. The extraction of trichome secretions has great commercial value. However, little is known about the trichome formation mechanism in L. japonica. Therefore, the study of trichome development between different varieties provides a basis for selecting suitable planting resources. RESULTS Here, we present a genome-wide comparative transcriptome analysis between two L. japonica cultivars, toward the identification of biological processes and functional gene activities that occur during flowering stage trichome development. In this study, the density and average lengths of flower trichomes were at their highest during three-green periods (S2). Using the Illumina RNA-Seq method, we obtained 134,304 unigenes, 33,733 of which were differentially expressed. In an analysis of 40 differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) involved in trichome development, 29 of these were transcription factors. The DEGs analysis of plant hormone signal transduction indicated that plant growth and development may be independent of gibberellin (GA) and cytokinine (CTK) signaling pathways, and plant stress may be independent of jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) signaling pathways. We screened several genes involved in the floral biosynthesis of odors, tastes, colors, and plant hormones, and proposed biosynthetic pathways for sesquiterpenoid, triterpenoid, monoterpenoid, flavonoid, and plant hormones. Furthermore, 82 DEGs were assigned to cell cycles and 2616 were predicted as plant resistance genes (PRGs).

A number of studies have been performed to analyze the diversity of airborne fungi in different environments worldwide, and in particular in many urban areas in China. We investigated, for the first time, the diversity, concentration and distribution of airborne fungi in Tianjin city. We sampled 8 outdoor environments, using open plate method, during a whole winter season. Isolated fungi were identified by morphological and molecular analysis. Environmental factors which could influence the airborne fungi concentration (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and air pressure) were monitored and analyzed. The effect of different urban site functions (busy areas with high traffic flow and commercial activities vs. green areas) on airborne fungal diversity was also analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 560 fungal strains, belonging to 110 species and 49 genera of Ascomycota (80 %), Basidiomycota (18 %), and Mucoromycota (2 %) were isolated in this study. The dominant fungal genus was Alternaria (22 %), followed by Cladosporium (18.4 %), Naganishia (14.1 %), Fusarium (5.9 %), Phoma (4.11 %), and Didymella (4.8 %). A fungal concentration ranging from 0 to 3224.13 CFU m(? 3) was recorded during the whole study. Permutational multivariate analysis showed that the month was the most influential factor for airborne fungal community structure, probably because it can be regarded as a proxy of environmental variables, followed by wind speed. The two analyzed environments (busy vs. green) had no detectable effect on the air fungal community, which could be related to the relatively small size of parks in Tianjin and/or to the study season. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shed light on the highly diverse community of airborne fungi characterizing the outdoor environments of Tianjin, and clarified the role that different environmental factors played in shaping the analyzed fungal community. The dominant presence of fungi with potential hazardous effect on human health, such as Alternaria, Cladosporium and Naganishia, deserves further attention.

Inter-OSCTC sharing of successful protocols and systems has been hampered by evolving resource constraints, the changing science of testing, and ever increasing COVID-19 case counts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to identify promising approaches to testing vulnerable populations. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 26 leaders of OSCTCs and public health departments across the United States between June 8th and August 10th, 2020. All interviews were coded utilizing oral coding via rapid identification of themes from audio recordings, and analysis occurred concurrently with data collection to assess when saturation was achieved. RESULTS: Six main themes emerged highlighting approaches to testing within vulnerable populations including: 1. Expanding services to support health and health-related needs beyond COVID-19; 2. Gaining community trust; 3. Developing and leveraging community partnerships; 4. Promoting clear and creative messaging; 5. Prioritizing patient experience; and 6. Managing patient results. CONCLUSIONS: Testing among the vulnerable not only helps those at highest risk of severe disease or death from COVID-19, but also presents a critical opportunity to control viral spread within and from these communities.

We exploit the distribution of the density of essential workers across provinces and rich administrative data in a difference in difference framework. We find that a standard deviation increase in essential workers per square kilometre leads to an additional daily registered case per 100,000 inhabitants. This is a sizeable impact, and it represents about 18% of the daily increase in COVID-19 cases after the 22nd of March. Back of envelope computations suggest that the about one third of the cases considered could be attributed to the less stringent lockdown for essential sectors, with an additional 107 million Euros in direct expenditure. Although this assessment should be taken with caution, this suggests that the less stringent lockdown came at moderate public health related economic costs. In addition, we find that these effects are heterogeneous across sectors, with services having a much larger impact than Manufacturing, while there are only small differences across geographic areas. These results are stable across a wide range of specifications and robustness check.","output":"Partial Lockdown and the Spread of Covid-19: Lessons from the Italian Case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Defense against intracellular infection has been extensively studied in vertebrate hosts, but less is known about invertebrate hosts; specifically, the transcription factors that induce defense against intracellular intestinal infection in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans remain understudied. Two different types of intracellular pathogens that naturally infect the C. elegans intestine are the Orsay virus, which is an RNA virus, and microsporidia, which comprise a phylum of fungal pathogens. Despite their molecular differences, these pathogens induce a common host transcriptional response called the intracellular pathogen response (IPR). Here we show that zip-1 is an IPR regulator that functions downstream of all known IPR-activating and regulatory pathways. zip-1 encodes a putative bZIP transcription factor, and we show that zip-1 controls induction of a subset of genes upon IPR activation. ZIP-1 protein is expressed in the nuclei of intestinal cells, and is at least partially required in the intestine to upregulate IPR gene expression. Importantly, zip-1 promotes resistance to infection by the Orsay virus and by microsporidia in intestinal cells. Altogether, our results indicate that zip-1 represents a central hub for triggers of the IPR, and that this transcription factor has a protective function against intracellular pathogen infection in C. elegans.","output":"The transcription factor ZIP-1 promotes resistance to intracellular infection in Caenorhabditis elegans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) applies health protocols to prove the serve during pandemic.

The authors aim to determine the complication profile of panniculectomies by body mass index (BMI). METHODS: The 2012C2018 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for all panniculectomy cases. Patients were assigned to a category by their calculated BMI. Rates of complications were compared across BMI ranges. Demographics, comorbidities, and perioperative factors were compared between those with and without complications. Multivariable analyses were performed to analyze the associations between BMI ranges and post-surgical complications. RESULTS: Twelve thousand seven hundred thirty-two cases were analyzed, of which 1759 (13.8%) had at least one postoperative complication. As BMI increased, patients were more likely to experience postoperative complications (p<0.001). Patients experiencing complications were more likely to be male, older, of a higher BMI group, have a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists Personal Status classification, be an inpatient, have various comorbidities, or be undergoing a concurrent procedure. On multivariable analysis, patients who were overweight (OR=1.24, p=0.039), with class 1 (OR=1.72, p<0.001), class 2 (OR=2.10, p<0.001), or class 3 (OR=3.01, p<0.001) obesity were more likely to have a postoperative complication. Wound complications were particularly prevalent in patients who were overweight (OR=1.77, p=0.001) or with class 1 (OR=2.59, p<0.001), class 2 (OR=4.05, p<0.001), or class 3 (p=5.84, p<0.001) obesity compared to non-overweight patients. CONCLUSION: A higher BMI is associated with more postoperative complications, particularly wound healing complications, following panniculectomy in a dose-dependent manner.

They are in direct contact with the patients as primary caregivers and, therefore, are at a higher risk of infection. This Pandemic offers a unique opportunity to explore the level of knowledge among ground-level HCWs during this global health crisis. OBJECTIVE: We conducted this study to assess the knowledge and awareness among HCW regarding the COVID-19 Pandemic in a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: It was a cross-sectional study done on HCW comprising faculty, senior residents, junior residents, demonstrators, and nursing staff of various specialties directly involved in the care of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients. A pretested questionnaire consisting of 20 questions was used as a study tool and was circulated through the digital platform. RESULTS: There were a total of 437 respondents. In the subgroup analysis, the respondents in the age group of 55C64 years had a higher mean knowledge score, followed by the respondents in the age group of 18C24 years. For years of experience, the mean knowledge score varied from 13.89 (10C20 years of experience) to 13.83 (5C10 years of experience). The mean knowledge score was the highest for consultants (14.10), followed by Resident Doctors (13.96). CONCLUSIONS: This study has shed some critical clues for further research and interventions. Firstly, as health care workers are probably learning about COVID-19 from their practical exposure rather than formal teaching, it is pertinent to address this issue through well-planned formal sessions of training workshops and lectures.","output":"Assessment of knowledge of COVID-19 among health care workers-a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study in a tertiary care hospital of India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has shaken the world by extremely raising death tolls, illnesses, and economic losses.

However, the dominant environmental drivers or factors influencing N2 fixation and the functional significance of the diazotroph community structure in paddy soil across a climatic gradient are not yet well understood. Thus, we characterized the diazotroph community and identified the ecological predictors of N2 fixation potential in four different climate zones (mid-temperate, warm-temperate, subtropical, and tropical paddy soils) in eastern China. Comprehensive nifH gene sequencing, functional activity detection, and correlation analysis with environmental factors were estimated. The potential nitrogenase activity (PNA) was highest in warm-temperate regions, where it was 6.2-, 2.9-, and 2.2-fold greater than in the tropical, subtropical, and mid-temperate regions, respectively; nifH gene abundance was significantly higher in warm-temperate and subtropical zones than in the tropical or mid-temperate zones. Diazotroph diversity was significantly higher in the tropical climate zone and significantly lower in the mid-temperate zone. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and canonical correlation analysis indicated that paddy soil diazotroph populations differed significantly among the four climate zones, mainly owing to differences in climate and soil pH. Structural equation models and automatic linear models revealed that climate and nutrients indirectly affected PNA by affecting soil pH and diazotroph community, respectively, while diazotroph community, C/P, and nifH gene abundance directly affected PNA. And C/P ratio, pH, and the diazotroph community structure were the main predictors of PNA in paddy soils. Collectively, the differences in diazotroph community structure have ecological significance, with important implications for the prediction of soil N2-fixing functions under climate change scenarios.","output":"Diazotrophic Community Variation Underlies Differences in Nitrogen Fixation Potential in Paddy Soils Across a Climatic Gradient in China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La pandemia del COVID-19 no solo ha afectado la salud pblica, tambin ha repercutido en la macro y micro economa.

The predicted common structural elements occur in the 3 end of a segment that is critical for internal ribosome binding, termed ribosome landing pad (RLP), of polioviruses. Base pairings between highly conserved 17-nucleotide (nt) and 21-nt sequences in the 5 UTR of human enteroviruses and rhinoviruses constitute a predicted pseudoknot that is significantly more stable than those that can be formed from a large set of randomly shuffled sequences. A conserved single-stranded polypyrimidine tract is located between two conserved tertiary elements. R. Nicholson, J. Pelletier, S.-Y. Le, and N. Sonenberg (1991, J. Virol. 65, 5886C5894) demonstrated that the point mutations of 3-nt UUU out of an essential 4-nt pyrimidine stretch sequence UUUC abolished translation. Structural analysis of the mutant sequence indicates that small point mutations within the short polypyrimidine sequence would destroy the tertiary interaction in the predicted, highly ordered structure. The proposed common tertiary structure can offer experimentalists a model upon which to extend the interpretations for currently available data. Based on these structural features possible base-pairing models between human enteroviruses and 18 S rRNA and between human rhinoviruses and 18 S rRNA are proposed.

The absence of specific biotherapeutics requires new strategies to prevent the spread and prophylaxis of the novel virus and its variants. The SARS-CoV-2 virus shows pathogenesis by entering the host cells via spike protein and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 receptor protein. Thus, the present study aims to compute the binding energies between a wide range of bacteriocins with receptor-binding domain (RBD) on spike proteins of wild type (WT) and beta variant (lineage B.1.351). Molecular docking analyses were performed to evaluate binding energies. Upon achieving the best bio-peptides with the highest docking scores, further molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to validate the structure and interaction stability. ProteinCprotein docking of the chosen 22 biopeptides with WT-RBD showed docking scores lower than ?7.9 kcal/mol. Pediocin PA-1 and salivaricin P showed the lowest (best) docking scores of ? 12 kcal/mol. Pediocin PA-1, salivaricin B, and salivaricin P showed a remarkable increase in the double mutants predicted binding affinity with ?13.8 kcal/mol, ?13.0 kcal/mol, and ?12.5 kcal/mol, respectively. Also, a better predicted binding affinity of pediocin PA-1 and salivaricin B against triple mutant was observed compared to the WT. Thus, pediocin PA-1 binds stronger to mutants of the RBD, particularly to double and triple mutants. Salivaricin B showed a better predicted binding affinity towards triple mutant compared to WT, showing that it might be another bacteriocin with potential activity against the SARS-CoV-2 beta variant. Overall, pediocin PA-1, salivaricin P, and salivaricin B are the most promising candidates for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 (including lineage B.1.351) entrance into the human cells. These bacteriocins derived from lactic acid bacteria hold promising potential for paving an alternative way for treatment and prophylaxis of WT and beta variants.

Although mortality is low, infection with IBV results in substantial losses for the egg and meat chicken industries. Despite the economic importance of IBV and decades of research into the pathogenesis of infection, significant gaps in our knowledge exist. The aim of this study was to compare the early progression of air sac lesions in birds receiving a vaccine strain of the virus or a more virulent field strain. The air sacs are lined by different types of epithelia and are relatively isolated from the environment, so they represent a unique tissue in which to study virus-induced lesions.

We found that the combination of treatment with bortezomib and CRT/E7(detox) DNA generated more potent E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses and better therapeutic effects against TC-1 tumors in tumor-bearing mice compared to monotherapy. Furthermore, we found that treatment with bortezomib led to increased apoptosis of TC-1 tumor cells and could render the TC-1 tumor cells more susceptible to lysis by E7-specific CD8+ T cells.

Both laparoscopic surgery and fast-track multimodal perioperative care have been reported to improve clinical recovery. However, objective measures supporting faster GI recovery are lacking. Therefore, GI transit was measured following open and laparoscopic colorectal surgery with or without fast-track care. METHODS Patients (n = 93) requiring elective colonic surgery were randomized to laparoscopic or conventional surgery with fast-track multimodal management or standard care, resulting in 4 treatment arms. Gastric emptying and colonic transit were scintigraphically assessed from days 1 to 3 in 78 patients and compared with clinical parameters such as time to tolerance of solid food and/or bowel movement and time until (ready for) discharge. RESULTS A total of 71 patients without mechanical bowel obstructions or surgical complications requiring intervention were available for analysis. No differences in gastric emptying 24 hours after surgery between the different groups were observed (P = .61). However, the median colonic transit of patients undergoing laparoscopic/fast-track care was significantly faster compared with the laparoscopic/standard, open/fast-track, and open/standard care groups. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that both laparoscopic surgery and fast-track care were significant independent predictive factors of improved colonic transit. Both were associated with significantly faster clinical recovery and shorter time until tolerance of solid food and first bowel movement. CONCLUSIONS Colonic transit recovers significantly faster after laparoscopic surgery and the fast-track program; laparoscopy and fast-track care lead to faster recovery of GI motility and improve clinical recovery.","output":"Faster recovery of gastrointestinal transit after laparoscopy and fast-track care in patients undergoing colonic surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Teaching laboratories are a highly complex environment that require students to master the following: technical skills, application of theory, safe working conditions, and teamwork.

The aim of this study was to investigate the management of cancer patients and oncological treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic and to describe the containment measures performed in ICS Maugeri outpatient clinic (Pavia, Italy). A comparison with the same period of the four previous years was performed. A significant reduction in access for therapy was seen between the year 2020 and 2019 but not between 2020 and 2018, 2017, or 2016. In 2020, the pandemic fear was the most common cause of treatment delay. Only few patients developed COVID-19. A significant reduction in radiological exams was found in 2020 versus all the other years considered. The low incidence of COVID-19 among our cancer patients, along with the hospital policy to control infection, enabled safe cancer treatment and a continuum of care in most patients. ABSTRACT: Lombardy was the first area in Italy to have an outbreak of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) at the beginning of 2020. In this context, cancer has been reported as a major risk factor for adverse outcomes and death, so oncology societies have quickly released guidelines on cancer care during the pandemic. The aim of this study was to investigate the management of cancer patients and oncological treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic and to describe the containment measures performed in our outpatient clinic at Pavia (Lombardy). A comparison with the same period of the four previous years (2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016) was also performed. Using our electronic databases, we evaluated the number and characteristics of patients accessing the hospital for anticancer drug infusion from 24 February, 2020 to 30 April, 2020 and the number of radiological exams performed. Although a significant reduction in access for therapy was seen when compared with 2019 (2590 versus 2974, access rate ratio (ARR) = 0.85, p < 0.001), no significant differences in access numbers and ARR was evident between 2020 and 2018, 2017, or 2016 (2590 versus 2626 (ARR = 0.07), 2660 (ARR = 0.99), and 2694 (ARR = 0.96), respectively, p > 0.05). In 2020, 63 patients delayed treatment: 38% for pandemic fear, 18% for travel restrictions, 13% for quarantine, 18% for flu syndrome other than COVID-19, and 13% for worsening of clinical conditions and death. Only 7/469 patients developed COVID-19.

The authors aimed to evaluate the results of LVMR in patients with internal rectal prolapse (IRP) external rectal prolapse (ERP). MATERIALS AND METHODS From September 2013 to January 2019, 122 patients with IRP (n=48) or ERP (n=74) underwent LVMR. Constipation and fecal incontinence (FI) scores were evaluated using the Cleveland Clinic Florida score preoperatively and postoperatively. The questionnaire for the change of obstructed defecation or FI symptoms after surgery was also administered to grade the results as cured, improved, unchanged, or worsened for each survey. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 61.9 years. The mean operation time was 116.5 minutes, and the mean hospital stay was 5.1 days. The mean follow-up was 42.1 months. There were no mesh-related complications. Eight patients (10.7%) among the ERP group required additional surgery for recurrent full-thickness prolapse. Eleven patients (14.7%) who had mucosal prolapse within 2 cm underwent stapled hemorrhoidopexy after LVMR. In the postoperative 6-month period, the overall constipation score (7.12) significantly improved compared with the preoperative score (13.03) (P<0.001), whereas the FI score significantly improved after surgery (12.16 to 8.92; P<0.001).

This was based on a community-orientated primary care approach and was a key strategy in limiting the spread of the pandemic, but it struggled with long turnaround times (TATs) for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test. The local experience at Symphony Way Community Day Centre (Delft, Cape Town), highlighted these challenges. The first positive tests had a median TAT of 4.5 days, peaking at 29 days in mid-May 2020. Issues that contributed to long TATs were unavailability of viral transport medium, sample delivery and storage difficulties, staffing problems, scarcity of testing supplies and other samples prioritised over CST samples. At Symphony Way, many patients who tested COVID-19 positive had abandoned their self-isolation because of the delay in results. Employers were unhappy with prolonged sick leave whilst waiting for results and patients were concerned about not getting paid or job loss. The CST policy relies on a rapid TAT to be successful. Once the TAT is delayed, the process of contacting patients, and tracing and quarantining contacts becomes ineffective. With hindsight, other countries' difficulties in upscaling testing should have served as warning. Community screening and testing was scaled back from 18 May 2020, and testing policy was changed to only include high-risk patients from 29 May 2020.

Understanding the relationships between health-system preparedness, responses to COVID-19, and the pattern of spread of the epidemic is particularly important in a country marked by wide inequalities in socioeconomic characteristics (eg, housing and employment status) and other health risks (age structure and burden of chronic disease). METHODS: From several publicly available sources in Brazil, we obtained data on health risk factors for severe COVID-19 (proportion of the population with chronic disease and proportion aged 60 years), socioeconomic vulnerability (proportions of the population with housing vulnerability or without formal work), health-system capacity (numbers of intensive care unit beds and physicians), coverage of health and social assistance, deaths from COVID-19, and state-level responses of government in terms of physical distancing policies. We also obtained data on the proportion of the population staying at home, based on locational data, as a measure of physical distancing adherence. We developed a socioeconomic vulnerability index (SVI) based on household characteristics and the Human Development Index. Data were analysed at the state and municipal levels. Descriptive statistics and correlations between state-level indicators were used to characterise the relationship between the availability of health-care resources and socioeconomic characteristics and the spread of the epidemic and the response of governments and populations in terms of new investments, legislation, and physical distancing. We used linear regressions on a municipality-by-month dataset from February to October, 2020, to characterise the dynamics of COVID-19 deaths and response to the epidemic across municipalities. FINDINGS: The initial spread of COVID-19 was mostly affected by patterns of socioeconomic vulnerability as measured by the SVI rather than population age structure and prevalence of health risk factors. The states with a high (greater than median) SVI were able to expand hospital capacity, to enact stringent COVID-19-related legislation, and to increase physical distancing adherence in the population, although not sufficiently to prevent higher COVID-19 mortality during the initial phase of the epidemic compared with states with a low SVI. Death rates accelerated until June, 2020, particularly in municipalities with the highest socioeconomic vulnerability. Throughout the following months, however, differences in policy response converged in municipalities with lower and higher SVIs, while physical distancing remained relatively higher and death rates became relatively lower in the municipalities with the highest SVIs compared with those with lower SVIs. INTERPRETATION: In Brazil, existing socioeconomic inequalities, rather than age, health status, and other risk factors for COVID-19, have affected the course of the epidemic, with a disproportionate adverse burden on states and municipalities with high socioeconomic vulnerability. Local government responses and population behaviour in the states and municipalities with higher socioeconomic vulnerability have helped to contain the effects of the epidemic. Targeted policies and actions are needed to protect those with the greatest socioeconomic vulnerability. This experience could be relevant in other low-income and middle-income countries where socioeconomic vulnerability varies greatly. FUNDING: None.

The Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP atzA determinant, an ATR chlorohydrolase important to the detoxification of ATR, was expressed as a fusion protein linked to the attachment domain of the BclA spore surface nap layer protein and expressed in B. thuringiensis Spores from this strain are decorated with AtzA N-terminally linked on the surface of the spores. The recombinant spores were assayed for ATR detoxification in liquid and soil environments and enzyme kinetics and stability were assessed. We successfully demonstrated the utility of this spore-based enzyme display system to detoxify ATR in water and laboratory soil samples.IMPORTANCEAtrazine is one of the most widely applied herbicides in the U.S. Midwestern states. The long environmental half-life of atrazine has contributed to the contamination of surface and ground water by atrazine and its chlorinated metabolites. The toxic properties of ATR have raised public health and ecological concerns. However, remediation of ATR by conventional approaches has proven to be costly and inefficient. We developed a novel B. thuringiensis spore platform system that is capable of long-term persistence in soil and can be engineered to surface express a high density of enzymes useful for bioremediation purposes. The enzymes are stably attached to the surface of the spore exosporium layer. The spore-based system will likely prove useful for remediation of other environmental pollutants, as well.","output":"A Bacillus Spore-Based Display System for Bioremediation of Atrazine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides sample classroom layouts that promote 6-foot social distancing during in-person education.

We conducted four surveys between April and August 2020 using the graph-based open-ended survey (GOS) framework, and investigated the most pressing concerns and issues for the general public in Japan. The GOS framework is a hybrid of the two traditional survey frameworks that allows respondents to post their opinions in a free-format style, which can subsequently serve as one of the choice items for other respondents, just as in a multiple-choice survey. As a result, this framework generates an opinion graph that relates opinions and respondents. We can also construct annotated opinion graphs to achieve a higher resolution. By clustering the annotated opinion graphs, we revealed the characteristic evolution of the response patterns as well as the interconnectedness and multi-faceted nature of opinions. Substantively, our notable finding is that social pressure, not infection risk, was one of the major concerns of our respondents. Social pressure refers to criticism and discrimination that they anticipate receiving from others should they contract COVID-19. It is possible that the collectivist nature of Japanese culture coupled with the governments policy of relying on personal responsibility to combat COVID-19 explains some of the above findings, as the latter has led to the emergence of vigilantes. The presence of mutual surveillance can contribute to growing skepticism toward others as well as fear of ostracism, which may have negative consequences at both the societal and individual levels.","output":"Graph-based open-ended survey on concerns related to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the psychological status and the attitudes toward the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine among anesthesiologists. We expected to analyze related factors and offer them some strategies to prevent and manage psychological issues under the post COVID-19 era. METHODS: Based on the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES), an online survey was designed and conducted among anesthesiologists in Shaanxi, China. Participants were asked to complete a validated questionnaire voluntarily. The following tests were performed: Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Primary Care Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Screen (PC-PTSD), and the attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: A total of 795 anesthesiologists completed the survey, the majority of them were female, young and middle-aged, well educated, and married. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in this sample were 26.5%, 35.5%, and 19.9%, respectively. Longer daily working time, concomitant basic chronic disease, and COVID-19 exposure were extracted as risk factors for the psychological symptoms, while vaccination, elder age, and married status were negatively associated with them. An unsatisfied vaccination rate (71.9%) which might be linked with inadequate awareness and perception of the COVID-19 vaccine was also detected in this study. CONCLUSION: Anesthesiologists are still under rising pressure of psychological symptoms in the post COVID-19 era.

Design/methodology/approach: This concluding article uses content analysis to re-visit the contributions made to assessing the impact of the pandemic and the implications for Caribbean cruise tourism. Findings: Governments across the Caribbean will need to re-think how they work with the cruise industry in a more cohesive and integrated way. This initiative is likely to result in the Caribbean having greater latitude in negotiations with the major cruise conglomerates that control over 80% of the industry in the region. Close attention must also be paid to improving local infrastructure and to facilitating the involvement of local people in providing tourists with an authentic Caribbean experience. Practical implications: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on the Caribbean region. In common with the rest of the world, island destinations had to close their borders to mitigate the impact of the virus and as tourism-dependent locations, this has had financial consequences. At present, there is no end in sight, and it is difficult to predict when Caribbean cruise tourism will ever return to pre-pandemic levels. Social implications: COVID-19 has shown the world that we are all dependent on each other and that greater collaboration is needed to re-open the cruise industry. The pandemic has also shown that rapid technological development is needed to drive change. Further, it can be argued that technology will enable all stakeholders to coordinate their responses, together with support from governments across the Caribbean. Originality/value: This theme issue explored the impact of COVID-19 on cruise tourism in the Caribbean and it proposes factors to mitigate re-occurrence.

Because they transport oxygen, red blood cells (RBCs) may play a role in the severity of hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients. The present study combines state-of-the-art metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics approaches to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on RBCs from 23 healthy subjects and 29 molecularly diagnosed COVID-19 patients. RBCs from COVID-19 patients had increased levels of glycolytic intermediates, accompanied by oxidation and fragmentation of ankyrin, spectrin beta, and the N-terminal cytosolic domain of band 3 (AE1). Significantly altered lipid metabolism was also observed, in particular, short- and medium-chain saturated fatty acids, acyl-carnitines, and sphingolipids. Nonetheless, there were no alterations of clinical hematological parameters, such as RBC count, hematocrit, or mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, with only minor increases in mean corpuscular volume. Taken together, these results suggest a significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on RBC structural membrane homeostasis at the protein and lipid levels. Increases in RBC glycolytic metabolites are consistent with a theoretically improved capacity of hemoglobin to off-load oxygen as a function of allosteric modulation by high-energy phosphate compounds, perhaps to counteract COVID-19-induced hypoxia. Conversely, because the N-terminus of AE1 stabilizes deoxyhemoglobin and finely tunes oxygen off-loading and metabolic rewiring toward the hexose monophosphate shunt, RBCs from COVID-19 patients may be less capable of responding to environmental variations in hemoglobin oxygen saturation/oxidant stress when traveling from the lungs to peripheral capillaries and vice versa.","output":"Evidence of Structural Protein Damage and Membrane Lipid Remodeling in Red Blood Cells from COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zika is an arbovirus infection mainly transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti.

Additionally, sepsis epidemiology has evolved. Early mortality has decreased, but many survivors now progress into chronic critical illness (CCI). This study sought to determine if there were significant differences in the host response and current epidemiology of surgical sepsis categorized by site of infection. STUDY DESIGN: This is a longitudinal study of surgical sepsis patients characterized by baseline predisposition, insult characteristics, serial biomarkers, hospital outcomes, and long-term outcomes. Patients were categorized into five anatomic sites of infection. RESULTS: The 316 study patients were predominantly Caucasian; half were male, with a mean age of 62 years, high comorbidity burden, and low 30-day mortality (10%). The primary sites were abdominal (44%), pulmonary (19%), skin/soft tissue (S/ST, 17%), genitourinary (GU, 12%), and vascular (7%). Most abdominal infections were present on admission and required source control. Comparatively, they had more prolonged proinflammation, immunosuppression, and persistent organ dysfunction. Their long-term outcome was poor with 37% CCI (defined as > 14 in ICU with organ dysfunction), 49% poor discharge dispositions, and 30% 1-year mortality. Most pulmonary infections were hospital-acquired pneumonia. They had similar protracted proinflammation and organ dysfunction, but immunosuppression normalized. Long-term outcomes are similarly poor (54% CCI, 47% poor disposition, 32% 1-year mortality). S/ST and GU infections occurred in younger patients with fewer comorbidities, less perturbed immune responses, and faster resolution of organ dysfunction. Comparatively, S/ST had better long-term outcomes (23% CCI, 39% poor disposition, 13% 1-year mortality) and GU had the best (10% CCI, 20% poor disposition, 10% 1-year mortality). Vascular sepsis patients were older males, with more comorbidities. Proinflammation was blunted with baseline immunosuppression and organ dysfunction that persisted. They had the worst long-term outcomes (38% CCI, 67% poor disposition, 57% 1-year mortality).

Overall, we find that, contrary to previous research, coverage and sentiment biases suggest equal public interest in female politicians. However, the results of the nominal and lexical analyses suggest this interest is not as professional or respectful as that expressed about male politicians. Female politicians are often named by their first names and are described in relation to their body, clothing, or family; this is a treatment that is not similarly extended to men.

A thematic analysis of 150 online documents identified paradigms and themes. The findings were discussed with expertise from the regions covered to review and validate the findings. Globally, comprehensive primary healthcare, whole-of-government and rights-based approaches have focused on social determinants and social agency to improve health as a basis for development. Biomedical, selective and disease-focused technology-driven approaches have, however, generally dominated, positioning health improvements as a result of macroeconomic growth. Traditional approaches in the three southern regions previously mentioned integrated reciprocity and harmony with nature. They were suppressed by biomedical, allopathic models during colonialism and by postcolonial neoliberal economic reforms promoting selective, biomedical interventions for highest-burden diseases, with weak investment in public health. In all three regions, holistic, sociocultural models and claims over natural resources re-emerged. In the 2000s, economic, ecological, pandemic crises and social inequality have intensified alliances and demand to address global, commercial processes undermining healthy societies, with widening differences between planetary health, integrating ecosystems and collective interests, and the coercive controls and protectionism in technology-driven and biosecurity-driven approaches. The trajectories point to a need for ideas and practice on healthy societies to tackle systemic determinants of inequities within and across countries, including to reclaim suppressed cultures; to build transdisciplinary, reflexive and participatory forms of knowledge that are embedded in and learn from action; and to invest in a more equitable circulation of ideas between regions in framing global ideas.

Cardiac inflammation and subsequent tissue damage is orchestrated by the infiltration and activation of various immune cells including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, mast cells, natural killer cells, and T and B cells into the myocardium. After tissue injury, monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages undergo marked phenotypic and functional changes, and function as key regulators of tissue repair, regeneration and fibrosis. Disturbance in resident macrophage functions such as uncontrolled production of inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and inefficient generation of an anti-inflammatory response or unsuccessful communication between macrophages and epithelial and endothelial cells and fibroblasts can lead to aberrant repair, persistent injury, and HF.

These efforts touch every level of the health system in the districtcommunity, primary care centers, hospitalincluding the establishment of the only RT-PCR lab for SARS-CoV-2 testing outside of the capital. Starting in March of 2021, a second wave of COVID-19 occurred in Madagascar, but there remain fewer cases in Ifanadiana than for many other diseases (e.g., malaria). At the Ifanadiana District Hospital, there have been two deaths that are officially attributed to COVID-19. Here, we describe the main components and challenges of this integrated response, the broad epidemiological contours of the epidemic, and how complex data sources can be developed to address many questions of COVID-19 science. Because of data limitations, it still remains unclear how this epidemic will affect rural areas of Madagascar and other developing countries where health system utilization is relatively low and there is limited capacity to diagnose and treat COVID-19 patients. Widespread population based seroprevalence studies are being implemented in Ifanadiana to inform the COVID-19 response strategy as health systems must simultaneously manage perennial and endemic disease threats.","output":"Integrating Health Systems and Science to Respond to COVID-19 in a Model District of Rural Madagascar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The incidence of gout has been rapidly increasing in recent years with the changing of diet. At present, modern medications used in the clinical treatment of gout showed several side effects, such as gastrointestinal damage and the increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The traditional Chinese prescription Simiao Powder (SMP) has a long history in the treatment of acute gouty arthritis (AGA) and has a good curative effect. However, the mechanism and target of its therapeutic effects are still not completely understood. METHODS: Potential active compounds (PACs) and targets of SMP were found in the TCMSP database, and the disease target genes related to AGA were obtained by searching CTD, DisGeNET, DrugBank, GeneCards, TTD, OMIM, and PharmGKB disease databases with acute gouty arthritis and Arthritis, Gouty as keywords, respectively. The network of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)-PACs-potential targets of acute gouty arthritis was constructed with the Cytoscape 3.7.2 software, and the target genes of acute gouty arthritis were intersected with genes regulated by active compounds of SMP. The resultant common gene targets were input into Cytoscape 3.7.2 software, and the BisoGenet plug-in was used to construct a PPI network. The GO functional enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the intersecting target proteins were performed using R software and corresponding program packages. The molecular docking verification was carried out between the potentially active compounds of SMP and the core target at the same time. RESULTS: 40 active components and 203 targets were identified, of which 95 targets were common targets for the drugs and diseases. GO function enrichment analysis revealed that SMP regulated several biological processes, such as response to lipopolysaccharide and oxidative stress, RNA polymerase II transcription regulator complex, protein kinase complex, and other cellular and molecular processes, including DNA-binding transcription factor binding. Results of KEGG pathway analysis showed that SMP was associated with AGA-related pathways such as interleukin-17 (IL-17), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), p53, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathways. The results of molecular docking showed that active compounds in SMP exhibited strong binding to five core protein receptors (TP53, FN1, ESR1, CDK2, and HSPA5). CONCLUSIONS: Active components of SMP, such as quercetin, kaempferol, wogonin, baicalein, beta-sitosterol, and rutaecarpine, showed therapeutic effects on AGA. These compounds were strongly associated with core target proteins (such as TP53, FN1, ESR1, CDK2, and HSPA5). This study reveals that IL-17, TNF, p53, and HIF-1 signaling pathways mediate the therapeutic effects of SMP on AGA. These findings expand our understanding of the mechanism of SMP in the treatment of AGA.","output":"Integrated Molecular Docking with Network Pharmacology to Reveal the Molecular Mechanism of Simiao Powder in the Treatment of Acute Gouty Arthritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients who infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), compared with the symptomatic infection patients, 2019-nCoV carried by asymptomatic infection patients are more likely to be widely spread due to secrecy and neglect, thus brings severe challenges to the current prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

The first relates to understanding the state of collective panic in Spain, France, and Italy. It is logical that fear of the pandemic should not turn into a state of collective panic in societies living under technologically advanced political systems, except in cases where these societies lack the basic elements on which social ties are based. Therefore, how do we understand the fragility of these social ties in European countries where mass panic is threatening daily life? The second sub-theme is related to the gestures and features of creating a new geopolitical map that has benefitted from the geopolitical retreat of the West to consolidate other political and regional alliances, mainly the Chinese initiative to tender aid to Italy at a time when other European countries turned their backs on and closed their borders with that European Union member state. How do we understand the contribution of the pandemic in forming new geopolitical alliances that could reset the balance of power in the world? We will observe the political behavior of countries that are supposed to be the first to have shown solidarity with Italy, Spain, and France, which are members of the European Union. We analyze the factors related to the erosion of the basis on which classical European society is based, where collective panic represents one of the manifestations of this disintegration. This panic, which was expressed in the rush to buy foodstuffs and the outbreak of a toilet paper buying fever that spread throughout Europe and the United States, saw shelves suddenly empty without a direct reason for this fact. Also, the study determines the relationship that binds these factors to the political disintegration expressed in the lack of solidarity from parts of the European Union with the three countries most affected by the pandemic. The second part of the study discusses how China will benefit from these political developments in the West with the prevalence of collective panic due to the pandemic, especially in the case of Italy, and how China is consolidating solidarity relations with these countries, drawing a map of new international political relations as part of its Silk Road project.

The pandemic SARS-Cov-2 outbreak necessitated the implementation of changes in everyday obstetric attendance, which demands continuity of care. Employment of sudden changes in obstetric attendance could have increased anxiety among medical personnel. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the Communication was to analyse the influence of professional experience on the level of anxiety in a group of midwives during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analysis included 100 midwives: average professional experience: 11.51 years (max. 36; median 7,5; SD: 10.37; p<0.0001). The largest group of respondents was employed in a tertiary referral hospital (n = 40), the smallest in a medical clinic (n = 7).

We report on nine lateral flow immunoassays currently available and compare their titer sensitivity in serum to a best-practice enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and viral neutralization assay. For a small group of PCR-positive, we found two lateral flow immunoassay devices with titer sensitivity roughly equal to the ELISA; these devices were positive for all PCR-positive patients harboring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. One of these devices was deployed in Northern Italy to test its sensitivity and specificity in a real-world clinical setting. Using the device with fingerstick blood on a cohort of 27 hospitalized PCR-positive patients and seven hospitalized controls, ROC curve analysis gave AUC values of 0.7646 for IgG. For comparison, this assay was also tested with saliva from the same patient population and showed reduced discrimination between cases and controls with AUC values of 0.6841 for IgG. Furthermore, during viral neutralization testing, one patient was discovered to harbor autoantibodies to ACE2, with implications for how immune responses are profiled. We show here through a proof-of-concept study that these lateral flow devices can be as analytically sensitive as ELISAs and adopted into hospital protocols; however, additional improvements to these devices remain necessary before their clinical deployment.","output":"Clinical Utility of a Highly Sensitive Lateral Flow Immunoassay as determined by Titer Analysis for the Detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies at the Point-of-Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two cell lines of human T lymphocytes (H9 and CEM) chronically infected with isolates of human or simian immunodeficiency viruses were examined by electron microscopy.

We sought to evaluate outcomes of delayed intubation and examine the ROX index (ie, [[Formula: see text]]/breathing frequency) to predict weaning from high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study of subjects with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and managed with HFNC. The ROX index was applied to predict HFNC success. Subjects that failed HFNC were divided into early HFNC failure (&#8804; 48 h of HFNC therapy prior to mechanical ventilation) and late failure (> 48 h). Standard statistical comparisons and regression analyses were used to compare overall hospital mortality and secondary end points, including time-specific mortality, need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and ICU length of stay between early and late failure groups. RESULTS: 272 subjects with COVID-19 were managed with HFNC. One hundred sixty-four (60.3%) were successfully weaned from HFNC, and 111 (67.7%) of those weaned were managed solely in non-ICU settings. ROX index >3.0 at 2, 6, and 12 hours after initiation of HFNC was 85.3% sensitive for identifying subsequent HFNC success. One hundred eight subjects were intubated for failure of HFNC (61 early failures and 47 late failures). Mortality after HFNC failure was high (45.4%). There was no statistical difference in hospital mortality (39.3% vs 53.2%, P = .18) or any of the secondary end points between early and late HFNC failure groups.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate urological patient satisfaction with teleconsultation during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, prospective, cross-sectional, non-interventional study carried out by telephone survey during the period considered as the peak of the pandemic (March-April 2020). A quality survey composed of 11 questions on urological care provided by physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted, selecting a representative sample of patients attended by teleconsultation. RESULTS: Two hundred patients were contacted by telephone to answer a survey on the quality of teleconsultation. The distribution of patients surveyed among the specialized consultations was homogeneous with the number of consultations cited in the period; 18% of them required assistance from family members. Sixty percent of patients avoided going to a medical center during the pandemic. Of the surveyed patients, 42% had cancelled diagnostic tests, 59% had cancelled medical consultations, 3.5% had cancelled treatments and 1% had cancelled interventions. Ten percent reported a worsening of urological symptoms during confinement. According to physicians, consultations were effectively delivered in 72% of cases, with teleconsultation being carried out by their usual urologist in 81%.

Nevertheless, there is still much to know. Understanding its mechanisms and its potential usefulness in airway infections and its prevention, asthma both Th2 and non Th2 type, bronchiectasis, as adjuvant in vaccination and in allergen immunotherapy still remains to clearly unveil. The aim of this paper was to provide a useful updated review of the role of the main available immunostimulants, giving particular focus on Pidotimod use and its potentials utility in respiratory diseases. Pidotimod showed its usefulness in reducing need for antibiotics in airway infections, increasing the level of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG) and T-lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+) endowed with immunomodulatory activity that affect both innate and adaptive immune responses. Higher expression of TLR2 and of HLA-DR molecules, induction of dendritic cell maturation and release of pro-inflammatory molecules, stimulation of T lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation toward a Th1 phenotype, as well as an increase of the phagocytosis have been demonstrated to be associated with Pidotimod in in vitro studies. All these activities are potentially useful for several respiratory conditions such as asthma, COPD, and recurrent respiratory tract infections.","output":"Immunostimulants in respiratory diseases: focus on Pidotimod"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the early tracheostomy on operated patients with severe head injury.

Whereas in most cases COVID-19 is asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic, extremely severe clinical forms are observed. In this case, complex immune dysregulations and an excessive inflammatory response are reported and are the main cause of morbidity and mortality. Natural killer cells are key players in the control of viral infection, and their activity is regulated by a tight balance between activating and inhibitory receptors; an alteration of NK activity was suggested to be associated with the development of severe forms of COVID-19. In this study, we analyzed peripheral NK cell subpopulations and the expression of activating and inhibitory receptors in 30 patients suffering from neurological conditions who recovered from mild, moderate, or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, comparing the results to those of 10 SARS-CoV-2-uninfected patients. Results showed that an expansion of NK subset with lower cytolytic activity and an augmented expression of the 2DL1 inhibitory receptor, particularly when in association with the C2 ligand (KIR2DL1-C2), characterized the immunological scenario of severe COVID-19 infection. An increase of NK expressing the ILT2 inhibitory receptor was instead seen in patients recovering from mild or moderate infection compared to controls. Results herein suggest that the KIR2DL1-C2 NK inhibitory complex is a risk factor toward the development of severe form of COVID-19. Our results confirm that a complex alteration of NK activity is present in COVID-19 infection and offer a molecular explanation for this observation.

METHODS Outcomes of 17 patients who underwent liver RFA for 27 metastatic GIST after TKI therapy, from January 2004 to March 2012, were retrospectively analyzed. Mean maximum tumor diameter was 2.5  1 cm (range 0.9-4.5 cm). In seven patients (group A), RFA of all residual tumors was performed, with curative intent, and TKI therapy was discontinued. In five patients (group B), RFA of all residual tumors was performed upon achieving the best morphological response with TKI therapy, which was maintained after RFA. In another five patients (group C), RFA was performed on individual liver metastases which were progressive under TKI therapy. RESULTS All 27 targeted tumors were completely ablated, without local recurrence during the mean follow-up period of 49 months. No major complications occurred. Two minor complications were reported (11 %). Only two patients (both in group C) died at 20 and 48 months. Two-year progression-free survival (PFS) after RFA was 29 % in group A, 75 % in group B, and 20 % in group C. CONCLUSIONS RFA in patients, previously treated with TKI, is feasible and safe. Our data suggest that RFA is a useful therapeutic option in patients with metastatic GIST and should be performed at the time of best clinical response with patient maintained under TKI after the procedure.","output":"A role for adjuvant RFA in managing hepatic metastases from gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) after treatment with targeted systemic therapy using kinase inhibitors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Members of the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network (DCVMN) have been actively engaged in the development of COVID-19 vaccine candidates.

Once successful candidates have been identified there will be a need for large scale vaccine manufacturing and supply, in which DCVMN member manufacturers can play a key role. In an internal survey in 2019, DCVMN members reported the capability to supply over 3.5 billion vaccine doses annually, and the provision of over 50 distinct vaccines to 170 countries. To describe the capabilities of DCVMN member manufacturers more precisely, a 121-question survey was circulated to 41 Network members. The survey assessed the manufacturers capabilities in utilizing various technology platforms, cell cultures and filling technologies, in addition to their capacities for manufacturing drug products. The survey also evaluated manufacturers preparedness to dedicate existing capacities to COVID-19 vaccine production. Results revealed that sampled manufacturers have strong capabilities for manufacturing vaccines based on recombinant technologies, particularly with mammalian cells, and microbial and yeast expression systems. Capabilities in utilizing cell cultures were distributed across multiple cell types, however manufacturing capacities with Vero and CHO cells were prominent.

METHODS: We have modeled the mortality and the intensive care unit (ICU) requirement for the care of patients with cancer infected with COVID-19 in Latin America. A dynamic multistate Markov model was constructed. Transition probabilities were estimated on the basis of published reports for cumulative probability of complications. Basic reproductive number (R0) values were modeled with R using the EpiEstim package. Estimations of days of ICU requirement and absolute mortality were calculated by imputing number of cumulative cases in the Markov model. RESULTS: Estimated median time of ICU requirement was 12.7 days, median time to mortality was 16.3 days after infection, and median time to severe event was 8.1 days. Peak ICU occupancy for patients with cancer was calculated at 16 days after infection. Deterministic sensitivity analysis revealed an interval for mortality between 18.5% and 30.4%. With the actual incidence tendency, Latin America would be expected to lose approximately 111,725 patients with cancer to SARS-CoV-2 (range, 87,116-143,154 patients) by the 60th day since the start of the outbreak. Losses calculated vary between < 1% to 17.6% of all patients with cancer in the region.

Ample evidence shows resistance and balance training can prevent falls in older adults;however, there is a paucity of evidence regarding exercise on fall prevention in the older cancer population, who often have unique risk factors for falls. Given the new reality of the COVID-19 pandemic, minimizing group gatherings and its associated risks is imperative for older patients, who are a vulnerable population. This study sought to investigate the feasibility of an 8-week, virtual exercise program and its preliminary effects on lower body strength and balance in community-dwelling cancer patients. Methods: Study participants were recruited for this pretest-posttest intervention study using consecutive sampling over a one-year period from the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton, Alberta. The intervention entailed leg muscle strengthening and balance training exercises that progressed in difficulty as outlined by the Otago program, and involved a virtual component (facilitated live by a certified exercise physiologist via Zoom meeting platform once a week) and independent at-home training component (twice a week). Lower body strength and balance were assessed using the 5-times chair-stand and the 4- stage balance test, respectively, and were analyzed using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Results: Twenty-seven older patients (mean age 70.1, range 65-76) participated. The most common cancer sites were breast (48%) and prostate (41%). One participant withdrew due to personal reasons unrelated to the program. The remaining 26 participants completed the intervention. Attendance rate for the virtual component was 97.6% and independent component 84.7%. Participants perceived the program as rewarding and enjoyable (100%), felt this program prepared them to exercise on their own (92%), were confident to continue exercising on their own (81%), and would recommend the program to other patients (100%). At baseline, 33% (n = 9) 1 fall over the past 6 months. A statistically significant improvement in lower body strength was detected post-intervention (p =.001), whereas no difference was detected in balance (p =.059). Conclusions: This virtual, hybrid resistance and balance training program was feasible, overwhelmingly accepted by our older participants, and appeared effective in improving lower body strength. Findings from this study may have potential to inform design of a larger, randomized multi-site study.","output":"Feasibility of a virtual hybrid resistance and balance training program for older patients with cancer and its preliminary effects on lower body strength and balance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic hit South Africa in March 2020, severely disrupting health services and health education. This fundamentally impacted the training of future health professionals and catalysed a significant response from across the health education sector. In 2020, the South African Association of Health Educationalists requested members to submit reflections on different aspects of their COVID-19 related educational responses. RESPONDING TO THE PANDEMIC: Seven vignettes focused specifically on clinical training in the context of primary care and family medicine. This short report highlights the key insights that emerged from these vignettes, considering what has been learnt in terms of health professions education and what we need to take forward. These insights include building on what was already in place, the student role, technology in the clinical learning context, taking workshops online, vulnerability and presence and the way going forward. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The contributions emphasised the value of existing relationships between the health services and training institutions, collaboration and transparent communication between stakeholders when navigating a crisis, responsiveness to the changed platform and dynamic environment and aligning teaching with healthcare needs. It is more important than ever to set explicit goals, have clarity of purpose when designing learning opportunities and to provide support to students. Some of these learning points may be appropriate for similar contexts in Africa.

Stakeholders opinions about these ethical issues are important since they can help in the development of ethical guidelines to govern biobanking activities. Physicians are among the important stakeholders since they contact potential participants and could be biobank users. The goal of this study is to evaluate the perceptions and attitude of Egyptian physicians towards ethical issues in biobanking. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was designed and distributed with the target group between November 2019 and January 2020. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 223 physicians. While 65.5% reported hearing the term \\"Biobanking\\" before, 45.7% knew that there are biobanks in Egypt. Participants had a general positive attitude towards the value of biobanks in research. About 73% agreed that biobanks can share biospecimens with international research organizations, but only 42.6% supported collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, and 44% agreed to the use of user fees by biobanks. About 48% supported the use of broad consent in biobanks, and 73.1% believed that donors of biospecimens should be informed about results of research performed on their biospecimens. CONCLUSION: Although many Egyptian physicians heard about biobanking, they had limited knowledge about the existence of biobanks in Egypt. They had concerns about commercialization, use of broad consent and user fees. A knowledge gap exists among these stakeholders, which should be covered by different educational activities.

Many of these models assume homogeneous mixing in the underlying population. However, contact rates and mixing patterns can vary dramatically among individuals depending on their age and activity level. Variation in contact rates among age groups and over time can significantly impact how well a model captures observed trends. To properly model the age-dependent dynamics of COVID-19 and understand the impacts of interventions, it is essential to consider heterogeneity arising from contact rates and mixing patterns. We developed an age-structured model that incorporates time-varying contact rates and population mixing computed from the ongoing BC Mix COVID-19 survey to study transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Using a Bayesian inference framework, we fit four versions of our model to weekly reported cases of COVID-19 in BC, with each version allowing different assumptions of contact rates. We show that in addition to incorporating age-specific contact rates and mixing patterns, time-dependent (weekly) contact rates are needed to adequately capture the observed transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Our approach provides a framework for explicitly including empirical contact rates in a transmission model, which removes the need to otherwise model the impact of many non-pharmaceutical interventions. Further, this approach allows projection of future cases based on clear assumptions of age-specific contact rates, as opposed to less tractable assumptions regarding transmission rates.","output":"Mathematical modeling of COVID-19 in British Columbia:an age-structured model with time-dependent contact rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in huge numbers of serious morbidity and mortality that overwhelmed emergency departments (EDs) worldwide. Here in New York City, we experienced a case fatality rate of 12.2% between March 21, 2020 and May 20, 2020. Once the initial wave subsided, we noted that our ED census was unusually low. In order to avoid cutting staff in response to that ominous trend, we explored the reassignment of staff in order to improve our ED operations. We chose the model of triage liaison physician (TLP), an efficient method of improving patient throughput. This would allow us to maintain staff that might otherwise by furloughed or lost permanently. Study Objectives: We present the results of our departmental performance improvement (PI) initiative, focusing on the metric of door-to-provider time (DPT). Methods: We obtained IRB approval to analyze data from our ED dashboard. We focused on data from ten weeks before the initiation of the TLP to 24 weeks thereafter. We restricted the data to include only patients who arrived between 10:00 AM and 2:00 AM, as those were the hours where a TLP was on duty. We measured median DTP times and created run charts and control charts to demonstrate how the TPL affected the DTP metric. The control chart was our way of determining if any improvement was a process that could be sustainable. Results: For the ten-week period prior to the initiation of the TLP, median DPT was 18 minutes. After initiation of the TLP, our median DTP was 7 minutes. This apparent improvement was supported by a run chart that showed the dramatic decrease, and by a control chart that showed the stability of the new TLP process. Conclusion: Our data suggest that reassigning an attending physician to the role of TPL allows an ED to retain valuable attending physicians while also improving patient safety metrics such as DTP. Future research should focus on other potential benefits of the TLP, such as revenue generated by reducing patients who leave without being seen, earlier detection of sepsis and stroke, and reduced dwell times in the ED.

The present study investigated the short-term effects of continuous stretching and rest-induced rebound on vascular endothelial function in hypertensive patients. Methods: This study was conducted as a single-arm prospective interventional study including patients between 30 and 70 years of age undergoing treatment for hypertension from October 2019 until May 2021.

Staple line leakage, as the most frequent and most feared complication, is still a major concern. METHODS Since 2005 data from patients undergoing bariatric procedures in Germany have been prospectively registered in an online database and analyzed. All patients who had undergone primary SG within a 7-year period were considered for analysis. RESULTS Using the German Bariatric Surgery Registry, data from more than 11,800 SGs were collected between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2013. Staple line leak rate decreased from 6.5% to 1.4%. Male sex, higher body mass index, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation time, a combination of buttresses and oversewing, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications were associated with a significantly higher leakage rate compared with when using either buttresses or oversewing alone. On multivariable analysis, operation time and year of procedure only had a significant impact on staple line leakage rate. CONCLUSIONS Owing to the growing experience a constant decrease in the leakage rate after SG has been observed. Staple line disruption may still lead to sepsis, multiorgan dysfunction, and increased mortality. The results of the current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of leakage and which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, select patients more carefully, and offer closer follow-up during the postoperative course with early recognition and adequate treatment.","output":"Results of More Than 11,800 Sleeve Gastrectomies: Data Analysis of the German Bariatric Surgery Registry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Filipino people are known for their strong religious faith.

Comparison of one's basal metabolic rate (BMR) to the average BMR of one's chronological age group gives the Metabolic age. Higher metabolic age of younger population is a serious concern and a key factor that leads to metabolic disorders in all age groups. Slower metabolism is a symbol of older age. Higher metabolic age indicates poor metabolism and higher risk of getting diseases and health complications later in life. Therefore, aging faster metabolically can severely impact chronological age. People with obesity and diabetes suffered the most due to current ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 patients with concomitant metabolic diseases had higher risk of worse prognosis and mortality.

This study aimed to characterize social inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in S?o Paulo, the most populous city in Brazil and Latin America. METHODS: We conducted a population-based study, including COVID-19 deaths among S?o Paulo residents from March to September 2020. Age-standardized mortality rates and unadjusted rate ratios (RRs) [with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs)] were estimated by race, sex, age group, district of residence, household crowding, educational attainment, income level and percentage of households in subnormal areas in each district. Time trends in mortality were assessed using the Joinpoint model. RESULTS: Males presented an 84% increase in COVID-19 mortality compared with females (RR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.79-1.90). Higher mortality rates were observed for Blacks (RR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.67-1.88) and mixed (RR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.37-1.47) compared with Whites, whereas lower mortality was noted for Asians (RR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.58-0.68). A positive gradient was found for all socio-economic indicators, i.e. increases in disparities denoted by less education, more household crowding, lower income and a higher concentration of subnormal areas were associated with higher mortality rates. A decrease in mortality over time was observed in all racial groups, but it started earlier among Whites and Asians. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal striking social inequalities in COVID-19 mortality in S?o Paulo, exposing structural inequities in Brazilian society that were not addressed by the governmental response to COVID-19. Without an equitable response, COVID-19 will further exacerbate current social inequalities in S?o Paulo.","output":"Social inequalities and COVID-19 mortality in the city of S?o Paulo, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The irrational use of antibiotics has led to a high emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria. The traditional overuse of antibiotics in the animal feed industry plays a crucial role in the emergence of these pathogens that pose both economic and health problems. In addition, antibiotics have also recently experienced an increase to treat companion animal infections, promoting the emergence of MDR bacteria in pets, which can reach humans. Phages have been proposed as an alternative for antibiotics for the treatment of livestock and companion animal infections due to their multiple advantages as adaptative drugs, such as their ability to evolve, to multiply at the site of infections, and their high specificity. Moreover, phage-derived enzymes may also be an interesting approach. However, the lack of regulation for this type of pharmaceutical hinders its potential commercialization. In this review, we summarize the main recent studies on phage therapy in livestock and companion animals, providing an insight into current advances in this area and the future of treatments for bacterial infections.","output":"Phage Therapy in Livestock and Companion Animals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"School-based nutrition education and gardening programs are found to positively affect nutrition knowledge and healthy eating behaviors in children.

The aim of this study was to analyze the cause of intraoperative hemorrhage and to explore therapeutic strategies. METHODS Retrospective review was performed of 53 consecutive patients with DAVF treated by Onyx embolization between February 2009 and December 2014. Tentorial DAVF with pial arterial supply was diagnosed in 6 patients (2 women and 4 men; mean age, 47.3 years  10.2), and transarterial Onyx embolization was performed in these patients. Fisher exact test was used to analyze differences of incidence of procedure-related complications. RESULTS Intraoperative hemorrhage occurred in 2 of 6 patients with pial arterial supply. One patient died as a result of hemorrhage, and the other patient survived after craniotomy. The incidence of complications for these 6 patients (2 of 6; 33.3%) was significantly higher (P = 0.0309) compared with patients with DAVF without pial arterial supply (1 of 47; 2.1%). CONCLUSIONS Pial arterial supply may be a risk factor for intraoperative hemorrhage during transarterial embolization of DAVF through dural feeders.

The present study aimed to investigate the psychological distress (anxiety and mood symptoms) and changes in routine among Italian primary and middle school students during the COVID-19 quarantine. Methods: : This qualitative interview study was performed between the 18th of May and 7th of June 2020: it involved a sample of 82 children and adolescents living in Milan (Italy), attending primary and middle school (aged 6 to 14 years), and their parents. Results: Almost 30% of the subjects reported having struggled to adjust to home learning. 36 responders completely changed their dietary habits during the lockdown: they were not eating the same amount of food and were consuming more junk food. Sleep habits were also affected by the lockdown measures: 28% of the sample had difficulties sleeping and wished to sleep in their parents bed. Concerning psychological distress, 64 (78%) children and adolescents had anxiety symptoms;43.9% of the students reported significant mood symptoms. Conclusions: Children are not indifferent to the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 epidemic: our data confirm their difficulties in adapting to the quarantine measures. The effects of stress exposure may not manifest later on during the childrens development, and, for this reason, it would be interesting to follow up on these participants to improve our understanding of how long these outcomes may last.","output":"Interviewing children: the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on childrens changes in routine and psychological distress."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyses the magnitude of the spatial transmission of COVID\\\\19 through the municipalities of the region of Madrid during the first pandemic wave using a spatial contagion index.

The genomic RNA of the virus population (JHM-CC virus) released from different passage levels of the same persistent infection has also been analyzed. The analysis shows the locations within the genomic and intracellular RNAs of more than 45 T1-resistant oligonucleotides and confirm earlier studies (J. L. Leibowitz, K. C. Wilhelmsen, and C. W. Bond (1981), Virology 114, 39C51), showing that the six subgenomic RNAs of MHV-JHM form a 3 coterminal nested set which extends for different lengths in a 5 direction. The analysis also identifies in each subgenomic RNA those large T1 oligonucleotides derived from noncontiguous regions of the genome during mRNA synthesis. Two important conclusions can be reached from analysis of the mutant viruses. First, the virus population released from the persistent infection represents a fairly constant mixture of viruses, and the fluctuating emergence of variants as predominant species in the culture does not occur. Second, the data indicate that for particular intracellular RNAs of mutant viruses the sequence rearrangements occurring during subgenomic mRNA synthesis are different from those in the corresponding intracellular RNA of wild-type virus. The result may indicate a potential flexibility in the leader/body fusion process that has not been previously recognized.","output":"Analysis of genomic and intracellular viral RNAs of small plaque mutants of mouse hepatitis virus, JHM strain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although in heart failure (HF) there is a strict correlation between heart and kidney, no data are available on the potential relationship in HF between renal dysfunction (RD) and the impaired sympathetic innervation.

Two hundred and sixty-three patients with mild-to-severe HF underwent iodine-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy to assess sympathetic innervation, evaluating early and late heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratios and washout rate. In all patients, glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula was assessed. A direct association was found between EPI-eGFR and late H/M (r = .215; P < .001). Dividing the population into moderate-to-severe eGFR reduction and normal-to-mildly reduced eGFR (cutoff  60 mLmin-11.73 m-2), a statistically significant reduction of late H/M value was found in patients with RD compared to patients with preserved eGFR (P = .030). By multivariable linear regression analysis, eGFR resulted in the prediction of impaired late H/M in patients with RD (P = .005). Patients with RD and HF show more impaired cardiac sympathetic activity than HF patients with preserved renal function, and reduced eGFR is a predictor of reduced late H/M.","output":"Renal function and cardiac adrenergic impairment in patients affected by heart failure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The application of disinfection is becoming popular in recent months due to the COVID-19.

However, RHD cure and preventative measures are inextricably linked with socioeconomic development, as the disease mainly affects children and young adults living in poverty. In order to address RHD, public health officials and health policymakers require up-to-date knowledge on the epidemiology of GAS, ARF and RHD, as well as the existing enablers and gaps in delivery of evidence-based care for these conditions. We propose to conduct a systematic review to assess the literature comprehensively, synthesising all existing quantitative and qualitative data relating to RHD in Africa. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We plan to conduct a comprehensive literature search using a number of databases and reference lists of relevant articles published from January 1995 to December 2015. Two evaluators will independently review and extract data from each article. Additionally, we will assess overall study quality and risk of bias, using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme criteria for quantitative and qualitative studies, respectively. We will meta-analyse estimates of prevalence, incidence, case fatality and mortality for each of the conditions separately for each country. Qualitative meta-analysis will be conducted for facilitators and barriers in RHD health access. Lastly, we will create a list of key stakeholders.

Our study was designed to identify high-risk areas of Delta VOC contamination in the hospital and provide suggestions to in-hospital infection control. We analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 Delta VOC contamination in the air and environmental surface samples collected from a hospital in Nanjing, China. Methods We collected data on clinical features, laboratory tests, swab tests, and hospital wards, identified the factors associated with environmental contamination, and analyzed patients' hygiene behaviors during hospitalization. Results A total of 283 environmental surface and air samples were collected from a hospital admitting 36 COVID-19 patients. Twelve swab samples from ten patients were positive. Toilet seats had the highest contamination rate (11.8%), followed by bedside tables (8.2%), garbage bins (5.9%), and bedrails (1.6%). The median time of symptom onset to surface sampling was shorter in the positive environment group than in the negative environment group (11 vs. 18 days; P=0.001). The results indicated that environmental surface contamination was associated with positive anal swabs [odds ratio (OR) 27.183; 95% CI: 2.359-226.063; P=0.003] and the time from symptom onset to surface sampling (OR 0.801; 95% CI: 0.501-0.990; P=0.046). The survey revealed that 33.3% of the patients never cleaned or disinfected their bedside tables or toilets, and 8.3% of them only cleaned their bedside tables or toilets. More than half of the patients often (25%) or always (30.6%) put the used masks on their bedside tables. Only 16.7% of the patients threw the masks into the specific garbage bin for used masks. Conclusions The SARS-CoV-2 Delta VOC was detected on environmental surfaces, especially toilet seats and bedside tables, within a median time of 11 days after symptom onset. Our study provided potential predictors for environmental surface contamination, including positive anal swabs and the time from symptom onset to sampling.

Our study aims to assess whether ACEi/ARB use in patients with COVID-19 conferred worsened severity of illness or increased mortality. Additionally, we explore the possibility of an unearthed protective benefit due to their interruption of the RAS signaling pathway as observed in cardiovascular diseases. Methods The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched for studies relevant to COVID-19 severity, mortality, and inflammation in the context of ACEi/ARB use. Eight studies were included with a total of 17,943 patients, 4,292 (23.9%) of which were taking an ACEi or an ARB. The study population was 47.9% female and the average age across all studies was 65. The studies chosen had a sample size of at least 100 patients. Results Mortality outcomes were assessed in six studies and showed no significant difference in mortality among the ACEi/ARB and control groups (odds ratio [OR]: 0.99, 95%CI: 0.48-2.04). Seven studies assessed the severity of COVID-19 and showed no statistically significant difference in disease severity when comparing the ACEi/ARB group to the control group (odds ratio [OR]: 1.30, 95% CI 0.87-1.94). Four studies reported the length of stay with no significant difference between the ACEi/ARB groups as compared to non-users. Four studies included inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-Dimer, which were noted to be consistently lower in the ACEi/ARB groups when compared to control groups, however, this was not statistically significant. Conclusion Our study found no significant difference in mortality, severity of illness, or length of stay between ACEi/ARB users and non-users with COVID-19 infection. These results support the continuation of ACEi and ARBs in the setting of COVID-19 as advised by the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA).

Persistent seizures are associated with a 20% to 40% risk of bodily injuries (eg, fractures, burns, concussions) over 12-month follow-up. The primary goal of epilepsy treatment is to eliminate seizures while minimizing adverse effects of antiseizure drugs (ASDs). Observations: An epileptic seizure is defined as a sudden occurrence of transient signs and symptoms caused by abnormal and excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. Focal and generalized epilepsy are the 2 most frequent types of epilepsy; diagnosis is based on the type of seizures. There are 26 US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for epilepsy, of which 24 have similar antiseizure efficacy for focal epilepsy and 9 have similar efficacy for generalized epilepsy. The decision to initiate an ASD should be individualized, but should be strongly considered after 2 unprovoked seizures or after 1 unprovoked seizure that occurred during sleep and/or in the presence of epileptiform activity on an electroencephalogram and/or in the presence of a structural lesion on the brain magnetic resonance imaging. The ASDs must be selected based on the seizure and epilepsy types, the epilepsy syndrome, and the adverse effects associated with the drug. For focal epilepsy, oxcarbazepine and lamotrigine are first-line therapy, while levetiracetam can be also considered if there is no history of psychiatric disorder. For generalized epilepsy, the selection of the ASD is based on the type of epilepsy syndrome and the patient's sex, age, and psychiatric history. Seizure freedom is achieved in approximately 60% to 70% of all patients. A total of 25% to 50% of patients also experience neurologic, psychiatric, cognitive, or medical disorders, such as mood, anxiety, and attention deficit disorders and migraines. For these patients, selecting an ASD should consider the presence of these disorders and concomitant use of medications to treat them. ASDs with cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducing properties (eg, carbamazepine, phenytoin) may worsen comorbid coronary and cerebrovascular disease by causing hyperlipidemia and accelerating the metabolism of concomitant drugs used for their treatment. They can also facilitate the development of osteopenia and osteoporosis. Conclusions and Relevance: Epilepsy affects approximately 65 million people worldwide and is associated with increased rates of bodily injuries and mortality when not optimally treated. For focal and generalized epilepsy, selection of ASDs should consider the seizure and epilepsy types and epilepsy syndrome, as well as the patient's age and sex, comorbidities, and potential drug interactions.","output":"Antiseizure Medications for Adults With Epilepsy: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Clinical prediction models/scores help clinicians make optimal evidence-based decisions when caring for their patients.

Studies reporting development or validation of multivariable prognostic models predicting recurrent stroke within 90 days in patients with TIA or minor stroke were included. Included studies were appraised for reporting quality and conduct using a select list of items from the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Statement. RESULTS After screening 7026 articles, 60 eligible articles were retained, consisting of 100 derivation and validation studies of 27 unique prediction models. Four models were newly derived while 23 were developed by validating and updating existing models. Of the 60 articles, 15 (25%) reported an informative title. Among the 100 derivation and validation studies, few reported whether assessment of the outcome (24%) and predictors (12%) was blinded. Similarly, sample size justifications (49%), description of methods for handling missing data (16.1%), and model calibration (5%) were seldom reported. Among the 96 validation studies, 17 (17.7%) clearly reported on similarity (in terms of setting, eligibility criteria, predictors, and outcomes) between the validation and the derivation datasets. Items with the highest prevalence of adherence were the source of data (99%), eligibility criteria (93%), measures of discrimination (81%) and study setting (65%). CONCLUSIONS The majority of derivation and validation studies for the prognosis of recurrent stroke in TIA and minor stroke patients suffer from poor reporting quality. We recommend that all prediction model derivation and validation studies follow the TRIPOD statement to improve transparency and promote uptake of more reliable prediction models in practice.

We attempted to quantify this around the Tristan da Cunha archipelago Marine Protected Area. Its shallows (<1000 m depth) are varied and productive. The 5.4 km2 of kelp stores ~60 tonnes of carbon (tC) and may export ~240 tC into surrounding depths. In deep-waters we analysed seabed data collected from three research cruises, including seabed mapping, camera imagery, seabed oceanography and benthic samples from mini-Agassiz trawl. Rich biological assemblages on seamounts significantly differed to the islands and carbon storage had complex drivers. We estimate ~2.3 million tC are stored in benthic biodiversity of waters <1000 m, which includes >0.22 million tC that can be sequestered (the proportion of the carbon captured that is expected to become buried in sediment or locked away in skeletal tissue for at least 100 years). Much of this carbon is captured by cold-water coral reefs as a mixture of inorganic (largely calcium carbonate) and organic compounds. As part of its 2020 Marine Protection Strategy, these deep-water reef systems are now protected by a full bottom-trawling ban throughout Tristan da Cunha and representative no take areas on its seamounts. This small United Kingdom Overseas Territory's reef systems represent approximately 0.8 Mt CO2 equivalent sequestered carbon; valued at >24 Million GBP (at the UN shadow price of carbon). Annual productivity of this protected standing stock generates an estimated 3 million worth of sequestered carbon a year, making it an unrecognized and potentially major component of the economy of small island nations like Tristan da Cunha.

We sought to conduct a systematic review to summarize what is known about long term sequelae among patients who were hospitalized for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: We conducted a search in MEDLINE and MedRxiv through December 15, 2020, using the search terms: COVID-19, Constitutional symptoms, COVID- 19 Sequelae, Long-term COVID-19 and Respiratory symptoms. Articles were evaluated independently by two authors. We then extracted to perform a quantitative synthesis of available evidence and scored studies for quality using the NIH quality assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Results: We identified 12 studies: nine published articles and three preprints. We obtained data for 4693 patients: 11 studies included hospitalized patients, 8 included ICU patients and 5 included outpatients. Follow-up time ranged from 16 days to 122 days post-hospitalization. The pooled prevalence of persistent constitutional and respiratory symptoms was: (45.6%), dyspnea (35.5%), cough (26.4%), joint pain (26.8%), myalgia (23.3%), headache (22.2%), and chest pain (20.5%). Heterogeneity across studies was high (I2&gt;90%). Chinese studies reported a lower frequency of persistent symptoms compared with studies carried out in Western countries (e.g., France, Italy, USA, UK). There were no significant differences in long-term sequelae between ICU and non-ICU patients. Conclusion: The prevalence of persistent constitutional and respiratory symptoms in patients infected with COVID-19 is high.

METHODS: Using the HF clinic database, we compared data of patients with HF before, during, and after the peak of the pandemic (January 1 to March 17 [pre-COVID], March 17 to May 31 [peak-COVID], and June 1 to October 1 [post-COVID]). During peak-COVID, all patients were managed by Tele-HFC or hospitalization. After June 1, patients chose either a face-to-face clinic visit or a continuous tele-clinic visit. RESULTS: Cardiovascular death and medical titration rates were similar in peak-COVID compared with all other periods. HF readmission rates were significantly lower in peak-COVID (8.7% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001) and slightly increased (3.5%) post-COVID. Heart transplant rates were substantially increased in post-COVID (4.5% vs. peak-COVID [0%], p = 0.002). After June 1, 38% of patients continued with the Tele-HFC program. Patients managed by the Tele-HFC program for <6 months were less likely to have HF with reduced ejection fraction (73% vs. 54%, p = 0.005) and stage-D HF (33% vs. 14%, p = 0.001), and more likely to achieve the target neurohormonal blockade dose (p<0.01), compared with the &#8805;6-month Tele-HFC group. CONCLUSIONS: HF rehospitalization and transplant rates significantly declined during the pandemic in ambulatory care of HF. However, reduction in these rates did not affect subsequent 5-month hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality in the setting of Tele-HFC program and continuum of advanced HF therapies.","output":"The impact of the coronavirus disease and Tele-Heart Failure Clinic on cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitalization in ambulatory patients with heart failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Viewpoint proposes that universal respiratory precautions in the operating roomuse of respirators with face masks and eye protectioncould protect staff from possible coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and facilitate resumption of elective surgeries canceled during the first wave of the pandemic [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of JAMA: Journal of the American Medical Association is the property of American Medical Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Surgery in a Time of Uncertainty: A Need for Universal Respiratory Precautions in the Operating Room"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages in the United States due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019, two models of N95 respirators were evaluated for reuse after gamma radiation sterilization. Gamma sterilization is attractive for PPE reuse because it can sterilize large quantities of material through hermetically sealed packaging, providing safety and logistic benefits. The Gamma Irradiation Facility at Sandia National Laboratories was used to irradiate N95 filtering facepiece respirators to a sterilization dose of 25 kGy(tissue). Aerosol particle filtration performance testing and electrostatic field measurements were used to determine the efficacy of the respirators after irradiation. Both respirator models exhibited statistically significant decreases in particle filtering efficiencies and electrostatic potential after irradiation. The largest decrease in capture efficiency was 40-50% and peaked near the 200 nm particle size. The key contribution of this effort is correlating the electrostatic potential change of individual filtration layer of the respirator with the decrease filtration efficiency after irradiation. This observation occurred in both variations of N95 respirator that we tested.

Our objective was to assess longitudinal changes in enrollees employment and student status after implementation of Michigans Medicaid expansion. METHODS: Longitudinal telephone survey of Michigan Medicaid expansion enrollees in 2016 (response rate [RR] = 53.7%), 2017 (RR = 83.4%), and 2018 (N = 2,608, RR = 89.4%) serially assessing self-reported employment or student status. Survey responses were benchmarked against statewide changes in assessed similar low-income adults in the U.S. Census Bureau Current Population Survey. We used mixed models with individual random effects to assess changes in the proportion of enrollees who were employed or students by year. RESULTS: Most respondents had incomes < 100% FPL (61.7% with 0C35% of the federal poverty level [FPL], 22.9% with 36C99% FPL, and 15.4% with 100C133% FPL), 89.3% had at least a high school diploma/equivalent, and they ranged in age (39.6% age 19C34, 34.5% age 35C50, 25.9% age 51C64). Employment or student status increased significantly among Michigan Medicaid expansion respondents, from 54.5% in 2016 to 61.4% in 2018 (P < 0.001), including among those with a chronic condition (47.8% to 53.8%, P < 0.001) or mental health/substance use disorder (48.5% to 56.0%, P < 0.001).

Study 1 examined characteristics of performing arts professionals work and health, and investigated how these relate to standardized measures of wellbeing. Study 2 examined the effects of the lockdown on work and wellbeing in the respondents own words. Findings from Study 1 indicate a substantial reduction in work and income. 53% reported financial hardship, 85% reported increased anxiety, and 63% reported being lonelier than before the crisis. 61% sought support on finances while only 45% did so on health and wellbeing. Multiple regression analyses, using the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Social Connectedness Scale, and Three-Item Loneliness Scale as outcome variables, indicate that perceived financial hardship was associated with lower wellbeing and higher depression and loneliness scores. Higher self-rated health was associated with higher wellbeing and lower depression scores. More physical activity before lockdown was associated with higher wellbeing and social connectedness scores, as well as lower loneliness scores, and an increase in physical activity during lockdown compared with before, as well as older age, were associated with higher wellbeing and social connectedness scores, and lower depression and loneliness scores. Thematic inductive analysis of 341 open responses in Study 2 identified five overarching themes characterizing the effects of Lockdown 1.0: lost or uncertain work and income, including canceled work, financial concerns, and uncertainties for the future; constraints of lockdown working, including challenges of working at home, struggles with online work and skill maintenance, and caring responsibilities; loss and vulnerability, including reduced social connections, lack of support, vulnerability, feelings of loss and grief, and concern for others; detrimental effects on health and wellbeing, including anxiety, low or unstable mood, poorer physical health, and lack of motivation; and professional and personal opportunities, including coping well or living more healthily, more time and less pressure, new possibilities and activities, enhanced social connections, and new skills.

METHODS We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis. The search was carried out in 5 bibliographic databases and in ClinicalTrials.gov. No restriction on language or date of publication was applied. This was complemented by references of the studies found and studies of evidence synthesis, manual search of abstracts of relevant congresses/scientific meetings and contact with experts. We included primary studies (observational, quasi-experimental and experimental studies) on parents of children with CA reporting the outcome quality of life (primary outcome) of parents, independently of the intervention/exposure studied. RESULTS We included 75 studies (35 observational non-comparatives, 31 observational comparatives, 4 quasi-experimental and 5 experimental studies). We identified 27 different QoL instruments. The two most frequently used individual QoL instruments were WHOQOL-Bref and SF-36. Relatively to family QoL tools identified, we emphasized PedsQL FIM, IOFS and FQOL. Non-syndromic congenital heart defects were the CA most frequently studied. Through the analysis of comparative studies, we verified that parental and familial QoL were impaired in this population.

However, it is not clear which of Chinese herbs are critical for the treatment of HCC. Besides, mechanisms of CCHs in the treatment of HCC remain unclear. Hence, our goal is to identify the core Chinese herbs (CCHs) for treating HCC and explore their antitumor mechanism. METHODS: Firstly, clinical traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescriptions for HCC were collected from Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, and then, data mining software was used to identify CCHs. After that, bioactive compounds and corresponding target genes of CCHs were obtained using three TCM databases, and target genes of HCC were acquired from MalaCards and OMIM. Subsequently, common target genes of CCHs and HCC were screened. Moreover, biological functions and pathways were analyzed, and Cytoscape plugin cytoHubba was used to identify hub genes. Finally, prognostic values of hub genes were verified by survival analysis, and the molecular docking approach was utilized to validate the interactions between targets and bioactive compounds of CCHs. RESULTS: Eight CCHs were determined from 630 prescriptions, and 100 bioactive compounds (e.g., quercetin and luteolin) and 126 common target genes were screened. Furthermore, common target genes of CCHs and HCC were mainly enriched in cancer-associated pathways, and six hub genes with statistical significance in survival analysis were selected as key target genes for molecular docking. Additionally, molecular docking showed that the bioactive compounds docked well with the protein receptors of key target genes. CONCLUSION: By combining data mining, network pharmacology, molecular docking, and survival analysis methods, we found that CCHs may play a therapeutic role in HCC through regulating the target genes and pathways related to cancer occurrence and development, angiogenesis, metastasis, and prognosis.","output":"Systematically Exploring the Antitumor Mechanisms of Core Chinese Herbs on Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Computational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: At the time of this writing, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak has already put tremendous strain on many countries' citizens, resources, and economies around the world. Social distancing measures, travel bans, self-quarantines, and business closures are changing the very fabric of societies worldwide. With people forced out of public spaces, much of the conversation about these phenomena now occurs online on social media platforms like Twitter. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we describe a multilingual COVID-19 Twitter data set that we are making available to the research community via our COVID-19-TweetIDs GitHub repository. METHODS: We started this ongoing data collection on January 28, 2020, leveraging Twitter's streaming application programming interface (API) and Tweepy to follow certain keywords and accounts that were trending at the time data collection began. We used Twitter's search API to query for past tweets, resulting in the earliest tweets in our collection dating back to January 21, 2020. RESULTS: Since the inception of our collection, we have actively maintained and updated our GitHub repository on a weekly basis. We have published over 123 million tweets, with over 60% of the tweets in English.

Objective To compare the rate of ischemic stroke between patients with COVID-19 and patients with influenza, a respiratory viral illness previously associated with stroke. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study was conducted at 2 academic hospitals in New York City, New York, and included adult patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with COVID-19 from March 4, 2020, through May 2, 2020. The comparison cohort included adults with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with influenza A/B from January 1, 2016, through May 31, 2018 (spanning moderate and severe influenza seasons). Exposures COVID-19 infection confirmed by evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the nasopharynx by polymerase chain reaction and laboratory-confirmed influenza A/B. Main Outcomes and Measures A panel of neurologists adjudicated the primary outcome of acute ischemic stroke and its clinical characteristics, mechanisms, and outcomes. We used logistic regression to compare the proportion of patients with COVID-19 with ischemic stroke vs the proportion among patients with influenza. Results Among 1916 patients with emergency department visits or hospitalizations with COVID-19, 31 (1.6%; 95% CI, 1.1%-2.3%) had an acute ischemic stroke. The median age of patients with stroke was 69 years (interquartile range, 66-78 years); 18 (58%) were men. Stroke was the reason for hospital presentation in 8 cases (26%). In comparison, 3 of 1486 patients with influenza (0.2%; 95% CI, 0.0%-0.6%) had an acute ischemic stroke. After adjustment for age, sex, and race, the likelihood of stroke was higher with COVID-19 infection than with influenza infection (odds ratio, 7.6; 95% CI, 2.3-25.2). The association persisted across sensitivity analyses adjusting for vascular risk factors, viral symptomatology, and intensive care unit admission. Conclusions and Relevance In this retrospective cohort study from 2 New York City academic hospitals, approximately 1.6% of adults with COVID-19 who visited the emergency department or were hospitalized experienced ischemic stroke, a higher rate of stroke compared with a cohort of patients with influenza.

The consequences are serious; leading to negative impacts on health decisions, including vaccine acceptance, and on trust in immunization advice from public health and/or healthcare professional. This article provides a brief overview of evidence-based strategies to address vaccine deniers in public, in clinical practice and in social situations. As well, a strategy to help differentiate between vaccine deniers and simple vaccine refusers in a practice or clinic is provided. Five tactics are widely used by vaccine deniers: conspiracy; fake experts; selectivity; impossible expectations; and misrepresentation and false logic. Recognizing and understanding these tactics can help protect against misinformation and science denialism propaganda. Highlighting the strong medical science consensus on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines also helps. Carefully and wisely choosing what to say and speaking up-whether you are at a dinner party, out with friends or in your medical office or clinic-is crucial.

A short region between the replicase gene and open reading frame (ORF) 2 of the equine arteritis virus (EAV) genome was previously assumed to be untranslated. However, here we report that this segment of the EAV genome contains the 5' part of a novel gene (ORF 2a) which is conserved in all arteriviruses. The 3' part of EAV ORF 2a overlaps with the 5' part of the former ORF 2 (now renamed ORF 2b), which encodes the GS glycoprotein. Both ORF 2a and ORF 2b appear to be expressed from mRNA 2, which thereby constitutes the first proven example of a bicistronic mRNA in arteriviruses. The 67-amino-acid protein encoded by EAV ORF 2a, which we have provisionally named the envelope (E) protein, is very hydrophobic and has a basic C terminus. An E protein-specific antiserum was raised and used to demonstrate the expression of the novel gene in EAV-infected cells. The EAV E protein proved to be very stable, did not form disulfide-linked oligomers, and was not N-glycosylated.

Knowledge on the role of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was not available. Methods: The study included all the cases reported from March 8 - May 31, 2020. Individuals with a history of international or domestic travel from high burden states, Influenza-like Illness or Severe Acute Respiratory Illness and high-risk contacts of COVID-19 cases were included. Detailed analysis based on contact tracing data available from the line-list of state surveillance unit was performed using cluster network analysis software. Findings: Amongst the 3404 COVID-19 positive cases, 3096 (91%) were asymptomatic while 308 (9%) were symptomatic. Majority of asymptomatic cases were in the age range of 16 and 45 years while symptomatic cases were between 31 and 65 years. Mortality rate was especially higher among middle-aged and elderly cases with co-morbidities, 34/38 (894%). Cluster network analysis of 822 cases indicated that the secondary attack rate, size of the cluster and superspreading events were higher when the source case was symptomatic as compared to an asymptomatic. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that both asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases transmit the infection, although symptomatic cases were the main driving force within the state during the beginning of the pandemic. Considering the large proportion of asymptomatic cases, their ability to spread infection cannot be overlooked. Notwithstanding the limitations and bias in identifying asymptomatic cases, the findings have major implications for testing policies. Active search, early testing and treatment of symptomatic elderly patients with comorbidities should be prioritized for containing the spread of COVID-19 and reducing mortality.

This essay, written in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021 vigilante anti-democratic white supremacist assault on the US Capitol, calls attention to the two-edged sword of data at play, reflecting long histories of support for and opposition to white supremacy and scientific racism. As illustrated by both past and present examples, including COVID-19, at issue are both the non-use (Edge #1) and problematic use (Edge #2) of data on racialized groups. Recognizing that structural problems require structural solutions, in this essay I propose a new two-part institutional mandate regarding the reporting and analysis of publicly-funded work involving racialized groups and health data and documentation as to why the proposed mandates are feasible. Proposal/part 1 is to implement enforceable requirements that all US health data sets and research projects supported by government funds must explicitly explain and justify their conceptualization of racialized groups and the metrics used to categorize them. Proposal/part 2 is that any individual-level health data by membership in racialized groups must also be analyzed in relation to relevant data about racialized societal inequities. A new opportunity arises as US government agencies re-engage with their work, out of the shadow of white grievance politics cast by the Trump Administration, to move forward with this structural proposal to aid the work for health equity.","output":"Structural Racism, Health Inequities, and the Two-Edged Sword of Data: Structural Problems Require Structural Solutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral macrodomains possess the ability to counteract host ADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification implicated in the creation of an antiviral environment via immune response regulation. This brought them into focus as promising therapeutic targets, albeit the close homology to some of the human macrodomains raised concerns regarding potential cross-reactivity and adverse effects for the host. Here, we evaluate the structure and function of the macrodomain of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. We show that it can antagonize ADP-ribosylation by PARP14, a cellular (ADP-ribosyl)transferase necessary for the restriction of coronaviral infections. Furthermore, our structural studies together with ligand modelling revealed the structural basis for poly(ADP-ribose) binding and hydrolysis, an emerging new aspect of viral macrodomain biology. These new insights were used in an extensive evolutionary analysis aimed at evaluating the druggability of viral macrodomains not only from the Coronaviridae but also Togaviridae and Iridoviridae genera (causing diseases such as Chikungunya and infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus disease, respectively).

In this questionnaire study, we aimed to analyze potential barriers and patients health beliefs during and after the lockdown early 2020 in a tertiary referral center in Kiel, Germany. METHODS: Patients admitted for the treatment of urgent ophthalmic diseases between March 1st, 2020, and June 3rd, 2020, were asked to participate in a questionnaire study. After informed consent was obtained, patients were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire which addressed aspects of their medical history, their health beliefs concerning the COVID-19 pandemic and barriers on their way to the treatment center. The study group was subdivided into two subgroups, depending on the occurrence of their symptoms, before and after the lockdown was ended on April 20th, 2020. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were included, 43 in subgroup A (before April 20th) and 50 in subgroup B (April 20th or later). Retinal disorders were the most common causes for admission (approximately 60%).. Only 8 patients (8.6%) experienced a delay between their decision to visit a doctor until the actual examination. Every fourth patient was afraid of a COVID-19 infection, and expected a higher likelihood for an infection at the hospital. Patients with comorbidities tended to be more likely to be afraid of an infection (correlation coefficient 0.183, p = 0.0785) and were significantly more likely to be concerned about problems with organizing follow-up care (corr. Coefficient 0.222, p = 0.0328). Higher age was negatively correlated with fear of infection (corr. Coefficient ? 0.218, p-value 0.034). CONCLUSION: In this questionnaire study, only a minority of patients indicated a delay in treatment, regardless of whether symptoms occurred before or after the lockdown before April 20th, 2020. While patients with comorbidities were more concerned about infection and problems during follow-up care, patients of higher age C who have a higher mortality C were less afraid.

There is currently not enough data in favour of danger or benefit from corticosteroids in COVID-19, so until this matter is resolved it is advisable to limit their indications to the most serious clinical pictures for which it is well established that this type of treatment has a positive impact on the progression of symptoms. In Grade V and VI Bell's palsy according to the House-Brackmann grading system, a weeks course of oral corticosteroids is recommended. Corticosteroid therapy is also recommended in cases of sudden hearing loss of more than 60 dB, either in the form of intratympanic injections or a weeks course of oral medication. In rhinology, there is no indication for systemic corticosteroid therapy in the current situation. However, patients are advised to continue with their local corticosteroid therapy in the form of a nasal spray or by inhalation.

Currently, in Germany >140 000 cases of COVID-19 are confirmed. Here we report a nosocomial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the pediatric dialysis unit of the University Hospital Mnster (UHM). METHODS Single-step real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs was used to diagnose the index patient and identify infected contacts. Epidemiological links were analyzed by patient interviews and medical record reviews. In addition, each contact was assessed for exposure to the index case and monitored for clinical symptoms. Cycle threshold (Ct) values of all positive test results were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. RESULTS Forty-eight cases were involved in this nosocomial outbreak. Nine contact cases developed laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections. Two SARS-CoV-2-positive cases remained clinically asymptomatic. Eleven cases reported flulike symptoms without positive results. Ct values were significantly lower in cases presenting typical COVID-19 symptoms, suggesting high viral shedding (P = .007). CONCLUSIONS Person-to-person transmission was at the heart of a hospital outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 between healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients in the pediatric dialysis unit at UHM. Semiquantitative rRT-PCR results suggest that individuals with high viral load pose a risk to spread SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital setting. Our epidemiological observation highlights the need to develop strategies to trace and monitor SARS-CoV-2-infected HCWs to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in the hospital setting.","output":"First Reported Nosocomial Outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in a Pediatric Dialysis Unit."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This piece is an invitation.

The extensive time commitment required of athletic trainers working in this setting has been identified as a precursor to work-family conflict (WFC) and work-family guilt (WFG). Though individualized, experiences in the work-life interface can largely be impacted by organizational factors (i.e., elements specific to the workplace). While staff size and patient load may influence the athletic trainer's feelings of WFC and WFG, these factors have not been directly studied. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to examine organizational factors and experiences of WFC and WFG among collegiate athletic trainers. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Collegiate setting. PARTICIPANTS: 615 (female=391, gender variant/non-conforming=1, male=222, preferred not to answer=1) athletic trainers responded to an online survey. The average age of participants was 33  9 years, and they were BOC certified for 10  8 years. 352 participants (57.2%) worked in the DI setting, 99 in DII (16.1%), and 164 in DIII (26.7%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Participants responded to demographic and workplace characteristic questions (organizational infrastructure, staff size, and number of varsity-level athletic teams). Individuals completed WFC and WFG scales that have been previously validated and used in the athletic trainer population. RESULTS: Work-family conflict and WFG were universally experienced among our participants with WFC scores predicting WFG scores. Participants reported higher time-based conflict than strain or behavior-based conflict. No significant differences in WFC and WFG scores were found between organizational infrastructures. Weak positive correlations were found between staff size and WFC scores and WFG scores. The number of athletic teams was not associated with WFC or WFG scores. CONCLUSIONS: Organizational factors are an important component of the work-life interface. From an organizational perspective, focusing on improving work-life balance for the athletic trainer can help mitigate experiences with WFC and WFG.","output":"Collegiate Athletic Trainers' Experiences with Work-family Conflict and Work-family Guilt Based Upon Organizational Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have read with great interest Dr Estbanez article regarding the case of a 28-year-old woman affected by COVID-19, presenting confluent erythematous-yellowish papules at both heels.

As most of the immune checkpoint inhibitors are new to the market, it is important to conduct studies using real-world data sources to investigate their safety profiles. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to develop a framework for signal detection and filtration of novel irAEs for 6 Food and Drug Administration-approved immune checkpoint inhibitors. METHODS: In our framework, we first used the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) standardized in an Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) common data model (CDM) to collect immune checkpoint inhibitor-related event data and conducted irAE signal detection. OHDSI CDM is a standard-driven data model that focuses on transforming different databases into a common format and standardizing medical terms to a common representation. We then filtered those already known irAEs from drug labels and literature by using a customized text-mining pipeline based on clinical text analysis and knowledge extraction system with Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) as a dictionary. Finally, we classified the irAE detection results into three different categories to discover potentially new irAE signals. RESULTS: By our text-mining pipeline, 490 irAE terms were identified from drug labels, and 918 terms were identified from the literature. In addition, of the 94 positive signals detected using CDM-based FAERS, 53 signals (56%) were labeled signals, 10 (11%) were unlabeled published signals, and 31 (33%) were potentially new signals. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that our approach is effective for irAE signal detection and filtration. Moreover, our CDM-based framework could facilitate adverse drug events detection and filtration toward the goal of next-generation pharmacovigilance that seamlessly integrates electronic health record data for improved signal detection.","output":"Detecting and Filtering Immune-Related Adverse Events Signal Based on Text Mining and Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics Common Data Model: Framework Development Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The fact that multiple sclerosis (MS) predominantly affects women has been recognized for many years.

METHODS: Based on a case report and the literature, the authors present a management strategy for infectious MCI during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and distinguish it from traumatic MCI deployment tactics. RESULTS: This management strategy can be divided into three phases, beginning with the acute emergency response including triage, stabilization of critical patients, and transport of patients requiring hospitalization. Phase 2 involves securing the facility's operational readiness, or housing residents elsewhere in case staff are infected or quarantined to a relevant degree. Phase 3 marks the return to regular operations. DISCUSSION: Phase 1 is based on usual MCI principles, phase 2 on hospital crisis management. Avoiding evacuation of residents to relieve hospitals is an important operational objective. The lack of mission and training experience with such situations, the limited applicability of established triage algorithms, and the need to coordinate a large number of participants pose challenges.

The RCTs compared some formulation of tea tree oil to another treatment or no treatment. Included participants were both men and women, ranging from 39 to 55 years of age. All RCTs were assessed at unclear or high risk of bias in one or more domains. We also identified two RCTs that are ongoing or awaiting publications. Data from three RCTs that reported a short-term mean change in the number of Demodex mites per eight eyelashes contributed to a meta-analysis. We are uncertain about the mean reduction for the groups that received the tea tree oil intervention (mean difference [MD] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24 to 1.16) at four to six weeks as compared to other interventions. Only one RCT reported data for long-term changes, which found that the group that received intense pulse light as the treatment had complete eradication of Demodex mites at three months. We graded the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as very low. Three RCTs reported no evidence of a difference for participant reported symptoms measured on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) between the tea tree oil group and the group receiving other forms of intervention. Mean differences in these studies ranged from -10.54 (95% CI - 24.19, 3.11) to 3.40 (95% CI -0.70 7.50). We did not conduct a meta-analysis for this outcome given substantial statistical heterogeneity and graded the certainty of the evidence as low. One RCT provided information concerning visual acuity but did not provide sufficient data for between-group comparisons. The authors noted that mean habitual LogMAR visual acuity for all study participants improved post-treatment (mean LogMAR 1.16, standard deviation 0.26 at 4 weeks). We graded the certainty of evidence for this outcome as low. No RCTs provided data on mean change in number of cylindrical dandruff or the proportion of participants experiencing conjunctival injection or experiencing meibomian gland dysfunction. Three RCTs provided information on adverse events. One reported no adverse events. The other two described a total of six participants randomized to treatment with tea tree oil who experienced ocular irritation or discomfort that resolved with re-educating the patient on application techniques and continuing use of the tea tree oil. We graded the certainty of the evidence for this outcome as very low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current review suggests that there is uncertainty related to the effectiveness of 5% to 50% tea tree oil for the short-term treatment of Demodex blepharitis; however, if used, lower concentrations may be preferable in the eye care arena to avoid induced ocular irritation. Future studies should be better controlled, assess outcomes at long term (e.g. 10 to 12 weeks or beyond), account for patient compliance, and study the effects of different tea tree oil concentrations.","output":"Tea tree oil for Demodex blepharitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Substantial strategies to reduce clinical documentation were implemented by health care systems throughout the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic at national and local levels. This natural experiment provides an opportunity to study the impact of documentation reduction strategies on documentation burden among clinicians and other health professionals in the United States. Objectives The aim of this study was to assess clinicians' and other health care leaders' experiences with and perceptions of COVID-19 documentation reduction strategies and identify which implemented strategies should be prioritized and remain permanent post-pandemic. Methods We conducted a national survey of clinicians and health care leaders to understand COVID-19 documentation reduction strategies implemented during the pandemic using snowball sampling through professional networks, listservs, and social media. We developed and validated a 19-item survey leveraging existing post-COVID-19 policy and practice recommendations proposed by Sinsky and Linzer. Participants rated reduction strategies for impact on documentation burden on a scale of 0 to 100. Free-text responses were thematically analyzed. Results Of the 351 surveys initiated, 193 (55%) were complete. Most participants were informaticians and/or clinicians and worked for a health system or in academia. A majority experienced telehealth expansion (81.9%) during the pandemic, which participants also rated as highly impactful (60.1C61.5) and preferred that it remain (90.5%). Implemented at lower proportions, documenting only pertinent positives to reduce note bloat (66.1  28.3), c hanging compliance rules and performance metrics to eliminate those without evidence of net benefit (65.7  26.3), and electronic health record (EHR) optimization sprints (64.3  26.9) received the highest impact scores compared with other strategies presented; support for these strategies widely ranged (49.7C63.7%). Conclusion The results of this survey suggest there are many perceived sources of and solutions for documentation burden. Within strategies, we found considerable support for telehealth, documenting pertinent positives, and changing compliance rules. We also found substantial variation in the experience of documentation burden among participants.","output":"Clinician and Health Care Leaders' Experiences withand Perceptions ofCOVID-19 Documentation Reduction Policies and Practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reporting on the weather may seem at first glance to be a very light story, but it can actually be a serious reflection of how we see ourselves and our changing perception of the world.

Moreover, the actual acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination and associated factors remain uncertain among health care students in Northwest China. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of a sample of 631 health care students was performed using a questionnaire developed through Wen Juan Xing survey platform to collect information regarding their attitudes, beliefs, and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the association between vaccination willingness and demographics, attitudes, and beliefs to determine the factors that actually effect acceptance and hesitancy of COVID-19 vaccine among health care students. Results: Overall, 491 (77.81%) students actually received the COVID-19 vaccine, and of the 140 unvaccinated, 69 were hesitant and 71 rejected. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the actually vaccinated individuals were those who mostly believed in the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine (OR = 2.94, 95%CI: 1.37, 6.29), those who mostly felt it is their responsibility to receive the vaccine to protect others from infection (OR = 2.75, 95%CI: 1.45, 5.23), with less previous experience about other vaccines (OR = 1.70, 95%CI: 1.06, 2.72), students who mostly thought COVID-19 to be very severe (OR = 1.77, 95%CI: 1.07, 2.93), and students who mostly thought the COVID-19 vaccine was one of the best protection measures (OR = 1.68, 95%CI: 1.03, 2.76). Concerns about side effects of vaccines (OR = 0.30, 95%CI: 0.18, 0.51) and the use of personal protective behavior as an alternative to the COVID-19 vaccination (OR = 0.16, 95%CI: 0.06, 0.39) hindered the vaccine acceptance. Conclusions: Our study showed higher COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among healthcare students. However, the individuals with vaccine hesitancy and rejection were still worrying. Vaccine safety and effectiveness issues continue to be a major factor affecting students' acceptance.

The study was based on 17 patients who at a retrospective search have been found to have a monoinfection with herpes simplex virus. The diagnosis was established by isolation of the virus from material obtained during fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) which also included broncho-alveolar lavage and tissue sampling. Fourteen patients had a chest radiograph performed within 24 h of the date of the FOB. Two radiographs showed no abnormalities of the lung parenchyma. The radiographs of the other 12 patients showed lung opacification, predominantly lobar or more extensive and always bilateral. Most patients presented with a mixed airspace and interstitial pattern of opacities, but 11 of 14 showed at least an airspace consolidation. Lobar, segmental, or subsegmental atelectasis was present in 7 patients, and unilateral or bilateral pleural effusion in 8 patients, but only in 1 patient was it a large amount. In contradiction to the literature which reports a high correlation between HSVP and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 11 of 14 patients did not meet the pathophysiological criteria for ARDS. The radiologist may suggest the diagnosis of HSVP when bilateral airspace consolidation or mixed opacities appear in a susceptible group of patients who are not thought to have ARDS or pulmonary edema.

METHODS The clinical data and the diagnostic results of 108 cases of SARS were retrospectively reviewed according to the MHC criteria. RESULTS There were 55 men and 53 women, with a median age of 34.5 years (range, 12 - 78 years). The interval between their first visit and clinical diagnosis was 3 days (range, 0 - 14 days). The diagnosis was made at the first visit in 7 (6.5%, 7/108) cases with a history of exposure to SARS patients and infiltrates on chest radiograph. Eighty-nine (82.4%) and 12 (11.1%) patients were categorized as probable cases and suspected cases respectively at their first visit and a clinical diagnosis of SARS was made subsequently. The interval between first visit and reaching the final diagnosis was 1 - 3 days in 72 (66.7%) cases and 4 days in 29 (26.9%) cases. The final diagnosis was made in 0 - 14 days (median, 2 days) for those (n = 59, 54.6%) with a history of close contact with SARS patients and 2 - 8 days (median, 3 days) for those (n = 49, 45.4%) living in Beijing but without such a history (P = 0.03). The chest radiograph was interpreted as unremarkable in 26 (24.1%) cases at their first visit, and the diagnosis was made in 4 days (range 2 - 8 days), which was significantly longer compared with other cases (P < 0.001). In patients without a history of close contact with SARS patients, all the five criteria were met after combination antibiotic therapy had failed. CONCLUSIONS A chest radiograph without infiltrates at the early stage of SARS is an important factor responsible for delayed diagnosis. In patients without a history of close contact with SARS cases, antibiotic effect was a major factor influencing doctors' diagnosis.","output":"Clinical diagnostic approach to severe acute respiratory syndrome: an institution's experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines suggest testing for respiratory viruses during the influenza season, but are unclear which categories of patients on the intensive care unit (ICU) should be tested.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study in consecutive CAP and HAP patients with an ICU stay of more than 24 h in two tertiary care hospitals in The Netherlands, from 2011 to December 2013. The proportion of patients receiving diagnostic testing with PCR for the presence of respiratory viruses in respiratory tract specimens was determined. RESULTS: In total, 1452 patients were included, of which 712 patients presented with CAP and 740 with HAP. In CAP, 282 of 712 (40%) were tested for respiratory viruses (190 of 417 (46%) during the influenza season). In HAP, 95 of 740 (13%) were tested (50 of 372 (13%) during the influenza season). Regardless of the season, virus diagnostic tests were ordered significantly more often in patients with comorbidities, and in those presenting with elevated CRP and leucopenia. In patients who were tested during the influenza season, the prevalence of influenza was 14% in patients with CAP and 10% in those with HAP. Influenza was absent during the summer in both groups.

Analysis of the results of kinetics-based competitive ELISA (K-cELISA) among these six enhancing MAbs grouped the epitopes into two clusters. Because transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and FIPV are so closely related antigenically, we also conducted K-cELISA experiments between the FIPV MAbs and TGEV S protein-specific MAbs for which the epitopes had previously been mapped to specific sites on the TGEV S protein. Results of these assays indicated that the two FIPV epitope clusters are homologues of the previously defined TGEV S protein sites A and E/F. In addition, two TGEV S protein-specific MAbs also induced antibody-dependent enhancement of FIPV infection of macrophages. This functional cross-reactivity provides further support for the close antigenic relationship between FIPV and TGEV.

However, it is not known how plank exercises affect physical fitness and immunocyte function. This study analyzed the changes in physical fitness and immune cells of a middle-aged man after performing 4 weeks of elbow plank exercise. Materials and Methods: Elbow plank exercise was performed for approximately 20 min (resting time, around 10 min) a day, 5 days a week for 4 weeks. The intensity was checked daily with ratings of perceived exertion (RPE). When the participant reached an intensity of RPE 15, RPE 16, and RPE 17 of the RPE 20 scale, 1 min of rest was given before repeating the process. Results: Compared with the pre-values, (1) all the physical fitness factors (muscle strength, muscle endurance, flexibility, and cardiopulmonary fitness) were increased after 4 weeks; (2) body weight, skeletal muscle mass, and the basal metabolic rate were increased, whereas body fat mass and fat percentage were decreased; and (3) although the variables of complete blood count were changed positively, some were not. Specifically, CD3, CD8, and CD56 were increased, whereas CD4, CD4/CD8, and cytotoxicity were decreased. These results show that elbow plank exercise can improve all factors of physical fitness and improve some of the immunocyte functions of a middle-aged man.

To meet patient demand, there is a need for increased access to high-quality, evidence-based mental health care. Telehealth has become well established in the treatment of illnesses, including mental health conditions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct a robust evidence synthesis to assess whether there is evidence of differences between telehealth and face-to-face care for the management of less common mental and physical health conditions requiring psychotherapy. METHODS: In this systematic review, we included randomized controlled trials comparing telehealth (telephone, video, or both) versus the face-to-face delivery of psychotherapy for less common mental health conditions and physical health conditions requiring psychotherapy. The psychotherapy delivered had to be comparable between the telehealth and face-to-face groups, and it had to be delivered by general practitioners, primary care nurses, or allied health staff (such as psychologists and counselors). Patient (symptom severity, overall improvement in psychological symptoms, and function), process (working alliance and client satisfaction), and financial (cost) outcomes were included. RESULTS: A total of 12 randomized controlled trials were included, with 931 patients in aggregate; therapies included cognitive behavioral and family therapies delivered in populations encompassing addiction disorders, eating disorders, childhood mental health problems, and chronic conditions. Telehealth was delivered by video in 7 trials, by telephone in 3 trials, and by both in 1 trial, and the delivery mode was unclear in 1 trial. The risk of bias for the 12 trials was low or unclear for most domains, except for the lack of the blinding of participants, owing to the nature of the comparison. There were no significant differences in symptom severity between telehealth and face-to-face therapy immediately after treatment (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.05, 95% CI ?0.17 to 0.27) or at any other follow-up time point. Similarly, there were no significant differences immediately after treatment between telehealth and face-to-face care delivery on any of the other outcomes meta-analyzed, including overall improvement (SMD 0.00, 95% CI ?0.40 to 0.39), function (SMD 0.13, 95% CI ?0.16 to 0.42), working alliance client (SMD 0.11, 95% CI ?0.34 to 0.57), working alliance therapist (SMD ?0.16, 95% CI ?0.91 to 0.59), and client satisfaction (SMD 0.12, 95% CI ?0.30 to 0.53), or at any other time point (3, 6, and 12 months).

During the preoperative anesthesia evaluation thorax CT was performed in 268 (56.7%) and PCR from nasopharyngeal swab was performed in 31 (6.6%) patients. General anesthesia was applied in 337 (71.2%) patients and alteration in the method of anesthesia was recorded in 45 (9.5%) patients. A cut-off value of 21 days was detected for the hospitals to adapt changes related to COVID-19. Rate of preoperative testing, emergency procedures, conservative approaches and topical/regional anesthesia increased after 21 days. The preoperative evaluation for management of urinary stone disease is significantly affected by COVID-19 pandemic. There is significant alteration in anesthesia methods and interventions. The optimal methods for preoperative evaluation are still unknown and there is discordance between different centers. It takes 21 days for hospitals and surgeons to adapt and develop new strategies for preoperative evaluation and management of stones.","output":"How does the COVID-19 pandemic affect the preoperative evaluation and anesthesia applied for urinary stones?

This study was conducted to investigate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic total pancreatectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS Three patients underwent laparoscopic total pancreatectomy between May 2014 and August 2015. We reviewed their general demographic data, perioperative details, and short-term outcomes. General morbidity was assessed using Clavien-Dindo classification and delayed gastric emptying (DGE) was evaluated by International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) definition. DIAGNOSIS AND OUTCOMES The indications for laparoscopic total pancreatectomy were intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) (n = 2) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) (n = 1). All patients underwent laparoscopic pylorus and spleen-preserving total pancreatectomy, the mean operative time was 490 minutes (range 450-540 minutes), the mean estimated blood loss was 266 mL (range 100-400 minutes); 2 patients suffered from postoperative complication. All the patients recovered uneventfully with conservative treatment and discharged with a mean hospital stay 18 days (range 8-24 days). The short-term (from 108 to 600 days) follow up demonstrated 3 patients had normal and consistent glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level with acceptable quality of life.

Our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize cardiac MRI findings in COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis. We performed a comprehensive systematic review of literature in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases using key terms covering COVID-19 vaccine, myocarditis, and cardiac MRI. Individual-level patient data (IPD) and aggregated-level data (AD) studies were pooled through a two-stage analysis method. For this purpose, all IPD were first gathered into a single data set and reduced to AD, and then this AD (from IPD studies) was pooled with existing AD (from the AD studies) using fixed/random effect models. I2 was used to assess the degree of heterogeneity, and the prespecified level of statistical significance (P value for heterogeneity) was <0.1. Based on meta-analysis of 102 studies (n = 468 patients), 79% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 54%-97%) of patients fulfilled Lake Louise criteria (LLC) for diagnosis of myocarditis. Cardiac MRI abnormalities included elevated T2 in 72% (95% CI: 50%-90%), myocardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in 93% (95% CI: 83%-99%; nearly all with a subepicardial and/or midwall pattern), impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (<50%) in 4% (95% CI: 1.0%-9.0%). Moreover, elevated T1 and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) (>30), reported only by some IPD studies, were detected in 74.5% (76/102) and 32% (16/50) of patients, respectively. In conclusion, our findings may suggest that over two-thirds of patients with clinically suspected myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination meet the LLC. COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis may show a similar pattern compared to other acute myocarditis entities. Notably, preserved LVEF is probably a common finding in these patients.

Though medical applications remain the major area of application, biosensors are gradually penetrating a wide variety of non-medical areas. Earlier predictions indicated that the medical application was around 90% of the total biosensor market, which includes clinical applications for diabetes, cholesterol, and coagulation monitoring. However, medical applications of biosensors are now down to around 60%. These changes are atributed to the rapidly advancing technologies and to some serious business challenges. The biosensor field has expanded dramatically in the past 45 years or so since the first demonstration of a biosensor application in 1962. Self-diagnosis of blood glucose levels by diabetes sufferers, however, remains the dominant area of biosensor application. The increased investment in new laboratories is essential to permit the application research required for determining the commercial applicability of biosensors. Different trends and models for collaboration between different entities are being noticed at the present time. Some of these trends are presented here. Incubators are springing up wherein scholarly research at universities may be gradually turned into or groomed to becoming successful business ventures. In effect, the future expansion of biosensor markets will depend on the balance between market opportunities and technical and/or financial obstacles.

Furthermore, the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on antibiotic prescriptions has not yet been investigated in China. We aimed to assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions and to evaluate the potential association between the COVID-19 pandemic and antibiotic prescriptions in primary care settings of Yinchuan, a city in China. Methods: This study included 155 primary care institutions and 10,192,713 outpatient visits. Outpatient prescriptions were classified as appropriate, potentially appropriate, inappropriate, or not linked to any diagnosis for antibiotic use following a validated evaluation scheme. Interrupted time-series analyses were performed to assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on antibiotic prescriptions in Chinese primary care facilities. Results: During the study period, 1,287,678 (12.6%, 95% confidence interval [12.6C12.7]) of 10,192,713 outpatient visits in primary care resulted in antibiotic prescriptions. Among 1,287,678 antibiotic prescriptions, 653,335 (50.7% [50.6C50.9]) were inappropriate, 463,081 (36.0% [35.8C36.1]) were potentially appropriate, 171,056 (13.3% [13.1C13.5]) were appropriate, and 206 could not be linked to any diagnosis. Furthermore, patient, physician, and institutional factors were associated with inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions; there was an overall decreasing trend in the proportions of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions, with the highest level in 2017 (67.1% [66.8C67.5]) and the lowest in 2021 (40.8% [40.3C41.3]). A total of 1,416,120 individual antibiotics were prescribed, of which 1,087,630 (76.8%) were broad-spectrum and 777,672 (54.9%) were classified in the World Health Organizations Watch category.

We developed a retrospective analytical model of COVID-19 related hospitalizations and ICU admissions linked to each of the three major chronic conditions C hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). METHODS: Based on the differential probability of hospitalization of the COVID-19 patients with and without a chronic condition, we estimate a baseline cumulative hospitalization rate and ICU admission rate using the population level chronic condition prevalence from the 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. Next, we estimate the hospitalization and ICU admission rates under an alternative scenario of a lower prevalence of the same chronic condition, aligned with the World Health Organization target of 25% relative reduction of prevalence by 2025. We then compare the outcomes of the baseline and the alternative scenarios. RESULTS: We estimate that the lower prevalence of hypertension would have lowered the cumulative hospitalization and ICU admission rates by more than 2.5%. The lower prevalence of diabetes and CVD would lower the cumulative hospitalization rate by 0.6% and 1.4% respectively. The decrease in the rates would have been relatively higher among Black and elderly (age 55+).

Accordingly, in order to protect the rights of migrants and improve the quality of the process of social urbanization in China, the most significant tasks involve investigating the current status of basic public services in Chinese towns and cities, especially the public services provided for potential new permanent migrant worker residents, and exploring methods to expand the coverage of these basic public services in urban areas to all their permanent residents.","output":"Promoting Universal Coverage of Basic Public Services Among Urban Residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Even in nonpandemic times, persons with disabilities experience emotional and behavioral disturbances which are distressing for them and for their close persons. We aimed at comparing the levels of stress in emotional and behavioral aspects, before and during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19), as reported by informal family caregivers of individuals with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) or stroke living in the community, considering two different stratifications of the recipients of care (cause and injury severity). METHODS: We conducted a STROBE\\\\compliant prospective observational study analyzing informal caregivers of individuals with stroke (IC\\\\STROKE) or traumatic brain injury (IC\\\\TBI). IC\\\\STROKE and IC\\\\TBI were assessed in\\\\person before and during COVID\\\\19 online, using the Head Injury Behavior Scale (HIBS). The HIBS comprises behavioral and emotional subtotals (10 items each) and a total\\\\HIBS. Comparisons were performed using the McNemar's test, Wilcoxon signed\\\\rank test or t\\\\test. Recipients of care were stratified according to their injury severity using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). RESULTS: One hundred twenty\\\\two informal caregivers (62.3% IC\\\\STROKE and 37.7% IC\\\\TBI) were assessed online between June 2020 and April 2021 and compared to their own assessments performed in\\\\person 1.74  0.88 years before the COVID\\\\19 lockdown. IC\\\\STROKE significantly increased their level of stress during COVID\\\\19 in five emotional items (impatience, frequent complaining, often disputes topics, mood change and overly sensitive) and in one behavioral item (overly dependent). IC\\\\TBI stress level only increased in one behavioral item (impulsivity). By injury severity, (i) mild (14.7%) showed no significant differences in emotional and behavioral either total\\\\HIBS (ii) moderate (28.7%) showed significant emotional differences in two items (frequent complaining and mood change) and (iii) severe (56.6%) showed significant differences in emotional (often disputes topics) and behavioral (impulsivity) items.

This perspecitve may be especially important to study among adolescents, who are less likely to experience severe symptoms but contribute to the spread of the virus. Objective: To examine psychological factors associated with adolescents' behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This self-reported survey conducted from March 20 to 22, 2020, recruited a population-based sample of adolescents via social media to complete an anonymous survey. Participants were eligible if they had internet access, lived in the United States, and were aged 13 to 18 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes included COVID-19 news monitoring, social distancing, disinfecting, and hoarding behaviors during the 7 days after the United States declared a national emergency. The psychological factors were attitudes about COVID-19 severity, social responsibility values, social trust, and self-interest. The a priori hypotheses were that greater attitudes about the severity of COVID-19, greater social responsibility, and greater social trust would be associated with greater news monitoring, social distancing, and disinfecting, whereas greater self-interest would be associated with more hoarding. Results: The sample included 770 adolescents collected via convenience sampling (mean [SD] age, 16.3 [1.1] years; 575 girls [74.7%]). Many teens reported not engaging in pure social distancing (528 [68.6%]), but they were monitoring the news (688 [89.4%]) and disinfecting daily (676 [87.8%]). Some teens reported hoarding (152 [19.7%]). Attitudes about the greater severity of COVID-19 were associated with more social distancing (? = 0.18; 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.25), disinfecting (? = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.23), and news monitoring (? = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.33) but also more hoarding (? = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.16). Greater social responsibility was associated with more disinfecting (? = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.17 to 0.32) and news monitoring (? = 0.14; 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.22) and less hoarding (? = -0.07; 95% CI = -0.14 to -0.01). Greater self-interest values were associated with less social distancing (? = -0.08; 95% CI = -0.15 to -0.01) and more hoarding (? = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.15). Greater social trust was associated with less hoarding (? = -0.09; 95% CI, -0.16 to -0.02). Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this survey study suggest that emphasizing the severity of COVID-19 and the social implications of pandemic-related behaviors may be important for teens, particularly for those who are not following preventive health behaviors or who are engaging in hoarding.","output":"Attitudes and Psychological Factors Associated With News Monitoring, Social Distancing, Disinfecting, and Hoarding Behaviors Among US Adolescents During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Catabolic conditions, such as starvation, inactivity, and cancer cachexia, induce Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor(s) expression and severe muscle atrophy via the induction of ubiquitin-proteasome system-mediated muscle proteolysis, resulting in frailty and poor quality of life. Although FOXOs are clearly essential for the induction of muscle atrophy, it is unclear whether there are other factors involved in the FOXO-mediated transcriptional regulation. As such, we identified FOXO-CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ? (C/EBP?) signaling pathway as a novel proteolytic pathway. By comparing the gene expression profiles of FOXO1-transgenic (gain-of-function model) and FOXO1,3a,4-/- (loss-of-function model) mice, we identified several novel FOXO1-target genes in skeletal muscle including Redd1, Sestrin1, Castor2, Chac1, Depp1, Lat3, as well as C/EBP?. During starvation, C/EBP? abundance was increased in a FOXOs-dependent manner. Notably, knockdown of C/EBP? prevented the induction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and decrease of myofibers in FOXO1-activated myotubes. Conversely, C/EBP? overexpression in primary myotubes induced myotube atrophy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that FOXO1 enhances the promoter activity of target genes in cooperation with C/EBP? and ATF4. This research comprehensively identifies novel FOXO1 target genes in skeletal muscle and clarifies the pathophysiological role of FOXO1, a master regulator of skeletal muscle atrophy.","output":"FOXO1 cooperates with C/EBP? and ATF4 to regulate skeletal muscle atrophy transcriptional program during fasting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic forced unprecedented changes upon journalists in the United States as they attempted to cover the story while adhering to the same stay-at-home orders as the rest of the public This study used organizational support theory to investigate the stress associated with the logistics of coverage early in the pandemic and how perceived organizational support played a role in either alleviating or adding to that stress In total, 222 journalists responded to a survey sent out during the first few weeks of the stay-at-home orders issued across the United States Results revealed varying degrees of logistical support provided by news organizations with nearly one quarter receiving no supplies, technology, or extra training at all Greater perceived organizational support was associated with lower levels of stress and higher levels of work commitment Female journalists and those who were younger and less experienced felt significantly more stress associated with pandemic coverage [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly is the property of Sage Publications Inc and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Covering COVID: Journalists Stress and Perceived Organizational Support While Reporting on the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: considering the growing increase in informal caregivers or family caregivers, it is critical to identify the unmet care needs of informal caregivers to improve their experiences, health, and well-being, contributing to the achievement of care needs of the elderly or people with adult dependency and promotion of successful transitions from health services to the community/home.

In order to successfully combat SARS?CoV?2, the development of effective COVID?19 vaccines is crucial. In this context, recent studies have highlighted a high COVID?19 mortality rate in patients affected by ?thalassemia, probably due to their co?existent immune deficiencies. In addition to a role in the severity of SARS?CoV?2 infection and in the mortality rate of COVID?19?infected patients with thalassemia, immunosuppression is expected to deeply affect the effectivity of anti?COVID?19 vaccines. In the context of the interplay between thalassemia?associated immunosuppression and the effectiveness of COVID?19 vaccines, the employment of immunomodulatory molecules is hypothesized. For instance, short?term treatment with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (such as everolimus and sirolimus) has been found to improve responses to influenza vaccination in adults, with benefits possibly persisting for a year following treatment. Recently, sirolimus has been considered for the therapy of hemoglobinopathies (including ?thalassemia). Sirolimus induces the expression of fetal hemoglobin (and this may contribute to the amelioration of the clinical parameters of patients with ?thalassemia) and induces autophagy (thereby reducing the excessive levels of ?globin). It may also finally contribute to the mobilization of erythroid cells from the bone marrow (thereby reducing anemia). In the present study, the authors present the hypothesis that sirolimus treatment, in addition to its beneficial effects on erythroid?related parameters, may play a crucial role in sustaining the effects of COVID?19 vaccination in patients with ?thalassemia.

The major risk factor for developing CIN is preexisting renal dysfunction, particularly in association with diabetes. Patients are considered to be at risk when estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or estimated creatinine clearance (eC(Cr)) is less than 60. The cornerstone of prevention of CIN is appropriate risk stratification, intravenous hydration with normal saline or sodium bicarbonate, appropriate withholding of nephrotoxic medications, use of low or iso-osmolar contrast media, and various intraprocedural methods for iodinated contrast dose reduction.

Comparing to chest Digital Radiography (DR), it is recently reported that chest Computed Tomography (CT) is more useful to serve as the early screening and diagnosis tool for NCIP. In this study, aimed to help physicians make the diagnostic decision, we develop a machine learning (ML) approach for automated diagnosis of NCIP on chest CT. Different from most ML approaches which often require training on thousands or millions of samples, we design a few-shot learning approach, in which we combine few-shot learning with weakly supervised model training, for computerized NCIP diagnosis. A total of 824 patients are retrospectively collected from two Hospitals with IRB approval. We first use 9 patients with clinically confirmed NCIP and 20 patients without known lung diseases for training a location detector which is a multitask deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) designed to output a probability of NCIP and the segmentation of targeted lesion area. An experienced radiologist manually localizes the potential locations of NCIPs on chest CTs of 9 COVID-19 patients and interactively segments the area of the NCIP lesions as the reference standard. Then, the multitask DCNN is furtherly fine-tuned by a weakly supervised learning scheme with 291 case-level labeled samples without lesion labels.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic pushed us to computationally sift and assess our small library of synthetic 2-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazoles against the main coronaviral protein/enzymatic targets. Surprisingly, few ligands exhibited interesting low binding energies (strong inhibitory affinities) with some SARS-CoV-2 proteins, mainly the pivotal enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nCoV-RdRp).

Therefore, an effective programme is required to help medical students and residents improve their clinical skills in MSK. This paper aims to assess the clinical skills of medical students who have participated in a peer role-playing simulation programme using a mini clinical evaluation exercise (mini-CEX). METHODS: Participants were 90 female medical students who were completing their first orthopaedic clinical clerkship. They were divided into two groups. The simulation group participated in a role-play focussed on MSK cases as low-fidelity simulation, a structured debriefing with the course supervisor, and a self-reflection on Day 1 (n = 64). The control group did not participate in the role-play due to randomised clerkship schedules (n = 26). On Day 2 of the intervention, we observed and assessed all participants performances during MSK outpatient encounters using the mini-CEX. We compared the mini-CEX score between the simulation group and the control group; the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The mini-CEX scores for physical examination, clinical reasoning and diagnosis, and overall clinical competency were significantly higher in the simulation group than in the control group (p < .05, physical examination: p = .014, clinical reasoning: p = .042, overall: p = .016). These findings suggest that medical students who partake in a peer role-playing simulation programme could experience improved clinical skills for physical examination, clinical reasoning and diagnosis, and overall clinical competency in real-life MSK outpatient encounters. CONCLUSIONS: Through a mini-CEX assessment, our findings indicate that medical students who participated in our peer role-playing simulation programme have improved clinical skills.

The opioid epidemic was already resurfacing with a 5% increase in overall deaths from 2018; however, the preliminary data show that prescription opioid deaths continued to decline, while at the same time deaths due to fentanyl, methamphetamine, and cocaine climbed, with some reductions in heroin deaths. The health tracker data also showed that along with an almost 88% decline in elective surgeries, pain-related prescriptions declined 15.1%. Despite increases in telehealth, outpatient services declined and only began returning towards normal at an extremely slow pace, accompanied by reduced productivity and increased practice costs.

The dynamic changes of their biofunctions, including cell viability, pathogen elimination function, phagocytic ability, and gene expressions of related proteins/mediators in innate and acquired immunity, inflammation, autophagy and apoptosis were analyzed. Results showed that IBV infection decreased chicken macrophage viability and phagocytic ability, and increased pathogen elimination function.

This study assesses PM(2.5) exposure and health risk during COVID-19, and its driving factors have been analyzed using spatiotemporal big data, including Tencent location-based services (LBS) data, place of interest (POI), and PM(2.5) site monitoring data. Specifically, the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) is utilized to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of PM(2.5) concentration firstly. Then, population exposure and health risks of PM(2.5) during the COVID-19 epidemic have been assessed based on LBS data. To further understand the driving factors of PM(2.5) pollution, the relationship between PM(2.5) concentration and POI data has been quantitatively analyzed using geographically weighted regression (GWR). The results show the time series coefficients of monthly PM(2.5) concentrations distributed with a U-shape, i.e., with a decrease followed by an increase from January to December. In terms of spatial distribution, the PM(2.5) concentration shows a noteworthy decline over the Central and North China. The LBS-based population density distribution indicates that the health risk of PM(2.5) in the west is significantly lower than that in the Middle East. Urban gross domestic product (GDP) and urban green area are negatively correlated with PM(2.5); while, road area, urban taxis, urban buses, and urban factories are positive. Among them, the number of urban factories contributes the most to PM(2.5) pollution.

This condition usually manifests as hypoxemic respiratory failure after exogenous usage of different consumer products, including Vaseline, Vicks VapoRub and lip gloss, and occupational exposure in lubricant production, machine cleaning, and spray painting. We report a 79-year-old patient who presented with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to lipoid pneumonia. Case Presentation:A 79-year-old female with PMH of depression, chronic neck and back pain PTSD, HTN, HLD who presented to our institution with a chief complaint of non-productive cough and dyspnea on exertion for greater than a month. CXR showed diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities. CT imaging showed multifocal confluent geographic areas of ground-glass opacities in crazy paving patters, suggestive of alveolar pathology. Connective tissue disorders, respiratory cultures, and multiple COVID-19 tests were negative. BNP was normal. She initially required high flow oxygen with 80% FIO2. Steroids were started without improvement. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with BAL for suspected PAP, HP, and to rule out DAH. BAL showed lipid-laden macrophages on oil red o stain, and periodic acid shift stain was negative. The patient subsequently reported continuous Vicks vapor rub for many years, which was likely the reason for lipoid pneumonia development. Discussion:Lipoid pneumonia is a rare condition in which lipid molecules occupy intraalveolar space and are subsequently found in alveolar macrophages2. The exact mechanism is unknown;however, the pathogenesis and severity are related to the amount of inhaled materials used3. Lipoid pneumonia symptoms typically are chronic cough and progressive dyspnea on exertion. Recently, exogenous lipoid pneumonia has been linked to E-cigarettes usage4. Our case underlines the importance of keeping high clinical suspicion of lipoid pneumonia as a potential cause of dyspnea in patients with crazy paving patterns on CT scan. Taking a detailed history is essential in making the correct diagnosis.Conclusion Lipoid pneumonia is a rare diagnosis caused by inhaling different lipids containing materials. Physicians should be aware of this etiology as a possible differential diagnosis in patients admitted with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.","output":"A case of exogenous lipoid pneumonia in a critically ill patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine have forced students to use distance learning. Modern information technologies have enabled global e-learning usage but also revealed a lack of personalization and adaptation in the learning process when compared to face-to-face learning. While adaptive e-learning methods exist, their practical application is slow because of the additional time and resources needed to prepare learning material and its logical adaptation. To increase e-learning materials usability and decrease the design complexity of automated adaptive students work evaluation, we propose several transformations from a competence tree-based structure to a graph-based automated e-evaluation structure. Related works were summarized to highlight existing e-evaluation structures and the need for new transformations. Competence tree-based e-evaluation structure improvements were presented to support the implementation of top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top transformations. Validation of the proposed transformation was executed by analyzing different use-cases and comparing them to the existing graph-to-tree transformation. Research results revealed that the competence tree-based learning material storage is more reusable than graph-based solutions. Competence tree-based learning material can be transformed for different purposes in graph-based e-evaluation solutions. Meanwhile, graph-based learning material transformation to tree-based structure implies material redundancy, and the competence of the tree structure cannot be restored.","output":"Toward Adaptability of E-Evaluation: Transformation from Tree-Based to Graph-Based Structure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The year 2021 marks not only 60 years since the discovery of messenger RNA and the genetic code.

In this randomized clinical trial, the efficacy and safety of IFN -1a were evaluated in patients with severe COVID-19. Forty-two patients in the interferon group received IFN -1a in addition to the national protocol medications (hydroxychloroquine plus lopinavir-ritonavir or atazanavir-ritonavir). Each 44-g/ml (12 million IU/ml) dose of interferon -1a was subcutaneously injected three times weekly for two consecutive weeks. The control group consisted of 39 patients who received only the national protocol medications. The primary outcome of the study was time to reach clinical response. Secondary outcomes were duration of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit stay, 28-day mortality, effect of early or late administration of IFN on mortality, adverse effects, and complications during the hospitalization.

During 1999-2020, nearly 840,000 lives were lost to suicide in the United States. During that period, the overall suicide rate peaked in 2018 and declined in 2019 and 2020 (1). Despite the recent decline in the suicide rate, factors such as social isolation, economic decline, family stressors, new or worsening mental health symptoms, and disruptions to work and school associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have raised concerns about suicide risk in the United States. During 2020, a total of 12.2 million U.S. adults reported serious thoughts of suicide and 1.2 million attempted suicide (2). To understand how changes in suicide death rates might have varied among subpopulations, CDC analyzed counts and age-adjusted suicide rates during 2019 and 2020 by demographic characteristics, mechanism of injury, county urbanization level, and state.

The pathogen of COVID-19 is SARS-COV-2, and previous studies have proposed the relationship between ABO blood group and coronavirus. Here, we aim to delve into the association between ABO blood group and COVID-19 infection, severity and demise. METHODS: The relevant studies were retrieved from five databases: PubMed, MedRxiv, BioRxiv,Web of Science and CNKI. Members of cases(symptomatic cases, severe cases, died cases) and controls(asymptomatic controls, non-severe controls, alive controls) were extracted from collected studies. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and interpreted from extracted data. Publication bias and sensitivity analysis were also applied to confirm our discovery. RESULTS: Overall 31,100 samples were included in the analysis. Compared to other ABO blood type, an increased odds of infecting COVID-19 among individuals with A blood group (OR: 1.249, 95%CI: 1.114-1.440, P < 0.001) and a decreased odds of infecting COVID-19 among individuals with blood group O (OR: 0.699, 95%CI: 0.635-0.770, P < 0.001) were found. Besides, individuals with blood group AB seems to link a higher risk to COVID-19 severity (OR: 2.424, 95%CI: 0.934-6.294) and demise (OR: 1.348, 95%CI: 0.507-3.583). Meantime, individuals with O blood group might had lower risk to COVID-19 severity (OR: 0.748, 95%CI: 0.556-1.007), and individuals with B blood group were likely to relate a lower risk to COVID-19 demise. CONCLUSIONS: The current meta-analysis suggest that blood type A might be more susceptible to infect COVID-19 while blood type O might be less susceptible to infect COVID-19; there were no correlation between ABO blood group and severity or demise of COVID-19.

The study goal is to determine if COVID-19 specific admission labs have any prognostic value beyond that provided by routine admission labs and vitals, and costs of labs with no prognostic value. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed adult patients admitted with COVID-19 from 3/2020 to 7/2020. Outcomes were mortality, ICU stay and length of hospitalization. Multivariable logistic and linear regression were used to determine if COVID-19 specific admission labs have any prognostic value beyond that provided by vitals and routine admission labs. COVID-19 specific labs were d-Dimer, fibrinogen, ferritin, LDH, CK, pro-BNP, troponin and CRP. Multivariable models included all routine admission labs and vitals. COVID-19 specific admission labs were included in the multivariable models if the p-value was <0.05 in the univariable analysis.

METHODS: We applied unsupervised machine learning to a data set of 853 patients with COVID-19 from the HM group of hospitals (HM Hospitales) in Madrid, Spain. Age and sex were not considered while building the clusters, as these variables could introduce biases in machine learning algorithms and raise ethical implications or enable discrimination in triage protocols. RESULTS: From 850 clinical and laboratory variables, four teststhe serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and the number of neutrophilswere enough to segregate the entire patient pool into three separate clusters. Further, the percentage of monocytes and lymphocytes and the levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) distinguished cluster 3 patients from the other two clusters. The highest proportion of deceased patients; the highest levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and CRP; the highest number of neutrophils; and the lowest percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes characterized cluster 1. Cluster 2 included a lower proportion of deceased patients and intermediate levels of the previous laboratory tests. The lowest proportion of deceased patients; the lowest levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and CRP; the lowest number of neutrophils; and the highest percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes characterized cluster 3.

This pilot project, aimed at expanding clinical access to specialized pediatric services in rural areas, evolved over the course of 2 years prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHOD: Providers earned the trust of the local community, gained understanding of pertinent sociocultural factors, and acquired knowledge of the clinical and educational concerns for the children residing in the rural community. The application of a culturally informed approach that highlights the importance of community participation and collaboration steered the decision to implement a TeleNP consultation model. By widening access to neuropsychology, this service helped to determine whether neuropsychological testing procedures were medically indicated. RESULTS: We summarize the distinct processes that needed to occur at each location to support the implementation of telemedicine. We propose a clinical service decision tree with specific criteria to help guide providers on how to triage cases in order to increase access to specialized healthcare.

The cases were divided into regular group, severe group and critically ill group according to the sixth edition scheme for COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment of China. The laboratory tests included blood routine, cellular and humoral immunity indices, biochemical detections and inflammatory biomarker. Compared with regular patients, severe and critically ill patients had significantly lower lymphocyte count (p < 0.01), decreased red blood cell and hemoglobin (p < 0.01), low levels of immunoglobulin G (p < 0.05) and significantly higher in D-dimer (p < 0.0001), fibrinogen (p < 0.01), white blood cell count (p < 0.01), neutrophil count (p < 0.0001), interleukin-6 (p < 0.05), C-reactive protein (p < 0.01), procalcitonin (p < 0.01), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p < 0.05), ferritin (p < 0.01) and lactate dehydrogenase (p < 0.0001). The specific immunoglobulin G antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 in severe and critically ill patients were significantly lower than that in regular patients (p < 0.05).

Here, we sought to characterize this in terms of self-reported insomnia. We hypothesized that those endorsing a positive COVID-19 diagnosis would also report greater levels of insomnia than those with a negative diagnosis. METHODS: Between April and September 2020 we administered the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), each month to a total of 6162 English speaking adults in the United States ranging in age from 18C84 (M=36.2 years, SD=12.1; 53.9% female), recruited from all 50 states and the District of Columbia using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowdsourcing platform. Data collections occurred cross-sectionally, approximately one month apart. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis H tests. RESULTS: In total, 247 (4.01%) participants responded Yes to the question Have you been formally diagnosed with COVID-19? (male=128, female=119). Those reporting yes had a higher mean score on the ISI (M=14.52, SD=5.56) compared to reporting no (M=9.98, SD=6.55). Total ISI scores were higher for those who reported that they were diagnosed with COVID-19 than those that did not, 2(1)=121.818, p=0.0001. Among those that reported that they were diagnosed with COVID-19, 57.11% had ISI scores indicating moderate to severe clinical insomnia compared to 25.42% of those who were not diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Those who reported that they had been diagnosed with COVID 19 had greater insomnia compared to those without such a diagnosis. This could be due to greater stress and anxiety in those who had a positive COVID-19 diagnosis due to the many uncertainties surrounding the short and long-term prognosis as well as potential impacts on the individuals family and workplace. However, it is important to consider the broader health picture of those diagnosed with COVID-19. This study is limited by the nature of the self-reported data, where we cannot verify a positive COVID-19 test. Causality cannot be inferred due to the cross-sectional nature of this study. Future work will need to determine the extent to which sleep-related factors are due to biological versus psychological factors associated with the diagnosis of COVID-19.

Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have been shown to increase access to care and improve chronic disease management in minority populations. However, such interventions have not been developed for or tested in Chinese immigrants with T2D. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine mobile device ownership, current use, and interest in mHealth interventions among Chinese immigrants with T2D. METHODS: In a cross-sectional survey, Chinese immigrants with T2D were recruited from Chinese community centers in New York City. Sociodemographic characteristics, mobile device ownership, current use of social media software applications, current use of technology for health-related purposes, and interest in using mHealth for T2D management were assessed. Surveys were administered face-to-face by bilingual study staff in the participants preferred language. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study sample and summarize technology use. RESULTS: The sample (N=91) was predominantly female (n=57, 63%), married (n=68, 75%), and had a high school education or less (n=58, 64%); most participants had an annual household income of less than US $25,000 (n=63, 69%) and had limited English proficiency (n=78, 86%). The sample had a mean age of 70 (SD 11) years. Almost all (90/91, 99%) participants had a mobile device (eg, basic cell phones, smart devices), and the majority (n=83, 91%) reported owning a smart device (eg, smartphone or tablet). WeChat was the most commonly used social media platform (65/91, 71%). When asked about their top source for diabetes-related information, 63 of the 91 participants (69%) reported health care providers, followed by 13 who reported the internet (14%), and 10 who reported family, friends, and coworkers (11%). Less than one-quarter (21/91, 23%) of the sample reported using the internet to search for diabetes-related information in the past 12 months. About one-third of the sample (34/91, 37%) reported that they had watched a health-related video on their cell phone or computer in the past 12 months. The majority (69/91, 76%) of participants reported interest in receiving an mHealth intervention in the future to help with T2D management. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high mobile device ownership, the current use of technology for health-related issues remained low in older Chinese immigrants with T2D. Given the strong interest in future mHealth interventions and high levels of social media use (eg, WeChat), future studies should consider how to leverage these existing low-cost platforms and deliver tailored mHealth interventions to this fast-growing minority group.","output":"Mobile Device Ownership, Current Use, and Interest in Mobile Health Interventions Among Low-Income Older Chinese Immigrants With Type 2 Diabetes: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are the basis of treatments and diagnostics for pathogens and other biological phenomena. We conducted a structural characterization of mAbs against the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid protein (NPNTD) from SARS-CoV-2 using small-angle X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Our solution-based results distinguished the mAbs' flexibility and how this flexibility affects the assembly of multiple mAbs on an antigen. By pairing two mAbs that bind different epitopes on the NPNTD, we show that flexible mAbs form a closed sandwich-like complex. With rigid mAbs, a juxtaposition of the antigen-binding fragments is prevented, enforcing a linear arrangement of the mAb pair, which facilitates further mAb polymerization. In a modified sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we show that rigid mAb-pairings with linear polymerization led to increased NPNTD detection sensitivity. These enhancements can expedite the development of more sensitive and selective antigen-detecting point-of-care lateral flow devices, which are critical for early diagnosis and epidemiological studies of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens.","output":"Rigid monoclonal antibodies improve detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, several convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods have been proposed for computer-aided COVID-19 diagnosis based on lung computed tomography (CT) scans. However, the lesions of pneumonia in CT scans have wide variations in appearances, sizes, and locations in the lung regions, and the manifestations of COVID-19 in CT scans are also similar to other types of viral pneumonia, which hinders the further improvement of CNN-based methods. Delineating infection regions manually is a solution to this issue, while excessive workload of physicians during the epidemic makes it difficult for manual delineation. In this article, we propose a CNN called dense connectivity network with parallel attention module (PAM-DenseNet), which can perform well on coarse labels without manually delineated infection regions. The parallel attention module automatically learns to strengthen informative features from both channelwise and spatialwise simultaneously, which can make the network pay more attention to the infection regions without any manual delineation. The dense connectivity structure performs feature maps reuse by introducing direct connections from previous layers to all subsequent layers, which can extract representative features from fewer CT slices. The proposed network is first trained on 3530 lung CT slices selected from 382 COVID-19 lung CT scans, 372 lung CT scans infected by other pneumonia, and 200 normal lung CT scans to obtain a pretrained model for slicewise prediction. We then apply this pretrained model to a CT scans dataset containing 94 COVID-19 CT scans, 93 other pneumonia CT scans, and 93 normal lung scans, and achieve patientwise prediction through a voting mechanism. The experimental results show that the proposed network achieves promising results with an accuracy of 94.29%, a precision of 93.75%, a sensitivity of 95.74%, and a specificity of 96.77%, which is comparable to the methods that are based on manually delineated infection regions.","output":"PAM-DenseNet: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Computer-Aided COVID-19 Diagnosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is sweeping the globe. Latest information on the outbreak of the corona virus epidemic in 2019, which was caused by the extreme acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 strains, has begun to shed light on the disease's effects on the liver. However, no studies have systematically to date, there have been no impaired liver tests in COVID-19 patients. In patients with irregular liver test results, we looked at the clinical features of COVID-19. The goal of this research was to explain the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with irregular liver tests and CLD. AIM:We performed an observational study to see how irregular liver tests and patients' clinical outcomes were influenced by chronic liver disease admitted to SMHRC Nagpur. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The research included 200 people aged 25 to 65 years old who had been diagnosed with corona positive and were admitted to Shalinitai Meghe Hospital in Nagpur. They were split up into different parties. One group had chronic liver disease, and the other did not, but both groups had patients that were corona positive. We included patients who had liver defects as a result of corona viruses in this study. During the research phase, we gathered information from this patient. As a research group and a control group, we test SGOT, SGPT, ALP, Protein, Total bilirubin, and GGT levels. RESULTS: The findings show that corona positive patients with liver disease had elevated liver function tests, such as increased levels of SGOT, SGPT, Total billirubin, Alkaline phosphates, and GGT, when compared to those who did not have any liver abnormalities but were corona positive. A history of irregular liver tests and liver damage was related to the development of serious pneumonia. The detrimental impacts on liver injury were linked to some drugs taken during hospitalization, implying that these patients should be monitored and evaluated on a regular basis. CONCLUSION: Patients who had irregular liver tests were more likely to develop serious disease. The negative effects on liver damage were mostly due to some drugs taken during hospitalization, which should be closely monitored and evaluated. ? 2021, Annals of R.S.C.B.

While the interdependences, similarities and complementarities of manufacturing and services are significant, there are considerable differences between goods and services, including the shift in focus from mass production to mass customization (whereby a service is produced and delivered in response to a customers stated or imputed needs). In general, services can be considered to be knowledge-intensive agents or components which work together as providers and consumers to create or co-produce value. Like manufacturing systems, an efficient service system must be an integrated system of systems, leading to greater connectivity and interdependence. Integration must occur over the physical, temporal, organizational and functional dimensions, and must include methods concerned with the component, the management, and the system. Moreover, an effective service system must also be an adaptable system, leading to greater value and responsiveness. Adaptation must occur over the dimensions of monitoring, feedback, cybernetics and learning, and must include methods concerned with space, time, and system. In sum, service systems are indeed complex, especially due to the uncertainties associated with the human-centered aspects of such systems. Moreover, the system complexities can only be dealt with methods that enhance system integration and adaptation. The paper concludes with several insights, including a plea to shift the current misplaced focus on developing a science or discipline for services to further developing a systems engineering approach to services, an approach based on the integration and adaptation of a host of sciences or disciplines (e.g., physics, mathematics, statistics, psychology, sociology, etc.). In fact, what is required is a services-related transdisciplinary - beyond a single disciplinary - ontology or taxonomy as a basis for disciplinary integration and adaptation.","output":"On integration and adaptation in complex service systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patient: Female, 48-year-old Final Diagnosis: COVID 19 infection Symptoms: Cough ? diarrhea ? dyspena ? fatigue ? fever ? headache ? lightheadedness ? nausea ? sore throat ? vomiting Medication:  Clinical Procedure:  Specialty: Infectious Diseases OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course BACKGROUND: During the global Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have identified and monitored variants of concerns (VOCs) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

In Costa Rica during the year 2020, a predominant genotype carrying the mutation T1117I in the spike (S:T1117I) was previously identified. To investigate the possible effects of this mutation on the function of the spike, i.e. the biology of the virus, different bioinformatic pipelines based on phylogeny, natural selection, and co-evolutionary models, molecular docking, and epitopes prediction were implemented. Results of the phylogeny of sequences carrying the S:T1117I worldwide showed a polyphyletic group, with the emergence of local lineages. In Costa Rica, the mutation is found in the lineage B.1.1.389 and it is suggested to be a product of positive/adaptive selection. Different changes in the function of the spike protein and more stable interaction with a ligand (nelfinavir drug) were found. Only one epitope out 742 in the spike was affected by the mutation, with some different properties, but suggesting scarce changes in the immune response and no influence on the vaccine effectiveness. Jointly, these results suggest a partial benefit of the mutation for the spread of the virus with this genotype during the year 2020 in Costa Rica, although possibly not strong enough with the introduction of new lineages during early 2021 which became predominant later.

Setting Primary care general practice surgeries and community pharmacies in Ireland. Methods Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 HCPs (five General practitioners [GPs], four practice nurses and five community pharmacists) identified through purposive and convenience sampling. The interviews were analysed by inductive thematic analysis. Main outcome measure Participants views and experiences of providing vaccines information to patients. Results Five key themes were identified: roles and responsibilities, perception of risk, perception of the public, building a relationship, and emotion. HCPs were motivated by duty and care for their patients. They respected patient autonomy and were driven by their concern for public health. HCPs were influenced by their perception of risk and their perceptions of the public. HCPs practiced patient-centred care by providing tailored vaccines information. They favoured an approach of providing patients with information and support to make their own decision. The topic was emotive; HCPs empathised with patients but were also frustrated by their perceived inability to change some patients views. Conclusion The provision of vaccines information by HCPs to patients is multifactorial with participants mindful of patient autonomy and the HCP role to support vaccinations as a public health priority.

In this work, the immune response, safety and efficacy of different vaccine formulations using the N. caninum recombinant proteins rNcSAG4 (the first bradyzoite-specific protein assayed as a vaccine) and rNcGRA7 were evaluated in mouse models. The survival curves of pups from all vaccinated groups showed a slight delay in time to death compared to control groups; this difference was statistically significant for rNcSAG4+adjuvant group. Immune response of mice vaccinated with rNcSAG4 was characterized by reduced specific IgG and cytokine levels with an equilibrated IFN-gamma/IL-10 balance. Regarding mice vaccinated with rNcGRA7, a very strong humoral and cellular immune response was generated characterized by a hyper-production of IFN-gamma. This response was not accompanied by significant protection. Vaccination with a mixture of both recombinant proteins reduced infection in lung and brain during acute and chronic infection, respectively, although it was not statistically significant. In summary, no significant protection was obtained with these vaccine formulations in the present mouse models.

Disease severity and clinical course characteristics of the patients and influencing factors of severe illness were analyzed in our study. Results: Among 1 350 cases of COVID-19 cases in Guangdong, 72 (5.3%) and 1049 (77.7%) were mild and ordinary cases, 164 (12.1%) were severe cases, 58 (4.3%) were critical cases and 7 (0.5%) were fatal. The median duration of illness were 23 days (P(25)-P(75): 18-31 days) and the median length of hospitalization were 20 days (P(25)-P(75): 15-27 days). For severe cases, the median time of showing severe manifestations was on the 12th day after onset (P(25)-P(75): 9th to 15th days), and the median time of severe manifestation lasted for 8 days P(25)-P(75): 4-14 days). Among 1 066 discharged/fetal cases, 36.4% (36/99) and 1.0% (1/99) of the mild cases developed to ordinary cases and severe cases respectively after admission; and 5.2% (50/968) and 0.6% (6/968) of the ordinary cases developed to severe cases, and critical cases respectively after admission. In severe cases, 11.4% developed to critical cases (10/88). The influencing factors for severe illness or worse included male (aHR=1.87, 95%CI: 1.43-2.46), older age (aHR=1.67, 95%CI: 1.51-1.85), seeking medical care on day 2-3 after onset (aHR=1.73, 95%CI: 1.20-2.50) pre-existing diabetes (aHR=1.75, 95%CI: 1.12-2.73) and hypertension (aHR=1.49, 95%CI: 1.06-2.09).

METHODS Twenty college athletes (10 men and 10 women) performed a half-squat exercise consisting of five incremental intensities: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% of the one-repetition maximum. Blood samples were collected at rest, 15 min and 24 h post-test. The concentration of lipid peroxidation markers and the activities of a skeletal muscle damage marker and a cardiac muscle damage marker were determined in serum. Serum -actin was measured as a marker of sarcomere damage. Serum levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were determined to assess the inflammatory response. RESULTS Interleukin-6 levels were higher at 24 h post-test than at rest and 15 min post-test in men (p < 0.05). Moreover, men showed significantly higher hydroperoxide levels in response to resistance exercise at 24 h post-test than at 15 min post-test (p < 0.05). No differences were found in muscle damage parameters regardless of sex or the time point of the test. No differences regarding the studied variables were found when comparing among different time points in women.

Therefore, its detection is important to avoid overtreatment. The COVID-19 pandemic determined a massive migration of hypertension consultations from the face-to-face modality to teleconsultations, and it is unknown whether WUCH exists in this context.? AIM: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of WUCH through home BP monitoring (HBPM) in treated hypertensive patients evaluated by teleconsultation. METHODS: We included treated hypertensive patients that owned a digital BP monitor. During teleconsultation, patients were asked to perform two BP measurements and then a 7-day HBPM, using the same device. Patients were classified as having WUCH if BP was  140 and/or 90 mmHg in teleconsultation and < 135/85 mmHg on HBPM. The prevalence of WUCH and its 95% confidence interval were estimated. One-way ANOVA, the Chi-square test or Fishers exact test were used to compare the characteristics of these patients with the other groups. RESULTS: We included 341 patients (45.2% male, mean age 62.3 years). The prevalence of WUCH was 33.1% (95% CI 28.3C38.3%). Significant differences were found in terms of age, the number of antihypertensive drugs and the use of calcium channel blockers, all lower in the WUCH group as compared with the groups with elevated BP on HBPM.

This commentary provides insight into potential mechanism involved in the development of depression and emotional negativity escalating during the current pandemic. In particular, preventive measures of COVID-19, such as staying at home, are sedentarism measures that decrease physical activity. Physical inactivity alters gut microbiome structure in a fashion that promotes gut dysbiosis and flaring of systemic inflammation, leading to the buildup of body fat. Obesity, which contributes to a trail of health-depleting disorders, furthers gut microbial disintegration while fat tissue stimulates the release of cytokines, promotes metabolic resistance, and alters signaling involved in the production of antioxidants. As a result, the body gets flooded by toxic molecules such pro-inflammatory mediators, free radicals, advanced glycation end products. These toxic molecules alter cellular function in all body tissues, including those of the brain. Neuroinflammation is associated with progressive declines in cognitive and motor functions along with dysregulation in emotions. Counteracting the sedentarism enforced by the COVID-19 pandemic through suitable indoors activities and intake of healthy food is likely to protect against or revert physiological impairments that may affect people retreating to their homes during the current crisis, eventually restoring physical and mental health.","output":"Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A pandemic that threatens physical and mental health by promoting physical inactivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: During spring 2009, a pandemic swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) emerged and spread globally. We describe the chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) findings of 40 patients with pneumonia due to S-OIV observed in our institution. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Among 534 patients with S-OIV, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition, seen between June and November 2009, 121 underwent chest X-ray and 40 (median age 44 years, range 16C79) had pneumonia. The initial chest radiographs were evaluated for pattern, distribution and extent of lung abnormalities. Unenhanced chest CT scans were performed in two patients and were reviewed for the same findings. Underlying medical conditions were present in 42% of patients (17/40). RESULTS: Our patients had predominantly mild illness, and pneumonia was observed in 40 individuals (40/121 patients who had chest X-rays, 33%; and 40/534 patients with S-OIV, 7.5%). However, S-OIV can cause severe illness requiring admission to the intensive care unit for advanced mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal life support, including adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. The major radiological abnormalities observed were interstitial changes (60.0%), with (22.0%) or without patchy ground-glass appearance, mostly bilateral, and located in the lower lung zones (7.5%). Extensive disease was seen in 37.5% (15/40), and ARDS was observed in three individuals (0.30%)with underlying medical conditions. Subtle pleural effusion was noted in four patients. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, the most frequent pneumonia patterns observed during S-OIV (H1N1) virus were interstitial changes and patchy ground-glass appearance, mostly bilateral, and located in the lower lung zones.

Because the upper respiratory airway is a primary site of SARS-CoV-2 entry, immunization at the mucosa via the intranasal route could potentially lead to induction of local sterilizing immunity that protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein loaded into N,N,N-trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles (RBD-TMC NPs). We showed that intranasal delivery of RBD-TMC NPs into mice induced robust local mucosal immunity, as evidenced by the presence of IgG and IgA responses in BALs and the lungs of immunized mice. Furthermore, mice intranasally administered with this platform of immunogens developed robust systemic antibody responses including serum IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgA and neutralizing antibodies. In addition, these immunized mice had significantly higher levels of activated splenic CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells compared with those that were administered with soluble RBD immunogen. Collectively, these findings shed light on an alternative route of vaccination that mimics the natural route of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We utilized no known disease/healthy COs (HC) as normal function controls. At 3C4 and 6C10 months post-differentiation, COs with mutations showed no evidence of disease-related pathology. Electrophysiology assessment showed that all COs exhibited mature neuronal firing at 6C10 months old. At this age, we observed significant changes in the electrophysiology of the COs with disease-associated mutations (dCOs) as compared with the HC, including reduced neuronal network communication, slowing neuronal oscillations, and increased coupling of delta and theta phases to the amplitudes of gamma oscillations. Such changes were linked with the detection of hypersynchronous events like spike-and-wave discharges. These dysfunctions were associated with altered production and release of neurotransmitters, compromised activity of excitatory ionotropic receptors including receptors of kainate, AMPA, and NMDA, and changed levels and function of excitatory glutamatergic synapses and inhibitory GABAergic synapses. Neuronal properties that modulate GABAergic inhibition including the activity of NaCK-Cl cotransport 1 (NKCC1) in Cl(?) homeostasis and the levels of synaptic and extra-synaptic localization of GABA receptors (GABARs) were altered in the T21 COs only.

It was named COVID-19, and to date, thousands of cases of infection and death are reported worldwide. This disease is associated with a wide range of symptoms, which makes accurate diagnosis of it difficult. During previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2003, researchers found that the patients with fever, cough, or sore throat had a 5% influenza virus-positive rate. This finding made us think that the wide range of symptoms and also relatively high prevalence of death in our patients may be due to the coinfection with other viruses. Thus, we evaluated the coinfection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with other respiratory viruses in dead patients in North Khorasan. We evaluated the presence of influenza A/B virus, human metapneumovirus, bocavirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza viruses in 105 SARS-CoV-2 positive dead patients, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription PCR tests. We found coinfection with influenza virus in 22.3%, RSV, and bocavirus in 9.7%, parainfluenza viruses in 3.9%, human metapneumovirus in 2.9%, and finally adenovirus in 1.9% of SARS-CoV-2 positive dead cases. Our findings highlight a high prevalence of coinfection with influenza A virus and the monopoly of coinfection with Human metapneumovirus in children.","output":"High prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (H1N1) coinfection in dead patients in Northeastern Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been spreading through many countries since the end of 2019 The 4th edition of the national guidelines for the management of COVID-19 provides an herbal formula with 9 herbs for its management Aim of Study We aimed to predict the mechanism of binding of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to provide a molecular-level explanation of the higher pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and to identify protein sites which may be targeted by therapeutic agents to disrupt virus-host interactions Subsequently, we aimed to investigate the formula for the initial-stage management to identify a therapeutic agent with the most likely potential to become pharmaceutical candidate for the management of this disease Materials and Methods GenBank and SWISS-MODEL were applied for model creation ClusPro was used for protein-protein docking PDBePISA was applied for identification of possible binding sites TCMSP was employed for identification of the chemical compounds AutoDock Vina together with PyRx was used for the prediction and evaluation of binding pose and affinity to ACE2 SwissADME and PreADME were applied to screening and prediction of the pharmacokinetic properties of the identified chemical compounds PyMOL was used to visualise the structural models of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins complexed to ACE2 and to examine their interactions Results SARS-CoV-2 had two chains (labelled chains B and C) which were predicted to bind with ACE2 In comparison, the SARS-CoV had only one chain (labelled chain C) predicted to bind with ACE2 The spike glycoproteins of both viruses were predicted to bind with ACE2 via position 487 Molecular docking screening and pharmacokinetic property prediction of the herbal compounds indicated that atractylenolide III (?9 1 kcal/mol) from Atractylodes lancea (Thunb ) Dc (Cangzhu) may be a candidate therapeutic agent for initial-stage management Conclusions Atractylenolide III is predicted to have a strong binding affinity with ACE2 and eligible pharmacokinetic properties, anti-inflammatory effects and antiviral effects in in vitro study, and high distribution on the lungs in in vivo study [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM) is the property of Hindawi Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Screening for a Potential Therapeutic Agent from the Herbal Formula in the 4th Edition of the Chinese National Guidelines for the Initial-Stage Management of COVID-19 via Molecular Docking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) entry factors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, are highly expressed in nasal epithelial cells. However, the association between SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 and nasal inflammation in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) has not been investigated. We thus investigated the expression of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 entry factors in nasal tissues of CRSwNP patients, and their associations with inflammatory endotypes of CRSwNP. METHODS: The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was assessed in nasal tissues of control subjects and eosinophilic CRSwNP (ECRSwNP) and nonECRSwNP patients. The correlations between ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression and inflammatory indices of CRSwNP endotypes were evaluated. Regulation of ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression by inflammatory cytokines and glucocorticoids was investigated. RESULTS: ACE2 expression was significantly increased in nasal tissues of nonECRSwNP patients compared to ECRSwNP patients and control subjects, and positively correlated with the expression of IFN\\\\, but negatively correlated with tissue infiltrated eosinophils, and expression of IL5 and IL13. IFN\\\\ up\\\\regulated ACE2 expression while glucocorticoid attenuated this increase in cultured nasal epithelial cells. Genes co\\\\expressed with ACE2 were enriched in pathways relating to defence response to virus in nasal tissue. TMPRSS2 expression was decreased in nasal tissues of CRSwNP patients compared to control subjects and not correlated with the inflammatory endotypes of CRSwNP. Glucocorticoid treatment decreased ACE2 expression in nasal tissues of nonECRSwNP patients, but not in ECRSwNP patients, whereas TMPRSS2 expression was not affected. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that ACE2 expression, regulated by IFN\\\\, is increased in nasal tissues of nonECRSwNP patients and positively correlates with type 1 inflammation.","output":"Distinct expression of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 receptor ACE2 correlates with endotypes of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Community-based physical activity interventions can offset the burden of developing chronic diseases. Positive psychology (PP) interventions may improve health behaviors, but little is known about their effectiveness in community-based prevention settings. A multilevel PP-based intervention has never been studied in people at risk for chronic diseases. PURPOSE: The aim of the trial is to demonstrate feasibility, acceptability, and improve physical activity. The purpose is to describe the theory, design, and rationale of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) phase of an iteratively developed physical activity intervention for metabolic syndrome. The feasibility results of the proof-of-concept phase are presented. METHODS: Participants are adult primary care patients at community health centers with metabolic syndrome and low physical activity (target n = 64). The 8-week group intervention consists of weekly physical activity goal-setting and self-monitoring, positive psychology activities, and neighborhood walks. Participants rate feasibility and acceptability of sessions. Pre-post-intervention, and 24 weeks later, participants complete accelerometers, questionnaires, and biometrics. FEASIBILITY RESULTS: Eight participants enrolled and seven completed. The median number of group sessions attended was 7 out of 8. Average ease and usefulness of sessions were rated as 7.0 (0.5)/10 and 8.1 (1.0)/10, respectively, indicating feasibility and acceptability. Average pre-post physical activity increased by 2152 steps and 29.25 min of MVPA/week. DISCUSSION: This proof-of-concept trial demonstrated high feasibility and acceptability, with increased physical activity. These positive findings suggest that the RCT phase will show high feasibility, acceptability, and initial impact on physical activity.","output":"A community-based positive psychology group intervention to promote physical activity among people with metabolic syndrome: Proof of concept results to inform a pilot randomized controlled trial protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In January 2013, several months after Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, began surveillance for MERS-CoV.

In this study, we evaluated the prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety, stress, and stress perception among a group of patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 106 inpatients with COVID-19 who had stable clinical conditions were evaluated psychologically by two questionnaires: Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4). Results: More than one third of patients had underlying disease. Overall, 97.2% of patients with COVID-19 had some degree of depression. Severity of depression, according to the DASS questionnaire, was 85.8%. All patients (100%) had severe (0.9%) and very severe (99.1%) anxiety. Regarding to stress levels, 97.1% of patients had some degree of stress. In the severity of stress category, 84.9% of patients had severe and very severe stress. In terms of perceived stress, 73.6% of patients had high levels and 22.6% had moderate levels. A positive strong correlation was found between depression and perceived stress (Coefficient: 0.33, P-value: 0.001). Correlation between anxiety and perceived stress was statistically significant (Coefficient: 0.2, P-value: 0.04). Conclusions: The existence of such a high prevalence and severity of psychiatric disorders among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 underscores the need for serious attention to the mental health status of these patients.

A total of 172 patients with COVID-19, hospitalized in COVID-unit of the Internal Medicine Department (Lyon, France) participated in this study between January and May 2021. Clinical parameters were collected for each patient. Routine hematological/biochemical parameters, blood viscosity, RBC deformability and aggregation, and RBC senescence markers were measured on the first day of hospitalization. A control group of 38 healthy individuals was constituted to compare the blood rheological and RBC profile. Rotational thromboelastography was performed in 76 patients to study clot formation dynamics. Our study demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 had increased blood viscosity despite lower hematocrit than healthy individuals, as well as increased RBC aggregation. In-vitro experiments demonstrated a strong contribution of plasma fibrinogen in this RBC hyper-aggregation. RBC aggregation correlated positively with clot firmness, negatively with clot formation time, and positively with the length of hospitalization. Patients with oxygen supplementation had higher RBC aggregation and blood viscosity than those without, and patients with pulmonary lesions had higher RBC aggregation and enhanced coagulation than those without.

Initial studies from New York City suggested more severe disease among PLWH but this was during a time when hospitals were over-capacity and health systems stretched. This report presents the incidence and outcomes among people living with HIV (PLWH) with COVID-19 in San Francisco over the first six months of the pandemic. METHODS: Community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in San Francisco on March 5, 2020. This report examines the match of the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) COVID-19 testing database and the SFDPH HIV Surveillance case registry from March 24-September 3, 2020. RESULTS: Among 4252 COVID-19 tests performed among PLWH, 4.5% (N=193) were positive for COVID-19, compared to a 3.5% (N=9626) positivity rate among the 272,555 people without HIV tested for COVID-19 (p<0.001). Mean age of those infected with HIV/COVID-19 was 48 years (20-76); 38.9% White, 38.3% Latinx, 11.9% Black; 91.2% were male. Only 54.6% of coinfected PLWH were housed, with the remainder marginally housed. The rate of severe illness with COVID-19 was not increased among PLWH. DISCUSSION: In San Francisco, susceptibility to COVID-19 was increased among PLWH over the first six months of the pandemic, although outcomes were similar to those without HIV. Homelessness and higher rates of congregate living situations among PLWH likely accounted for this disparity. Special efforts to house patients with marginal housing during the COVID-19 pandemic are needed.","output":"COVID-19 Susceptibility and Outcomes among People Living with HIV in San Francisco"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients undergoing fertility treatments, such as in-vitro fertilization (IVF), face unique challenges both physically and mentally With the emergence of the COVID-19 global pandemic, IVF patients began to face additional obstacles as hospitals and clinics shut down in compliance with recommendations for limiting exposure risk In order to assess the impact of COVID-19 on IVF patients, we conducted a qualitative analysis using 563 public Instagram posts collected from three randomly selected days in March 2020 After the exclusion of 354 posts, thematic coding was used to analyze 209 posts Five major themes were identified including (1) the medical and physical experience of IVF, (2) emotional spectrum, (3) sources of social support, (4) coping mechanisms, and (5) education on social media Posts were categorized based on whether COVID-19 was discussed and theme frequencies were compared The majority of patients impacted by the pandemic discussed setbacks to care, such as clinic closures In addition, posts authored by those impacted by COVID-19 contained more negative emotions and fewer positive emotions compared to unaffected users Despite an increase in setbacks and negative emotions, posts offering support nearly tripled in frequency highlighting the resilience of the IVF community Our thematic analysis supports the need for careful consideration of the psychological and social effects of cycle cancellations on the IVF community Experiences and sentiments revealed by this study should be considered when a successive pandemic or global emergency threatens IVF treatment protocols","output":"Trends in Social Media Topics During COVID-19 Among Women Undergoing Assisted Reproductive Technology Treatments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: To assist nurses caring for hospitalized adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the authors synthesize evidence-based information on the disease, providing background on the epidemiology and history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the causative virus.

Among >10 million annual admissions to U.S. jails, approximately 55% of detainees are released back into their communities each week (4); in addition, staff members at correctional and detention facilities are members of their local communities. Thus, high rates of COVID-19 in correctional and detention facilities also have the potential to influence broader community transmission. In March 2020, the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) began implementing surveillance for COVID-19 among correctional and detention facilities in Louisiana and identified cases and outbreaks in many facilities. In response, LDH and CDC developed and deployed the COVID-19 Management Assessment and Response (CMAR) tool to guide technical assistance focused on infection prevention and control policies and case management with correctional and detention facilities. This report describes COVID-19 prevalence in correctional and detention facilities detected through surveillance and findings of the CMAR assessment. During March 25-April 22, 489 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 37 (7.6%) hospitalizations and 10 (2.0%) deaths among incarcerated or detained persons, and 253 cases, including 19 (7.5%) hospitalizations and four (1.6%) deaths among staff members were reported. During April 8-22, CMAR telephone-based assessments were conducted with 13 of 31 (42%) facilities with laboratory-confirmed cases and 11 of 113 (10%) facilities without known cases. Administrators had awareness and overall understanding of CDC guidance for prevention of transmission in these facilities but reported challenges in implementation, related to limited space to quarantine close contacts of COVID-19 patients and inability of incarcerated and detained persons to engage in social distancing, particularly in dormitory-style housing. CMAR was a useful tool that helped state and federal public health officials assist multiple correctional and detention facilities to better manage COVID-19 patients and guide control activities to prevent or mitigate transmission.","output":"Public Health Response to COVID-19 Cases in Correctional and Detention Facilities - Louisiana, March-April 2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose 2020 has proved to be a challenging year In addition to the challenges of COVID-19, yet again, the USA has witnessed police brutality leading to the death of a Black man, George Floyd The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, founded in the US but now an international organisation which challenges white supremacy and deliberates harm against Black people, mobilised hundreds of thousands of people to take to the streets across the globe Increasingly, the protests focus not only on George Floyd's murder but also the continued failure to challenge the celebrity of those involved in the transatlantic slave trade and European imperialism In this article, the author will contend that many organisations are now reexamining their association with these historical wrongs against Black Africa and its diaspora Further, the author will contend but that the failure to highlight the role of Black chattel slavery and imperialism in the accumulation of economic, commercial and political benefits reaped by the global north is a source of shame not only for many firms and institutions but also for universities Design/methodology/approach The author has reviewed the online media for the latest developments in response to Black Lives Matter's George Floyd campaign in 2020 and reviewed the literature on the link between European global ambition and its impact on the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa Findings Internationally, there is a discernible change in outlook towards the importance of the evils of slavery and colonialism on the Black experience today These small steps will require scholars to embark on a fresh reexamination of race, society and work Originality/value For decades, the slave trade and colonialism were issues rarely raised in government, firms and business schools This will inevitably change especially in those countries that are the main beneficiaries of Black chattel slavery and colonial exploitation Much Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) practice is fundamentally tokenism A root and branch reappraisal will be needed to create more effective EDI policy and practice in support of race equality and anti-racism","output":"From slavery and colonialism to Black Lives Matter: new mood music or more fundamental change?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Interleukin-6 signal blockade has shown preliminary beneficial effects in treating aberrant host inflammatory response against SARS-CoV-2 leading to severe respiratory distress.

Setting: Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS as Italian Covid reference center. Participants: Patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and respiratory distress with PaO2/FiO2 ratio<300 treated with Sarilumab between March 23rd - April 4th, 2020. Date of final follow-up was April 18, 2020. Main outcomes and measures: We describe the clinical outcomes of 53 patients with SARS-CoV-2 severe pneumonia treated with intravenous Sarilumab in terms of pulmonary function improvement or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rate in medical wards setting and of live discharge rate in ICU treated patients as well as in terms of safety. Each patient received Sarilumab 400 mg administered intravenously on day 1, with eventual additional infusion based on clinical judgement, and was followed for at least 14 days, unless previously discharged or dead. No gluco-corticosteroids were used at baseline. Results: Of the 53 SARS-CoV-2pos patients receiving Sarilumab, 39 (73.6%) were treated in medical wards (66.7% with a single infusion) while 14 (26.4%) in ICU (92.6% with a second infusion).

As with many human behaviors, peoples vaccine acceptance may be affected by their beliefs about whether others will accept a vaccine (i.e., descriptive norms). However, information about these descriptive norms may have different effects depending on peoples baseline beliefs and the relative importance of conformity, social learning, and free-riding. Here, using a large, pre-registered, randomized experiment (N=437,236) embedded in an international survey, we show that accurate information about descriptive norms can substantially increase intentions to accept a vaccine for COVID-19. These positive effects (e.g., reducing by 5.3% the fraction of people who are unsure or more negative about accepting a vaccine) are largely consistent across the 23 included countries, but are concentrated among people who were otherwise uncertain about accepting a vaccine.

The European Commission is now considering a policy view to commercialize the development and extraction of methane gas from European offshore areas. Affirmation from the European Commission that offshore methane hydrates are too useful and too valuable to forego development could initiate a global response to adopt offshore methane hydrates as a new source of natural gas for heating, for electrical power supplies, and for potential new revenues. The upside? The potential rewards from offshore methane hydrates are multi-fold. Coastal states are surrounded in methane hydrate resources that if responsibly developed could enable vast amounts of methane (natural gas) to be produced for decades or centuries beyond the timelines of conventional natural gas assets. There are also massive volumes of fresh water trapped in hydrates that could aid in fighting droughts and desertification. The downside? There are novel foreseeable risks that might result from those commercial methane hydrate activities. The climate change risks and geo-physical hazards from offshore methane hydrates are quite distinct from both conventional and unconventional hydrocarbons. There are new challenges to achieving safety and sustainability.

Therefore, androgens, particularly testosterone (T), could be suspected as playing a critical role in driving this excess of risk. However, gonadal function in critically ill men is actually unknown, mainly because serum T concentration is not routinely measured in clinical practice, even more in this clinical context. OBJECTIVE: To overview on possible mechanisms by which serum T levels could affect the progression of COVID-19 in men. METHODS: Authors searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Google, and institutional websites for medical subject headings terms and free text words referred to \\"SARS-CoV-2,\\" \\"COVID-19,\\" \\"testosterone,\\" \\"male hypogonadism,\\" \\"gender\\" \\"immune system,\\" \\"obesity,\\" \\"thrombosis\\" until May 19th 2020. RESULTS: T, co-regulating the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 in host cells, may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 internalization. Instead, low serum T levels may predispose to endothelial dysfunction, thrombosis and defective immune response, leading to both impaired viral clearance and systemic inflammation. Obesity, one of the leading causes of severe prognosis in infected patients, is strictly associated with functional hypogonadism, and may consistently strengthen the aforementioned alterations, ultimately predisposing to serious respiratory and systemic consequences. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: T in comparison to estrogen may predispose men to a widespread COVID-19 infection. Low serum levels of T, which should be supposed to characterize the hormonal milieu in seriously ill individuals, may predispose men, especially elderly men, to poor prognosis or death. Further studies are needed to confirm these pathophysiological assumptions and to promptly identify adequate therapeutic strategies.","output":"Worse progression of COVID-19 in men: Is testosterone a key factor?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of coordinating policies on vaccinations at the national level. In Australia, the regulation and management of pharmacist-administered vaccination programs are the responsibility of each of the eight jurisdictions (six states and two territories), and have been developed independently of each other, leading to substantial variation. Consequently, there are variations regarding which vaccines pharmacists can administer, the minimum age, and whether these vaccines are publicly funded. OBJECTIVE(S): To identify opportunities for a nationally consistent approach to pharmacist-administered vaccinations in Australia. METHODS: This policy analysis used the Multiple Streams Framework to identify barriers and enablers within the three streams of problem, policy, and politics, and how they affected the development of a national approach. Data were drawn from semi-structured interviews with 13 key policy actors and documents (pre-budget submissions and parliamentary inquiry reports). Themes were generated around actor interests, current and proposed pharmacist vaccination programs, and policymaking processes. RESULTS: From the pharmacy sector, there was little clarity around the need for a nationally consistent approach. This issue was linked to their ultimate goal of expanding pharmacist vaccination programs; it was seen as a means for states/territories with smaller programs to catch up to other jurisdictions. There was also no unified policy approach from this sector; additionally, decision-makers within jurisdictional health departments faced different service delivery models, policy priorities, agendas, and policy actor relationships. Lastly, there was no federal body that had the capacity to coordinate a national approach. Possible enablers include refining the problem definition and re-framing it to a patient-centric model. CONCLUSIONS: Coordination of vaccination policies is an ongoing policy issue with implications for pharmacist vaccination programs and other health policy areas in which a national approach is being considered. This analysis provides insight into how this may be developed in the future.","output":"The tension between national consistency and jurisdictional professional expansion: The case of pharmacist-administered vaccinations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract In this article we argue that the field of design evolved to include helping organizations address complex problems in the face of uncertainty, but it has yet to build knowledge in a way that formalizes the various activities embraced by the field.

There is scarce of information on acute poisoning in the study area. OBJECTIVE: To assess treatment outcome and the associated factors among patients admitted with acute poisoning at Hiwot Fana Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted. All acutely poisoned patients who had been admitted at the emergency department of Hiwot Fana Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2020 who fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the study were included. Data were collected by review of medical records. Poor treatment outcome of acute poisoning was defined as the acutely poisoned patient was died, or survived with disability. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with the outcome of acute poisoning. RESULT: A total of 175 patients medical records were reviewed. Of these, 150 patients medical records had complete information and were included in the final analysis. The majority of participants 89 (59.3%) were in the age group of 19C37 years. More than half of the participants 86 (57.3%) were females. Organophosphate was the most poisoning agent encountered in 62 cases. Acetaminophen was the predominant drug poisoning agent encountered in 10 participants. Among 30 patients managed with antidote, 18 patients were treated with atropine for organophosphate poisoning. Of all the poisoning cases admitted during the study period, 16.7% died. Participants who were poisoned by themselves were 2.4 times more likely to have poor treatment outcomes than those who were poisoned accidentally: 2.44 (95% confidence interval: 1.10C5.42). The odd of having poor treatment outcome in participants who were poisoned by drugs was 2.13 more likely: 2.13 (95% confidence interval: 1.21C3.32). CONCLUSION: Organophosphate was the predominant cause of acute poisoning encountered in 62 cases. The modes of poisoning and drug poisoning were significant risk factors associated with poor treatment outcomes of acute poisoning.","output":"Treatment outcome and associated factors among patients admitted with acute poisoning in a tertiary hospital in Eastern Ethiopia: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an economically important infectious disease of swine. Constant emergence of variant strains of PRRS virus (PPRSV) and virus-mediated immune evasion followed by viral persistence result in increased incidence and recurrence of PRRS in swine herds. Current live and killed PRRSV vaccines administered by a parenteral route are ineffective in inducing complete protection. Thus, new approaches in design and delivery of PRRSV vaccines are needed to reduce the disease burden of the swine industry. Induction of an effective mucosal immunity to several respiratory pathogens by direct delivery of a vaccine to mucosal sites has proven to be effective in a mouse model. However, there are challenges in eliciting mucosal immunity to PRRS due to our limited understanding of safe and potent mucosal adjuvants, which could potentiate the mucosal immune response to PRRSV. The purpose of this review is to discuss methods for induction of protective mucosal immune responses in the respiratory tract of pigs. The manuscript also discusses how PRRSV modulates innate, adaptive and immunoregulatory responses at both mucosal and systemic sites of infected and/or vaccinated pigs. This information may help in the design of innovative mucosal vaccines to elicit superior cross-protective immunity against divergent field strains of PRRSV.","output":"Mucosal vaccines to prevent porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome: a new perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has affected the global economy like no other crisis in the history of mankind. It forced worldwide lockdown and economic shutdown to the point from where the recovery process has been very difficult. It has affected demand, supply, production and consumption in such a way that the entire economic development cycle has gone to its lowest levels. COVID-19 has also affected the social and economic sustainability structure which has led from one crisis to another and the developing countries have been the worst hit. Economic crisis resulted in unemployment leading to labour migrations, inevitable casualties and rising poverty etc. However, at a certain level, a few industries and organizations have shown resilience with better anticipation and survivability which may lead them to a quicker recovery. The current study aims at presenting a holistic view of organizational resilience which leads to the overall sustainable development. The study considers three aspects of organizational resilience as crisis anticipation, organizational robustness and recoverability. It assesses the impact of the aspects of resilience on social sustainability and economic sustainability. The study uses empirical analysis of primary data which is analysed to verify the hypothesized relationships by using a structural equation modelling approach. The study finds out that predicting the crisis and disruptions, building robustness and recoverability have a positive effect on both the social and economic aspects of sustainability.

The aim of this review was to identify the potential risk of transmission associated with key interventions (chest compressions, defibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation) to inform international treatment recommendations. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review comprising three questions: (1) aerosol generation associated with key interventions; (2) risk of airborne infection transmission associated with key interventions; and (3) the effect of different personal protective equipment strategies. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization COVID-19 database on 24th March 2020. Eligibility criteria were developed individually for each question. We assessed risk of bias for individual studies, and used the GRADE process to assess evidence certainty by outcome. RESULTS: We included eleven studies: two cohort studies, one case control study, five case reports, and three manikin randomised controlled trials. We did not find any direct evidence that chest compressions or defibrillation either are or are not associated with aerosol generation or transmission of infection. Data from manikin studies indicates that donning of personal protective equipment delays treatment delivery. Studies provided only indirect evidence, with no study describing patients with COVID-19. Evidence certainty was low or very low for all outcomes. CONCLUSION: It is uncertain whether chest compressions or defibrillation cause aerosol generation or transmission of COVID-19 to rescuers.

However, it was unclear whether the increases were due to pandemic effects or industry expansion. METHODS: We performed interrupted time series regressions of monthly per capita legal cannabis sales from March 2019 to February 2021, first with national averages, then with provincial/territorial data after adjusting for store density. We considered two interruption alternatives: January 2020, when product variety increased; and March 2020, when pandemic restrictions began. RESULTS: The provincial/territorial regression with the January interruption explained R (2) = 69.6% of within\\\\jurisdiction variation: baseline monthly per capita sales growth averaged $0.21 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15, 0.26), sales immediately dropped in January by $1.02 (95% CI ?1.67, ?0.37), and monthly growth thereafter increased by $0.16 (95% CI 0.06, 0.25). With the March interruption, the regression instead explained 68.7% of variation: baseline sales growth averaged $0.14 (95% CI 0.06, 0.22), there was no immediate drop and growth thereafter increased by $0.22 per month (95% CI 0.08, 0.35). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Increasing cannabis sales during the pandemic was consistent with pre\\\\existing trends and increasing store numbers. The extra increased growth was more aligned with January's new product arrivals than with March's pandemic measures, though the latter cannot be ruled out.

Despite economic progression over the past few years, food insecurity is continuing to affect several vulnerable groups (Orang Asli, elderly, students, B40). It is a growing concern that should not be taken lightly, especially with the recent rise in food prices coupled with low income among vulnerable groups and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As cities develop and expand, they stretch out and occupy former farmlands forcing farms to stop operating or move further off from the city centre. New trends like urban farming are slowly emerging, which have the potential to be a solution to the developing crises of food insecurity. This research aims to determine how relevant each of the factors, confidence (CF), societal (SC), pleasantness (PL), and naturalness (NT), are towards adopting (AD) the idea of urban farming and, if relevant, among which has the most positive impact. A mixed-method approach was used to obtain quantitative and qualitative data. One hundred and thirty-three responses were recorded and used (a significant sample size according to the G-power software). The validity and reliability of the data were also tested to affirm their quality and relevance according to the factors. The main findings revealed that pleasantness and confidence were strong factors for adopting urban farming, in line with Cohens R Square of more than 32%, which signifies a high impact toward influencing adoption. In addition, qualitative analysis shows that while positive outcomes complemented the quantitative study, practical constraints were highlighted. These constraints were space, time, supply chain, resources, tools, community and government support. Hence, this study provides two significant contributions to regulators and policymakers on urban farming (further explained in the discussions section).","output":"The Perception and Degree of Adoption by Urbanites towards Urban Farming"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vaccine hesitancy in healthcare workers has been increasing especially in France while they are the cornerstone of vaccination programs. Greater understanding of healthcare students (HCS) vaccine knowledge, attitudes and beliefs is necessary to provide an adequate vaccination education to better equip them to promote vaccination in their future careers. The aim of this study was to assess vaccination perception (VP) (perception of benefits and risks of vaccines) and its impact on vaccination coverage (VC) for mandatory and recommended vaccines among HCS. METHODS: A standardized, anonymous self-reporting electronic questionnaire was prospectively sent to HCS (medicine, nursing, pharmacy, midwifery, physiotherapy students and 1st year of health sciences students) of Normandy University in France between 18/03/2019 and 8/04/2019. VP was evaluated with questions regarding vaccination hesitancy, safety of vaccine and the benefit/risk balance of vaccination. Global VC (GVC) was defined as being vaccinated according to the mandatory and/or recommended vaccination schedule by national French law in 2018. RESULTS: 542 HCS took part in this survey. VC was high for mandatory (diphtheriae, poliomyelitis, tetanus 93.5%, hepatitis B virus 88.6%) and even most of recommended vaccinations (measles 95%, pertussis 88.2%). Global VC (40.4%) was not statistically different between HCS except for 1st year health sciences students who were less vaccinated (25.6%). Regarding VP, 97.8% of HCS thought that vaccine are effective. When vaccine safety and level of vaccine hesitancy were assessed (on a 0C10 scale, 0: not safe or not hesitant and 10: completely safe and strongly hesitant for vaccine), 91% of respondents stated that vaccine safety is 7 and in 80% the vaccine hesitancy was < 3. There was no difference among student categories. 80.6% of HCS recommended all vaccines but only 52% agreed that flu vaccination should be mandatory for HCS. In the multivariate analysis, being a 1st year health care sciences student was associated with a lower GVC (OR 95% CI = 2 [1.2C3.3], p = 0.004) than being a medical student.

However, it is still a matter of debate whether the lead extraction procedure is a safe treatment choice in the elderly. METHODS We collected the clinical information from 3,810 patients undergoing TLE in 2 high-volume centers (Poland and Italy) between 2006 and 2017. We tested risk factors, effectiveness, safety and long-term survival in 3 groups of patients: those aged 80-89.99 years, 90 years and 30-79.99 years. RESULTS Lower BMI, lower levels of hemoglobin and more comorbidities characterized the patients, whose ages ranged from 80 to 89.99 years. Those aged 90 years most often had single-chamber pacemakers. Octogenarians and nonagenarians were more often undergoing TLE due to infectious indications (57.19 and 74.29 vs. 45.35% in younger individuals). Lead age and the number of leads extracted were comparable in the 3 groups. In octogenarians, leads were more often removed using standard extraction techniques: simple traction and mechanical dilatators, whereas in nonagenarians TLE was more complex. The duration of the procedure was shorter in older patients, while clinical and procedural effectiveness was similar to that in younger individuals. The rate of major complications related to TLE did not differ between octogenarians and younger subjects (2.0 vs. 1.38%, p = ns), and the number of procedure-related risk factors was smaller in older people. Nonagenarians did not develop any major complication related to TLE. Long-term mortality after TLE was similar among octogenarians and nonagenarians (39.67 and 40.00%) but higher than in younger patients (24.41; p < 0.001 and 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Lead extraction procedures appear effective and safe in octogenarians and nonagenarians, comparable to younger individuals. Procedure-related risk in the elderly is not associated with most of the typical risk factors encountered in younger subjects, but only with the higher number of pacemaker, implantable cardiac defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy device procedures before TLE. Long-term survival after TLE was found to be similar among octogenarians and nonagenarians being about 60% at over 3 years of follow-up. Age alone should not be considered a risk factor for the occurrence of major complications or procedure-related death, and therefore it should not prevent candidacy for TLE.","output":"Risk Factors and Long-Term Survival of Octogenarians and Nonagenarians Undergoing Transvenous Lead Extraction Procedures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The infection of health care workers during the 2013 to 2016 Ebola outbreak raised concerns about fomite transmission. In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, investigations are ongoing to determine the role of fomites in coronavirus transmission as well. The bacteriophage phi 6 has a phospholipid envelope and is commonly used in environmental studies as a surrogate for human enveloped viruses. The persistence of phi 6 was evaluated as a surrogate for Ebola virus (EBOV) and coronaviruses on porous and nonporous hospital surfaces. Phi 6 was suspended in a body fluid simulant and inoculated onto 1-cm2 coupons of steel, plastic, and two fabric curtain types. The coupons were placed at two controlled absolute humidity (AH) levels: a low AH of 3.0 g/m3 and a high AH of 14.4 g/m3 Phi 6 declined at a lower rate on all materials under low-AH conditions, with a decay rate of 0.06-log10 PFU/day to 0.11-log10 PFU/day, than under the higher AH conditions, with a decay rate of 0.65-log10 PFU/h to 1.42-log10 PFU/day. There was a significant difference in decay rates between porous and nonporous surfaces at both low AH (P < 0.0001) and high AH (P < 0.0001). Under these laboratory-simulated conditions, phi 6 was found to be a conservative surrogate for EBOV under low-AH conditions in that it persisted longer than Ebola virus in similar AH conditions. Additionally, some coronaviruses persist longer than phi 6 under similar conditions; therefore, phi 6 may not be a suitable surrogate for coronaviruses.IMPORTANCE Understanding the persistence of enveloped viruses helps inform infection control practices and procedures in health care facilities and community settings. These data convey to public health investigators that enveloped viruses can persist and remain infective on surfaces, thus demonstrating a potential risk for transmission. Under these laboratory-simulated Western indoor hospital conditions, we assessed the suitability of phi 6 as a surrogate for environmental persistence research related to enveloped viruses, including EBOV and coronaviruses.","output":"Persistence of Bacteriophage Phi 6 on Porous and Nonporous Surfaces and the Potential for Its Use as an Ebola Virus or Coronavirus Surrogate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking may increase the risk of COVID-19 complications, reinforcing the urgency of smoking cessation in populations with high smoking prevalence such as individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Whether the COVID-19 pandemic has altered perceptions, motivation to quit, or tobacco use among cigarette smokers and nicotine e-cigarette vapers with OUD is unknown. METHODS: A telephone survey was conducted in March-July 2020 of current cigarette smokers or nicotine vapers with OUD who were stable on buprenorphine treatment at five Boston (MA) area community health centers. The survey assessed respondents' perceived risk of COVID-19 due to smoking or vaping, interest in quitting, quit attempts and change in tobacco consumption during the pandemic. RESULTS: 222/520 patients (43 %) completed the survey, and 145 were asked questions related to COVID-19. Of these, 61 % smoked cigarettes only, 13 % vaped nicotine only, and 26 % were dual users. Nearly 80 % of participants believed that smoking and vaping increased their risk of COVID-19 infection or complications. Smokers with this belief reported an increased interest in quitting (AOR 4.6, 95 % CI:1.7-12.4). Overall, 49 % of smokers and 42 % of vapers reported increased interest in quitting due to the pandemic; 24 % and 20 %, respectively, reported attempting to quit since the pandemic. However, 35 % of smokers and 27 % of vapers reported increasing smoking and vaping, respectively, during the pandemic.

The expressions of genes related to non-specific immune cells and cytokines were markedly up-regulated and those associated with cellular immune were dramatically down-regulated. In VTE patients, cytological examination indicated the functions of NK cells were significantly compromised, and the antigen recognition and killing function of T cells markedly decreased. The consistence between genomic and cytological examination suggests the symptomatic VTE is closely associated with the infection and immune dysfunction.","output":"Symptomatic Venous Thromboembolism Is a Disease Related to Infection and Immune Dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nation-states are scrambling to limit damage as the coronavirus spreads, triggering lockdowns of millions of people, high unemployment rates, food shortages, a lack of medical supplies, shrinking GDP, and high mortality rates Not surprisingly, there has also been a direct impact on the JASand Cambridge University Press more generally Because of public health concerns for the workers who produce and transport the materials for printed copies of the journal, and the fact that global supply chains are unable to function at this unprecedented time, there will be delays in printing the JAS Joseph Seeley and Aaron Skabelund provide an analysis of zoological gardens as part of the discursive and institutional practices of Japanese colonial power in Seoul and Taipei in the early decades of the twentieth century ","output":"Editorial Foreword"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in an attempt to systematically collect and evaluate the associations of epidemiological, comorbidity factors with the severity and prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

This disease burden is linked to the pathogen's intrinsic antibiotic-resistance and protected intracellular localization in alveolar macrophages. Current treatment regimens require several antibiotics with multi-month oral and intravenous administrations that are difficult to implement in the developing world. Herein, we report that a macrophage-targeted polyciprofloxacin prodrug acts as a surprisingly effective pre-exposure prophylactic in highly lethal murine models of aerosolized human pulmonary melioidosis. A single dose of the polymeric prodrug maintained high lung drug levels and targeted an intracellular depot of ciprofloxacin to the alveolar macrophage compartment that was sustained over a period of 7 days above minimal inhibitory concentrations. This intracellular pharmacokinetic profile provided complete pre-exposure protection in a BSL-3 model with a drug-resistant, aerosolized clinical isolate of Burkholderia pseudomallei from Thailand. This total protection was achieved despite the bacteria's intrinsic resistance to ciprofloxacin and where an equivalent dose of pulmonary-administered ciprofloxacin was ineffective. For the first time, we demonstrate that targeting the intracellular macrophage compartment with extended antibiotic dosing can achieve pre-exposure prophylaxis in a model of pulmonary melioidosis. This fully synthetic and modular therapeutic platform could be an important therapeutic approach with new or re-purposed antibiotics for melioidosis prevention and treatment, especially as portable inhalation devices in high-risk, resource-poor settings.","output":"A macrophage-targeted platform for extending drug dosing with polymer prodrugs for pulmonary infection prophylaxis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has altered the usual practice of medicine and the state of emergency declared in Spain on March 14th has considerably changed the activity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) units. The aim of this study was to evaluate the consequences of COVID-19 on the IBD Unit's activity and provide information on restructuring with available resources. METHODS: an observational study was performed in a referral hospital in Madrid (Spain). Type of appointment, loss of follow-up, hospital admission, treatment changes, endoscopic activity, surgeries and blood tests were evaluated between March 15th and May 15th, 2020. This data was compared with the usual activity a year before. RESULTS: among the 510 patients included, 476 (93.33 %) received had a remote consultation, representing an increase of 92.38 % compared with the previous year (0.95 %). There was a loss of follow-up in 26 patients (5.1 %) vs 15 (3.58 %) the previous year. A total of 60 (35.09 %) blood tests, 64 (76.19 %) endoscopies and all scheduled surgeries were suspended. Besides, 484 (94.9 %) patients remained adherent vs 417/419 (99.5 %) in the pre-pandemic period and 48 (9.41 %) reported symptoms of an IBD flare. Thirty-nine (7.6 %) patients developed symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: a large number of tests and on-site outpatient visit consultations were suspended. However, a rapid adaptation to telemedicine allowed these patients to be closely followed up.

MATERIALS & METHODS: In a COVID-19 ICU-patient, the tongue became grotesquely swollen, hardened and protruding from the oral cavity after 20 h of mechanical ventilation uninterrupted in the prone position. To assess the doubtful viability of the tongue, pulse-oximetric hemoglobin O2-saturation (SpO2; Nellcor, OxiMax MAX-NI, Covidien, MA, USA) and NIRS-based, regional tissue O2-saturation measurements (rSO2; SenSmart, Nonin, MN, USA) were performed at the tongue. RESULTS: At the tongue, regular pulse-oximetric waveforms with a pulse-oximetric hemoglobin O2-saturation (SpO2) of 88% were recorded, i.e. only slightly lower than the SpO2 reading at the extremities at that time (90%). Lingual NIRS-based rSO2 measurements yielded stable tissue rSO2-values of 76-78%, i.e. values expected also in other adequately perfused and oxygenated (muscle-) tissues. CONCLUSION: Despite the alarming, clinical finding of a grotesquely swollen, rubber-hard tongue and clinical concerns on the adequacy of the tongue perfusion and oxygenation, our measurements of both arterial pulsatility (SpO2) and NIRS-based tissue oxygenation (rSO2) suggested adequate perfusion and oxygenation of the tongue, rendering non-vitality of the tongue, e.g. by lingual venous thrombosis, unlikely.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Type Specific Primer based one step RT-PCR (TSP-PCR) test to distinguish the L and S type strains of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for viral genome sequencing, was developed. The study also analyzed 18,221 whole genome sequences (WGS) available up to April 2020 to know the prevalence of L and S type of strains. Phylogenetic and recombination analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome with nearest animal and human coronaviruses were analyzed using MEGA X and SimPlot version 3.5.1 software respectively. RESULTS: The rapid TSP-PCR distinguished the L and S type strains of SARS-CoV-2 by amplifying a specific 326 bp and 256 bp fragment of the L and S type strain respectively. The test was used to analyzed 120 random SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from Assam, India among which 118 were found to be of L-type strains only. On analysis of 18,221 WGS, it was found that L type was the predominant strain with an overall prevalence 90%. However, pockets of high prevalence of S-type strains (>35%) were still in circulation in Washington region in April 2020. The study did not detect any significant recombination events between closely related coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: TSP-based PCR for identification of circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2, will add in rapid identification of strains of COVID-19 pandemic to understand the spread of the virus, its transmissibility and adaptation into human population. Though, the S-type strains have decreased drastically across the globe since April 2020, the role of TSP-PCR in geographical niches where such strains are still prevalent may help in rapidly distinguishing the strains and study its evolution.","output":"TSP-based PCR for rapid identification of L and S type strains of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Web-based videoconferencing has gained a great momentum worldwide, with extremely high adoption rates during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The points in favor of the discipline were, mainly up-gradation of the specialty of microbiology in terms of learning, skill development, infrastructure, networking & research opportunities related to COVID-19. While the main points against were, nerve wracking work load without much acknowledgement, performance pressure from hospital administration to maintain rapid turnaround time, and a forceful neglect of all other infectious diseases like tuberculosis and antimicrobial resistance which were the key battle fields of the medical microbiologists. Postgraduate & even undergraduate training programs got completely derailed to their disadvantage. By the end of the debate, it was concluded that COVID-19 was neither a boon nor a bane to the microbiologists. A balanced approach to the problem in hand is required without ignoring the pre-existing infectious diseases in our country.

Twenty-two (22) patients in total fulfilled the inclusion criteria and are included in this report. Patients' socio-demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory parameters outcomes as well as treatment modalities employed were extracted from their respective medical records and analyzed using STATA version 14. Dyspnoea, fever and cough were most common associated symptoms. The mean duration of admission at the ICU was 4.1  3.0 days with five deaths (22.7%). About 91% (20/22) had at least one comorbidity with hypertension as the most prevalent. The median oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) level was significantly higher in persons with only COVID-19 pneumonia compared to those with complicated respiratory failure (p<0.001).

Increasing amounts of temporal network data are now becoming available to study such spreading processes of behaviours, opinions, ideas, diseases and innovations to test hypotheses regarding their specific properties. To this end, we here present a methodology based on doseCresponse functions and hypothesis testing using surrogate data models that randomise most aspects of the empirical data while conserving certain structures relevant to contagion, group or homophily dynamics. We demonstrate this methodology for synthetic temporal network data of spreading processes generated by the adaptive voter model.

This data set provides a physically-close-contact network between several hundreds of university students participating in the study over the course of 3 months. We study the potential spreading dynamics of the health-related behaviour regularly going to the fitness studio on this network. Based on a hierarchy of surrogate data models, we find that our method neither provides significant evidence for an influence of a doseCresponse-type network spreading process in this data set, nor significant evidence for homophily. The empirical dynamics in exercise behaviour are likely better described by individual features such as the disposition towards the behaviour, and the persistence to maintain it, as well as external influences affecting the whole group, and the non-trivial network structure.

The aim of our work is to evaluate the prognostic role of sarcopenia in patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Materials and Methods 272 COVID-19 patients admitted to the University Hospital of Modena (Italy) from February 2020 to January 2021 were retrospectively studied. All included patients underwent a chest computed tomography (CT) scan to assess pneumonia during their hospitalization and showed a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test. Sarcopenia was defined by skeletal muscle area (SMA) evaluation at the 12th thoracic vertebra (T12). Clinical, laboratory data and adverse clinical outcome (admission to Intensive Care Unit and death) were collected for all patients. Results prevalence of sarcopenia was high (41,5%) but significantly different in each pandemic wave (57,9% vs 21,6% p<0,0000). At the multivariate analysis, sarcopenia during the first wave (Hazard Ratio 2,29, 95% confidence intervals1,17 to 4,49 p=0,0162) was the only independent prognostic factor for adverse clinical outcome. There were no significant differences in comorbidities and COVID19 severity in terms of pulmonary involvement at lung CT comparing during the first and second wave.

METHODS This study included the initial 65 consecutive patients with small renal tumors who had undergone RAPN at our institution. A single trained surgeon with extensive experience in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, but not in laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, performed RAPN for all patients using the da Vinci Xi. The learning curve was analyzed by examining the perioperative outcomes among five groups each consisting of 13 consecutive patients. RESULTS In this series, the median tumor size and R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score were 23 mm and 7, respectively, and the median console time and warm ischemia time (WIT) were 116 and 15 minutes, respectively. Fifty-eight patients (89.2%) achieved trifecta outcomes, meaning that the ischemic time was 25 minutes, there was a negative surgical margin, and no major postoperative complications occurred. Although there were no significant changes in R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry scores over time, increased surgeon experience was significantly associated with a shorter console time and WIT. Drawing logarithmic approximation curves enabled the achievement of a console time 150 minutes and WIT 20 minutes at the sixth and fourth procedures, respectively. Furthermore, multivariate analysis identified an independent correlation between surgeon experience with WIT, but not with console time. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that regardless of a surgeon's prior experience in laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, an experienced robotic surgeon can perform RAPN using the da Vinci Xi with acceptable perioperative outcomes after a small number of procedures.","output":"Initial learning curve for robot-assisted partial nephrectomy performed by a single experienced robotic surgeon."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT This narrative follows an ongoing open-form process group in an abstinence-based sober-living house as residents deal with the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, interpersonal difficulties, and maintenance of recovery from Substance Use Disorder The story illustrates the role development, role conflict, and role demand that group social workers experience and highlights a new social worker's transition from professional anxiety and rigidity to spontaneity, nuance, and confidence in his practice (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"The group worker becoming: Moving from anxiety to spontaneity with the guys"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence and epidemiological risk factors of olfactory and/or taste disorder (OTD), in particular isolated OTD, in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection METHODS: We conducted a retrospective and cross-sectional study Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) Singapore between 24 March 2020 and 16 April 2020 The electronic health records of these patients were accessed, and demographic data and symptoms reported (respiratory, self-reported OTD and other symptoms such as headache, myalgia and lethargy) were collected RESULTS: A total of 1065 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were recruited Overall, the prevalence of OTD was 12 6% Twelve patients (1 1%) had isolated OTD The top three symptoms associated with OTD were cough, fever and sore throat The symptoms of runny nose and blocked nose were experienced by only 29 8 and 19 3% of patients, respectively Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the female gender, presence of blocked nose and absence of fever were significantly associated with OTD (adjusted relative risks 1 77, 3 31, 0 42, respectively) All these factors were statistically significant CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 infection can present with OTD, either in isolation or in combination with other general symptoms Certain demographic profile, such as being female, and symptomatology such as the presence of blocked nose and absence of fever, were more likely to have OTD when infected by COVID-19 Further studies to elucidate the pathophysiology of OTD in these patients will be beneficial","output":"Olfactory taste disorder as a presenting symptom of COVID-19: a large single-center Singapore study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is revealing the deeply entrenched structural inequities in health that exist in the United States.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the nurse-patient (N:P) ratio required by COVID-19 patients and to identify the factors that influence nursing in this context. DESIGN: This study was a retrospective observational study that evaluated the N:P ratio using the Nursing Activities Score (NAS). SETTING: Three Belgian French-speaking hospitals, including five ICUs. Patients included COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients in the ICU. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The study included 95 COVID-19 patients and 1,604 non-COVID-19 patients (control group) resulting in 905 and 5,453 NAS measures, respectively. The NAS was significantly higher among the COVID-19 patients than in the control group (p=<0.0001). In the COVID-19 group, these higher scores were also observed per shift and uniformly across the three hospitals. COVID-19 patients required more time in the activities of monitoring and titration (2= 457.60, p=<0.0001), mobilisation (2= 161.21, p=<0.0001), and hygiene (2= 557.77, p=<0.0001). Factors influencing nursing time measured by NAS in the COVID-19 patients were age < 65 years old (p=0.23), the use of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (p=0.002), a high APACHE II score (p=0.006), and patient death (p=0.002). A COVID-19 diagnosis was independently associated with an increase in nursing time (OR=4.8, 95% CI:3.6-6.4).

The aim of this study was to examine how the general public's trust relates to their attitudes towards uses of health data. METHODS A stratified sample from the general Swedish population received a questionnaire about their willingness to share health data. Respondents were also asked about their trust in the management and protection of electronic health data. RESULTS A large majority (81.9%) of respondents revealed high levels of trust in the ability of healthcare to protect electronic patient data. Good health was associated with significantly higher levels of trust compared to bad health. Respondents with low levels of trust were significantly less willing to allow personal data to be used for different purposes and were more inclined to insist on being asked for permission beforehand. Those with low levels of trust also perceived risks of unauthorized access to personal data to be higher and the likely damage of such unauthorized access worse, compared to those with high levels of trust. CONCLUSIONS Trust in the ability of healthcare to protect electronic health is generally high in Sweden. Those with higher levels of trust are more willing to let their data be used, including without informed consent. It thus seems crucial to promote trust in order to be able to reap the benefits that digitalization makes possible through increased access and use of data in healthcare.","output":"Trust and digital privacy in healthcare: a cross-sectional descriptive study of trust and attitudes towards uses of electronic health data among the general public in Sweden."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic is challenging medical and surgical activities.

We collected patient\\\\level information regarding demographics, insurance status, comorbidities, level of care, and mortality using a structured chart review. We compared characteristics of patients categorized by (1) home discharge, (2) general hospital ward admission, and (3) intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death within 30 days of the index visit. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to report odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) between hospital admission versus ED discharge home and between ICU care versus general hospital ward admission. RESULTS: In total, 994 patients who presented to the ED with symptoms were included in the analysis with 551 (55.4%) patients discharged home, 314 (31.6%) patients admitted to the general hospital ward, and 129 (13.0%) admitted to the ICU or dying. Patients requiring admission were more likely to be Black or to have public insurance (Medicaid and/or Medicare). Patients who were admitted to the ICU or dying were more likely aged  65 years or male. In multivariable logistic regression, old age, public insurance, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, heart failure, and hyperlipidemia were independent predictors of hospital admission. When comparing those who needed ICU care versus general hospital ward admission in univariate logistic regression, patients with Medicaid (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2C4.6), Medicare (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.1C8.4), Medicaid and Medicare (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.4C7.7), history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2C4.2), hypertension (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1C2.7), and heart failure (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.4C4.7) were more likely to be admitted into the ICU or die; Black (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.4C2.9) and Hispanic/Latino (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.6C1.8) patients were less likely to be admitted into the ICU; however, the associations were not statistically significant. In multivariable logistic regression, old age, male sex, public insurance, and heart failure were independent predictors of ICU care/death.

Design Multicentric prospective cohort study. Setting Surgery room. Patients ASA I-II undergoing elective surgery. Measurements The authors designed a closed loop system that implements a control algorithm based on anesthetic depth monitoring and the Patient State Index (PSITM) of the SEDLine monitor for propofol, and on hemodynamic variables for remifentanil. The measurement of clinical performance was made based on the percentage of PSITM maintenance time in the range 20-50. Precision analysis was evaluated by measuring median performance error (MDPE) can be defined as the median difference between actual and desired values, which refers to the degree of precision in which the controller is able to maintain the control variable within the objective set by the anesthesiologist; it represents the direction (over-prediction or under-prediction) of performance error (PE) rather than size of errors, which is represented by MDAPE, median absolute percentage error, Wobble index, which is used for measuring the intrasubject variability in performance error.

DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective, observational study. SETTING: Ten tertiary referral university and community hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with confirmed severe COVID-19-related ARDS. INTERVENTIONS: Venovenous or venoarterial ECMO. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two patients (mean age 51.1  9.7 years, female 17.4%) were treated with ECMO for confirmed severe COVID-19-related ARDS. Before ECMO, the mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 10.1  4.4, mean pH was 7.23  0.09, and mean PaO2/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio was 77  50 mmHg. Venovenous ECMO was adopted in 122 patients (92.4%) and venoarterial ECMO in ten patients (7.6%) (mean duration, 14.6  11.0 days). Sixty-three (47.7%) patients died on ECMO and 70 (53.0%) during the index hospitalization. Six-month all-cause mortality was 53.0%. Advanced age (per year, hazard ratio [HR] 1.026, 95% CI 1.000-1-052) and low arterial pH (per unit, HR 0.006, 95% CI 0.000-0.083) before ECMO were the only baseline variables associated with increased risk of six-month mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggested that about half of adult patients with severe COVID-19-related ARDS can be managed successfully with ECMO with sustained results at six months. Decreased arterial pH before ECMO was associated significantly with early mortality. Therefore, the authors hypothesized that initiation of ECMO therapy before severe metabolic derangements subset may improve survival rates significantly in these patients.

High-performing and energy-efficient spin functionalities have been proposed, often relying on current-driven manipulation and detection of the spin states. In this regard, metallic vdW magnets are expected to have several advantages over the widely-studied insulating counterparts, but have not been much explored due to the lack of suitable materials. Here, we report tunable itinerant ferro- and antiferromagnetism in Co-doped Fe4GeTe2 utilizing the vdW interlayer coupling, extremely sensitive to the material composition. This leads to high TN antiferromagnetism of TN ~ 226 K in a bulk and ~210 K in 8 nm-thick nanoflakes, together with tunable magnetic anisotropy. The resulting spin configurations and orientations are sensitively controlled by doping, magnetic field, and thickness, which are effectively read out by electrical conduction.

Many works have been published on the linguistic profile of various clinical populations, but very few papers have been devoted to linguistic changes in patients with eating disorders. Patients with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) share similar psychological features such as disturbances in self-perceived body image, inflexible and obsessive thinking and anxious or depressive traits. We hypothesize that these characteristics can result in altered linguistic patterns and be detected using the Natural Language Processing tools. METHODS: We enrolled 51 young participants from December 2019 to February 2020 (age range: 14C18): 17 girls with a clinical diagnosis of AN, and 34 normal-weighted peers, matched by gender, age and educational level. Participants in each group were asked to produce three written texts (around 10C15 lines long). A rich set of linguistic features was extracted from the text samples and the statistical significance in pinpointing the pathological process was measured. RESULTS: Comparison between the two groups showed several linguistics indexes as statistically significant, with syntactic reduction as the most relevant trait of AN productions. In particular, the following features emerge as statistically significant in distinguishing AN girls and their normal-weighted peers: the length of the sentences, the complexity of the noun phrase, and the global syntactic complexity. This peculiar pattern of linguistic erosion may be due to the severe metabolic impairment also affecting the central nervous system in AN. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data showed the existence of linguistic parameters as probable linguistic markers of AN. However, the analysis of a bigger cohort, still ongoing, is needed to consolidate this assumption. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE III: Evidence obtained from caseCcontrol analytic studies.

Hyperinflammation and high levels of several cytokines, for example, IL-6, are observed in severe COVID-19 cases. However, little is known about the cellular origin of these cytokines. Here, we investigated whether circulating leukocytes from patients with COVID-19 had spontaneous cytokine production. Patients with hyperinflammatory COVID-19 (n = 6) and sepsis (n = 3) were included at Sk?ne University Hospital, Sweden. Healthy controls were also recruited (n = 5). Cytokines were measured in COVID-19 and sepsis patients using an Immulite immunoassay system. PBMCs were cultured with brefeldin A to allow cytokine accumulation. In parallel, LPS was used as an activator. Cells were analyzed for cytokines and surface markers by flow cytometry. High levels of IL-6 and measurable levels of IL-8 and TNF, but not IL-1?, were observed in COVID-19 patients. Monocytes from COVID-19 patients had spontaneous production of IL-1? and IL-8 (P = 0.0043), but not of TNF and IL-6, compared to controls. No spontaneous cytokine production was seen in lymphocytes from either patients or controls. Activation with LPS resulted in massive cytokine production by monocytes from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, but not from sepsis patients. Finally, monocytes from COVID-19 patients produced more IL-1? than from healthy controls (P = 0.0087) when activated. In conclusion, monocytes contribute partly to the ongoing hyperinflammation by production of IL-1? and IL-8. Additionally, they are responsive to further activation. This data supports the notion of IL-1? blockade in treatment of COVID-19.

Exacerbations of asthma have been associated with bacterial and viral respiratory tract infections and air pollution. We correlated the asthma admission rates with fluctuations in respiratory virus activity and traffic-related air pollution, namely particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter  10 m (PM(10)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), and ozone (O(3)). A probabilistic risk assessment framework was developed based on a detrended fluctuation analysis to predict future respiratory virus and air pollutant associated asthma incidence. Results indicated a strong association between asthma admission rate and influenza (r = 0.80, p < 0.05) and SO(2) level (r = 0.73, p < 0.05) in Taiwan in the period 2001C2008. No significant correlation was found for asthma admission and PM(10), O(3), NO(2), and CO. The proposed fluctuation analysis provides a simple correlation exponent describing the complex interactions of respiratory viruses and air pollutants with asthma. This study revealed that there was a 95% probability of having exceeded 2987 asthma admissions per 100,000 population. It was unlikely (30% probability) that the asthma admission rate exceeded 3492 per 100,000 population.

However, these are typically confined to wealthy, developed countries; or, to the national reference laboratories of developing-world countries. There are many infectious diseases that are endemic in low-resource settings (LRS) where the lack of simple, instrument-free, NA diagnostic tests is a critical barrier to timely treatment. One of the primary barriers to the practicality and availability of NA assays in LRS has been the complexity and power requirements of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrumentation (another is sample preparation). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this article, we investigate the hypothesis that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays. We assess the heater's equivalence to commercially available PCR instruments through the characterization of the temperature profiles produced, and a minimal method comparison. Versions of the prototype for several different isothermal techniques are presented. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays, and that the results of those assays are not significantly different from ones incubated in parallel in commercially available PCR instruments. These results clearly suggest the potential of the non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification (NINA) heater for molecular diagnostics in LRS. When combined with other innovations in development that eliminate power requirements for sample preparation, cold reagent storage, and readout, the NINA heater will comprise part of a kit that should enable electricity-free NA testing for many important analytes.","output":"A Simple, Inexpensive Device for Nucleic Acid Amplification without ElectricityToward Instrument-Free Molecular Diagnostics in Low-Resource Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and shortage of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), hospitals implemented inpatient telemedicine measures to ensure operational readiness and a safe working environment for clinicians. The utility and sustainability of inpatient telemedicine initiatives need to be evaluated as the number of COVID-19 inpatients is expected to continue declining. In this viewpoint, we describe the use of a rapidly deployed inpatient telemedicine workflow at a large academic medical center and discuss the potential impact on PPE savings. In early 2020, videoconferencing software was installed on patient bedside iPads at two academic medical center teaching hospitals. An internal website allowed providers to initiate video calls with patients in any patient room with an activated iPad, including both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Patients were encouraged to use telemedicine technology to connect with loved ones via native apps or videoconferencing software. We evaluated the use of telemedicine technology on patients' bedside iPads by monitoring traffic to the internal website. Between May 2020 and March 2021, there were a total of 1240 active users of the Video Visits website (mean 112.7, SD 49.0 connection events per month). Of these, 133 (10.7%) connections were made. Patients initiated 63 (47.4%) video calls with family or friends and sent 37 (27.8%) emails with videoconference connection instructions. Providers initiated a total of 33 (24.8%) video calls with the majority of calls initiated in August (n=22, 67%). There was a low level of adoption of inpatient telemedicine capability by providers and patients. With sufficient availability of PPE, inpatient providers did not find a frequent need to use the bedside telemedicine technology, despite a high census of patients with COVID-19. Compared to providers, patients used videoconferencing capabilities more frequently in September and October 2020.

We focus on two federally regulated pollutants, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Observed concentrations at all available ground monitoring sites (240 and 480 for NO2 and PM2.5, respectively) were compared between April 2020 and April of the prior five years, 2015-2019, as the baseline. Large statistically significant decreases in NO2 concentrations were found at more than 65% of the monitoring sites, with an average drop of 2 ppb when compared to the mean of the previous five years. The same patterns are confirmed by satellite-derived NO2 column totals from NASA OMI. PM2.5 concentrations from the ground monitoring sites, however, were more likely to be higher. The second goal of this study is to explain the different responses of the two pollutants during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hypothesis put forward is that the shelter-in-place measures affected peoples' driving patterns most dramatically, thus passenger vehicle NO2 emissions were reduced. Commercial vehicles and electricity demand for all purposes remained relatively unchanged, thus PM2.5 concentrations did not drop significantly. To establish a correlation between the observed NO2 changes and the extent to which people were sheltering in place, we use a mobility index, which was produced and made public by Descartes Labs. This mobility index aggregates cell phone usage at the county level to capture changes in human movement over time. We found a strong correlation between the observed decreases in NO2 concentrations and decreases in human mobility. By contrast, no discernible pattern was detected between mobility and PM2.5 concentrations changes, suggesting that decreases in personal-vehicle traffic alone may not be effective at reducing PM2.5 pollution.","output":"Changes in air quality and human mobility in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) is one of the molecular targets for drug design. Effective vaccines have been identified as a long-term solution but the rate at which they are being administered is slow in several countries, and mutations of SARS-CoV-2 could render them less effective. Moreover, remdesivir seems to work only with some types of COVID-19 patients. Hence, the continuous investigation of new treatments for this disease is pivotal. This study investigated the inhibitory role of natural products against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) as repurposable agents in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Through in silico approach, selected flavonoids were docked into the active site of M(pro). The free energies of the ligands complexed with M(pro) were computationally estimated using the molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) method. In addition, the inhibition process of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with these ligands was simulated at 100 ns in order to uncover the dynamic behavior and complex stability. The docking results showed that the selected flavonoids exhibited good poses in the binding domain of M(pro). The amino acid residues involved in the binding of the selected ligands correlated well with the residues involved with the mechanism-based inhibitor (N3) and the docking score of Quercetin-3-O-Neohesperidoside (?16.8 Kcal/mol) ranked efficiently with this inhibitor (?16.5 Kcal/mol). In addition, single-structure MM/GBSA rescoring method showed that Quercetin-3-O-Neohesperidoside (?87.60 Kcal/mol) is more energetically favored than N3 (?80.88 Kcal/mol) and other ligands (Myricetin 3-Rutinoside (?87.50 Kcal/mol), Quercetin 3-Rhamnoside (?80.17 Kcal/mol), Rutin (?58.98 Kcal/mol), and Myricitrin (?49.22 Kcal/mol). The molecular dynamics simulation (MDs) pinpointed the stability of these complexes over the course of 100 ns with reduced RMSD and RMSF. Based on the docking results and energy calculation, together with the RMSD of 1.98  0.19 ? and RMSF of 1.00  0.51 ?, Quercetin-3-O-Neohesperidoside is a better inhibitor of M(pro) compared to N3 and other selected ligands and can be repurposed as a drug candidate for the treatment of COVID-19. In addition, this study demonstrated that in silico docking, free energy calculations, and MDs, respectively, are applicable to estimating the interaction, energetics, and dynamic behavior of molecular targets by natural products and can be used to direct the development of novel target function modulators.","output":"Development of Effective Therapeutic Molecule from Natural Sources against Coronavirus Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) care apps are a promising technology to monitor and control health individually and cost-effectively with a technology that is widely used, affordable, and ubiquitous in many peoples lives.

While this is an important aspect for the prevention of future chronic diseases, the burdened health care systems worldwide may directly profit from the use of therapy apps by those patients already in need of medical treatment and monitoring. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the factors influencing the acceptance of lifestyle and therapy apps to better understand what drives and hinders the use of mHealth apps. METHODS: We applied the established unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) technology acceptance model to evaluate mHealth apps via an online questionnaire with 707 German participants. Moreover, trust and privacy concerns were added to the model and, in a between-subject study design, the influence of these predictors on behavioral intention to use apps was compared between lifestyle and therapy apps. RESULTS: The results show that the model only weakly predicted the intention to use mHealth apps (R(2)=0.019). Only hedonic motivation was a significant predictor of behavioral intentions regarding both app types, as determined by path coefficients of the model (lifestyle: 0.196, P=.004; therapy: 0.344, P<.001). Habit influenced the behavioral intention to use lifestyle apps (0.272, P<.001), while social influence (0.185, P<.001) and trust (0.273, P<.001) predicted the intention to use therapy apps. A further exploratory correlation analysis of the relationship between user factors on behavioral intention was calculated. Health app familiarity showed the strongest correlation to the intention to use (r=0.469, P<.001), stressing the importance of experience. Also, age (r=C0.15, P=.004), gender (r=C0.075, P=.048), education level (r=0.088, P=.02), app familiarity (r=0.142, P=.007), digital health literacy (r=0.215, P<.001), privacy disposition (r=C0.194, P>.001), and the propensity to trust apps (r=0.191, P>.001) correlated weakly with behavioral intention to use mHealth apps.

Examination of the reproductive tract revealed the presence of a large mass attached to the uterine wall via a wide and short peduncle in both cases. The mass expanded into the uterine lumen in the mare and into the abdomen in the cow. Both masses were removed using a minimally invasive endoscopic approach and a vessel-sealing and dividing device. RESULTS Minimally invasive surgical resection of a subserosal and a submucosal leiomyoma with maximal sparing of uterine tissue resulted in a short convalescence period and apparent return to breeding function in a cow and a mare.

OBJECTIVE To analyze the results of multimodality treatment for a consecutive series of pediatric patients with ruptured and unruptured BAVMs at a single institution. METHODS Forty patients <18 years of age were retrospectively reviewed. Results were divided by hemorrhage status, ie, ruptured or unruptured, and the intended curative treatment modality, ie, surgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients (68%) presented with hemorrhage, and 13 patients (32%) presented without hemorrhage. Among ruptured patients, 19 (70%) underwent surgery and 8 (30%) underwent stereotactic radiosurgery. In surviving patients who presented with hemorrhage, 23 of 26 (88%) had a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 2 at the last follow-up, and 24 of 26 (92%) obtained radiographic cure. For unruptured BAVMs, all 6 patients with grade I to III BAVM obtained radiographic cure and had an mRS score of 0 to 1 at the last follow-up, whereas 1 of 5 patients (20%) with grade IV and V BAVM had BAVM obliteration and a mean mRS score of 1.8 at the last follow-up. In a total of 93.6 years of follow-up from date of presentation to last clinical follow-up, there was 1 hemorrhage (1.1%/y). Of 30 patients with radiographic obliteration, 2 patients had radiographic recurrence (7% incidence). CONCLUSION The majority of ruptured patients had an mRS score of 0 to 2 at the last follow-up and obtained radiographic cure. Unruptured patients with grade I to III BAVMs had superior outcomes compared with those with grade IV and V AVMs. Treatment of grade I to III BAVMs appears safe, and additional study is needed to determine optimal strategies for the management of unruptured grade IV and V BAVMs.","output":"Outcomes of Multimodality Therapy in Pediatric Patients With Ruptured and Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a critical biomarker in the angiogenesis of several cancers.

In this work, we examined the chaperone activity of PLL-g-Dex to assist G-quadruplex-based fluorescent DNA biosensors for sensitive detection of VEGF. This convenient and effective strategy is based on chitosan hydrogel, c-myc, Thioflavin T (ThT), VEGF aptamer, and its partially complementary strand. The results show that chaperone copolymer PLL-g-Dex significantly promotes the accumulation of G-quadruplex and assembles into G-wires, allowing an effective signal amplification. Using this method, the detection limit of VEGF was as low as 23 pM, better than many previous works on aptamer-based VEGF detection.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the association between chlorpromazine use and mortality among adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an observational, multicenter, retrospective study at Assistance Publique-H?pitaux de Paris (AP-HP) Greater Paris University hospitals. Study baseline was defined as the date of first prescription of chlorpromazine during hospitalization for COVID-19. The primary endpoint was death. Among patients who had not been hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs), we compared this endpoint between those who received chlorpromazine and those who did not, in time-to-event analyses adjusted for patient characteristics, clinical markers of disease severity, and other psychotropic medications. The primary analysis used a Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting. Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of the 14,340 adult inpatients hospitalized outside ICUs for COVID-19, 55 patients (0.4%) received chlorpromazine. Over a mean follow-up of 14.3 days (standard deviation [SD] 18.2), death occurred in 13 patients (23.6%) who received chlorpromazine and 1289 patients (9.0%) who did not. In the primary analysis, there was no significant association between chlorpromazine use and mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75-5.40; p = 0.163). Sensitivity analyses included a Cox regression in a 1:5 ratio matched analytic sample that showed a similar result (HR 1.67, 95% CI 0.91-3.06; p = 0.100) and a multivariable Cox regression that indicated a significant positive association (HR 3.10, 95% CI 1.31-7.34; p = 0.010).

It is increasingly evident that the new coronavirus has sounded a warning that calls attention to the indirect effects of deforestation, especially in tropical forests such as the Amazon rainforest. The concept of the so-called risk society, proposed by the German sociologist Ulrich Beck, represents an opportunity to broaden the discussion on possible intersections between the environmental and health crises, reinforcing the urgency of articulated measures to contain epidemics and the deforestation supported by public policies based on science. However, it is observed that the dissemination of this understanding in public management collides with the Brazilian federal government's obstacles. Such barriers are supported by historical and scientific denial, considered a guiding principle for decisions that favour the dissemination of Covid-19 and the aggravation of environmental crises in Brazil. To face this challenge, it is necessary to strengthen democratic and participatory governance structures, strengthening the relationship between science and society to search for solutions to combat increasingly complex socio-environmental problems.

The effect on neurosurgical presentations and referrals during COVID-19 is unclear. Our aim, therefore, was to describe the referral patterns to a high-volume neurosurgical department in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Electronic referrals were identified from the referrals database from January 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020, inclusive, with January used as the baseline. The demographic data and referral diagnoses were captured on Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA). Differences between referral volumes were evaluated using &#967;2 goodness-of-fit tests. RESULTS: A total of 2293 electronic referrals had been received during the study period. The median age was 63 years. Overall, the referrals had decreased significantly in volume during the study period [&#967;2(4) = 60.95; P < 0.001]. We have described the patterns in the daily referrals as the pandemic progressed. The reduction in the volume of referrals for degenerative spine cases and traumatic brain injuries was statistically significant (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The referrals for degenerative spine and traumatic brain injuries decreased significantly during the pandemic, which can be explained by the lower vehicular traffic and patient avoidance of healthcare services, respectively.

Qualitative studies exploring the experiences of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic have mainly focused on secondary care. AIM: To gain an understanding of the experiences of European primary care professionals (PCPs) working during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING: An exploratory qualitative study, using semi-structured interviews in primary care in England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Greece, and Sweden, between April and July 2020. METHOD: Interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed, and analysed using a combination of inductive and deductive thematic analysis techniques. RESULTS: Eighty interviews were conducted with PCPs. PCPs had to make their own decisions on how to rapidly transform services in relation to COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 care. Despite being overwhelmed with guidance, they often lacked access to practical training. Consequently, PCPs turned to their colleagues for moral support and information to try to quickly adjust to new ways of working, including remote care, and to deal with uncertainty. CONCLUSION: PCPs rapidly transformed primary care delivery despite a number of challenges. Representation of primary care at policy level and engagement with local primary care champions are needed to facilitate easy and coordinated access to practical information on how to adapt services, ongoing training, and access to appropriate mental health support services for PCPs.

It is underlined that the stationary character of the isolation measures can be expected to imply that an effective SIR model with constant parameters should describe the infection process. Then, a derivation of this property is presented, assuming that the statistical fluctuations in the number of infection and recovered cases are disregarded. This effective SIR model shows a reduced population number and a constant $\\\\beta$ parameter. The effects of also including the retardation between recovery and infection process is also considered. Next, it is shown that any solution of the effective SIR also solves the linear problem to which the SIR equations reduce when the total population is much larger than the number of the infected cases. Then, it is also argued that this equivalence follows for a specific contagious parameter $\\\\beta(t)$ which time dependence is analytically derived here. Then, two equivalent predictive calculational methods for the infection dynamics under stationary isolation measures are proposed. The results represent a solutions for the known and challenging problem of defining the time dependence of the contagion parameter, when the SIR parameter $N$ is assumed to be the whole population number. Finally, the model is applied to describe the known infection curves for countries that already had passed the epidemic process under strict stationary isolation measures. The cases of Iceland, New Zealand, Korea and Cuba were considered. Although, non subject to stationary isolation measures the cases of U.S.A. and Mexico are also examined due to their interest.

The result has been increased depression, anxiety, and loneliness in the general population. However, populations who demonstrated pre-pandemic emotional disturbance and social isolation, such as individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), are likely uniquely vulnerable to such symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the emotional outcomes, including reports of loneliness, in individuals with MS during the COVID-19 pandemic. We additionally sought to examine how individuals experiences during the pandemic may contribute to a specific COVID-19-related depression or anxiety. METHODS: 142 individuals with MS who previously participated in a national, online, survey-based study were asked to complete an online survey assessing their current level of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Increases in the rates of depression and anxiety were noted, with approximately 54% and 33% reporting new depression or anxiety, respectively. Given this increase, we examined how individuals with new depression or anxiety differed from those without depression and anxiety and those with pre-pandemic depression and/or anxiety. Significant differences in person-specific factors (e.g., personality, self-efficacy) were noted between the groups. Increased loneliness was also found among both those with depression or anxiety regardless of whether new or pre-pandemic. Finally, all those depressed or anxious reported greater disruption and distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic with a trend for increased anxiety specifically related to the pandemic (e.g., fear or dying due to COVID-19) among those with new depression or anxiety when compared to those with existing depression or anxiety, suggesting an influence of the pandemic that is specific to reports of new depression or anxiety. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest increased depression, anxiety, and loneliness among individuals with MS following the COVID-19 pandemic, with reports of new depression or anxiety, which appears to be related to the pandemic, specifically. Moreover, factors commonly associated with depression or anxiety in MS (e.g., personality, self-efficacy) were more common among those with existing depression or anxiety but not among those experiencing new depression or anxiety. These differences should be considered when attempting to ameliorate the impact of the COVID-19 among those experiencing emotional distress.","output":"Surviving a global pandemic: The experience of depression, anxiety, and loneliness among individuals with multiple sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Both during and following the global pandemic of Covid-19, there appears to be an increased need to rediscover purpose and promote physical and emotional well-being.

METHODS: Drawing on a sample of 17 interviews conducted between the years 2012 and 2019 in addition to associated archival material originating from government and non-government sectors including sex worker representative organisations. RESULTS: It finds that non-sex workers endorsement for the decriminalisation of sex work was motivated by the New Zealand Prostitutes Collective (NZPC) and occurred primarily within a human rights and harm minimisation framework. But that during the lobbying and parliamentary process, amendments to the Bill emerged that contradicted the NZPCs main goal which was for sex work to be recognised as a legitimate labour activity and for all sex workers to benefit from decriminalisation and policy reform. CONCLUSIONS: As such, this article broadens the scope of analysis related to the sex worker rights movement by examining how and why sex workers and their allies came to communicate and act on the impetus for sex work law reform and how it affected policy outcomes. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Those involved in collaborative governance sex work law reform projects could consider adopting ?stegrens typology of repressive, restrictive or integrative approaches to sex work law reform in negotiations that concern regulation and policies.","output":"Changing Minds and Changing Laws: How New Zealand Sex Workers and Their Allies Shaped Decriminalisation in New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CASE: A fifteen-year-old male patient sustained a posteriorly dislocated right capital femoral Delbet type Ib epiphyseal fracture-separation and a right acetabular posterior column fracture after a low-energy trip and fall.

Technology provided one mechanism for them to stay connected with others, but technology may not be accessible or desirable for everyone.

This project explored experiences of older people in Mexico and Scotland during the pandemic and examined the potential of everyday technology to help maintain social connectedness. A mixed methods approach included secondary analysis of large-scale datasets alongside primary data. Online semi-structured interviews and focus groups were carried out with 36 older people in Mexico and 23 older people in Scotland.

The findings demonstrate that advantages and disadvantages accumulated in the life course determine how older people select, optimize and compensate for new ways of staying socially connected during the pandemic in both countries. The use of technologies among older people is further mediated by structural inequalities with differences found between Mexico and Scotland in specific patterns identified. Further, stereotypes about older age and technology use are obstacles to the use of technology, as they affect the perception of self-efficacy by older people.

Patients data were extracted from electronic medical records. RESULTS: Of the total of 32 COVID-19 patients with T1D, 21.9% required hospitalization, while 78.1% underwent home isolation. Among the study population, 9.4% (3/32) were reported to have hypertension, 21.9% (7/32) had chronic pulmonary disease (CPD), 18.8% (6/32) had thyroid disorders, and 18.8% (6/32) had the celiac disease.

However, the effect of COVID-19-related fear on brain atrophy has not been evaluated. In this study, we evaluated the relation between brain atrophy and the effect of COVID-19-related fear by analyzing changes in brain volume over time using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: Participants were 25 Japanese patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or subjective cognitive decline (SCD), who underwent 1.5-tesla MRI scan twice, once before and once after the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19, and the Fear of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Scale (FCV-19S) assessment during that period. We computed regional brain atrophy per day between the 1st and 2nd scan, and evaluated the relation between the FCV-19S scores and regional shrinkage. RESULTS: There was significant positive correlation between the total FCV-19S score and volume reduction per day in the right posterior cingulate cortex. Regarding the subscales of FCV-19S, we found significant positive correlation between factor 2 of the FCV-19S and shrinkage of the right posterior cingulate cortex. CONCLUSIONS: There was positive correlation between the FCV-19S score and regional brain atrophy per day.

Heparin is a cornerstone of treatment in critically ill COVID-19 patients. HIT antibodies can be detected by antigen tests and functional tests. Often strong reactivity in the antigen test is used as surrogate marker for the presence of clinically relevant, platelet activating antibodies. We observed an unexpectedly high percentage of COVID-19 patients, clinically suspected to have HIT, with high titer anti-PF4/heparin antibodies, but a negative functional test. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether in COVID-19 patients a serum-derived factor inhibits the heparin-induced platelet activation test (HIPA). METHODS AND RESULTS: 12 COVID-19 patients with suspected HIT were tested. Three samples tested negative in all assays; nine samples tested positive by antigen tests, among which only three tested also positive by HIPA. When we spiked COVID-19 serum or control serum with the human HIT antibody like mAb 5B9, reactivity of 5B9 remained the same. Also the purified IgG fractions of COVID-19 sera testing strongly positive in the PF4/heparin antigen test but negative in the functional test did not show increased reactivity in the functional test in comparison to the original serum. Both results make a functionally inhibitory factor in the serum/plasma of COVID-19 patients highly unlikely. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients often present with strong reactivity in PF4/heparin antigen tests without the presence of platelet-activating antibodies.

Newborn screening (NBS) has the potential to detect a number of rare conditions in asymptomatic children, providing the possibility of early treatment and a significantly improved long-term outcome. Despite these clear benefits, the availability and conduct of NBS programmes varies considerably across Europe and, with the increasing potential of genomic testing, it is likely that these differences may become even more pronounced.

To estimate them, detailed data on host population dynamics are required; however, estimating the population size for wildlife is often difficult. We aimed to elucidate the morbidity and lethality of classical swine fever (CSF) currently highly prevalent in the wild boar population in Japan. To this end, we estimated lethality rate, recovery rate, and case fatality ratio (CFR) of CSF without detailed data on the population estimates of wild boar. A mathematical model was constructed to describe the CSF dynamics and population dynamics of wild boar. We fitted the model to the (i) results of the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for the CSFV gene and the (ii) results of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for the antibody against CSFV in sampled wild boar. In the 280 wild boar sampled from September 2018 to March 2019 in the major CSF-affected area in Japan, the lethality rate and recovery rate of CSF per week were estimated as 0.165 (95% confidence interval: 0.081C0.250) and 0.004 (0C0.009), respectively. While the estimate of lethality rate of CSF was similar with the estimates in previous studies, the recovery rate was lower than those reported previously. CFR was estimated as 0.959 (0.904C0.981) using our estimate of recovery rate. This study is the first to estimate lethality rate of CSF from the dynamics of CSF epidemics in the wild boar population. Since the value of CFR is sensitive to the value of recovery rate, the accuracy in the estimate of recovery rate is a key for the accurate estimation of CFR. A long-term transmission experiment of moderately virulent strains may lead to more accurate estimation of the recovery rate and CFR of CSF.","output":"Estimation of the Lethality Rate, Recovery Rate, and Case Fatality Ratio of Classical Swine Fever in Japanese Wild Boar: An Analysis of the Epidemics From September 2018 to March 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Congenital unilateral pulmonary hypoplasia of a pulmonary artery is considered a rare congenital anomaly in the pediatric and adult population.

These assays need to target conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2 global variants and avoid cross-reactivity to seasonal human coronaviruses. To contribute to this effort, we employed an in silico immunoinformatics analysis pipeline to identify immunogenic peptides resulting from conserved and highly networked regions with topological importance from the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike proteins. A total of 57 highly networked T-cell epitopes that are conserved across geographic viral variants were identified from these viral proteins, with a binding potential to diverse HLA alleles and 80 to 100% global population coverage. Importantly, 18 of these T-cell epitope derived peptides had limited homology to seasonal human coronaviruses making them promising candidates for SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell immunity assays. Moreover, two of the NC-derived peptides elicited effector/polyfunctional responses of CD8+ T cells derived from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients.IMPORTANCE The development of specific and validated immunologic tools is critical for understanding the level and duration of the cellular response induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccines against this novel coronavirus disease. To contribute to this effort, we employed an immunoinformatics analysis pipeline to define 57 SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic peptides within topologically important regions of the nucleocapsid (NC) and spike (S) proteins that will be effective for detecting cellular immune responses in 80 to 100% of the global population. Our immunoinformatics analysis revealed that 18 of these peptides had limited homology to circulating seasonal human coronaviruses and therefore are promising candidates for distinguishing SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses from pre-existing coronavirus immunity. Importantly, CD8+ T cells derived from SARS-CoV-2 survivors exhibited polyfunctional effector responses to two novel NC-derived peptides identified as HLA-binders. These studies provide a proof of concept that our immunoinformatics analysis pipeline identifies novel immunogens which can elicit polyfunctional SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses.","output":"Identification of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid and Spike T-Cell Epitopes for Assessing T-Cell Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to produce significant emotional consequences at the individual, community, societal, and global levels.

Participants included patients from 18 years of age hospitalized with Covid-19 with 4 or fewer days since symptom onset enrolled at a university and a community hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Exclusion criteria included prior intensive care unit (ICU) admission and use of ARBs/angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors at randomization. Control arm received standard care alone and treatment arm telmisartan 80 mg twice daily for 14 days. Primary outcomes were C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma levels at day 5 and 8 after randomization. Secondary outcomes included time to discharge within 15 days, admission to ICU and death at 15- and 30-days. NCT04355936 (Completed). Findings A pragmatic decision to end the study before the third interim analysis was made on Oct. 30th due to sharp reduction in recruitment. A total of 162 patients were randomized. 158 patients enrolled between May 14 and October 30 2020, were included in the analysis, 80 in the standard care and 78 in the telmisartan added to standard care group. Baseline absolute CRP serum levels were 5.53  6.19 mg/dL (95% CI 6.91 to 4.15, n = 80) and 9.04  7.69 (95% CI 9.04 to 10.82, n = 74) in the standard care and telmisartan added to standard care groups, respectively.

Interleukin (IL)-1 or IL-6 inhibitors have been used to treat this patient population, but the comparative effectiveness of these different strategies remains undetermined. We aimed to compare IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, and hyperinflammation. METHODS: This cohort study included patients admitted to San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and hyperinflammation, defined as serum C-reactive protein concentration of 100 mg/L or more or ferritin concentration of 900 ng/mL or more. The primary endpoint was survival, and the secondary endpoint was a composite of death or mechanical ventilation (adverse clinical outcome). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to compare clinical outcomes of patients receiving IL-1 inhibition (anakinra) or IL-6 inhibition (tocilizumab or sarilumab) with those of patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors, after accounting for baseline differences. All patients received standard care. Interaction tests were used to assess the probability of survival according to C-reactive protein or lactate dehydrogenase concentrations. FINDINGS: Of 392 patients included between Feb 25 and May 20, 2020, 275 did not receive interleukin inhibitors, 62 received the IL-1 inhibitor anakinra, and 55 received an IL-6 inhibitor (29 received tocilizumab and 26 received sarilumab). In the multivariable analysis, compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors, patients treated with IL-1 inhibition had a significantly reduced mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0450, 95% CI 0204C0990, p=0047), but those treated with IL-6 inhibition did not (0900, 0412C1966; p=079). In the multivariable analysis, there was no difference in adverse clinical outcome risk in patients treated with IL-1 inhibition (HR 0866, 95% CI 0482C1553; p=063) or IL-6 inhibition (0882, 0452C1722; p=071) relative to patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. For increasing C-reactive protein concentrations, patients treated with IL-6 inhibition had a significantly reduced risk of mortality (HR 0990, 95% CI 0981C0999; p=0031) and adverse clinical outcome (0987, 0979C0995; p=00021) compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. For decreasing concentrations of serum lactate dehydrogenase, patients treated with an IL-1 inhibitor and patients treated with IL-6 inhibitors had a reduced risk of mortality; increasing concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase in patients receiving either interleukin inhibitor were associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR 1009, 95% CI 1003C1014, p=00011 for IL-1 inhibitors and 1006, 1001C1011, p=0028 for IL-6 inhibitors) and adverse clinical outcome (1006, 1002C1010, p=00031 for IL-1 inhibitors and 1005, 1001C1010, p=0016 for IL-6 inhibitors) compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. INTERPRETATION: IL-1 inhibition, but not IL-6 inhibition, was associated with a significant reduction of mortality in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, and hyperinflammation. IL-6 inhibition was effective in a subgroup of patients with markedly high C-reactive protein concentrations, whereas both IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition were effective in patients with low lactate dehydrogenase concentrations.

A surge in firearm purchasing following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic may have contributed to an increase in firearm violence. We sought to estimate the state-level association between firearm purchasing and interpersonal firearm violence during the pandemic. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia from January 2018 through July 2020. Data were obtained from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (a proxy for firearm purchasing) and the Gun Violence Archive. Using negative binomial regression models, we estimated the association between cumulative excess firearm purchases in March through July 2020 (measured as the difference between observed rates and those expected from autoregressive integrated moving average models) and injuries (including nonfatal and fatal) from intentional, interpersonal firearm violence (non-domestic and domestic violence). RESULTS: We estimated that there were 4.3 million excess firearm purchases nationally from March through July 2020 and a total of 4075 more firearm injuries than expected from April through July. We found no relationship between state-level excess purchasing and non-domestic firearm violence, e.g., each excess purchase per 100 population was associated with a rate ratio (RR) of firearm injury from non-domestic violence of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.50C1.02) in April; 0.99 (95% CI: 0.72C1.25) in May; 1.10 (95% CI: 0.93C1.32) in June; and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.85C1.12) in July. Excess firearm purchasing within states was associated with an increase in firearm injuries from domestic violence in April (RR: 2.60; 95% CI: 1.32C5.93) and May (RR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.19C2.91), though estimates were sensitive to model specification. CONCLUSIONS: Nationwide, firearm purchasing and firearm violence increased substantially during the first months of the coronavirus pandemic. At the state level, the magnitude of the increase in purchasing was not associated with the magnitude of the increase in firearm violence. Increases in purchasing may have contributed to additional firearm injuries from domestic violence in April and May.

Due to worldwide application, human beings are exposed to this compound via inhalation. Inhalation of prallethrin can expose lung surfactant proteins (SPs) to this compound. SPs such as SP-A and SP-D have anti-microbial activities, whereas SP-B and SP-C prevent alveolar collapse during exhalation by reducing surface pressure in alveolar walls. The present study aimed to investigate the binding affinities of prallethrin for the pulmonary SPs and the possible interactions involved in it. METHODS: In this study, molecular docking was performed using prallethrin as ligand and lung SPs as target molecules. The three-dimensional structure of prallethrin (PubChem CID: 9839306) was retrieved from PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), whereas the same for SPs were retrieved from RCSB Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/). AutoDock 4.2 employing Lamarckian genetic algorithm was used to calculate binding affinities between the target protein and the ligand. Polar and nonpolar interactions between the amino acids of SPs and Prallethrin were studied utilizing Chimera X and Discovery Studio Visualizer. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that, prallethrin can bind with the four SPs using several interactions such as hydrogen bonds, alkyl bonds, PiCPi interaction, Van der Waals interaction and other. Prallethrin interacted with two binding pockets of SP-A and SP-C, whereas the prallethrin interacted with three binding pockets of SP-B and SP-D, respectively. CONCLUSION: Findings of the study indicated that prallethrin can bind with the pulmonary SPs employing hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. Such interactions could impair critical functions of SPs in lungs. This might increase susceptibility of lungs towards a range of respiratory illness, pathogenic infections, as well as malignancy.

To fill this gap, here we first build general, behavior implicit, SIR epidemic models including behavioral responses and set them within the framework of nonlinear feedback control theory. Second, we provide a thorough investigation of the effects of different types of agents behavioral responses for the dynamics of hybrid stochastic SIR outbreak models. In the proposed model, the stochastic discrete dynamics of infection spread is combined with a continuous model describing the agents delayed behavioral response. The delay reflects the memory mechanisms with which individuals enact protective behavior based on past data on the epidemic course. This results in a stochastic hybrid system with time-varying transition probabilities. To simulate such system, we extend Gillespies classic stochastic simulation algorithm by developing analytical formulas valid for our classes of models.

How substantially marginalized groups like impoverished urban-dwelling individuals are specifically impacted amid this pandemic is poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate correlates of financial concerns and symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19 pandemic among impoverished urban-dwelling individuals residing in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between August and September 2020 using face-to-face interviews in six disadvantaged neighborhoods (slums) in Dhaka. Individuals were interviewed using a structured questionnaire consisting of questions assessing socio-demographics, lifestyle, financial well-being relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, depression, and PTSD. Results: A total of 435 individuals (male=54.7%;mean age=45.012.0 years;age range=18-85 years) participated. Most (96.3%) reported that their household income decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Associated factors included female gender, primary education, jobless, food scarcity, and depression. Depression symptoms were linked to female gender, being jobless, being divorced, living in a joint family, excessive sleep, and smoking. Low incomes, excessive sleep, joblessness, and food scarcity were positively associated with PTSD symptoms. In contrast, less sleep appeared protective against PTSD. Limitations: Potential limitations included cross-sectional study design and limited sample size. Conclusions: Public health initiatives, in particular mental health services, should be introduced to mitigate against psychological and financial effects of the pandemic on impoverished urban-dwelling individuals in Bangladesh.","output":"Correlates of Financial Concerns and Symptoms of Depression and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Impoverished Urban-dwelling Individuals in Bangladesh During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Face-to-face Interview Findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Though accumulated evidence proved that laparoscopic major hepatectomy was technically feasible, it remains a challenging procedure and is limited to highly specialized centers. Paragonimiasis is one of the most important food-borne parasitic zoonoses caused by the trematode of the genus Paragonimus. Although hepatic paragonimiasis is rare, the previous studies had investigated hepatic paragonimiasis from different perspectives. However, the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic major hepatectomy for hepatic paragonimiasis have not yet been reported in the literature. METHODS We here present 2 cases of hepatic paragonimiasis at the deep parts of the liver with treatment by laparoscopic major hepatectomy. One case is a 32-year-old male patient who was admitted to the hospital due to upper abdominal discomfort without fever for 1 month. The clinical imaging revealed that there was a lesion about 5.9  3.7 cm in the boundary of right anterior lobe and right posterior lobe of the liver with rim enhancement and tract-like nonenhanced areas. The other one is a 62-year-old female patient who was referred to the hospital for 1 month of right upper abdominal pain and fever. The ultrasonography showed that there was a huge hypoechoic mass (about 10.8  6.3 cm) in middle lobe of the liver with tract-like nonenhanced areas. Both patients were from an endemic area of paragonimiasis and the proportion of eosinophil in the second case was increased. RESULTS The preoperative diagnosis of the first case was ambiguous and the hepatic paragonimiasis was considered for the second case. The first case underwent laparoscopic extended right posterior lobe hepatectomy and the other case underwent laparoscopic extended left hemihepatectomy. Both operations went very well and the operation times for the 2 cases were 275 minutes and 310 minutes, respectively. The 2 patients' postoperative recovery was smooth without major postoperative complications (such as, bleeding, bile leakage, and liver failure). Moreover, the 2 patients were discharged on the 6th day and 7th day after surgery, respectively. The postoperative histopathological examination manifested hepatic paragonimiasis in both patients. CONCLUSION This study suggests that the laparoscopic approach may be safe and technically feasible for hepatic paragonimiasis.","output":"Feasibility of laparoscopic major hepatectomy for hepatic paragonimiasis: two case reports."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Of the 2790 local health departments (LHDs) in the United States, Internet homepages were located for 1986.

STUDY DESIGN: An anonymous online survey was disseminated to members of RAS and YFA. Descriptive analyses were performed, and factors associated with depression and burnout were examined with univariate and multivariable stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the RAS/YFA membership of 21,385, there were 1,160 respondents. The majority (96%) of respondents reported the COVID-19 pandemic having a negative impact on their clinical experience, with 84% residents reporting >50% reduction in operative volume and inability to meet minimum case requirements. Respondents also reported negative impacts on personal wellness. Nearly one third reported inadequate access to personal protective equipment (PPE), and depression and burnout were pervasive (21% of respondents reported yes to every screening symptom). On multivariable analysis, female gender (OR 1.54 for depression, OR 1.47 for burnout) and lack of wellness resources (OR 1.55 for depression, OR 1.44 for burnout) predicted depression and burnout. Access to adequate PPE was protective against burnout (OR 0.52). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate a significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon the lives of resident and early-career surgeons.

In this pilot survey, we review the factors that supported the rapid transition to televisits during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we explore the barriers that continue to prevent clinicians from using other digital mental health interventions, such as mindfulness applications, mood trackers, and digital therapy programs. We conducted a pilot survey of mental health clinicians in different practice environments in the USA. Survey respondents (n = 51) were primarily psychiatrists working in academic medical centers. Results indicated that systemic factors, including workplace facilitation and insurance reimbursement, were primary reasons motivating clinicians to use televisits to provide remote patient care. The shift to televisits during the pandemic was not accompanied by increased use of other digital mental health interventions in patient care. Nine clinicians reported that they have never used digital interventions with patients. Among the 42 clinicians who did report some experience using digital interventions, the majority reported no change in the use of digital applications since transitioning to televisits. Our preliminary findings lend insight into the perspective of mental health clinicians regarding the factors that supported their transition to televisits, including institutional support and insurance reimbursement, and indicate that this shift to virtual patient care has not been accompanied by increased use of other digital mental health interventions. We contend that the same systemic factors that supported the shift toward virtual visits in the COVID-19 pandemic may be applied to support the incorporation of other digital interventions in mental healthcare.

In our hospital, the use of 250-500 mg/day of methylprednisolone was frequent in the first wave of the pandemic. Lower dose were recommended in our protocol since September 2020. The aim was to evaluate the impact of methylprednisolone dose in the outcome of patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective and observational study. Inclusion criteria: SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed by PCR, admission to our hospital between March 2020 and February 2021, SatO2 < 94% or SatO2/FiO2 < 447. Two treatment groups were compared: patients treated with 0.5-1.5 mg/kg/day (group 1) and patients treated with more than 1.5 mg/kg/day (group 2). The primary outcome analyzed was orotracheal intubation (OTI) or death from any cause at 28 days after admission. Differences in demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics between treatment groups were analyzed. Variables with P < 0.1 were included in a binary logistic regression model, calculating a propensity score for assigning each patient to group 1 treatment. Bivariate analysis was performed to identify variables associated with worst outcome. Finally, Cox regression was performed including treatment group, propensity score as covariate and all the variables with P< 0.05 in the bivariate analysis. RESULTS: 285 patients were included, 197 in group 1 and 88 in group 2. The median age was 73 years, 52,3% were male. Mortality or OTI at 28 days was 24,9%. There was a higher proportion of patients in group 1 with COPD (9,6% vs 1.1%, P< 0.01), dyspnea (60.4% vs 45.5%, P=0.01), sepsis (22.8% vs 13.6%, P=0.07).

The lockdown period comprises 4 lockdown phases with distinct measures, whereas the unlocking period had 3 phases. PM(2.5) concentration reduced significantly in all megacities and met the national standards during the lockdown period. The maximum reduction in PM(2.5) level was observed in Kolkata (62%), followed by Mumbai (49%), Chennai (34%), and New Delhi (26%) during the lockdown period. Comparatively, Hyderabad exhibited a smaller reduction in PM(2.5) concentration, i.e., 10%. The average PM(2.5) levels during the lockdown in the peak hour (i.e., 07:00?11:00 h) in New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, and Hyderabad decreased by 21.3%, 48.5%, 63.4%, 56.4%, and 23.8%, respectively, compared to those before lockdown period.

To achieve a better distribution of lidocaine in the tracheobronchial tree, spray catheters have been developed, allowing nebulization of the local anesthetic solution. However, there are little data on the efficacy and safety of this approach, or on the consumption of sedative drugs and lidocaine during nebulized administration. OBJECTIVES To investigate the tolerability of nebulized lidocaine compared to conventional lidocaine administration via syringe through the working channel of the bronchoscope in patients undergoing bronchoscopy. Consumption of sedative drugs and lidocaine was also compared between the two lidocaine administration approaches. METHODS Patients requiring bronchoscopy with endobronchial or transbronchial biopsy were randomly assigned to receive topical lidocaine either via syringe or via nebulizer. Endpoints were consumption of lidocaine and sedative drugs, as well as patient tolerance and safety. RESULTS Thirty patients were included, 15 in each group. Patients in the nebulizer group required lower doses of endobronchial lidocaine (184.7  67.98 vs. 250.7  21.65 mg, p = 0.0045) and intravenous fentanyl (0.033  0.041 vs. 0.067  0.045 mg, p = 0.0236) than those in the syringe group; midazolam or propofol dosages did not differ between the two groups. In addition, there were no between-group differences in patient tolerance or safety (all p > 0.05).

The goal of this analysis is to examine improvements in key mental health parameters among students who endorsed negative affectivity at baseline. METHOD: A total of 285 11C12-year-olds (72% white, 18% Hispanic, 55% female) participated in a single-arm, non-randomized 6-week 1:1 school-based coaching intervention, Healthy Kids. Youth completed validated surveys at baseline and 6-week follow-up assessing depression/anxiety symptoms, bullying, self-efficacy, academic pressure, grit, and resilience. Participants were determined to have elevated negative affectivity if they reported mild-to-severe symptoms for both depression and anxiety symptoms. General linear models examined differences between groups for each mental health parameter, as well as change in outcomes from baseline to follow-up. RESULTS: A third of participants (38%) at baseline endorsed negative affectivity. Youth who endorsed negative affectivity were more often female (71% vs 29%; p < 0.001) and identified as victims of cyberbullying (25% vs 8%; p < 0.001). Youth with baseline negative affectivity scored lower for self-efficacy (total 70.5 vs 86.8; p < 0.0001). Baseline negative affectivity was a significant moderator for change in mental health parameters. Post-intervention, those who endorsed baseline negative affectivity, medium effect sizes were observed for self-efficacy (g = 0.6; 95%CI 0.3, 0.9; p < 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (g = ? 0.70; 95%CI ? 1.0, ? 0.4; p < 0.001).

METHOD: We described and compared the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the cases recorded in different phases of the epidemic and reviewed the effectiveness of the public health measures implemented using the changes in the daily number of confirmed cases and the interval from symptom onset to hospital admission. RESULTS: Between January and May 2020, 1084 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported, about 70% of which had travel history during the incubation period. The case fatality ratio was 0.4%. The local epidemic progressed through four phases: (i) preparedness and imported infection from mainland China, (ii) local transmission, (iii) imported infection from overseas countries associated with local transmission, and (iv) controlled imported infection with limited local transmission, with an eventual reduction of daily case number and minimization of onset-to-admission interval. Various public health measures, including enhanced surveillance, border control and social distancing, were introduced in phases in response to the prevailing local and global situations.

METHODS A cross-sectional survey was administered to Italian dentists at the end of the lockdown (May 3, 2020). A total of 1,407 dentists answered the survey. RESULTS A total of 1,205 dentists were included. Most of the respondents were dental owners (73.6%). About 79.7% of the dentists handled urgencies during the lockdown. The number of urgencies treated weekly was lower than that generally handled before the COVID-19 outbreak (p < 0.001). Many dentists (81.2%) provided telephone consultations to evaluate symptoms. Pulpitis and abscesses were the most common urgencies (44.7% and 40.2%, respectively). Furthermore, 95% of dentists wore masks, protective eyewear, and surgical gloves while delivering non-postponable treatments. The FFP2 mask was used by 41.8% and 41.7% of owners and dental assistants respectively. Financial concerns, risk of contagion, and PPE supply were indicated as the main current concerns.

The length of hospital stay was greater in diabetics than non-diabetics, (1326 days vs 9.518.5 days, p<0.05). Diabetics with an admission glucose > 140 mg/dL (vs<140 g/dL) had a 2.4-fold increased odds of both intubation and ICU admission (95% CI: 1.2, 4.5; 1.3, 4.6). Diabetics with admission glucoses > 180 mg/dL (vs <180 g/dL) had a 1.8-fold increased mortality (95% CI: 1.2, 2.9). Non-diabetics with admission glucoses >140 mg/dL (vs<140 g/dL) had a two-fold increased mortality (95% CI: 1.2, 3.5), 3.5-fold increased odds of ICU admission (95% CI: 1.8,6.6) and a 2.3-fold increased odds of both intubation and AKI (95% CI: 1.3, 4.2; 1.3,4.2). Non-diabetics with a glucose >180 mg/dL (vs <180 g/dL) had a four-fold increased mortality (95% CI: 1.8, 8.8), 2.7-fold increased odds of intubation (95% CI: 1.3, 5.6) and 2.9-fold increased odds of ICU admission (95% CI: 1.3, 6.2). Conclusion: Our results show hyperglycemia portends worse outcomes in diabetics and non-diabetics with COVID-19. Elevated admitting glucoses >180 mg/dL increased odds of mortality four-fold in non-diabetics and 1.8- fold in diabetics. In COVID-19, diabetic patients had a 37% greater length of hospital stay than non-diabetics. Whether hyperglycemia is a marker or a cause of more severe COVID-19 is unknown. These findings suggest that patients presenting with hyperglycemia require closer observation and more aggressive therapies. This raises the testable hypothesis that intensive glucose control may improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Sugar Is Not Always Sweet: Exploring the Relationship Between Hyperglycemia and COVID-19 in a Predominantly African American Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease, has infected over 290,000 people since the end of 2019, killed over 12,000, and caused worldwide social and economic disruption(1,2).

There are no specific antiviral agents for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Information regarding the effect of Abidol on in-hospital mortality is scarce. The present study aimed to evaluate the treatment effect of Abidol for patients with COVID-19 before and after propensity score matching (PSM). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 1019 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in China from December 22, 2019 to March 13, 2020. Patients were divided to Abidol (200 mg, tid, 5C7 days, n = 788, 77.3%) and No-Abidol (n = 231, 22.7%) groups. The primary outcome was the mortality during hospitalization. RESULTS: Among 1019 COVID-19 patients, the age was (60.4  14.5) years. Abidol-treated patients, compared with No-Abidol-treated patients, had a shorter duration from onset of symptoms to admission, less frequent renal dysfunction, lower white blood cell counts (lymphocytes <0.8) and erythrocyte sending rate, lower interleukin-6, higher platelet counts and plasma IgG and oxygen saturation, and less frequent myocardial injury. The mortality during hospitalization before PSM was 17.9% in Abidol group and 34.6% in No-Abidol (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.610, 95% confident interval (CI): 1.980C3.440), all seen in severe and critical patients. After PSM, the in-hospital death was 13.6% in Abidol and 28.6% in No-Abidol group (HR = 2.728, 95% CI: 1.598C4.659).

Early studies showed an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality for cancer patients, but it is not well understood how this association varies by cancer site, cancer treatment, and vaccination status. MethodsUsing electronic health record data from an academic medical center, we identified 259,893 individuals who were tested for or diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 10, 2020, to February 2, 2022. Of these, 41,218 tested positive for COVID-19 of whom 10,266 had a past or current cancer diagnosis. We conducted Firth-corrected, covariate-adjusted logistic regression to assess the association of cancer status, cancer type, and cancer treatment with four COVID-19 outcomes: hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality, and a composite \\"severe COVID-19\\" outcome which is the union of the first three outcomes. We examine the effect of the timing of cancer diagnosis and treatment relative to COVID diagnosis, and the effect of vaccination. ResultsCancer status was associated with higher rates of severe COVID-19 infection [OR (95% CI): 1.18 (1.08, 1.29)], hospitalization [OR (95% CI): 1.18 (1.06, 1.28)], and mortality [OR (95% CI): 1.22 (1.00, 1.48)]. These associations were driven by patients whose most recent initial cancer diagnosis was within the past three years. Chemotherapy receipt was positively associated with all four COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., severe COVID [OR (95% CI): 1.96 (1.73, 2.22)], while receipt of either radiation or surgery alone were not associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Among cancer types, hematologic malignancies [OR (95% CI): 1.62 (1.39, 1.88)] and lung cancer [OR (95% CI): 1.81 (1.34, 2.43)] were significantly associated with higher odds of hospitalization. Hematologic malignancies were associated with ICU admission [OR (95% CI): 1.49 (1.11, 1.97)] and mortality [OR (95% CI): 1.57 (1.15, 2.11)], while melanoma and breast cancer were not associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Vaccinations were found to reduce the frequency of occurrence for the four COVID-19 outcomes across cancer status but those with cancer continued to have elevated risk of severe COVID [cancer OR (95% CI) among those fully vaccinated: 1.69 (1.10, 2.62)] relative to those without cancer even among vaccinated. ConclusionOur study provides insight to the relationship between cancer diagnosis, treatment, cancer type, vaccination, and COVID-19 outcomes. Our results indicate that it is plausible that specific diagnoses (e.g., hematologic malignancies, lung cancer) and treatments (e.g., chemotherapy) are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Vaccines significantly reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in individuals with cancer and those without, but cancer patients are still at higher risk of breakthrough infections and more severe COVID outcomes even after vaccination.

We aimed to assess breakdowns in structural connectivity from the supplementary motor area in patients with any combination of progressive AOS and/or agrammatic aphasia to determine which supplementary motor area tracts are specifically related to these clinical symptoms. Eighty-four patients with progressive AOS or progressive agrammatic aphasia were recruited by the Neurodegenerative Research Group and underwent neurological, speech/language, and neuropsychological testing, as well as 3 T diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Of the 84 patients, 36 had apraxia of speech in isolation (primary progressive apraxia of speech, PPAOS), 40 had apraxia of speech and agrammatic aphasia (AOS-PAA), and eight had agrammatic aphasia in isolation (progressive agrammatic aphasia, PAA). Tractography was performed to identify 5 distinct tracts connecting to the supplementary motor area. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were assessed at 10 positions along the length of the tracts to construct tract profiles, and median profiles were calculated for each tract. In a case-control comparison, decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity were observed along the supplementary motor area commissural fibers in all three groups compared to controls. PPAOS also had abnormal diffusion in tracts from the supplementary motor area to the putamen, prefrontal cortex, Broca's area (frontal aslant tract) and motor cortex, with greatest abnormalities observed closest to the supplementary motor area. The AOS-PAA group showed abnormalities in the same set of tracts, but with greater involvement of the supplementary motor area to prefrontal tract compared to PPAOS. PAA showed abnormalities in the left prefrontal and frontal aslant tracts compared to both other groups, with PAA showing greatest abnormalities furthest from the supplementary motor area. Severity of AOS correlated with tract metrics in the supplementary motor area commissural and motor cortex tracts. Severity of aphasia correlated with the frontal aslant and prefrontal tracts. These findings provide insight into how AOS and agrammatism are differentially related to disrupted diffusivity, with progressive AOS associated with abnormalities close to the supplementary motor area, and the frontal aslant and prefrontal tracts being particularly associated with agrammatic aphasia.","output":"Tractography of supplementary motor area projections in progressive speech apraxia and aphasia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"China's policy interventions to reduce the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 have environmental and economic impacts.

This evaluation is conducted through the perceptions of professional and community board members. The outcome consists of an inventory of best practices. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We collected data by means of semi-structured interviews with all eight member of the EAB. The interviews were conducted via telephone, lasted approximately 30 minutes each, and were audio-recorded with respondents permission. Respondents identities were held in confidence. The IRB at UTMB reviewed our study. The interviews were transcribed. The data were analyzed by means of an inductively-oriented, grounded theory approach (Charmaz, 2006). Emergent themes led to the formation of a series of best practices. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Common concerns included the need for more extensive training for new members;circulation of the agenda before the meeting;and the value of more structured main leadership. The members generally agreed that the breakout groups were valuable because they encouraged them to engage in hands-on responses to practical problems. One of the key epistemological findings was the consensus view that the evaluation of the EAB should be an ongoing project, as opposed to a yearly task. This serious approach to evaluation would be conducive to a process analysis of the EAB, since medical, social, economic, and cultural conditions surrounding and influencing translational science are generally in flux (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic and the various stages in the CTSA grant).

Rare disease researches are enlightening, with more workload to clinicians, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. We aim to explore the mental influence of participating in rare disease researches on clinicians. METHOD: Doctors received electronic questionnaires regarding job-burnout in October 2020. The modified Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS) was used to evaluate job burnout state. The MBI-GS consisting of three dimensions, emotional exhaustion (five questions), cynicism (five questions), and reduced personal accomplishment (six questions). The 7-grade Likert scale is adopted in each question, from 0 point (never) to 6 points (very frequently). Job burnout was considered if the average score of any dimension is no less than three. RESULTS: Questionnaires from all 203 doctors were analysed in this study, with females (70.0%, n=140). Age ranging from 25 to 39, 40 to 54, and above 55 were 41.4%, 50.7%, 7.9%, respectively. Nearly half of the subjects (50.2%, n=102) fulfil the definition of job-burnout, which was fewer than that in the residency program (50.2% vs. 62.9%, p=0.02). An inappropriate evaluation system (36.0%) and lack of private time (35.5%) were the leading cause of job-burnout. The pressure of scientific researches (79.3%) and career promotion (58.1%) was the major source of mental pressure. Doctors who participated in rare disease researches (46.8%, n=95) did not show significant differences in burnout rate than individuals who did not (44.2% vs 55.6%, p=0.123), nor as in three dimensions (27.3% vs 36.1%, p=0.183 for emotional exhaustion, 21.1% vs 20.4%, p=0.905 for cynicism, 21.1% vs 27.8%, p=0.267 for reduced personal accomplishment). Logistic analysis revealed that high requirement from superior (22.5% vs 6.9%, p= 0.001), pressure from family (33.3% vs 17.8%, p=0.010), inappropriate job allocation (47.1% vs 29.7%, p= 0.019) as well as delayed off-work time (p=0.013) were independent risk factors of job-burnout. Physicians who participate in rare disease research had better job allocation (75.8% vs. 49.1%, p<0.001), but not in the other three risk factors.

This study evaluated immunity over time. Design, setting, participants, and measurements: This retrospective cohort study included maintenance dialysis patients from a midsize national dialysis provider who received a complete SARS-CoV-2 vaccine series and had at least one antibody titer checked after full vaccination. Immunoglobulin G spike antibodies (SAb-IgG) titers were assessed monthly with routine labs beginning after full vaccination and followed over time; the semiquantitative SAb-IgG titer reported a range between 0 and []20 U/L. Descriptive analyses compared trends over time by prior history of COVID-19 and type of vaccine received. Time-to-event analyses were conducted for the outcome of loss of seroresponse (SAb-IgG < 1 U/L or development of COVID-19). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for additional clinical characteristics of interest. Results: Among 1898 maintenance dialysis patients, 1567 (84%) had no prior history of COVID-19. Patients without a history of COVID-19 had declining titers over time. Among 441 BNT162b2/Pfizer recipients, median [IQR] SAb-IgG titer declined from 20 [5.99-20] U/L in month 1 to 1.30 [0.15-3.59] U/L by month 6.

No national standards for best geocoding practice exist in Ireland. Irish postcodes (Eircodes) are not routinely recorded for infectious disease notifications and > 35% of dwellings have non-unique addresses. This may result in incomplete geocoding and introduce systematic errors into studies. AIMS: This study aimed to develop a reliable and reproducible methodology to geocode cryptosporidiosis notifications to fine-resolution spatial units (Census 2016 Small Areas), to enhance data validity and completeness, thus improving geospatial epidemiological studies. METHODS: A protocol was devised to utilise geocoding tools developed by the Health Service Executives Health Intelligence Unit. Geocoding employed finite-string automated and manual matching, undertaken sequentially in three additive phases. The protocol was applied to a cryptosporidiosis notification dataset (2008C2017) from Irelands Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting System. Outputs were validated against devised criteria. RESULTS: Overall, 92.1% (4266/4633) of cases were successfully geocoded to one Small Area, and 95.5% (n = 4425) to larger spatial units. The proportion of records geocoded increased by 14% using the multiphase approach, with 5% of records re-assigned to a different spatial unit. CONCLUSIONS: The developed multiphase protocol improved the completeness and validity of geocoding, thus increasing the power of subsequent studies. The authors recommend capturing Eircodes ideally using application programming interface for infectious disease or other health-related datasets, for more efficient and reliable geocoding. Where Eircodes are not recorded/available, for best geocoding practice, we recommend this (or a similar) quality driven protocol.","output":"Geocoding cryptosporidiosis cases in Ireland (2008C2017)development of a reliable, reproducible, multiphase geocoding methodology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, clinical laboratories worldwide are overwhelmed with SARS-CoV-2 testing using the current gold standard: real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. The large numbers of suspected cases led to shortages in numerous reagents such as specimen transport and RNA extraction buffers. We try to provide some answers on how strongly preanalytical issues affect RT-PCR results by reviewing the utility of different transport buffer media and virus inactivation procedures and comparing the literature data with our own recent findings. We show that various viral inactivation procedures and transport buffers are available and are less of a bottleneck for PCR-based methods. However, efficient alternative lysis buffers remain more difficult to find, and several fast RT-PCR assays are not compatible with guanidine-containing media, making this aspect more of a challenge in the current crisis. Furthermore, the availability of different SARS-CoV-2-specific RT-PCR kits with different sensitivities makes the definition of a general cutoff level for the cycle threshold (Ct) value challenging. Only a few studies have considered how Ct values relate to viral infectivity and how preanalytical issues might affect viral infectivity and RNA detection. We review the current data on the correlation between Ct values and viral infectivity. The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome in its own is not sufficient proof of infectivity and caution is needed in evaluation of the infectivity of samples. The correlation between Ct values and viral infectivity revealed an RT-PCR cutoff value of 34 cycles for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity using a laboratory-developed RT-PCR assay targeting the RdRp gene. While ideally each clinical laboratory should perform its own correlation, we believe this perspective article could be a reference point for others, in particular medical doctors and researchers interested in COVID-19 diagnostics, and a first step toward harmonization.","output":"Preanalytical Issues and Cycle Threshold Values in SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time RT-PCR Testing: Should Test Results Include These?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND CPAP is frequently used in prehospital and emergency settings. An air-flow output minimum of 60 L/min and a constant positive pressure are 2 important features for a successful CPAP device. Unlike hospital CPAP devices, which require electricity, CPAP devices for ambulance use need only an oxygen source to function. The aim of the study was to evaluate and compare on a bench model the performance of 3 orofacial mask devices (Ventumask, EasyVent, and Boussignac CPAP system) and 2 helmets (Ventukit and EVE Coulisse) used to apply CPAP in the prehospital setting. METHODS A static test evaluated air-flow output, positive pressure applied, and FIO2 delivered by each device. A dynamic test assessed airway pressure stability during simulated ventilation. Efficiency of devices was compared based on oxygen flow needed to generate a minimum air flow of 60 L/min at each CPAP setting. RESULTS The EasyVent and EVE Coulisse devices delivered significantly higher mean air-flow outputs compared with the Ventumask and Ventukit under all CPAP conditions tested. The Boussignac CPAP system never reached an air-flow output of 60 L/min. The EasyVent had significantly lower pressure excursion than the Ventumask at all CPAP levels, and the EVE Coulisse had lower pressure excursion than the Ventukit at 5, 15, and 20 cm H2O, whereas at 10 cm H2O, no significant difference was observed between the 2 devices. Estimated oxygen consumption was lower for the EasyVent and EVE Coulisse compared with the Ventumask and Ventukit. CONCLUSIONS Air-flow output, pressure applied, FIO2 delivered, device oxygen consumption, and ability to maintain air flow at 60 L/min differed significantly among the CPAP devices tested. Only the EasyVent and EVE Coulisse achieved the required minimum level of air-flow output needed to ensure an effective therapy under all CPAP conditions.","output":"CPAP Devices for Emergency Prehospital Use: A Bench Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease that requires long-term treatment to improve or maintain stable disease activity. Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), a class of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARD), are effective at treating symptoms and inhibiting joint progression. Although treatment changes are not recommended in patients with stable disease, health plans have recently enacted formulary changes with higher copayments that could disrupt patient access to TNFis. OBJECTIVE To assess the association of formulary copayment changes with real-world treatment patterns, treatment effectiveness, and health care costs among bDMARD-naive patients with RA receiving the TNFi etanercept. METHODS This retrospective observational cohort analysis used the IBM Watson Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database. Adult patients with RA with 6 months of stable etanercept use (no refill gap  45 days) from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2015, were selected and the index date was set to the first fill date after the stable-use period. Average etanercept copayment was calculated at the drug-plan level. Copayment change was defined as a monthly increase of at least $40 to account for copayment changes attributable to etanercept wholesale acquisition costs between 2014 and 2015. This amount also corresponded to the 90th percentile of average plan-level changes in etanercept copayments in the database, representing an average change in copayment by a payer. Patients were followed  12 months before and after the index date to track etanercept treatment changes and  12 months after a treatment change to track costs after etanercept copayment changes. Etanercept persistence, bDMARD switching, refill gaps, and treatment effectiveness (using a validated effectiveness algorithm) were described for patients with or without copayment change during the 12 months post-index or postchange. We also assessed the mean total of all-cause and RA-related expenditure during the 12-month post-index (or postchange) period. RESULTS 1,970 stable patients met study inclusion criteria (mean [standard deviation] age: 50.3 [9.5] years; 77.8% female) and were evaluated. Of these, 133 (6.8%) patients had a copayment change $40 during follow-up. Overall, most patients (60.3%) persisted on etanercept for the 12-month follow-up period, while 13.0% switched from etanercept, and 8.1% discontinued (refill gap of  45 days). Nearly half (48.0%) of all patients were considered effectively treated according to a validated algorithm. Compared with patients without a copayment change, those with a copayment change were more likely to switch biologics (19.5% vs. 12.6%; P = 0.021). Although statistical significance was not reached, patients with a copayment change were less likely to be persistent (54.1% vs. 60.7%; P = 0.135), and less likely to be effectively treated (42.1% vs. 48.4%; P = 0.161) than patients without a copayment change. All-cause and RA-related expenditures at baseline and post-copayment change were similar between patients with and without a copayment change. CONCLUSIONS Changing formulary copayment of etanercept was associated with higher switching without difference in costs or health care utilization between copayment and no copayment change groups.

Blood tests every 3 months in those on continuous treatment for > 1 year who have never had an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 2,000/L has been proposed as a monitoring strategy; however, there are no South American data to support this recommendation. This study sought to investigate whether clozapine use and other variables could explain the occurrence of ANC < 1,000/L in patients with severe mental disorders. METHODS: A total of 5,847 subjects were included, 1,038 on clozapine. We performed a Cox regression considering the outcome as ANC < 1,000/L at any time point. Predictors were sex, age, ethnicity, clozapine use, ANC > 2,000/L during the first year of blood monitoring, and presence of a severe medical condition. RESULTS: In the Cox regression model, ethnicity (white) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.53; 95%CI 0.29-0.99, p < 0.05) and ANC > 2,000/L (HR 0.04; 95%CI 0.01-0.10, p < 0.001) were protective factors, while presence of a severe medical condition (HR 69.35; 95%CI 37.45-128.44, p < 0.001) was a risk factor for ANC < 1,000/L. Other variables were not significant, including clozapine use (HR 1.33; 95%CI 0.74-2.39, p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that clozapine does not increase the risk of neutropenia in subjects with ANC > 2,000/L during the first year of use and in the absence of a severe medical condition. These results could help guide clinical and public-health decisions regarding clozapine blood monitoring guidelines.","output":"Risk of neutropenia among clozapine users and non-users: results from 5,847 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae-family The genus Beta-coronaviruses, are enveloped positive strand RNA viruses with club-like spikes at the surface with a unique replication process and a large RNA genome (25 kb) CoVs are known as one of the major pathogenic viruses causing a variety of diseases in birds and mammals including humans (lethal respiratory dysfunctions) Recently, a new strain of coronavirus has been identified and named as SARS-CoV-2 A large number of COVID-19 (disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) cases are being diagnosed all over the World especially in China (Wuhan) COVID-19 showed high mortality rate exponentially, however, not even a single effective cure is being introduced yet against COVID-19 In the current study, immunoinformatics approaches were employed to predict the antigenic epitopes against COVID-19 for the development of a coronavirus peptide vaccine Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) and B-cell epitopes were predicted for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus structural proteins (Spikes, Membrane, Envelope, and Nucleocapsid) The docking complexes of the top 10 epitopes having antigenic sites were analyzed led by binding affinity and binding interactional analyses of top ranked predicted peptides with the MHC-I HLA molecule The predicted peptides may have potential to be used as peptide vaccine against COVID-19 ?

This study aims to assess individual changes in mental health and health status before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, and to explore potential predictors of change. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in Germany (n = 15 037) were conducted. Demographics, depression and anxiety symptoms (PHQ-2, GAD-2), distress (DT), and health status (EQ-5D-3L) were assessed. Additionally, all instruments used were adapted to measure the participants mental health and health status before the COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19, and the subjective level of information about COVID-19 were examined. RESULTS: Overall, the participants showed a significant increase in depression and anxiety symptoms, and distress, while health status deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. Impairment in mental health was predicted by COVID-19-related fear. Pre-existing mental illness predicted an increase in depression symptoms and a deterioration in health status. Trust in governmental actions and the subjective level of information predicted less increase in psychological burden.

Therefore, there are ongoing research efforts to identify drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro that resulted in hundreds of X-ray crystal structures of ligand-bound Mpro complexes in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) describing the interactions of different fragment chemotypes within different sites of the Mpro. In this work, we performed rigorous molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of 62 reversible ligand-Mpro complexes in the PDB to gain mechanistic insights about their interactions at the atomic level. Using a total of over 3 s long MD trajectories, we characterized different pockets in the apo Mpro structure, and analyzed the dynamic interactions and binding affinity of ligands within those pockets. Our results identified the key residues that stabilize the ligands in the catalytic sites and other pockets of Mpro. Our analyses unraveled the role of a lateral pocket in the catalytic site in Mpro that is critical for enhancing the ligand binding to the enzyme. We also highlighted the important contribution from HIS163 in the lateral pocket towards ligand binding and affinity against Mpro through computational mutation analyses.

Ride-pooling, where a single vehicle is shared by more than one traveller, is not only appealing for mobility platforms and their travellers, but also for promoting the sustainability of urban mobility systems. Yet, the potential of ride-pooling rides to serve as a safe and effective alternative given the personal and public health risks considerations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic is hitherto unknown. To answer this, we combine epidemiological and behavioural shareability models to examine spreading among ride-pooling travellers, with an application for Amsterdam. Findings are at first sight devastating, with only few initially infected travellers needed to spread the virus to hundreds of ride-pooling users. Without intervention, ride-pooling system may substantially contribute to virus spreading. Notwithstanding, we identify an effective control measure allowing to halt the spreading before the outbreaks (at 50 instead of 800 infections) without sacrificing the efficiency achieved by pooling. Fixed matches among co-travellers disconnect the otherwise dense contact network, encapsulating the virus in small communities and preventing the outbreaks.","output":"Modelling virus spreading in ride-pooling networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic triggered university lockdowns, forcing physiology educators to rapidly pivot laboratories into a remote delivery format. This study documents the experiences of an international group of 10 physiology educators surrounding this transition. They wrote reflective narratives, framed by guiding questions, to answer the research question: \\"What were the changes to physiology laboratories in response to the COVID-19 pandemic?\\" These narratives probed educators' attitudes toward virtual laboratories before, during, and after the transition to remote delivery. Thematic analysis of the reflections found that before COVID-19 only a few respondents had utilized virtual laboratories and most felt that virtual laboratories could not replace the in-person laboratory experience. In response to university lockdowns, most respondents transitioned from traditional labs to remote formats within a week or less. The most common remote delivery formats were commercially available online physiology laboratories, homemade videos, and sample experimental data. The main challenges associated with the rapid remote transition included workload and expertise constraints, disparities in online access and workspaces, issues with academic integrity, educator and student stress, changes in learning outcomes, and reduced engagement. However, the experience generated opportunities including exploration of unfamiliar technologies, new collaborations, and revisiting the physiology laboratory curriculum and structure. Most of the respondents reported planning on retaining some aspects of the remote laboratories postpandemic, particularly with a blended model of remote and on-campus laboratories.

Several chemotypes of small molecules, including heteroaryldihydropyrimidines (HAPs) and sulfamoylbenzamides (SBAs), have been discovered to allosterically modulate core protein structure and consequentially alter the kinetics and pathway of core protein assembly, resulting in formation of irregularly-shaped core protein aggregates or empty capsids devoid of pre-genomic RNA and viral DNA polymerase. Interestingly, in addition to inhibiting nucleocapsid assembly and subsequent viral genome replication, we have now demonstrated that HAPs and SBAs differentially modulate the biosynthesis of covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA from de novo infection and intracellular amplification pathways by inducing disassembly of nucleocapsids derived from virions as well as double-stranded DNA-containing progeny nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm. Specifically, the mistimed cuing of nucleocapsid uncoating prevents cccDNA formation during de novo infection of hepatocytes, while transiently accelerating cccDNA synthesis from cytoplasmic progeny nucleocapsids. Our studies indicate that elongation of positive-stranded DNA induces structural changes of nucleocapsids, which confers ability of mature nucleocapsids to bind CpAMs and triggers its disassembly. Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the dual effects of the core protein allosteric modulators on nucleocapsid assembly and disassembly will facilitate the discovery of novel core protein-targeting antiviral agents that can more efficiently suppress cccDNA synthesis and cure chronic hepatitis B.","output":"HBV core protein allosteric modulators differentially alter cccDNA biosynthesis from de novo infection and intracellular amplification pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many studies have highlighted the impact of lockdowns on the lifestyle of university students.

Methods: We enrolled adults and children in a prospective 6-month study in the following categories: 1) symptomatic, SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ (SP+; children, n=8; adults, n=16), 2) symptomatic, PCR- or untested (children, n=27), 3) asymptomatic exposed (children, n=13) and 4) asymptomatic, no known exposure (children, n=19). Neutralizing and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 antigens and Spike protein variants were measured by multiplex serological assays. Results: All SP+ children developed nAb, whereas 81% of SP+ adults developed nAb. Decline in the presence of nAb over 6 months was not significant in symptomatic children (100% to 87.5%, p=0.32) in contrast to adults (81.3 to 50.0%, p=0.03). Among all children with nAb (n=22), nAb titers and change in titers over 6 months were similar in symptomatic and asymptomatic children. Levels of IgG antibodies in children to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, RBD-1 and -2, nucleocapsid and N-terminal domain antigens and to Spike protein variants were similar to those in adults. IgG levels to primary antigens decreased over time in both children and adults, but levels to three of six Spike variants decreased only in children. Conclusions: Children with asymptomatic or symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection develop robust neutralizing antibodies that remain present longer than in adults but wane in titer over time, and broad IgG antibodies that also wane in level over time.","output":"Level and duration of IgG and neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in children with symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, chlorine-containing disinfectants have been widely used in nucleic acid amplification testing laboratories.

We also explored the mechanisms and models of action of chlorine-containing disinfectants that affected the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The results showed that different HOCl concentrations and different action times had an impact on the SARS-CoV-2 results. High concentrations of ambient HOCl have a greater impact than low concentrations, and this effect will increase with the extension of the action time and with the increase in ambient humidity. Compared with the enzymes or the extracted RNA required for RT-PCR, the impact of HOCl on the SARS-CoV-2 detection is more likely to be caused by damage to primers and probes in the PCR system. The false negative result still existed after changing the ambient disinfectant to ethanol but not peracetic acid. The use of HOCl in the environment will have an unpredictable impact on the nucleic acid test results of SARS-CoV-2.

Resolution of inflammation is an active process, and the pro-resolution effects of lipoxins, resolvins and protectins have received significant interest. Here, we review emerging data on the role of these lipid mediators in infectious disease. Lipoxins influence host control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi and Plasmodium berghei cerebral malaria in mice. Their effects are protective in toxoplasmosis, T. cruzi infection and cerebral malaria but detrimental in tuberculosis; related to the balance between pathogen-control and excessive immune response. Topical lipoxin abrogates the tissue damage seen in a rabbit model of Porphyromonas gingivalis periodontitis. The increased virulence of H5N1 influenza A virus in mice correlates with reduced expression of SOCS2, required to mediate the effects of lipoxin. Mice unable to synthesize lipoxin suffer increased lung pathology during respiratory syncytial virus infection. Protectin suppresses influenza A virus replication in vitro and increases survival in a mouse model of severe influenza infection. Resolvins were investigated in a number of animal models of systemic bacterial infection, and were found to enhance phagocytic clearance of bacteria, reduce inflammation severity, promote neutrophil apoptosis, modulate neutrophil chemotaxis and importantly, reduce mortality. Interestingly, resolvin also enhances the antibacterial effect of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. Topical resolvin application reduces the severity of herpes simplex virus ocular infection in mice.

We here report on an aglycon analogue of the antibiotic teicoplanin (code name LCTA-949) that inhibits DENV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in a dose-dependent manner. Virus infection was completely inhibited at concentrations that had no adverse effect on the host cells. These findings were corroborated by quantification of viral RNA levels in culture supernatant. Antiviral activity was also observed against other flaviviruses such as the yellow fever virus and the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). In particular, potent antiviral activity was observed against TBEV. Time-of-drug-addition experiments indicated that LCTA-949 inhibits an early stage in the DENV replication cycle; however, a virucidal effect was excluded. This observation was corroborated by the fact that LCTA-949 lacks activity on DENV subgenomic replicon (that does not encode structural proteins) replication. Using a microsopy-based binding and fusion assay employing DiD-labeled viruses, it was shown that LCTA-949 targets the early stage (binding/entry) of the infection. Moreover, LCTA-949 efficiently inhibits infectivity of DENV particles pre-opsonized with antibodies, thus potentially also inhibiting antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify potential failure points in a new chemotherapy preparation technology and to implement changes that prevent or minimize the consequences of those failures before they occur using the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) approach. METHODS: An FMEA was conducted by a team of medication safety pharmacists, oncology pharmacists and technicians, leadership from informatics, investigational drug, and medication safety services, and representatives from the technology vendor. Failure modes were scored using both Risk Priority Number (RPN) and Risk Hazard Index (RHI) scores. RESULTS: The chemotherapy preparation workflow was defined in a 41-step process with 16 failure modes. The RPN and RHI scores were identical for each failure mode because all failure modes were considered detectable. Five failure modes, all attributable to user error, were deemed to pose the highest risk. Mitigation strategies and system changes were identified for 2 failure modes, with subsequent system modifications resulting in reduced risk. CONCLUSION: The FMEA was a useful tool for risk mitigation and workflow optimization prior to implementation of an intravenous compounding technology.

RESULTS: Four major themes emerged: (a) unprecedented pressure (first-line nurse managers revealed their suffering with the unprecedented demanding situations during COVID-19 pandemic); (b) strengthening system and resilience (nurse managers employed several strategies to strengthen the health system and enhance resilience); (c) building a supportive team (the presence of a robust supportive system is vital to deal with the pandemic); and (d) maturity during the crisis (exposure to a new experience developed nurse managers management skills and self-awareness). CONCLUSIONS: The unprecedented pressure associated with COVID-19 drained first-line nurse managers physically and psychosocially. Providing adequately trained staff and medical equipment is important to better deal with crises. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Strengthening emergency training and improving emergency response plans of hospitals are essential.","output":"Experiences of first-line nurse managers during COVID-19: A Jordanian qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated coagulopathy is unusual, poorly defined and is linked with significant hypercoagulability and microthrombotic and macrothrombotic complications leading to worse outcomes and higher mortality. Conventional coagulation assays do not always actively reflect these derangements and might fail to detect this coagulopathy. Viscoelastic hemostatic assays (VHA) provide a possible tool that adds to conventional coagulation assays in identifying this hypercoagulable state. VHA has been mostly used in surgery and trauma but it's still not well defined in sepsis patients with lack of large randomized trials. Few studies described VHA findings in patients with COVID-19 showing significant hypercoagulability and fibrinolysis shutdown. Clinicians taking care of these patients might have little experience interpreting VHA results.

Several studies have identified psychological, cognitive, and neurophysiological measures that might explain this MI-BCI inefficiency. Traditional research had focused on mu suppression in the sensorimotor area in order to classify imagery, but this does not reflect the true dynamics that underlie motor imagery. Functional connectivity reflects the interaction between brain regions during the MI task and resting-state network and is a promising tool in improving MI-BCI classification. In this study, 54 novice MI-BCI users were split into two groups based on their accuracy and their functional connectivity was compared in three network scales (Global, Large and Local scale) during the resting-state, left vs. right-hand motor imagery task, and the transition between the two phases. Our comparison of High and Low BCI performers showed that in the alpha band, functional connectivity in the right hemisphere was increased in High compared to Low aptitude MI-BCI users during motor imagery.

Family and clinician perspectives about phone and video communication in the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic are not yet well-understood. Increased knowledge about clinicians' and families' experiences with telehealth may help to improve the quality of remote interactions with families during periods of hospital visitor restrictions during COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To explore experiences, perspectives and attitudes of family members and ICU clinicians about phone and video interactions during COVID-19 hospital visitor restrictions. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative interviewing study with an intentional sample of twenty-one family members and fourteen treating clinicians of cardiothoracic and neurologic ICU patients at an academic medical center in April 2020. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with each participant. We used content analysis to develop a codebook and analyze interview transcripts. We specifically explored themes of effectiveness, benefits and limitations, communication strategies, and discordant perspectives between families and clinicians related to remote discussions. RESULTS: Respondents viewed phone and video communication as somewhat effective but inferior to in-person communication. Both clinicians and families thought phone calls were useful for information-sharing and brief updates, while video calls were preferable for aligning clinician and family perspectives. Clinicians and families expressed discordant views on multiple topics-for example, clinicians worried they were unsuccessful in conveying empathy remotely, while families felt empathy was conveyed successfully via phone and video. Communication strategies suggested by families and clinicians for remote interactions include identifying a family point-person to receive updates, frequently checking family understanding, positioning the camera on video calls to help family see the patient and their clinical setting, and offering time for the family and patient to interact without clinicians participating. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth communication between families and clinicians of ICU patients appears a somewhat effective alternative when in-person communication is not possible. Use of communication strategies specific to phone and video can improve clinician and family experiences with telehealth.","output":"Perspectives on Telephone and Video Communication in the ICU during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Current mitigation strategies for SARS-CoV-2 rely on population-wide adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Monitoring NPI adoption, mobility patterns and their association with SARS-CoV-2 infection can provide key information for public health agencies and be used to calibrate transmission models. METHODS: We used an online panel to accrue representative samples from Florida, Illinois, and Maryland (n=3,009, approximately 1,000 per state) from July 15C31, 2020 and capture socio-demographically and geographically resolved information about NPI adoption and mobility in the prior 2 weeks. Logistic regression was used to identify correlates of self-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection in the prior 2 weeks. RESULTS: Overall, 96% reported traveling outside their home in the prior 2 weeks, the most common reason being to visit a grocery store/pharmacy (92%), followed by visiting friends/family (61%), and visiting a place of worship (23%); 22% reporting public transportation use. In total, 44% of respondents reported always practicing social distancing and 40% reported always using a mask indoors and outdoors. Overall, 74 (2.5%) reported testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the prior 2 weeks, with strong dose-response relationships between several forms of movement frequency and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Variables capturing mobility were all highly correlated with one another, suggesting there are clusters of individuals who engage in multiple activities (Figure); 41% of positive cases engaged in all forms of mobility captured compared to 1% of those who did not test positive within the prior 2 weeks. Patterns of mobility and NPI uptake did not significantly differ by state; however, there were significant relationships with age, race/ethnicity, and gender. In multivariable models including adjustment for NPIs, significant relationships remained with public transportation, visiting a place of worship, and participating in outdoor group fitness activities. Figure. Heatmap depicting pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients between survey responses. Pairwise correlation coefficients are displayed in the boxes at intersection of any two variables. Questions were asked with respect activities in the prior 2 weeks. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: NPI adoption and mobility did not vary across these three states with variable policies and SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates. Rather, associations with recent positivity appear to be driven largely by mobility patterns and engagement in activities where NPI use may be challenging or inconsistent.

Methods A qualitative design with focus group interviews was used to elaborate on the quantitative survey results obtained and analyzed in a previous survey study from the first phase of the Covid-19 pandemic. Five focus groups with seventeen adolescents were conducted digitally during the second pandemic phase in November and December 2020. The interview data were analyzed with directed content analysis. Results The adolescents reported using traditional media and official websites as sources for Covid-19 information. They engaged in preventive behavior, and washing hands and keeping a distance from strangers had become a habit. However, not being physically close to friends felt strange and unpleasant. The measure most frequently discussed was limiting social contact, which was a constant struggle. No one disputed the authorities' guidelines and rules, but the social restrictions caused boredom and despair, particularly due to interrupted schooling and missed opportunities to engage in life events, and freely socialize with friends. Conclusion The adolescents gave an overall impression of being health literate, which corresponds well with the results from our previous survey study. Their descriptions of how they translated protective measures into their everyday lives demonstrate that they took responsibility and accepted personal costs for the collective good.

While medical students wanted high-quality, consolidated educational resources on COVID-19, the medical school faculty who typically produced such resources were increasingly burdened with clinical, administrative, and personal commitments. However, students eager to contribute to the pandemic response were well-suited to create these instructional materials for their peers. APPROACH: In mid-March 2020, a group of students at Harvard Medical School came together to synthesize the key facts and collate the best existing educational materials about the COVID-19 pandemic into a unified learning resource. The materials were faculty reviewed and shared freely online. The curriculum now contains 8 modules that are updated regularly. Throughout this process, the student authors prioritized accessibility, iterative improvement, and effective pedagogy. OUTCOMES: To date, nearly 80,000 users from 132 countries have accessed the curriculum. It has been referenced or incorporated into courses at Harvard Medical School and more than 30 other medical schools across the country. About 40% of all users are from outside the United States, and the materials have been translated into 28 languages. This effort has spurred a number of other educational initiatives led by medical student groups in the United States and abroad. NEXT STEPS: As understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic is constantly changing, the student authors' immediate goal is to keep the curriculum up to date in the months to come. They plan to maintain existing partnerships with medical schools and student groups around the world while pursuing new opportunities to expand the curriculum's reach, provide education, and build community.

Our study found that low trabecular bone score (TBS) (a measure of bone strength) may help identify people with CF at risk of fractures especially when combined with bone density measured by DXA, age, hemoglobin A1c, and transplant status. INTRODUCTION: People with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at increased risk of fractures. This study aims to evaluate the association of trabecular bone score (TBS) with fractures in CF. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of adults with CF who completed bone density between 2009 and 2019. TBS was applied to lumbar spine studies. RESULTS: A total of 202 people with CF were included. A history of fracture was present in 36 (17.8%) subjects. Patients with history of fractures had higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C) (7.8  2.7% vs. 6.7  1.7%, p = 0.024), lower femoral neck (FN) Z/T-score (- 1.05  1.08 vs. - 0.44  1.08, p = 0.012), and lower TBS (1.36  0.13 vs. 1.40  0.11, p = 0.05) compared to those without. Lung transplant recipients had a higher prevalence of fractures (50% vs. 14.1%, p < 0.001). The odds ratio (95%CI) of having a fracture for subjects with TBS ( 1.2 vs. > 1.2) stratified by FN Z/T-score ( - 2.0 or > - 2.0) was 3.88 (0.92, 16.35), p = 0.07. ROC analysis showed TBS was significantly associated with fractures (p < 0.05); however, FN BMD was superior. A model combining FN BMD, age, A1c, transplant, and TBS improved ROC compared to FN BMD + age (0.837 vs. 0.779, p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: TBS  1.2 may identify people with CF at high risk of fractures.

Prediction performances not only depend on the structure and features of the model, but also on its parametrization. Official databases are often biased due to lag in reporting of cases, changing testing policy or incompleteness of data. Moreover, model parametrization is time-dependent e.g. due to changing age-structures, new emerging virus variants, non-pharmaceutical interventions and ongoing vaccination programs. To cover these aspects, we develop a principled approach to parametrize SIR-type epidemiologic models of different complexities by embedding the model structure as a hidden layer into a general Input-Output Non-Linear Dynamical System (IO-NLDS). Non-explicitly modelled impacts on the system are imposed as inputs of the system. Observable data are coupled to hidden states of the model by appropriate data models considering possible biases of the data. We estimate model parameters including their time-dependence by a Bayesian knowledge synthesis process considering parameter ranges derived from external studies as prior information. We applied this approach on a SIR-type model and data of Germany and Saxony demonstrating good prediction performances. By our approach, we can estimate and compare for example the relative effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and can provide scenarios of the future course of the epidemic under specified conditions. Our method of parameter estimation can be translated to other data sets, i.e. other countries and other SIR-type models even for other disease contexts.","output":"On the parametrization of epidemiologic models -- lessons from modelling COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microalgae and cyanobacteria are good sources for prospecting metabolites of biotechnological interest, including glucosidase inhibitors.

We find that, first, after the proposal of the BRI, the total direct carbon dioxide emissions of the Silk Roads countries and Chinas proportion of carbon dioxide emission transfer to the other Silk Roads countries have both declined. Second, the Silk Roads countries are generally the net receivers of carbon dioxide emission transfer, and the inflow is mainly distributed in Southeast Asian countries and core countries in other sub-regions. Then, the transfer of carbon dioxide emission accepted by the Silk Roads countries comes mostly from large developing countries, such as China, Russia, and India, and developed countries, such as the United States, Japan, and Germany. The products are mainly concentrated in energy and chemical industries, as well as heavy industries, such as mining and quarrying, and metal products.

We report that P2ry6-deficient mice exhibit marked resistance to DMBA/TPA-induced skin papilloma formation compared with wild-type mice. Consistent with these findings, epidermal hyperplasia in response to TPA was suppressed in the P2ry6 knockout or MRS2578 (P2RY6 antagonist)-treated mice. The dramatic decrease in hyperplasia and tumorigenesis due to P2ry6 disruption was associated with the suppression of TPA-induced keratinocyte proliferation and inflammatory reactions. Notably, P2ry6 deletion prevented the TPA-induced increase in YAP nuclear accumulation and its downstream gene expression in an MST/LATS1-dependent manner. Upon TPA stimulation, enhanced activation of MEK1 and ?-catenin were also impaired in P2ry6 knockout primary keratinocytes, tumor tissues or MRS2578-treated HaCaT cells. Moreover, mutual promotion of the YAP and ?-catenin signaling pathways was observed in normal skin cells treated with TPA, while P2ry6 deletion could inhibit their crosstalk by regulating MEK1.

This paper aims to examine the suitability of analytical hierarchy process (AHP)-based tools for initial screening of manufacturing reshoring decisions.Design/methodology/approachTwo AHP-based tools for the initial screening of manufacturing reshoring decisions are developed. The first tool is based on traditional AHP, while the second is based on fuzzy-AHP. Six high-level and holistic reshoring criteria based on competitive priorities were identified through a literature review. Next, a panel of experts from a Swedish manufacturing company was involved in the overall comparison of the criteria. Based on this comparison, priority weights of the criteria were obtained through a pairwise analysis. Subsequently, the priority weights were used in a weighted-sum manner to evaluate 20 reshoring scenarios. Afterwards, the outputs from the traditional AHP and fuzzy-AHP tools were compared to the opinions of the experts. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the stability of the developed decision support tools.FindingsThe research demonstrates that AHP-based support tools are suitable for the initial screening of manufacturing reshoring decisions. With regard to the presented set of criteria and reshoring scenarios, both traditional AHP and fuzzy-AHP are shown to be consistent with the experts' decisions. Moreover, fuzzy-AHP is shown to be marginally more reliable than traditional AHP. According to the sensitivity analysis, the order of importance of the six criteria is stable for high values of weights of cost and quality criteria.Research limitations/implicationsThe limitation of the developed AHP-based tools is that they currently only include a limited number of high-level decision criteria. Therefore, future research should focus on adding low-level criteria to the tools using a multi-level architecture. The current research contributes to the body of literature on the manufacturing reshoring decision-making process by addressing decision-making issues in general and by demonstrating the suitability of two decision support tools applied to the manufacturing reshoring field in particular.Practical implicationsThis research provides practitioners with two decision support tools for the initial screening of manufacturing reshoring decisions, which will help managers optimize their time and resources on the most promising reshoring alternatives. Given the complex nature of reshoring decisions, the results from the fuzzy-AHP are shown to be slightly closer to those of the experts than traditional AHP for initial screening of manufacturing relocation decisions.Originality/valueThis paper describes two decision support tools that can be applied for the initial screening of manufacturing reshoring decisions while considering six high-level and holistic criteria. Both support tools are applied to evaluate 20 identical manufacturing reshoring scenarios, allowing a comparison of their output. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates the relative importance of the reshoring criteria.","output":"AHP-based support tools for initial screening of manufacturing reshoring decisions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loneliness, which may be more prevalent in older than younger adults, may lead to increased subjective cognitive decline and cognitive impairment may in turn predict perceived loneliness. COVID-19 physical distancing restrictions may exacerbate perceived loneliness, especially that experienced by older adults. The present study investigated whether self-reported cognitive abilities (i.e., executive functions) would predict loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Younger (YA; n = 136, 18-35 years), middle-aged (MA; n = 126, 36-54 years), and older (OA; n = 171, 55-88 years) adults completed questionnaires assessing self-reported executive functions (EF) and perceived loneliness using the BRIEF-A and UCLA Loneliness scale respectively. Forty-nine of the 171 older participants partially completed a cognitive learning intervention, which has previously been found to increase EF. In the current study, age group did not significantly predict perceived loneliness. However, OA who participated in the prior intervention reported less loneliness than those who did not participate in the intervention. Additionally, OA who participated in the intervention and self-reported worse EF during the current study, also reported feeling lonelier than adults who did not participate in the intervention. Although results from our prior research found most OA who participated in the intervention improved their EF, the results from the current study suggest that it left them more susceptible to the negative effects of physical distancing restrictions if they had lower self-reported EF during the pandemic. Decreased engagement, real or perceived, in cognitively stimulating activities due to the pandemic strengthens the relationship between lower self-reported EF and perceived loneliness.","output":"Older Adults Engagement in Cognitively Stimulating Activities Prior to the Pandemic Predicts Loneliness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study examined the daily well-being of Koreans (n = 353,340) for 11 weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic (January 20 CApril 7).

First, we found that the well-being of Koreans changed daily in a cubic fashion, such that it declined and recovered during the early phase but declined substantially during the later phase (after COVID- 19 was declared world pandemic by WHO). Second, unlike other emotions, boredom displayed a distinctive pattern of linear increase, especially for younger people, suggesting that boredom might be, in part, responsible for their inability to comply with social distancing recommendations. Third, the well-being of older people and males changed less compared to younger people and females. Finally, daily well-being dropped significantly more in the hard-hit regions than in other regions.

A 1.1. kilobase cDNA, prepared from the BVDV genome, was molecularly cloned and used in this study. Insert cDNA was removed from the pUC9 plasmid vector by Pst-I restriction endonuclease digestion and purified from plasmid DNA by agarose electrophoresis and electroelution. The hybridization probe was prepared by nick translation in the presence of gamma dCT(32)P and labelled to a specific activity of 2  10(8) cpm/g of DNA. Specificity was determined by dot blot hybridization of infected cell culture supernate from nine different BVDV strains. The probe hybridized equally with all strains of BVDV tested, which included four cytopathic and five noncytopathic strains of BVDV. Serum was collected from veal calves with respiratory tract disease, unthriftiness, anorexia, and/or poor conditions. Serum samples were treated with nonidet P40 detergent and denatured with formaldehyde and heat prior to application on 1.2 micron nylon membrane filters using a vacuum dot blot apparatus. Hybridization was done under relatively stringent conditions (50% formamide at 42C). A total of 141 serum samples from different calves were tested and of these samples, 55 (39%) were positive by dot blot hybridization for BVDV RNA.

This study explored the early impact of COVID-19 on the emotional well-being of patients and self-reported changes in their home therapy since the start of the pandemic. METHODS: Adult patients with CF, lung-transplanted (LTX) CF patients and parents of children with CF completed an online questionnaire, securely linked to their medical files. The questionnaire covered the emotional impact of the pandemic, changes in CF and LTX treatment, changes in health-protecting behaviours and CF-related concerns, and their perception of their COVID-19 status. RESULTS: The response rate was 63% (80 CF, 66 LTX and 73 parents). A wide range of illness severity was included. None of the respondents had contracted COVID-19 and all strictly followed the social distancing rules. There was evident psychological impact, with many reporting increased stress, fear and worry about CF and the future. Changes in treatment were positive, including more physiotherapy for adults and better-quality nebulizing. Changes in routine were reported, such as different treatment timing. Adult patients and parents had cancelled their CF appointments more often since the start of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The initial psychological impact of COVID-19 was evident. The impact on home treatment was reassuringly small. Psychological care is needed for patients suffering prolonged psychological impact, and CF teams need to contextualize the information that patients and parents receive from the media and support them to balance the perceived risk with true risk.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the emotional well-being and home treatment of Belgian patients with cystic fibrosis, including transplanted patients and paediatric patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2, a novel lineage of the coronavirus causing COVID-19, contains multiple mutations within two immunodominant domains of the spike protein.

The cavity and target drainage tubes are difficult to reach; therefore, a nasogastric tube (NGT) and fasting are required for an extended period. We successfully treated and managed two patients with anastomotic leakage using percutaneous transesophageal gastro-tubing (PTEG). CASE PRESENTATION In case 1, a 79-year-old man with gastric cancer underwent total gastrectomy; 1 week later, he underwent emergent open laparotomy due to panperitonitis attributed to anastomotic leakage-related jejunojejunostomy. We resected the portion between esophagojejunostomy and jejunojejunostomy and reconstructed it using the Roux-en-Y technique. On postoperative day (POD) 9, anastomotic leakage was diagnosed at the esophagojejunostomy site and jejunotomy staple line. After using a circular stapler for jejunojejunostomy, a stapled jejunal closure was added. We inserted an NGT and performed aspiration for bowel decompression. As he did not improve within 2 weeks, we decided to perform PTEG to free him of the NGT. We kept performing intermittent aspiration; leakage stopped shortly after, due to effective inner drainage. The PTEG catheter was removed after oral intake was restarted. In case 2, an 81-year-old man with esophagogastric junction cancer underwent resection of the distal esophagus and proximal stomach. After shaping the remnant stomach, esophagogastrostomy was performed under the right thoracotomy. On POD 11, anastomotic leakage was identified, along with a mediastinal abscess. We inserted an NGT into the abscess cavity through the anastomotic leakage site. On POD 25, we performed PTEG and inserted a drainage tube, instead of an NGT. Although the abscess cavity disappeared, anastomotic leakage persisted as a fistula. We exchanged the PTEG with a double elementary diet (W-ED) tube with jejunal extension, with the side hole located near the anastomosis. The anastomotic fistula disappeared after treatment. Dysphagia persisted due to disuse atrophy of swallowing musculature; PTEG was useful for enteral feeding, even after the leakage occurred. CONCLUSION Patients are sometimes forced to endure pain for a long time for transnasal inner drainage. Using PTEG, patients will be free of sinus pain and discomfort; PTEG should be helpful for patients withstanding NGT.","output":"Percutaneous transesophageal gastro-tubing for the management of anastomotic leakage after upper GI surgery: a report of two clinical cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Establishing structured peer support in mental health, particularly for people with schizophrenia, as a psychosocial intervention is early in low and middle-income countries like India. Before implementing and understanding the effectiveness of peer support service and which mode of peer support delivery will be suitable for our culture, our study aimed to understand if peer support would be accepted by the different participants like persons with schizophrenia, caregivers and mental health professionals in a tertiary care center in Chennai, India. METHODS: The study was conducted at the outpatient department (OPD) of a tertiary psychiatric care facility in Chennai, India. A cross-sectional study method was used. Consecutive persons diagnosed with schizophrenia and caregivers of persons with schizophrenia, who attended the outpatient department, and mental health professionals within and outside the facility who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria participated in the study. A structured questionnaire purposefully developed for the study was administered to the different study participants. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Categorical variables were expressed as frequency and percentages, while the continuous variables were expressed as mean and standard deviation. RESULTS: A total of 155 participants (52 persons with schizophrenia, 50 caregivers and 53 mental health professionals) completed the survey. The majority of the participants (90.4% of persons with schizophrenia, 86% caregivers and all mental health professionals) welcomed peer support interventions. The participants wanted peers to help persons with schizophrenia achieve personal goals to enhance their mental health and day to day living with an emphasis on independent living and interpersonal and social relationships and help them achieve medication and treatment-related goals toward recovery. Understanding the role of a peer support volunteer and transitioning from a person with schizophrenia to a peer support volunteer by persons with schizophrenia was thought most challenging. CONCLUSION: The results highlight the potential acceptability of peer support across several stakeholders in the care of schizophrenia in a low and middle-income country context. The results may guide the implementation of a peer support volunteer programme as an essential mechanism of delivering psychosocial interventions for persons with schizophrenia.","output":"Acceptability of Peer Support for People With Schizophrenia in Chennai, India: A Cross Sectional Study Amongst People With Lived Experience, Caregivers, and Mental Health Professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Astroviruses (AstVs) are RNA viruses infecting a large diversity of avian and mammalian species, including bats, livestock, and humans. We investigated AstV infection in a free-tailed bat species, Mormopterus francoismoutoui, endemic to Reunion Island.

Each sample was tested for the presence of the AstV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) gene using a pan-AstV semi-nested polymerase chain reaction assay. In total, 27 guano samples (7.1%) tested positive, with high genetic diversity of the partial RdRp gene sequences among positive samples. Phylogenetic analysis further revealed that the detected viruses were genetically related to AstVs reported in rats, reptiles, dogs, and pigs, but did not cluster with AstVs commonly found in bats. Although more investigations need to be conducted to assess the prevalence of infected bats in the studied population, our findings show that Reunion free-tailed bats are exposed to AstVs, and suggest that cross-species transmission may occur with other hosts sharing the same habitat.","output":"Astrovirus in Reunion Free-Tailed Bat (Mormopterus francoismoutoui)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cancer patients (pts) have higher risk of serious COVID-19 symptoms, morbidity and mortality than general population. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials excluded patients with metastatic cancer or undergoing immunosuppressive therapies;therefore, the effectiveness of vaccines are unknown in this population. Hence, there is an urgent need to understand the correlation between cancer type, its treatment and vaccine efficacy. Trial design: Methods: This is a prospective study conducted by the Oncology Unit of Cremona (Cr) Hospital, enrolling pts from Oncology, Hematology, Radiotherapy (RT) and Palliative Care divisions. The trial aims to evaluate effectiveness of mRNA vaccines [BNT162b2 (Pfizer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna)], incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 infection, antibodies (Abs) response and onset of adverse events (AEs) in a consecutive population of 300 cancer pts, undergoing antiblastic therapies, starting from March 2021. A vaccination point was set up by Cr Hospital, dedicated to cancer pts treated with chemotherapy (CT), TKIs, RT, hormones. Only pts in follow-up or treated with adjuvant hormone are excluded. CT was suspended at least 5 days before and 3 days after vaccination;targeted therapy, immunotherapy and RT are not interrupted. Primary endpoint: Number of symptomatic pts affected by COVID-19, diagnosed 7-60 days after the 2nddose of vaccines. The infection is defined according to the FDA criteria combined with a positive nasopharyngeal swab. Secondary endpoints: Abs variation at different timepoints compared to baseline;vaccine-related adverse events;duration of abs, up to 12 months after 2nd dose;correlation between effectiveness of vaccines and antiblastic treatments, tumor burden, PS ECOG.

At 5-year follow-up, 15% of IPF patients develop lung cancer, which significantly reduces the survival rate. Here we review the literature on the clinical role of oncomarkers in IPF progression, and describe the trend of routine oncomarkers in IPF patients over the longest follow-up yet reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic search of the literature in PubMed was performed to find relevant studies published up to 24 September 2020. The most common oncomarkers were chosen to select papers related to pulmonary fibrosis. Then, 24 IPF patients and 25 non-IPF patients, followed at Careggi ILD Referral Centre and Siena Regional Referral Centre for ILD, were enrolled consecutively. RESULTS A few studies reported an association between serum oncomarkers and severity of IPF. NSE, CEA, Ca19.9, and Ca125 were higher in the IPF, than in the non-IPF, group at every follow-up (p < 0.05). Ca15.3 concentrations were higher in the IPF, than the non-IPF, group at t3 (p = 0.0080) and t4 (p = 0.0168). To improve the specificity and sensitivity of Ca15.3, a panel of biomarkers was analyzed, with the IPF group as dependent variable, and chitotriosidase, Cyfra 21.1, Ca15.3, Ca125, and Ca19.9 as independent variables. CONCLUSIONS This study focused on the discovery of multiple biomarker signatures, such as combinations of oncomarkers, that are widely and routinely available in biochemistry laboratories. The combination of clinical parameters and biological markers could help achieve more accurate results regarding prognosis and response to treatment in IPF.

Periconceptional folic acid reduces the risk of NTDs by up to 70%; however, in Pakistan, no public information program exists concerning the risks of NTDs or promoting folic acid use. As such, the aim of this study was to assess levels of knowledge about NTDs and folic acid use among women attending the gynaecology department of DHQ Hospital, Faisalabad, Pakistan. Design: A cross-sectional survey. Setting: The gynaecology department of the District Head Quarter (DHQ) Hospital in Faisalabad, Pakistan. Participants: Three hundred and fifty-five married women. Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measures included knowledge of NTDs and knowledge of folic acid use. Results: About 85.4% of participants had no knowledge of neural tube defects and 76.7% reported no knowledge about folic acid use. The majority of participants (86.2%) were unaware that folic acid protects against NTDs. Lack of knowledge of NTDs was significantly associated with education (P = 0.001), husband's education (P = 0.002), planned pregnancy (P = 0.002), sources of antenatal care (P = 0.003), knowledge of folic acid (P = 003), knowledge that folic acid protects against NTDs (P = 0.002), and health decision-making (P = 0.003).

Dark nudges aim to change consumer behavior against their best interests. Sludge uses cognitive biases to make behavior change more difficult. We have identified dark nudges and sludge in alcohol industry corporate social responsibility (CSR) materials. These undermine the information on alcohol harms that they disseminate, and may normalize or encourage alcohol consumption. Policymakers and practitioners should be aware of how dark nudges and sludge are used by the alcohol industry to promote misinformation about alcohol harms to the public. CONTEXT: Nudges and other behavioral economic approaches exploit common cognitive biases (systematic errors in thought processes) in order to influence behavior and decision\\\\making. Nudges that encourage the consumption of harmful products (for example, by exploiting gamblers cognitive biases) have been termed dark nudges. The term sludge has also been used to describe strategies that utilize cognitive biases to make behavior change harder. This study aimed to identify whether dark nudges and sludge are used by alcohol industry (AI)Cfunded corporate social responsibility (CSR) organizations, and, if so, to determine how they align with existing nudge conceptual frameworks. This information would aid their identification and mitigation by policymakers, researchers, and civil society. METHODS: We systematically searched websites and materials of AI CSR organizations (e.g., IARD, Drinkaware, Drinkwise, duc'alcool); examples were coded by independent raters and categorized for further analysis. FINDINGS: Dark nudges appear to be used in AI communications about responsible drinking. The approaches include social norming (telling consumers that most people are drinking) and priming drinkers by offering verbal and pictorial cues to drink, while simultaneously appearing to warn about alcohol harms. Sludge, such as the use of particular fonts, colors, and design layouts, appears to use cognitive biases to make health\\\\related information about the harms of alcohol difficult to access, and enhances exposure to misinformation. Nudge\\\\type mechanisms also underlie AI mixed messages, in particular alternative causation arguments, which propose nonalcohol causes of alcohol harms. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol industry CSR bodies use dark nudges and sludge, which utilize consumers cognitive biases to promote mixed messages about alcohol harms and to undermine scientific evidence. Policymakers, practitioners, and the public need to be aware of how such techniques are used to nudge consumers toward industry misinformation.

However, it is not clear whether the effect of these genetic factors is independent of the risk due to more established non-genetic demographic and metabolic risk factors such as male sex, poor cardiometabolic health, and low socioeconomic status. We sought to identify interactions between genetic variants and non-genetic risk factors influencing COVID-19 severity via a genome-wide interaction study in the UK Biobank. Of 378,051 unrelated individuals of European ancestry, 2,402 were classified as having experienced severe COVID-19, defined as hospitalization or death due to COVID-19. Exposures included sex, cardiometabolic risk factors (obesity and type 2 diabetes [T2D], tested jointly), and multiple deprivation index. Multiplicative interaction was tested using a logistic regression model, conducting both an interaction test and a joint test of genetic main and interaction effects. Five independent variants reached genome-wide significance in the joint test, one of which also reached significance in the interaction test. One of these, rs2268616 in the PGF gene, showed stronger effects in males and in individuals with T2D.

Among other non-viral factors, host information is essential for the surveillance and control of virus spread. Flaviviruses (genus Flavivirus), akin to other viruses, are modulated by high mutation rates and selective forces to adapt their codon usage to that of their hosts. However, a major challenge is the identification of potential hosts for novel viruses. Usually, potential hosts of emerging zoonotic viruses are identified after several confirmed cases. This is inefficient for deterring future outbreaks. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm to identify the host range of a virus from its raw genome sequences. The proposed strategy relies on comparing codon usage frequencies across viruses and hosts, by means of a normalized Codon Adaptation Index (CAI). We have tested our algorithm on 94 flaviviruses and 16 potential hosts. This novel method is able to distinguish between arthropod and vertebrate hosts for several flaviviruses with high values of accuracy (virus group 91.9% and host type 86.1%) and specificity (virus group 94.9% and host type 79.6%), in comparison to empirical observations.

However, the efficient production of BGs from bacteria in a short period of time is challenging. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of producing BGs in the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis using various chemicals, and the potential application of BGs as a novel immunomodulatory agent. RESULTS: In this study, Bacillus subtilis ghosts (BSGs) were generated, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of hydrochloric acid (HCl; 6.25 mg/mL), sulfuric acid (H(2)SO(4); 3.125 mg/mL), and nitric acid (HNO(3); 6.25 mg/mL). Among the BSGs generated using these chemicals, HCl-induced BSGs were completely DNA-free as confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Scanning electron microscopy showed the formation of transmembrane lysis tunnel structures in HCl-induced BSGs. Murine macrophages exposed to the HCl-induced BSGs at a concentration of 1  10(5) CFU/mL showed a cell viability of 97.8%. Additionally, HCl-induced BSGs upregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and IL-6. Furthermore, we found differences in the protein expression profiles between intact live bacteria and BSGs using two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with peptide mass fingerprinting/matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry analysis. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the HCl-induced BSGs may be potentially safe and effective candidates for inactivated bacterial vaccines and/or immunostimulants.

Donation after cardiac death (DCD) livers are often used, and treatment of acute rejection (ACR) requires the use of immunosuppressive drugs that are associated with complications. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) are used in treatment following LT; however, they have limitations, including low colonization in the liver. An optimized BMMSC application method is required to suppress ACR. METHODS: BMMSCs were isolated and modified with the heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) gene. HO-1/BMMSCs were perfused into donor liver in vitro using a normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) system, followed by LT into rats. The severity of ACR was evaluated based on liver histopathology. Gene chip technology was used to detect differential gene expression, and flow cytometry to analyze changes in natural killer (NK) T cells. RESULTS: NMP induced BMMSCs to colonize the donor liver during in vitro preservation. The survival of HO-1/BMMSCs in liver grafts was significantly longer than that of unmodified BMMSCs. When the donor liver contained HO-1/BMMSCs, the local immunosuppressive effect was improved and prolonged, ACR was controlled, and survival time was significantly prolonged. The application of HO-1/BMMSCs reduced the number of NKT cells in liver grafts, increased the expression of NKT cell co-inhibitory receptors, and reduced NKT cell expression of interferon-. CONCLUSIONS: NK cell and CD8(+) T cell activation was inhibited by application of HO-1/BMMSCs, which reduced ACR of transplanted liver. This approach could be developed to enhance the success rate of LT.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the self-reported symptoms among adults (older than 18 years) who underwent COVID-19 testing at an ambulatory assessment center in Canada and at a hospital in Israel between March 16, 2020, and August 19, 2020. The primary outcome was the prevalence of self-reported chemosensory dysfunction (anosmia/hypomsia and dysgeusia/ageusia). Subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate the prevalence of chemosensory deficits among the outpatients. RESULTS: We identified a total of 350 COVID-19-positive patients (138 Canadians and 212 Israelis). The overall prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction was 47.1%. There was a higher proportion of chemosensory deficits among Canadians compared to Israelis (66.7% vs 34.4%, P < .01). A subgroup analysis for outpatients (never hospitalized) still identified a higher prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction among Canadians compared to Israelis (68.2% vs 36.1%, P < 0.01). A majority of patients recovered their sense of smell after 4 weeks of symptom onset. CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence of chemosensory deficit in COVID-19 was found to be similar to previously published reports, the prevalence can vary significantly across different geographical regions.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the association between child maltreatment and unemployment rate in the Republic of Korea. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Nationally representative data at the province level were used. METHODS: The monthly excess number of hotline calls related to child maltreatment during the COVID-19 pandemic was estimated for each province. Fixed effects regressions was used to examine the relationship between the excess number of hotline calls and unemployment rate. RESULTS: The average excess number of hotline calls was significantly negative in the early stage of the pandemic, but became significantly positive afterwards except for some months with averages not statistically different from zero. The regression results showed that an increase of male unemployment rate by 1% was significantly associated with an increase in the excess number of hotline calls by 0.150.17 per 10,000 children for most dependent variables for the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The statistical significance of female unemployment rate was mixed with the opposite sign of the coefficient to that of male unemployment. Overall unemployment rate was not significant.

BACKGROUND Previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding DES safety and efficacy in patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS Patient-level data from 18 prospective randomized trials were pooled. DES treatment outcomes in patients with versus without DM were analyzed in 2 propensity score-matched groups further stratified according to lesion complexity (American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association class A/B1 vs. B2/C). Remaining baseline differences were adjusted for by multivariate analysis. RESULTS DM was present in 3,467 of 18,441 patients (18.8%). DM was a predictor of 1-year repeat revascularization (target lesion revascularization: hazard ratio: 1.34; 95% confidence interval: 1.05 to 1.70; target vessel revascularization: hazard ratio: 1.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.15 to 1.72) and cardiac death or myocardial infarction (hazard ratio: 1.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.09 to 1.81). Rates of target lesion and target vessel revascularization were significantly higher in patients with versus those without DM with type B2/C lesions (8.0% vs. 4.5% and 10.6% vs. 5.9%, respectively, p < 0.0001 for both), but not in patients with only type A/B1 lesions (4.6% vs. 4.8%, p = 0.87, and 7.4% vs. 6.8%, p = 0.47, respectively), with a significant interaction between DM and lesion type observed for both endpoints (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively). No interaction was observed for death or myocardial infarction (p = 0.28). CONCLUSIONS In the DES era, patients with DM remain at increased risk for cardiac death or myocardial infarction. However, DM is a risk factor for repeat revascularization only in those patients with complex lesions; patients with DM and noncomplex lesions have similar rates of 1-year freedom from repeat revascularization as do patients without DM.","output":"Impact of coronary lesion complexity on drug-eluting stent outcomes in patients with and without diabetes mellitus: analysis from 18 pooled randomized trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air pollution is a major environmental problem and causes serious damage to human health Considering the COVID-19 pandemic scenario, the importance of monitoring and controlling pollution emissions becomes more relevant and fundamental for combating the disease Seeking to contribute with technological tools, this work presents a proposal for a system based on IoT using low sensors to monitor the most novice pollutants to health, according to the recommendations of the World Health Organization The proposal presents the development in the hardware layer of a device able to measure the concentrations of the following pollutants: Particulate Material (PM2 5 and PM10), Ozone, Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide and Ammonia by means of three sensors, respectively, PMSA003, MICS-6814 and MQ-131 The device is be equipped with the ESP-WROOM-32 microcontroller that has a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wireless interface that will allow data to be sent to a server in the cloud It is important to note that what differentiates from the proposal from others is the implementation of periodic notifications and the sending of alerts for cases in which a given pollutant has reached the maximum acceptable concentration ? 2020 IEEE","output":"An IoT-based Air Quality Monitoring Platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, no direct antiviral treatment is effective as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

Clusters were randomized to receive LPV/r PEP (400/100 mg) twice daily for 5 days or no PEP (surveillance). The primary outcome is the occurrence of COVID-19 within 21 days post-enrollment.Findings: Of 318 participants, 157 (49.4%) were women, median age was 39 (interquartile range, 28-50) years. A total of 209 (179 clusters) participants were randomized to LPV/r PEP and 109 (95 clusters) to surveillance. Baseline characteristics were similar, with the exception of baseline SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity, which was 3-fold more frequent in the LPV/r arm (34/209 [16.3%] vs 6/109 [5.5%], respectively). During 21-day follow-up, 48/318 (15.1%) participants developed COVID-19: 35/209 (16.7%) in the LPV/r group and 13/109 (11.9%) in the surveillance group (unadjusted hazard ratio 1.44;95% CI, 0.76 to 2.73). In the primary endpoint analysis adjusted for propensity score to receive LPV/r, the hazard ratio for developing COVID-19 in the LPV/r group vs surveillance was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.23 to 1.23, respectively;P =.14).Interpretation: LPV/r role as PEP for COVID-19 remains unanswered. In this trial, LPV/r over 5 days did not significantly reduce incidence of COVID-19 in exposed individuals.

The aim of this study is to summarize the evidence from the available systematic reviews on the efficacy and safety of CP in COVID-19 through an overview of the published systematic reviews (SRs). A systematic literature search was conducted up to August 2021 in Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane and Medrxiv databases to identify systematic reviews focusing on CP use in COVID-19. Two review authors independently evaluated reviews for inclusion, extracted data and assessed quality of evidence using AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess Reviews) and GRADE tools. The following outcomes were analyzed: mortality, viral clearance, clinical improvement, length of hospital stay, adverse reactions. In addition, where possible, subgroup analyses were performed according to study design (e.g., RCTs vs. non-RCTs), CP neutralizing antibody titer and timing of administration, and disease severity. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the checklist for systematic reviews AMSTAR-2 and the GRADE assessment. Overall, 29 SRs met the inclusion criteria based on 53 unique primary studies (17 RCT and 36 non-RCT). Limitations to the methodological quality of reviews most commonly related to absence of a protocol (11/29) and funding sources of primary studies (27/29). Of the 89 analyses on which GRADE judgements were made, effect estimates were judged to be of high/moderate certainty in four analyses, moderate in 38, low in 38, very low in nine. Despite the variability in the certainty of the evidence, mostly related to the risk of bias and inconsistency, the results of this umbrella review highlight a mortality reduction in CP over standard therapy when administered early and at high titer, without increased adverse reactions.","output":"Safety and Efficacy of Convalescent Plasma in COVID-19: An Overview of Systematic Reviews"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Early diagnosis of acute community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is important in patient triage and treatment decisions.

In a short span of time, this infection has led to a global pandemic and has become a significant threat to the existence of present human society. Currently, there are no treatments for this infection and the measures established across various countries such as social distancing, usage of mask to prevent entry of the virus into the respiratory tract, quarantine, and containment together have reduced the prevalence of this disease and mortality in highly susceptible individuals. Here, we examine the structure, replication cycle, phylogeny and genomic organization of this virus and discuss the role of spike (S) protein of the virus, an important structure that interacts with the host ACE2 receptor facilitating viral entry. Further, we explore the epidemiology, symptoms of the disease, describe the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that establishes the diagnosis of the disease and also review its unique diagnostic features in the chest CT-Scan. Finally, we review the current approaches to develop therapies and vaccines as a measure for disease prevention and control.","output":"Insights into the COVID-19 pandemic: Origin, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapeutic interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Islam, religious directives regarding death are derived from the Quran and Islamic tradition, but there is a variety of death rituals and practices, lived by Muslims across contexts and geographies.

Designing effective nudges for widespread adoption is important when federal mandates are politically or legally infeasible.

In the first video, the President simply recited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. In the second, the President additionally emphasized that wearing a mask is optional. In the third video, the President added that he will not personally wear a mask. We find that exposure to presidential messages can increase the stated likelihood of wearing a mask-particularly among the President's supporters. We also explore experiential effects of COVID-19, and find that people (especially supporters of the President) are more likely to support wearing a mask if they know someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.

Herein, we combined violacein, a naturally-occurring antimicrobial agent, with porous nanofiber membranes to develop a series of functional filters that autonomously sterilizes viruses and bacteria. The violacein-embedded membrane inactivates viruses within 4 hours (99.532 % reduction for influenza and 99.999 % for human coronavirus) and bacteria within 2 hours (75.5 % reduction). Besides, its nanofiber structure physically filters out the nanoscale (<0.8 m) and micron-scale (0.8 m - 3 m) particulates, providing high filtration efficiencies (99.7 % and 100 % for PM 1.0 and PM 10, respectively) with long-term stability (for 25 days).

However, there are no prophylactic or therapeutic drugs available on the market to treat COVID-19, although several drugs have been approved. Recently, two articles using the comparative viral-human proteinCprotein interaction map revealed that the sigma-1 receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells. Knockout and knockdown of SIGMAR1 (sigma-1 receptor, encoded by SIGMAR1) caused robust reductions in SARS-CoV-2 replication, which indicates that the sigma-1 receptor is a key therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Interestingly, a recent clinical trial demonstrated that treatment with the antidepressant fluvoxamine, which has a high affinity at the sigma-1 receptor, could prevent clinical deterioration in adult outpatients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we discuss the brief history of the sigma-1 receptor and its role in SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells.

The ZUMA-2 trial demonstrated that brexu-cel induces durable remissions in these pts with an ORR of 85% (59% CR), estimated 12-month PFS rate of 61%, and similar toxicity profile to other CAR T therapies (Wang et al, NEJM 2020). We conducted a multicenter, retrospective study of pts treated with commercial brexu-cel to evaluate its safety and efficacy in the non-trial setting. Methods: We reviewed records of pts with relapsed MCL across 12 US academic medical centers. Pts who underwent leukapheresis between July 2020 and June 2021 with the intent to proceed to commercial brexu-cel were included. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and univariate models were fit to identify predictors of post-CAR T outcomes. Results: Fifty-five pts underwent leukapheresis. There were 3 manufacturing failures. Baseline characteristics of the 52 pts who received brexu-cel are summarized in Table 1. Median age was 66 yrs (range: 47-79 yrs) and 82% were male. Twenty of 29 (69%) pts with known baseline MIPI were intermediate or high risk. Seven pts had a history of CNS involvement. The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range: 2-8), including prior autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in 21 (40%) and prior allogeneic transplant in 2 pts (1 with prior ASCT and 1 without). Fifty percent had relapsed within 24 months of their initial therapy. All pts had previously received a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), including 29 (56%) with disease progression on a BTKi. Forty (77%) pts received bridging therapy (17 BTKi, 10 BTKi + venetoclax, 6 chemo, 3 venetoclax, 2 XRT only, 1 steroids only, 1 lenalidomide + rituximab). The ORR was 88% (CR 69%) among patients who received brexu-cel. Two pts had PD on initial restaging and 3 died prior to first response assessment (without evidence of relapse). Seven pts have not completed restaging due to limited follow-up (< 3 months) and were not included in the response assessment. Five pts have progressed, including 2 with CR and 1 with PR on initial restaging. With a median follow-up of 4.2 months, the estimated 6-month PFS and OS rates were 82.7% and 89.0%, respectively. All 7 pts with prior CNS involvement were alive without relapse at last follow-up. The incidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was 84% (10% grade  3) with a median time to max grade of 5 days (range: 0-10 days). There were no cases of grade 5 CRS. The incidence of neurotoxicity (NT) was 57% (31% grade  3) with a median time to onset of 7 days (range: 4-15 days). NT occurred in 4/7 pts with prior CNS involvement (3 grade 3, 1 grade 4). Grade 5 NT occurred in 1 pt who developed cerebral edema and died 8 days after infusion. Thirty-five pts received tocilizumab, 33 received steroids, 7 received anakinra, and 1 received siltuximab for management of CRS and/or NT. Post-CAR T infections occurred in 8 pts, including two grade 5 infectious AEs (covid19 on day +80 and septic shock on day +40 after infusion). Rates of grade  3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were 38% and 37%, respectively. Among pts with at least 100 days of follow-up and lab data available, 5/34 (15%) had persistent grade  3 neutropenia and 4/34 (12%) had persistent grade  3 thrombocytopenia at day +100. Five pts have died, with causes of death being disease progression (2), septic shock (1), NT (1), and covid19 (1). Univariate analysis did not reveal any significant associations between survival and baseline/pre-CAR T MIPI, tumor pathologic or cytogenetic features, prior therapies, receipt of steroids/tocilizumab, or pre-CAR T tumor bulk. Conclusions: This analysis of relapsed MCL pts treated with commercial brexu-cel reveals nearly identical response and toxicity rates compared to those reported on ZUMA-2. Longer follow-up is require to confirm durability of response, but these results corroborate the efficacy of brexu-cel in a population of older adults with high-risk disease features. While all 7 pts with prior CNS involvement are alive and in remission, strategies to mitigate the risk of NT in this setting need to be evaluated. Further studies to define the optimal timing of CAR T, bridging strategies, and salvage therapies for post-CAR T relapse in MCL are warranted.

While a growing body of evidence has solidified the role of adipokinetic hormone (AKH) in modulating the physiological and behavioral responses to metabolic stress, little is known about the upstream endocrine circuit that directly regulates AKH release. We evaluated the AKH-producing cell (APC) transcriptome to identify potential regulatory elements controlling APC activity and found that a number of receptors showed consistent expression levels, including all known dopamine receptors and the pigment dispersing factor receptor (PDFR). We tested the consequences of targeted genetic knockdown and found that APC limited expression of RNAi elements corresponding to each dopamine receptor and caused a significant reduction in survival under starvation. In contrast, PDFR knockdown significantly extended lifespan under starvation, whereas expression of a tethered PDF in APCs resulted in significantly shorter lifespans. These manipulations caused various changes in locomotor activity under starvation. We used live-cell imaging to evaluate the acute effects of the ligands for these receptors on APC activation. Dopamine application led to a transient increase in intracellular calcium in a trehalose-dependent manner. Furthermore, coapplication of dopamine and ecdysone led to a complete loss of this response, suggesting that these two hormones act antagonistically. We also found that PDF application led to an increase in cAMP in APCs and that this response was dependent on expression of the PDFR in APCs. Together, these results suggest a complex circuit in which multiple hormones act on APCs to modulate metabolic state.","output":"Modulation of Metabolic Hormone Signaling via a Circadian Hormone and Biogenic Amine in Drosophila melanogaster"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we report the complete genome sequences of 11 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants from the Philippines.

The first dimension covers liability liquidity risk (or funding liquidity) modeling, the second dimension focuses on asset liquidity risk (or market liquidity) modeling, and the third dimension considers asset-liability liquidity risk management (or asset-liability matching). The purpose of this research is to propose a methodological and practical framework in order to perform liquidity stress testing programs, which comply with regulatory guidelines (ESMA, 2019) and are useful for fund managers. The review of the academic literature and professional research studies shows that there is a lack of standardized and analytical models. The aim of this research project is then to fill the gap with the goal to develop mathematical and statistical approaches, and provide appropriate answers. In this first part that focuses on liability liquidity risk modeling, we propose several statistical models for estimating redemption shocks. The historical approach must be complemented by an analytical approach based on zero-inflated models if we want to understand the true parameters that influence the redemption shocks. Moreover, we must also distinguish aggregate population models and individual-based models if we want to develop behavioral approaches. Once these different statistical models are calibrated, the second big issue is the risk measure to assess normal and stressed redemption shocks. Finally, the last issue is to develop a factor model that can translate stress scenarios on market risk factors into stress scenarios on fund liabilities.","output":"Liquidity Stress Testing in Asset Management -- Part 1.

This study investigated a large sample size of COVID-19 patients who performed CT scan. Materials and methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was done using the CT scan findings of all suspected, probable, and definite patients of COVID-19 attending Sari Shafa Hospital, Iran during March and April 2020. The Siemens Somatom Emotion 16-slice CT scanner was used. CT scan was performed by HRCT method only in axial sections without contrast material and with 2 mm thickness sections. Data, including demographic information and HRCT findings were collected from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS). Results: From 3132 patients, 1883 (60.1%) were found with no positive results. Among those with lung involvement, 1138 (36.4%) had highly suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 and 111 (3.5%) had inconsistent symptoms. Bilateral, peripheral, and diffuse lung involvement were seen in 79.9%, 53.3%, and 87.6%, respectively. Patchy morphology was detected in 64.9%. Ground-glass opacities were seen in 96.7% and pleural effusion was observed in 6.4%. The highest frequency involvement was in the lower right lobe (82%) and 697 patients with positive findings had less than 25% lung involvement. Conclusion: The present study showed ground-glass opacity as the most common finding of the CT scan in patients with COVID-19 and bilateral lung involvement that occurred mainly in lower lobes.

Methods: A total of 950 participants submitted an online self-administered questionnaire, which was developed through literature search and validated. The online survey link was distributed through various social media platforms (WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Snapchat, Pinterest, and Tumblr). And 861 forms were included in the study after checking for completion of relevant response from participants, whereas 89 forms were excluded. The data were analyzed through Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Descriptive statistics were performed for percentage and frequency determination of quantitative and qualitative variables. Spearman's correlation and Chi square test were performed to control confounders and association of knowledge, attitude, and practices with gender and education level. The P value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: More than two third of the population was aware of COVID-19 and three fourth had had bachelor's degrees, whereas 18% had master level education. 85% have not attended any courses, awareness campaigns, and lectures to inculcate recent and updated knowledge. 83% believed that COVID-19 is a serious threat to the community; hence, prevention strategies should be adopted. There was no significant relationship (p = 0.23) between knowledge, attitude, and practice levels with gender, whereas a significant relationship (p = 0.01) was noted with education of participant. Similarly, a significant relationship (p = 0.00) was seen between knowledge and practices of participants toward COVID-19. Conclusion: The studied population displayed adequate knowledge, attitude, and practice to combat COVID-19.

This study examines these mitigation methods and association with COVID-19 infection, respiratory infection, and school staff wellbeing between October to December 2020 in Wales, UK. MethodsA school staff survey captured self-reported COVID-19 mitigation measures in the school, participant anxiety and depression, and open-text responses regarding experiences of teaching and implementing measures. These survey responses were linked to national-scale COVID-19 test results data to examine association of measures in the school and the likelihood of a positive (staff or pupil) COVID-19 case in the school (clustered by school, adjusted for school size and free school meals using logistic regression). Linkage was conducted through the SAIL (Secure Anonymised Information Linkage) Databank. ResultsResponses were obtained from 353 participants from 59 primary schools within 15 of 22 local authorities. Having more direct non-household contacts was associated with a higher likelihood of COVID-19 positive case in the school (1-5 contacts compared to none, OR 2.89 (1.01, 8.31)) and a trend to more self-reported cold symptoms. Staff face covering was not associated with a lower odds of school COVID-19 cases (mask vs. no covering OR 2.82 (1.11, 7.14)) and was associated with higher self-reported cold symptoms. School staff reported the impacts of wearing face coverings on teaching, including having to stand closer to pupils and raise their voices to be heard. 67.1% were not able to implement 2-metre social distancing from pupils. We did not find evidence that maintaining a 2-metre distance was associated with lower rates of COVID-19 in the school. ConclusionsImplementing, adhering to and evaluating COVID-19 mitigation guidelines is challenging in primary school settings. Our findings suggest that reducing non-household direct contacts lowers infection rates. There was no evidence that face coverings, 2-metre social distancing or stopping children mixing was associated with lower odds of COVID-19 or cold infection rates in the school.

We compared the clinicopathological characteristics between recurrent and non-recurrent cases and examined their association with the material used for visceral pleural coverage: polyglycolic acid sheet versus oxidized regenerated cellulose mesh. RESULTS 57 patients underwent thoracoscopic bullectomy plus coverage using oxidized regenerated cellulose mesh and 55 underwent thoracoscopic bullectomy plus coverage using polyglycolic acid sheet. The recurrence rate among all patients was 13.3%. No severe postoperative complications were observed in either group. There were no significant differences in the perioperative outcomes. However, the postoperative recurrence rate was significantly higher in the oxidized regenerated cellulose mesh group than in the polyglycolic acid sheet group (22.8 vs 3.6%).

The WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern therefore several scientists are dedicated to the study of the new virus. Since human viruses have codon usage biases that match highly expressed proteins in the tissues they infect and depend on host cell machinery for replication and co-evolution, we selected the genes that are highly expressed in the tissue of human lungs to perform computational studies that permit to compare their molecular features with SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS genes. In our studies, we analysed 91 molecular features for 339 viral genes and 463 human genes that consisted of 677873 codon positions. Hereby, we found that A/T bias in viral genes could propitiate the viral infection favoured by a host dependant specialization using the host cell machinery of only some genes. The envelope protein E, the membrane glycoprotein M and ORF7 could have been further benefited by a high rate of A/T in the third codon position. Thereby, the mistranslation or de-regulation of protein synthesis could produce collateral effects, as a consequence of viral occupancy of the host translation machinery due tomolecular similarities with viral genes. Furthermore, we provided a list of candidate human genes whose molecular features match those of SARS-CoV-2, SARSand MERS genes, which should be considered to be incorporated into genetic population studies to evaluate thesusceptibility to respiratory viral infections caused by these viruses.

Targeting at China, this research aims to reveal, visualize and compare the geographical distribution patterns of different subtypes of urban and rural health workforce and identify the priority regions for health workforce planning and allocation policies designing. METHODS The health workforce density (workforce-to-population ratio) is adopted to represent the accessibility to health workforce in each geographical unit. Besides a descriptive geography of health workforce as a whole, the local indicators of spatial association (LISA) are used to explore the spatial clusters of different subtypes of health workforce, which are visualized by geographical tools. RESULTS Results reveal that regional disparities and spatial clusters exist in China's health workforce distribution, with different types of workforce exhibiting relatively different spatial distribution characteristics. Besides, huge urban-rural disparities are found in the distribution of health workforce in China. Unexpectedly but intriguingly, most of the high-high and high-low cluster area of urban health workforce are concentrated in the western China (Xinjiang, Xizang etc.), indicating the relative abundant stock of urban health workforce in these units, while the low-low and low-high cluster area of different types of urban health workforce are mainly distributed in middle China. Regarding the rural health workforce, there is an obvious and similar low-low and low-high clustering pattern in western provinces (Sichuan, Yunnan) for the licensed doctors, pharmacists, technologists, which play a critical role in health services delivery. CONCLUSIONS Different types of health workforce displayed distinct spatial distribution patterns, while the misdistribution of rural health workforce imposed more challenges to the Chinese health sector due to its poorer stock and more disadvantaged positions of backward regions (i.e., low-low and low-high cluster area). Subtype-specific and region-oriented health workforce planning and allocation policies are suggested to be made, aiming at the urban and rural health workforce respectively, by prioritizing the identified low-low and low-high cluster areas.","output":"Detecting the priority areas for health workforce allocation with LISA functions: an empirical analysis for China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is growing evidence to indicate that inflammatory reactions are involved in cancer progression.

Cardiopulmonary function and metabolic reaction were measured by the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). All tests were carried out in random sequence and should be completed in 1 week. Results: The CPETs with the mask-on condition were performed undesirably (p < 0.05), and the Borg scale was higher than the mask-off (p < 0.001). Rest oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]) and carbon dioxide production ([Formula: see text] CO(2)) with the mask-on condition were lower than mask-off (p < 0.01), which were more obvious at peak exercise ([Formula: see text] O(2)(peak): 1454.8  418.9 vs. 1628.6  447.2 ml/min, p < 0.001; [Formula: see text] CO(2)(peak): 1873.0  578.7 vs. 2169.9  627.8 ml/min, p = 0.005), and the anaerobic threshold (AT) brought forward (p < 0.001).

The virus further exploits the host cellular machinery to gain access into the cells; its spike protein is cleaved by a host cell surface transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) shortly after binding ACE2, followed by its proteolytic activation at a furin cleavage site. The virus primarily targets the epithelium of the respiratory tract, which is covered by a tightly regulated airway surface liquid (ASL) layer that serves as a primary defense mechanism against respiratory pathogens. The volume and viscosity of this fluid layer is regulated and maintained by a coordinated function of different transport pathways in the respiratory epithelium. We argue that SARS-CoV-2 may potentially alter evolutionary conserved second-messenger signaling cascades via activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) or by directly modulating G protein signaling. Such signaling may in turn adversely modulate transepithelial transport processes, especially those involving cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC), thereby shifting the delicate balance between anion secretion and sodium absorption, which controls homeostasis of this fluid layer. As a result, activation of the secretory pathways including CFTR-mediated Cl(?) transport may overwhelm the absorptive pathways, such as ENaC-dependent Na(+) uptake, and initiate a pathophysiological cascade leading to lung edema, one of the most serious and potentially deadly clinical manifestations of COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 may hijack GPCR signaling pathways to dysregulate lung ion and fluid transport"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The subtribe Hyptidinae contains approximately 400 accepted species distributed in 19 genera (Hyptis, Eriope, Condea, Cantinoa, Mesosphaerum, Cyanocephalus, Hypenia, Hyptidendron, Oocephalus, Medusantha, Gymneia, Marsypianthes, Leptohyptis, Martianthus, Asterohyptis, Eplingiella, Physominthe, Eriopidion and Rhaphiodon). This is the Lamiaceae clade with the largest number of species in Brazil and high rates of endemism. Some species have been used in different parts of the world mainly as insecticides/pest repellents, wound healing and pain-relief agents, as well as for the treatment of respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This review aims to discuss the current status concerning the taxonomy, ethnobotanical uses, phytochemistry and biological properties of species which compose the subtribe Hyptidinae. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The available information was collected from scientific databases (ScienceDirect, Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, ChemSpider, SciFinder ACS Publications, Wiley Online Library), as well as other literature sources (e.g. books, theses). RESULTS: The phytochemical investigations of plants of this subtribe have led to the identification of almost 300 chemical constituents of different classes such as diterpenes, triterpenes, lignans, &#945;-pyrones, flavonoids, phenolic acids and monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, as components of essential oils. Extracts, essential oils and isolated compounds showed a series of biological activities such as insecticide/repellent, antimicrobial and antinociceptive, justifying some of the popular uses of the plants. In addition, a very relevant fact is that several species produce podophyllotoxin and related lignans. CONCLUSION: Several species of Hyptidinae are used in folk medicine for treating many diseases but only a small fraction of the species has been explored and most of the traditional uses have not been validated by current investigations. In addition, the species of the subtribe appears to be very promising, as alternative sources of podophyllotoxin-like lignans which are the lead compounds for the semi-synthesis of teniposide and etoposide, important antineoplastic agents.

A great deal of research has examined who falls for misinformation and why, and what can be done to make people more discerning consumers of news. Comparatively little work, however, has considered misinformation producers, and how their strategies interact with the psychology of news consumers. Here we use game-theoretic models to study the strategic interaction between news publishers and news readers. We show that publishers who seek to spread misinformation can generate high engagement with falsehoods by using strategies that mix true and false stories over time, in such a way that they serve more false stories to more loyal readers. These coercive strategies cause false stories to receive higher reader engagement than true stories - even when readers strictly prefer truth over falsehood. In contrast, publishers who seek to promote engagement with accurate information will use strategies that generate more engagement with true stories than with false stories. We confirm these predictions empirically by examining 1,000 headlines from 20 mainstream and 20 fake news sites, comparing Facebook engagement data with 20,000 perceived accuracy ratings collected in a survey experiment. We show that engagement is negatively correlated with perceived accuracy among misinformation sites, but positively correlated with perceived accuracy among mainstream sites. We then use our model to analyze the conditions under which news sites seeking engagement will produce false stories. We show that if a publisher incorrectly assumes that readers prefer falsehoods, their resulting publication strategy can itself manufacture greater engagement with false news - leading to a self-reinforcing cycle of false news promotion.","output":"The coercive logic of fake news"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Whether liraglutide use improves cardiometabolic risk factors in different subsets of subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD) remains unclear.

Our findings presented as WMD and 95% CI showed a statistical significant decrease in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) [?0.36%; ?0.47; ?0.26, p < 0.001; I (2) = 0.0% (with 6 RCTs)], body mass index (BMI) [?0.61 kg/m(2); ?1.21; ?0.01, p = 0.047; I (2) = 72.2% (with five RCTs)], and waist circumference [?2.41 cm; ?3.47; ?1.36, p < 0.001; I (2) = 0.0% (with three RCTs)]. Through a set of subgroup analyses, we found a significant reduction in BMI in CAD patients with T2D [WMD = ?1.06; 95% CI, ?1.42, ?0.70, p < 0.001; I (2) = 0.0% (with three RCTs)] compared to CAD only patients [WMD = ?0.08; 95% CI, ?0.45, 0.29, p = 0.66; I (2) = 0.0% (with two RCTs)] in the liraglutide group compared with the placebo group. No significant changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and lipid profiles were observed. Conclusions: Among people with established CAD, liraglutide significantly improved HbA1c, BMI, and waist circumference values. The effect of liraglutide on BMI was more robust in individuals with T2D compared to those without.","output":"Effect of Liraglutide on Cardiometabolic Risk Profile in People with Coronary Artery Disease with or without Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Health and social care services in England are moving towards greater integration, yet little is known about how leadership of integrated care teams and systems can be supported and improved. This realist review explores what works about the leadership of integrated care teams and systems, for whom, in what circumstances and why. METHODS: A realist synthesis approach was undertaken in 2020 to explore English language literature on the leadership of integrated care teams and systems, complemented by ongoing stakeholder consultation. RESULTS: Evidence was identified for seven potentially important components of leadership in integrated care teams and systems: inspiring intent to work together; creating the conditions; balancing multiple perspectives; working with power; taking a wider view; a commitment to learning and development and clarifying complexity. DISCUSSION: Research into the leadership of integrated care teams and systems is limited, with ideas often reverting to existing framings of leadership, where teams and organisations are less complex. Research also often focuses on the importance of who the leader is rather than what they do.

Although the world has intensively focused on the epidemic center during this period of time, it is imperative to emphasize that more attention should also be paid to some impoverished areas in China since they are more vulnerable to disease outbreak due to their weak health service capacities. Therefore, this study took Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture as an example to analyze the COVID-19 epidemic in the impoverished area, evaluate the control effect and explore future control strategies. METHODS: In this study, we collected information including age, gender, nationality, occupation, and address of all COVID-19 cases reported from 25 January 2020 to 23 April 2020 in Liangshan Prefecture from the Nationwide Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System (NIDRIS), which were used under license and not publicly available. Additionally, we retrieved other information of cases through epidemiological investigation reports reviewing. Data were analyzed using the software Excel 2010 and SPSS 17.0. The geographic distribution of cases was mapped using ArcGIS10.2. RESULTS: By 23 April 2020, a total of 13 COVID-19 cases and two asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers were reported in Liangshan, in three family clusters. Among the cases, eight cases had a history of sojourning in Hubei Province (61.54%), of which six were related to Wuhan. Cases aged under 44 years accounted for 61.54%, with no child case. The delay of patients hospital visiting, and the low degree of cooperation in epidemiological investigation are problems. CONCLUSIONS: During the study period, Liangshan was well under control. This was mainly contributed to strict preventive strategies aimed at local culture, inter-sectoral coordination and highly degree of public cooperation. Besides, some possible environmentally and culturally preventive factors (e.g., rapid air flow and family concept) would affect disease prevention and control. In the next step, the health education about COVID-19 should be strengthened and carried out according to the special culture of ethnic minorities to enhance public awareness of timely medical treatment.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in impoverished area: Liangshan Yi autonomous prefecture as an example"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To control the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), COVID-19 vaccination has been quickly developed. However, the COVID-19 pandemic will not be controlled if the COVID-19 vaccination uptake willingness is low. Therefore, the study aim was to explore the COVID-19 vaccination uptake willingness among the outpatient population and healthcare workers in Taiwan during the worldwide pandemic period without community outbreaks. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among healthcare workers (HCWs; n = 500; mean age = 32.96 years) of National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH) and outpatients (n = 238; mean age = 34.43 years) arriving at NCKUH. We used an online survey conducted between September 24 and 21 November 2020, for healthcare workers, and between 27 October and 31 December 2020, for the outpatient sample. Information regarding willingness to receive vaccination, willingness to rapid test, fear of COVID-19, risk perception, and preventive behaviors was collected in both samples; information regarding willingness to care for patients was collected in healthcare workers. Willingness to receive vaccination was the main variable in the present study; willingness to rapid test, willingness to care for patients, fear of COVID-19, risk perception, and preventive behaviors were the secondary variables in the study. The factors associated with vaccination willingness were identified through logistic regression analysis. The participants' willingness to receive vaccination was low for both healthcare workers (23.4%) and the outpatient sample (30.7%). Similarly, their willingness to take rapid tests was low (23.6% for healthcare workers and 28.6% for outpatient sample). Risk perception (crude odds ratio (COR) = 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03, 1.63), willingness to take rapid test (COR = 9.24; 95% CI = 5.76, 14.83), and preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors (COR = 2.32; 95% CI = 1.52, 3.56) were significant factors explaining the healthcare workers' willingness to receive vaccination. Willingness to take a rapid test (COR = 8.91; 95% CI = 4.71, 16.87) and preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors (COR = 1.69; 95% CI = 1.09, 2.60) were significant factors explaining the outpatient sample's willingness to receive vaccination. Willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 among HCWs and outpatients is low due to the relatively safe status of COVID-19 infection in Taiwan. These findings can help policymakers advocate for the effectiveness of and provide transparent information on COVID-19 vaccination uptake in a country/region with a relatively safe COVID-19 outbreak status.","output":"Willingness of Taiwan's Healthcare Workers and Outpatients to Vaccinate against COVID-19 during a Period without Community Outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The instruction of high enrollment general and organic chemistry laboratories at a large public university always has curricular, administrative, and logistical challenges Herein, we describe how we met these challenges in the transition to remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic We discuss the reasoning behind our approach, the utilization of our existing web-based course content, the additions and alterations to our curriculum, replacement of experimental work with videos, the results of both student and TA surveys, and lessons learned for iterations of these courses in the near future","output":"Online in No Time: Design and Implementation of a Remote Learning First Quarter General Chemistry Laboratory and Second Quarter Organic Chemistry Laboratory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Human adenovirus type 55 is a re\\\\emerging human respiratory pathogen that is associated with several respiratory infections outbreaks in military and school populations.

However, reports have shown that the main populations of the transplanted MSCs are trapped in the liver, spleen, and lung upon administration, highlighting the importance of the development of cell-free therapies. Concerning rising evidence suggesting that the beneficial effects of MSC therapy are closely linked to MSC-released components, predominantly MSC-derived exosomes, the development of an MSC-based cell-free approach is of paramount importance. The exosomes are nano-sized (30100nm) lipid bilayer membrane vesicles, which are typically released by MSCs and are found in different body fluids. They include various bioactive molecules, such as messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNAs, proteins, and bioactive lipids, thus showing pronounced therapeutic competence for tissues recovery through the maintenance of their endogenous stem cells, the enhancement of regenerative phenotypic traits, inhibition of apoptosis concomitant with immune modulation, and stimulation of the angiogenesis. Conversely, the specific roles of MSC exosomes in the treatment of various tumors remain challenging. The development and clinical application of novel MSC-based cell-free strategies can be supported by better understanding their mechanisms, classifying the subpopulation of exosomes, enhancing the conditions of cell culture and isolation, and increasing the production of exosomes along with engineering exosomes to deliver drugs and therapeutic molecules to the target sites. In the current review, we deliver a brief overview of MSC-derived exosome biogenesis, composition, and isolation methods and discuss recent investigation regarding the therapeutic potential of MSC exosomes in regenerative medicine accompanied by their double-edged sword role in cancer.","output":"Mesenchymal stem/stromal cell-derived exosomes in regenerative medicine and cancer; overview of development, challenges, and opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Environmental education is crucial to tackling the pressing ecological and societal issues on our planet.

The aim of the game is to colonize habitats with different species and use ecological processes (e.g., predation, competition, and mutualism) and conservation measures (e.g., restoration and reintroduction) to face random environmental disturbances (e.g., climate warming, drought, pollution, and biological invasion). The version of the game presented in this paper was based on European species. The game includes 50 species (25 dragonflies and 25 damselflies).

Reported here is the first known P. vivax-associated death amongst these women. The initial patient presentation was of uncomplicated P. vivax (0.5% parasitaemia) in a term, multigravida woman who responded rapidly to oral artesunate and mefloquine treatment, clearing her blood stage parasites within 48 hours.

Three such anti-MCA antibodies are: (1) anti-Gal, also produced in Old-World monkeys and apes, binds to -gal epitopes synthesized in non-primate mammals, lemurs, and New-World monkeys; (2) anti-Neu5Gc binds to Neu5Gc (N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid) synthesized in apes, Old-World monkeys, and many non-primate mammals; and (3) anti-Forssman binds to Forssman-antigen synthesized in various mammals. Anti-viral protection by anti-MCA antibodies is feasible because carbohydrate chains of virus envelopes are synthesized by host glycosylation machinery and thus are similar to those of their mammalian hosts. Analysis of MCA glycosyltransferase genes suggests that anti-Gal appeared in ancestral Old-World primates following catastrophic selection processes in which parental populations synthesizing -gal epitopes were eliminated in enveloped virus epidemics. However, few mutated offspring in which the 1,3galactosyltransferase gene was accidentally inactivated produced natural anti-Gal that destroyed viruses presenting -gal epitopes, thereby preventing extinction of mutated offspring. Similarly, few mutated hominin offspring that ceased to synthesize Neu5Gc produced anti-Neu5Gc, which destroyed viruses presenting Neu5Gc synthesized in parental hominin populations. A present-day example for few humans having mutations that prevent synthesis of a common carbohydrate antigen (produced in >99.99% of humans) is blood-group Bombay individuals with mutations inactivating H-transferase; thus, they cannot synthesize blood-group O (H-antigen) but produce anti-H antibody.

However, as the COVID-19 distribution becomes global, including tropical climates, the evidence reveals that atmospheric conditions explain, at most, only a limited amount of the space-time dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.

Salivary sIgA from healthy volunteers was used as a control (N-sIgA). Expression of TLR4, MyD88, NF-&#954;B, TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and MCP-1 were detected in the mesangial area of IgAN patients by immunohistochemistry, the expression levels in patients with positive sIgA deposition were higher than that with negative sIgA deposition. Human renal mesangial cells (HRMCs) were cultured in vitro, flow cytometry showed that P-sIgA bound HRMCs significantly better than N-sIgA. HRMCs were cultured in the presence of sIgA (400 g/mL) for 24 h, compared with cells cultured with N-sIgA, HRMCs cultured in vitro with P-sIgA showed enhanced expression of TLR4, increased secretion of TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and MCP-1, and increased expression of MyD88/NF-&#954;B. TLR4 shRNA silencing and NF-&#954;B inhibition both reduced the ability of HRMCs to synthesize TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and MCP-1. Our results indicate that sIgA may induce high expression of TLR4 in HRMCs and further activate downstream signalling pathways, prompting HRMCs to secrete multiple cytokines and thereby mediating kidney damage in IgAN patients.","output":"The TLR4-MyD88-NF-B pathway is involved in sIgA-mediated IgA nephropathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a disease-causing coronavirus strain that emerged in December 2019 that led to an ongoing global pandemic. The ability to anticipate the pandemics path is critical. This is important in order to determine how to combat and track its spread. COVID-19 data is an example of time-series data where several methods can be applied for forecasting. Although various time-series forecasting models are available, it is difficult to draw broad theoretical conclusions regarding their relative merits. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of several time-series models for forecasting COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths in Saudi Arabia. In particular, seven forecasting models were trained using autoregressive integrated moving average, TBATS, exponential smoothing, cubic spline, simple exponential smoothing Holt, and HoltWinters. The models were built using publicly available daily data of COVID-19 during the period of 24 March 2020 to 5 April 2021 reported in Saudi Arabia. The experimental results indicate that the ARIMA model had a smaller prediction error in forecasting confirmed cases, which is consistent with results reported in the literature, while cubic spline showed better predictions for recoveries and deaths. As more data become available, a fluctuation in the forecasting-accuracy metrics was observed, possibly due to abrupt changes in the data.","output":"Empirical Evaluation of Alternative Time-Series Models for COVID-19 Forecasting in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Guillain-Barr Syndrome (GBS) is a rapidly progressive immune-mediated polyneuropathy often associated with an antecedent infectious illness or vaccination. The classic presentation of GBS is characterized by ascending limb weakness and numbness with loss of reflexes. However, atypical variants involving the face and arms or with purely sensory symptoms also exist. In up to 30 percent of cases, GBS progresses to respiratory failure, with patients requiring mechanical ventilation. CASE REPORT: We report a case of atypical GBS occurring after COVID-19 vaccination in an otherwise healthy 38-year-old male. The patient's clinical presentation was characterized by bilateral hand and foot paresthesias, dysarthria, bilateral facial weakness, and an absence of classic ascending limb weakness. Albuminocytological dissociation within the cerebrospinal fluid was suggestive of GBS. The patient received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy with modest improvement in his symptoms at the time of the patient's discharge from the hospital. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Patients with GBS are at risk for life threatening complications including respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. It is critical for Emergency physicians to be aware of the manifold presentations of GBS for early recognition and treatment. This may be of particular importance in the context of a worldwide vaccination campaign in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Guillain-Barr Syndrome presenting as facial diplegia after COVID-19 vaccination: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To investigate the association between parameters indicating immunity from BCG at country level (presence of BCG vaccination policy, BCG coverage, age-specific incidence of tuberculosis (TB)) and the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. METHODS: Country-specific data for COVID-19 cases and deaths, demographic details, BCG coverage and policy, age-specific TB incidence and income level were obtained. The crude COVID-19 cases and deaths per 100,000 population were calculated and assessed against the parameters indicating immunity from BCG using linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Univariate analysis identified higher income level of a country to be significantly associated with COVID-19 cases (p < 0.0001) and deaths (p < 0.0001) but not with its case fatality rate. The association between COVID-19 and TB was strongest for TB incidence in patients > 65-years (Cases (r(s) = ? 0.785,p = 0.0001)) and deaths (r(s) = ? 0.647,p = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified the higher income level of a country and not having a universal BCG vaccination policy to affect the COVID-19 cases. The deaths were inversely affected by the presence of BCG vaccination policy and coverage; and positively by the TB incidence in patients > 65-years.

After implementing universal screening for COVID-19 in women admitted for delivery, we sought to describe the characteristics of COVID-19 in this large cohort of women. STUDY DESIGN: An observational study of women admitted to labor and delivery units in Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) hospitals between April 6 and May 11, 2020 who were universally offered testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 3,963). Hospital inpatient and outpatient physician encounter, and laboratory records were used to ascertain universal testing levels, test results, and medical and obstetrical histories. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated from the number of women who tested positive during labor per 100 women delivered. RESULTS: Of women delivered during the study period, 3,923 (99.0%) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. A total of 17 (0.43%; 95% confidence interval: 0.23-0.63%) women tested positive, and none of them were symptomatic on admission. There was no difference in terms of characteristics between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative tested women. One woman developed a headache attributed to COVID-19 3 days postpartum. No neonates had a positive test at 24 hours of life. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that in pregnant women admitted for delivery between April 6 and May 11, 2020 in this large integrated health care system in Southern California, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 test positive was very low and all patients were asymptomatic on admission.

Rotavirus accounted for approximately 10% of the total episodes of diarrhea in the pediatric clinic and DCC populations, but 50% during the winter months. The occurrence of RV in the DCCs paralleled that seen in the pediatric clinic. The annual rate of RV infection in DCCs was 0.55 episodes per child-year, with diarrhea occurring in only 40% of the episodes (0.22 episodes per child-year). There were 45 diarrhea outbreaks in DCCs, for a mean of 3.8 per center per year; nine of these outbreaks were associated with RV. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of RNA genome patterns of RV strains from eight of these outbreaks showed that in seven outbreaks a single strain was identified in children in that DCC, whereas multiple strains were identified simultaneously in the community.

Methods: This was a qualitative study using semi-structured telephone interviews with rheumatology nurse specialists in England (Summer 2020). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using inductive thematic analysis.[1] Results: Sixteen nurses were recruited and interviews lasted between 30 to 60 minutes. Seven themes were identified. Early disease management Care was characterised by evidence-based RA management provided by experienced nurse specialists with a high degree of autonomy, in the context of a rheumatology multidisciplinary team. The aims of care were to: start treatment, keep in treatment, educate and support. 'So treat to target.escalating treatment as necessary, and addressing any concerns that the patients might have' (CNS14) Addressing psychosocial needs Patients with early RA experience shock, fear, anger, grief and denial while feeling unwell with pain and fatigue. Nurses use a holistic, person-centred and empathetic approach to address psychosocial needs, building a working relationship, listening and creating trust. 'Because it all relates, and if they're stressed because they're not coping at work, then their arthritis isn't going to be so good. So everything relates to one another really' (CNS06) Monitoring treatment, disease impact and patient outcomes Nurses monitor disease activity and disease impact using validated outcome measures and by asking questions during the consultation. Good outcomes are disease control, managing disease impact, medication and side effects, wellbeing and keeping in work. 'When you get them stable, when you get them into remission, when they're happy, when they're feeling well, I think there's lots of ways you can measure that'. (CNS13) Coordinating care, referring and signposting Nurses coordinate care, refer to other health professionals and signpost patients to relevant services and charities. Lack of access to psychology expertise was highlighted. 'And whilst most of us have got some degree of understanding of.self management, or psychology.we're not psychologists' (CNS02) Providing a 'lifeline' Nurse-led telephone advice services provide a 'lifeline' for patients. If patients struggle, they can call and speak with a specialist who knows them and their RA well. 'The advice line has been a lifeline to them, to be able to speak to someone, to be able to get a response quickly to their questions, they feel very well supported, they know that they can always call us' (CNS16) Service evaluation and auditing The individual clinics are reviewed regularly.

Abstract Within the context of the SARS-Cov-2 virus epidemic, the Ambulatory Care Unit of the Toulouse University Hospital Center, offering institutional psychotherapeutic care to people with severe and/or disabling psychiatric pathologies, closed its doors to patients on the 16th of March 2020. This article aims to document the necessary adjustments to the care setting during this extraordinary period. As it was, the team had to tell patients to stay at home and to respect rules of social distancing. An inescapable paradox when our work consists precisely in de-confining, connecting, being in contact with each other. Face-to-face meetings, group workshops, the array of our mediations were suspended; the challenge for us was to bring to light what is irreducible or essential in the institutional psychotherapeutic care for psychoses, what must remain active through the confinement. These modifications of the psychotherapeutic setting will be described in terms of constructing a virtual mental institution, based on a setting twisted by the distance but not abolished, telephone consultations opening up to a speculative but not disembodied psychopathological imaginary, and finally a blog as a quasi-materialization of a virtual space. This experience led the team of the Ambulatory Care Unit to radicalize the institution to keep it in its simplest apparatus: a virtual tree structure of the mental institution. The prior interactions between caregivers and patients have been translated (and thus re-created) virtually. As to respect their singular aspects, as well as their fundamental belonging to the collective that supports our institution. This virtual mental institution can therefore maintain the framework that structures our institutional care project, and can link the before and what will be the after of the confinement.

Outside the cell, NAD(+) or its metabolites are important signaling molecules, related especially to calcium homeostasis, which controls the functioning of the heart. The cleavage of NAD(+) or its precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), produces derivatives entering the cell to rebuild the intracellular NAD(+) pool, which is important for cells with high energy turnover. Abnormalities in NAD(+) and NMN metabolism can lead to cell aging and the development of cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we demonstrated that the extracellular metabolism of NAD(+) and NMN is vastly different in the vascular endothelium obtained from different species and locations. This may have implications for strategies to modulate the NAD(+) system and may cause difficulties for comparing the results of different reports. ABSTRACT: The disruption of the metabolism of extracellular NAD(+) and NMN may affect related signaling cascades and pathologies, such as cardiovascular or respiratory system diseases. We aimed to study NAD(+) and NMN hydrolysis on surface endothelial cells of diverse origins and with genetically modified nucleotide catabolism pathways. We tested lung endothelial cells isolated from C57BL/6 J wild-type (WT) and C57BL/6 J CD73 knockout (CD73 KO) mice, the transfected porcine iliac artery endothelial cell line (PIEC) with the human E5NT gene for CD73 (PIEC CD73), and a mock-transfected control (PIEC MOCK), as well as HMEC-1 and H5V cells. Substrate conversion into the product was followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We showed profound differences in extracellular NAD(+) and NMN metabolism related to the vessel origin, species diversity, and type of culture.

In the past few years, several early warning signals (EWS) from complex systems theory have been introduced to detect impending critical transitions and extend the set of indicators. However, it is still debated whether they are generically applicable or potentially sensitive to some dynamical characteristics such as system noise and rates of approach to critical parameter values. Moreover, testing on empirical data has, so far, been limited. Hence, verifying EWS performance remains a challenge. In this study, we tackle this question by analyzing the performance of common EWS, such as increasing variance and autocorrelation, in detecting the emergence of COVID-19 outbreaks in various countries. Our work illustrates that these EWS might be successful in detecting disease emergence when some basic assumptions are satisfied: a slow forcing through the transitions and not-fat-tailed noise. In uncertain cases, we observe that noise properties or commensurable time scales may obscure the expected early warning signals. Overall, our results suggest that EWS can be useful for active monitoring of epidemic dynamics, but that their performance is sensitive to certain features of the underlying dynamics. Our findings thus pave a connection between theoretical and empirical studies, constituting a further step towards the application of EWS indicators for informing public health policies.","output":"Performance of early warning signals for disease re-emergence: A case study on COVID-19 data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) has forced China to lockdown many cities and restrict transportation, industrial, and social activities. This provides a great opportunity to look at the impacts of pandemic quarantine on air quality and premature death due to exposure to air pollution. In this study, we applied the difference-in-differences (DID) model to quantify the casual impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on air quality at 278 cities across China. A widely used exposure-response function was further utilized to estimate the short-term health impacts associated with changes in PM(2.5) due to lockdown. Results show that lockdown has caused drastic reduction in air pollution level in terms of all criteria pollutants except ozone. On average, concentrations of PM(2.5), PM(10), NO(2), SO(2) and CO are estimated to drop by 14.3 g/m(3), 22.2 g/m(3), 17.7 g/m(3), 2.9 g/m(3), and 0.18 mg/m(3) as the result of lockdown. Cities with more confirmed cases of COVID-19 are related to stronger responses in air quality, despite that similar lockdown measures were implemented by the local governments. The improvement of air quality caused by COVID-19 lockdown in northern cities is found to be smaller than that of southern cities. Avoided premature death associated with PM(2.5) exposures over the 278 cities was estimated to be 50.8 thousand.

We analyzed the ease of integration of the Visby STI Panel into clinical practice, studied acceptance by patients and clinic personnel, and assessed the potential to inform accurate treatment decisions. METHODS In a cross-sectional single visit study of 55 women, aged 18-56 years, women self-collected vaginal swab samples which were analyzed using the Visby STI panel for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV). Results were compared to standard-of-care clinic results from send-out laboratory PCR tests. Surveys assessed patient and device operator experiences with the Visby STI panel and clinicians' perceived need for and acceptance of the device. Time parameters were measured to evaluate impact on clinical workflow, and syndromic treatment decisions were compared to anticipated treatment based on the Visby STI panel results. RESULTS Patients strongly agreed that sample self-collection was easy, and operators reported the device easy to use. Clinicians valued the rapid return of results, and patients were comfortable waiting up to 30-minutes to receive them. In 13 of 15 cases, the Visby STI Panel correctly identified undertreated patients as infected, and correctly identified all 33 incidences of overtreatment.

Design Single-center observational study. Setting and Participants: Patients admitted to geriatric care in a large hospital in Sweden, between March 1st C June 11th 2020; 250 were treated for COVID-19 and 717 for other diagnoses. Methods COVID-19 diagnosis was clinically confirmed by positive RT-PCR test or, if negative, by other methods. Patient data were extracted from electronic medical records, which included Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), and were further used for assessments of the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). In-hospital mortality and home discharge were followed up for up to 25 and 28 days, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression models adjusted for age and sex were used. Results Among the COVID-19 patients, in-hospital mortality rate was 24% and home discharge rate was 44%. Higher age was associated with in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR]=1.05 per each year, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.01-1.08) and lower probability of home discharge (HR=0.97, 95% CI=0.95-0.99). CFS (>5) and CCI, but not HFRS, were predictive of in-hospital mortality (HR=1.93, 95% CI=1.02-3.65 and HR=1.27, 95% CI=1.02-1.58, respectively). Patients with CFS>5 had a lower probability of being discharged home (HR=0.38, 95% CI=0.25-0.58). CCI and HFRS were not associated with home discharge. In general, effects were more pronounced in men. Acute kidney injury was associated with in-hospital mortality and hypertension with discharge to home. Other comorbidities (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, lung diseases, chronic kidney disease and dementia) were not associated with either outcome.

This review summarizes recent literature on fomite contamination and microbial survival in the built environment, transmission between fomites and humans, and implications for human health. RECENT FINDINGS: Applications of molecular sequencing techniques to analyze microbial samples have increased our understanding of the microbial diversity that exists in the built environment. This growing body of research has established that microbial communities on surfaces include substantial diversity, with considerable dynamics. While many microbial taxa likely die or lay dormant, some organisms survive, including those that are potentially beneficial, benign, or pathogenic. Surface characteristics also influence microbial survival and rates of transfer to and from humans. Recent research has combined experimental data, mechanistic modeling, and epidemiological approaches to shed light on the likely contributors to microbial exchange between fomites and humans and their contributions to adverse (and even potentially beneficial) human health outcomes. SUMMARY: In addition to concerns for fomite transmission of potential pathogens, new analytical tools have uncovered other microbial matters that can be transmitted indirectly via fomites, including entire microbial communities and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Mathematical models and epidemiological approaches can provide insight on human health implications. However, both are subject to limitations associated with study design, and there is a need to better understand appropriate input model parameters. Fomites remain an important mechanism of transmission of many microbes, along with direct contact and short- and long-range aerosols.","output":"Microbial Exchange via Fomites and Implications for Human Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study is conducted to explore the association between health behaviors and the COVID-19 vaccination based on the risk compensation concept among health-care workers in Taizhou, China.

A total of 592 out of 660 subjects (89.7%) responded to the questionnaire after receiving an e-poster on WeChat. Subjects who had been inoculated with the COVID-19 vaccine were asked to mention the differences in their health behaviors before and after the vaccination.

Women are more likely to manifest abnormal bleeding symptoms due to physiologic events and menorrhagia is the most common presenting symptom. Methods: this case-control study included 168 women aged between 18 and 45. The cases had menorrhagia whilst the controls did not. Blood grouping, activated partial thromboplastin time and von Willebrand factor activity tests were performed on samples collected from consenting study participants. Results: the mean age was 29.96  7.37. Mean vWF activity of cases was 66.6% and of controls 97.8%. The mean activated Partial ThromboplastinTime (aPTT) of cases was 31.09s and of controls was 30.40s. There was no difference in the vWF activity between blood group O (86.3%) and non-blood group O (88.0%) participants. Eight women were diagnosed with von Willebrand disease, 6 cases and 2 controls. Higher odds of von Willebrand disease were seen in the cases (OR = 6.6). Epistaxis, von Willebrand and factor activity levels and family history of menorrhagia were associated with an increased risk for menorrhagia. Conclusion: von Willebrand factor activity levels were associated with menorrhagia while activated partial thromboplastin time was not. vWF activity levels did not depend on any specific blood group. The prevalence of von Willebrand disease was significantly higher in participants with menorrhagia and repeated epistaxis and family history of menorrhagia pointed to a higher risk of menorrhagia.","output":"von Willebrand factor activity and activated partial thromboplastin time as proxy biomarkers for coagulopathies in women with menorrhagia in Zambia: a case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into stark relief the gaps in global preparedness to address widespread outbreaks of deadly viral infections.

Cellular, humoral and cytokine responses were analysed and correlated with clinical data. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies were detected using ELISA and multiplex assay in both the respiratory tract and blood of COVID-19 patients, although a higher receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific IgM and IgG seroconversion level was found in respiratory specimens. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity in respiratory samples was detected only when high levels of RBD-specific antibodies were present. Strikingly, cytokine/chemokine levels and profiles greatly differed between respiratory samples and plasma, indicating that inflammation needs to be assessed in respiratory specimens for the accurate assessment of SARS-CoV-2 immunopathology. Diverse immune cell subsets were detected in respiratory samples, albeit dominated by neutrophils.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the surgical complications before COVID -19 (Pre-COVID) and after COVID -19 (post-COVID) appearance using the Clavien-Dindo classification (CDC). Methodsbetween January 1, 2019, to November 3, 2021, we performed a comprehensive search in PubMed/Medline and Scopus for studies reporting the postoperative complications based on/transformable to CDC. ResultFrom 909 screened articles, 34 studies were included for systematic review. Among included articles, 11 were eligible for meta-analysis. Nineteen thousand one hundred thirty-seven patients (pre-COVID: 3522, post-COVID: 15615) were included, mostly undergoing elective surgeries (86.32%). According to CDC classification, there were no significant change between pre-COVID and post-COVID for grade 1 (Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95-CI): 0.99, 0.60-1.63, p=0.96), grade 2 (OR and 95-CI: 0.65, 0.42-1.01, p = 0.055), grade 3 (OR and 95-CI: 0.86, 0.48-1.57, p=0.64), grade 4 (OR and 95-CI: 0.85, 0.46-1.57, p =0.60). However, the postoperative mortality was lower before the COVID -19 outbreak (OR and 95-CI: 0.51, 0.27-0.95, p= 0.035). The included studies for systematic review and meta-analysis had a low risk of bias and unsignificant publication bias. ConclusionAlthough delivering routine surgery was challenging, the postoperative complications during the pandemic remained identical to the pre-pandemic era. The stricter patient selection tending to choose more critical states and more advanced clinical stages of the operated patients may explain some extent of higher mortality during the pandemic. Adopting preventive strategies helped deliver surgeries during the outbreak of COVID -19 while limiting the capacity of operations and admissions.","output":"The comparison of Post-Operative Complications pre Covid era versus during Covid-Era based on Clavien-Dindo-classification: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work we introduce a model based on master equations to describe the time evolution of the popularity of topics and hashtags on the Twitter social network.

However, the factors that influence the concentration of respiratory droplets and aerosols that potentially contribute to hospital- and nursing care-associated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are not well understood. To assess the effect of health care professional (HCP) and patient activity on size and concentration of airborne particles, an optical particle counter was placed (for 24 h) in the head position of an empty bed in the hospital room of a patient admitted from the nursing home with confirmed COVID-19. The type and duration of the activity, as well as the number of HCPs providing patient care, were recorded. Concentration changes associated with specific activities were determined, and airway deposition modeling was performed using these data. Thirty-one activities were recorded, and six representative ones were selected for deposition modeling, including patients activities (coughing, movements, etc.), diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (e.g., diagnostic tests and drug administration), as well as nursing patient care (e.g., bedding and hygiene). The increase in particle concentration of all sizes was sensitive to the type of activity. Increases in supermicron particle concentration were associated with the number of HCPs (r = 0.66; p < 0.05) and the duration of activity (r = 0.82; p < 0.05), while submicron particles increased with all activities, mainly during the daytime. Based on simulations, the number of particles deposited in unit time was the highest in the acinar region, while deposition density rate (number/cm(2)/min) was the highest in the upper airways. In conclusion, even short periods of HCP-patient interaction and minimal patient activity in a hospital room or nursing home bedroom may significantly increase the concentration of submicron particles mainly depositing in the acinar regions, while mainly nursing activities increase the concentration of supermicron particles depositing in larger airways of the adjacent bed patient. Our data emphasize the need for effective interventions to limit hospital- and nursing care-associated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens (including viral pathogens, such as rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and adenoviruses, and bacterial and fungal pathogens).","output":"Modeling of nursing care-associated airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a real-world hospital setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Households are increasingly stockpiling and producing hand sanitizer amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which can pose an increased risk for unintentional toxicity among children.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate hand sanitizer formulations and safety precautions discussed in popular do-it-yourself (DIY) YouTube videos, and to assess the frequency of calls to poison control centers for pediatric hand sanitizer exposure before and after the arrival of COVID-19 in the United States. METHODS: The first 100 videos on YouTube with the most views using the search term DIY hand sanitizer were evaluated for accuracy compared with the World Health Organization local hand sanitizer production guidelines. The incidence of pediatric hand sanitizer exposure reported to participating U.S. poison control centers from January 2018 through May 2020 was reviewed from the American Association of Poison Control Centers National Poison Data System. The average number of calls between January 2020 and May 2020 was compared, and the average number of calls in March 2020 was compared with March 2019 and March 2018. RESULTS: Of the YouTube videos that met inclusion criteria, 27% discussed the use of at least 96% ethanol or 99.8% isopropyl alcohol, 4.1% incorporated 3% hydrogen peroxide, 82% used glycerol or an alternative humectant, and 4.1% specified the need for distilled or previously boiled water. Most of the videos failed to describe labeling storage containers, 69% of videos encouraged the use of oils or perfumes to enhance hand sanitizer scent, and 2% of videos promoted the use of coloring agents to be more attractive for use among children specifically. There was a significantly increased average number of daily calls to poison control centers regarding unsafe pediatric hand sanitizer exposure since the first confirmed COVID-19 patient in the United States. There was a significantly increased average number of daily calls in March 2020 compared with the previous 2 years.

We show that expression of nsp1 significantly inhibited IFN-dependent signaling by decreasing the phosphorylation levels of STAT1 while having little effect on those of STAT2, JAK1, and TYK2. We engineered an attenuated mutant of nsp1 in SARS-CoV through reverse genetics, and the resulting mutant virus was viable and replicated as efficiently as wild-type virus in cells with a defective IFN response.

METHODS: We studied 48 patients with MP (26 atopic, 22 non-atopic), between 3 and 12 years of age. Serial changes in blood eosinophil counts, serum interleukin-5 (IL-5), and serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels were measured in atopic and non-atopic children with MP upon admission, recovery, and at 2 months post-recovery. Serum IL-5 and ECP levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; eosinophil counts were measured using an autoanalyzer. RESULTS: Serial changes in serum IL-5, ECP, and total eosinophil counts were significantly higher in atopic patients, relative to non-atopic controls (P0.001). Serum IL-5 and ECP levels were significantly higher in atopic patients at all three time points tested, while eosinophil counts were higher in the clinical recovery and follow-up phases, but not in the acute phase.

Emerging VOCs have sparked the need for a diagnostic method capable of simultaneously monitoring these SNVs. To date, no highly sensitive, efficient clinical tool exists to monitor SNVs simultaneously. Here, an encodable multiplex microsphere-phase amplification (MMPA) sensing platform that combines primer-coded microsphere technology with dual fluorescence decoding strategy to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA and simultaneously identify 10 key SNVs in the RBD. MMPA limits the amplification refractory mutation system PCR (ARMS-PCR) reaction for specific target sequence to the surface of a microsphere with specific fluorescence coding. This effectively solves the problem of non-specific amplification among primers and probes in multiplex PCR. For signal detection, specific fluorescence codes inside microspheres are used to determine the corresponding relationship between the microspheres and the SNV sites, while the report probes hybridized with PCR products are used to detect the microsphere amplification intensity. The MMPA platform offers a lower SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection limit of 28 copies/reaction, the ability to detect a respiratory pathogen panel without cross-reactivity, and a SNV analysis accuracy level comparable to that of sequencing. Moreover, this super-multiple parallel SNVs detection method enables a timely updating of the panel of detected SNVs that accompanies changing VOCs, and presents a clinical availability that traditional sequencing methods do not.

This study was designed to determine the effects of pandemic movement restriction policies on the 24-hour movement behavior (24-HMB) of children, and whether any alterations are reflected in worsening physical fitness outcomes determined via direct testing. Methods: A two-phase, repeated-measures study with matched controls was conducted. Phase One: N = 62 schoolchildren (N = 31 female) completed self-assessment questionnaires on 24-HMB in October 2018 (pre-pandemic) and again in April 2020, at the height of movement restrictions enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic first wave. Phase Two: physical fitness of the original N = 62 children were determined directly pre- and post-isolation using an eight-component standardized fitness test battery and compared to N = 62 control children who were matched for age, sex, school region, and fitness centile scores. Results: During lockdown (total duration: 63 days), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) decreased by ~46 min per day, screen time demonstrated a significant interaction effect, such that kids reported spending less recreational screen time on weekends during lockdown compared to no restriction, and sleep duration was consistently lower (95% CI: ?104.1 to ?45.5 min, p < 0.001). No interaction effect was present for direct fitness indicators, including: hand tapping (reaction time), standing broad jump, polygon backward obstacle course (coordination), sit-ups, stand-and-reach, bent-arm hang, 60-m, and 600-m run (p  0.05) although significant main effects are noted for both sexes. Conclusion: Initial changes in 24-HMB did not translate to reductions in physical fitness per se, likely due to the high initial fitness levels of the children. Further work is needed to confirm whether longer or repeated movement restrictions exacerbate initial negative 24-HMB trends, especially for children who are less fit when restrictions are initiated, prolonged, or repeated.","output":"The Effect of Pandemic Movement Restriction Policies on Children's Physical Fitness, Activity, Screen Time, and Sleep"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is an accumulating volume of research into neurological manifestations of COVID-19.

Methods: Tests were carried out using ELISA (total antibodies) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIFA) (IgM & IgG) methods on serial sera from patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Cross-reactivity was seen in these two test assays with sera from COVID-19 patients and was detected in 6 out of 7 patients from 7 days after onset of symptoms. Five of the patients had detectable antibodies by the 3rd week into their illness and there was evidence of seroconversion in 4 patients.

Whilst extensive investigation on potential predictors has been carried out, there is little evidence regarding POPF healing time. METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of all consecutive DPs performed at the Department of General and Pancreatic Surgery, University of Verona Hospital Trust, from 2015 to 2019. Perioperative variables were analyzed identifying possible predictors of POPF healing time defined as days between surgery and last drain removal due to POPF. RESULTS A total of 496 patients were included. POPF rate was 28.2% and median POPF healing time was 30 days (CI95% 28 - 31). Independent predictors of POPF were BMI (OR 1.073, CI95% 1.010-1.147, p= 0.040), operative time (OR CI95% 1.002 - 1.009, p= 0.003) and post-operative acute pancreatitis (OR 3.793, CI95%,1.852 - 7.767, p< 0.001). Independent predictors of POPF healing time were female sex (HR 1.323, CI95% 1.093 - 1.998, p= 0.042), preoperative pancreatic enzymes replacement therapy (HR 2.319, CI95% 1.195 - 4.498, p= 0.013), ASA score 3 (HR 0.278, CI95% 0.119 - 0.646, p= 0.003), pancreatic transection with ultrasonic dissector (HR 0.605, CI95% 0.404 - 0.907, p= 0.015) and positive drain cultures (HR 0.635, CI95% 0.443 - 0.910, p= 0.013).

It is shown that based on regression analysis of combined data from a recent cross-sectional study for endemic viral infections and network analysis of animal movements, a positive serological result for bovine coronavirus (BCV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is significantly associated with the purchase of animals. For BCV, this association was significant also when accounting for herd size and regional cattle density, but not for BRSV. Examples are given for different approaches to include cattle movement data in risk-based surveillance by selecting herds based on network analysis measures. Results show that compared to completely random sampling these approaches increase the number of detected positives, both for BCV and BRSV in our study population.

Objective: To evaluate the association of underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective single-center case series analyzed patients with COVID-19 at the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City, China, from January 23, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Analysis began February 25, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic data, laboratory findings, comorbidities, and treatments were collected and analyzed in patients with and without elevation of troponin T (TnT) levels. Results: Among 187 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 144 patients (77%) were discharged and 43 patients (23%) died. The mean (SD) age was 58.50 (14.66) years. Overall, 66 (35.3%) had underlying CVD including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, and 52 (27.8%) exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated TnT levels. The mortality during hospitalization was 7.62% (8 of 105) for patients without underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 13.33% (4 of 30) for those with underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 37.50% (6 of 16) for those without underlying CVD but elevated TnT levels, and 69.44% (25 of 36) for those with underlying CVD and elevated TnTs. Patients with underlying CVD were more likely to exhibit elevation of TnT levels compared with the patients without CVD (36 [54.5%] vs 16 [13.2%]). Plasma TnT levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (? = 0.530, P < .001) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels (? = 0.613, P < .001). Plasma TnT and NT-proBNP levels during hospitalization (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.307 [0.094-0.600]; 1902.00 [728.35-8100.00]) and impending death (median [IQR], 0.141 [0.058-0.860]; 5375 [1179.50-25695.25]) increased significantly compared with admission values (median [IQR], 0.0355 [0.015-0.102]; 796.90 [401.93-1742.25]) in patients who died (P = .001; P < .001), while no significant dynamic changes of TnT (median [IQR], 0.010 [0.007-0.019]; 0.013 [0.007-0.022]; 0.011 [0.007-0.016]) and NT-proBNP (median [IQR], 352.20 [174.70-636.70]; 433.80 [155.80-1272.60]; 145.40 [63.4-526.50]) was observed in survivors (P = .96; P = .16). During hospitalization, patients with elevated TnT levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias, and the use of glucocorticoid therapy (37 [71.2%] vs 69 [51.1%]) and mechanical ventilation (31 [59.6%] vs 14 [10.4%]) were higher compared with patients with normal TnT levels. The mortality rates of patients with and without use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers was 36.8% (7 of 19) and 21.4% (36 of 168) (P = .13). Conclusions and Relevance: Myocardial injury is significantly associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury is relatively favorable. Myocardial injury is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. Inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury. Aggressive treatment may be considered for patients at high risk of myocardial injury.","output":"Cardiovascular Implications of Fatal Outcomes of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been detected in domestic and wild cats.

AIMS: The present study aimed to design and synthesize a chimeric VLP vaccine of the phage Qbeta (Q?) coat protein presenting the universal epitope of the coronavirus. METHODS: The RNA phage Q? coat protein was designed and synthesized, denoted as Qbeta. The CoV epitope, a universal epitope of coronavirus, was inserted into the C-terminal of Qbeta using genetic recombination, which was designated as Qbeta-CoV. The N-terminal of Qbeta-CoV was successively inserted into the TEV restriction site using mCherry red fluorescent label and modified affinity-purified histidine label 6xHE, which was denoted as HE-Qbeta-CoV. Isopropyl ?-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) assessment revealed the expression of Qbeta, Qbeta-CoV, and HE-Qbeta-CoV in the BL21 (DE3) cells. The fusion protein was purified by salting out using ammonium sulfate and affinity chromatography. The morphology of particles was observed using electron microscopy. The female BALB/C mice were immunized intraperitoneally with the Qbeta-CoV and HE-Qbeta-CoV chimeric VLPs vaccines. Their sera were collected for the detection of antibody level and antibody titer using ELISA. The serum is used for the neutralization test of the three viruses of MHV, PEDV, and PDCoV. RESULTS: The results revealed that the fusion proteins Qbeta, Qbeta-CoV, and HE-Qbeta-CoV could all obtain successful expression.

However, the pathogenesis of myocardial injury in COVID-19 remains unclear, and cardiac involvement by SARS-CoV-2 presents a major challenge worldwide. OBJECTIVE: This histological and immunohistochemical study sought to clarify the pathogenesis and propose a mechanism with pathways involved in COVID-19 myocardial injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: Postmortem minimally invasive autopsies were performed in six patients who died from COVID-19, and the myocardium samples were compared to a control group (n=11). Histological analysis was performed using hematoxylin-eosin and toluidine blue staining. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed using monoclonal antibodies against targets: caspase-1, caspase-9, gasdermin-d, ICAM-1, IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, CD163, TNF-, TGF-, MMP-9, type 1 and type 3 collagen. The samples were also assessed for apoptotic cells by TUNEL. Histological analysis showed severe pericardiocyte interstitial edema and higher mast cells counts per high-power field in all COVID-19 myocardium samples. The IHC analysis showed increased expression of caspase-1, ICAM-1, IL-1, IL-6, MMP-9, TNF-, and other markers in the hearts of COVID-19 patients. Expression of caspase-9 did not differ from the controls, while gasdermin-d expression was less. The TUNEL assay was positive in all the COVID-19 samples supporting endothelial apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of COVID-19 myocardial injury does not seem to relate to primary myocardiocyte involvement but to local inflammation with associated interstitial edema. We found heightened TGF- and interstitial collagen expression in COVID-affected hearts, a potential harbinger of chronic myocardial fibrosis.

Influenza vaccine uptake has remained low in most countries, including Switzerland. The aim of the study was to determine parents' intentions towards influenza vaccination of their children as well as themselves, and to assess regional differences. METHODS: Parents presenting to four pediatric emergency departments (PEDs;Zurich, Bern, Bellinzona, Geneva) were asked to complete an online survey during and after the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic (April - June 2020). The anonymized survey included demographic information, vaccination history and intentions to vaccinate against influenza, as well as attitudes towards future vaccination against COVID-19. RESULTS: The majority of children (92%;602/654) were up-to-date on their vaccination schedule. In 2019/2020, 7.2% (47/654) were vaccinated against influenza. Children with chronic illnesses were more frequently vaccinated compared to healthy children (19.2% vs 5.6%;p = 0.002). For the coming winter season, 111 (17%) parents stated they plan to vaccinate their children against influenza, more than double the rate from last year, and 383 (59.2%) parents suggest they will vaccinate against COVID-19 once a vaccine is available.

With the help of Big Data visualization and analysis, various factors contributing to airline delays in the United States are investigated to make suggestions for airline companies. First, this paper pre-processes the dataset by restricting the time period to rule out the influence of Covid-19 on the irregularity of airline schedules. To obtain the most accurate results, we expurgate missing data. Then, this paper visualizes the correlations between various factors, including months, airline carriers, departure times, weather conditions, and airline delay rate. Each factor is assigned as strong, weak, or no correlation with airline delay. Next, this paper evaluates the results by comparing findings from other research or reports, which support the result from the study. Finally, the optimal situation is analyzed for a flight to depart on time, and suggestions are provided for airline companies to reduce their delay rate. Our analysis shows that the correlation between airline carriers, departure times, and airline delay is strong. There is a weak correlation between weather conditions and airline delays.

Most previously introduced models have approximated media effect through disease incidence, making media influence dependent on the size of epidemic.

We introduce a network-based model, in which disease is transmitted through local interactions between individuals and the probability of transmission is affected by media coverage. We assume that media attention increases self-protection (e.g. hand washing and compliance with social distancing), which, in turn, decreases disease model. We apply the model to the case of H1N1 transmission in Mexico City in 2009 and show how media influencemeasured by the time series of the weekly count of news articles published on the outbreakhelps to explain the observed transmission dynamics. We show that incorporating the media attention based on the observed media coverage of the outbreak better estimates the disease dynamics from what would be predicted by using media function that approximate the media impact using the number of cases and rate of spread.

In addition, the S- and RBD-specific IgG levels are 2-fold higher in the recovered patients who are SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative than those who are RNA positive.

Live attenuated vaccines are traditionally generated by serial passage of a virulent strain in embryonated chicken eggs; however, the molecular mechanism of attenuation is unknown. M41-CK, a virulent lab-adapted strain of IBV, was egg passaged over 100 times in four parallel independent replicates. All four final egg-passaged viruses were attenuated in vivo and exhibited similar growth phenotypes in adult chicken kidney cells and ex vivo tracheal organ cultures. The virus populations were sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing at the end of passaging, and the results showed that overall sequence diversity in the IBV population increased but the four replicates only had between 11 and 17 consensus-level single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Although hot spots of variation were identified in spike and nucleocapsid structural proteins as well as the 3? untranslated region, each attenuated virus possessed a different pattern of genomic variation. Overall, only a small number of consensus-level SNPs were acquired during egg passage, leaving a potentially short route back to virulence. These results highlight the unpredictable nature of attenuation by serial egg passage and the need to develop mechanisms to rationally attenuate IBV for the next generation of effective vaccines. IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis remains a major problem in the global poultry industry, despite the existence of many different vaccines. IBV vaccines are currently developed by serial passage of a virulent strain on embryonated hens eggs until attenuation; however, little is known about the evolution of the viral population during the process of attenuation. High-throughput sequencing of four replicates of a serially egg-passaged IBV revealed a different pattern of genomic variation in each attenuated replicate and few consensus-level SNPs. This raises concerns that only a small number of genomic mutations are required to revert to a virulent phenotype, which may result in vaccine breakdown in the field. The observed hot spots of variation in the attenuated viruses have the potential to be used in the rational attenuation of virulent IBV for next-generation vaccine design.","output":"Attenuation of Infectious Bronchitis Virus in Eggs Results in Different Patterns of Genomic Variation across Multiple Replicates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many Veterans Healthcare Administration providers working with veterans diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder to question the feasibility and appropriateness of continuing to provide trauma-focused treatment during this crisis.

METHODS: Through semantic analysis, we collected 45 retrospective cohort studies, which evaluated 303 clinical and demographic variables across 13 different outcomes of patients with COVID-19, and 84,140 Twitter posts from 1036 COVID-19-positive users. Machine learning tools to extract biomedical information were introduced to identify mentions of uncommon or novel symptoms in tweets. We then examined and compared two data sets to expand our landscape of risk factors and symptoms related to COVID-19. RESULTS: From the biomedical literature, approximately 90% of clinical and demographic variables showed inconsistent associations with COVID-19 outcomes. Consensus analysis identified 72 risk factors that were specifically associated with individual outcomes. From the social media data, 51 symptoms were characterized and analyzed. By comparing social media data with biomedical literature, we identified 25 novel symptoms that were specifically mentioned in tweets but have been not previously well characterized. Furthermore, there were certain combinations of symptoms that were frequently mentioned together in social media.

No statistically significant differences were found before and during COVID\\\\19 pandemic on vaccine uptake. Logistic regression analysis showed that higher education level, understanding the risk of contracting the disease and vaccination status of the child determined the vaccination status of parents, regardless of their age, age of their child, severity of CHD, beliefs about vaccine safety and efficacy and risk of transmission if not vaccinated. Factor analysis revealed distinct groups among unvaccinated parents (76.3% of the variation in the responses). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination coverage of caregivers and household contacts of children with CHD is suboptimal. Influenza vaccination campaigns should take into consideration the specific characteristics of parental groups and target interventions accordingly to increase their vaccine uptake and indirectly protect children with CHD.","output":"Influenza vaccination among caregivers and household contacts of children with congenital heart disease before and during COVID\\\\19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, wasted mask is chosen as a pyrolysis feedstock whose generation has incredibly increased these days due to COVID-19. We suggest a way to produce value-added chemicals (e.g., aromatic compounds) from the mask with high amounts through catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP). To this end, the effects of zeolite catalyst properties on the upgradation efficiency of pyrolytic products produced from pyrolysis of wasted mask were investigated. The compositions and yields of pyrolytic gases and oils were characterized as functions of pyrolysis temperature and the type of zeolite catalyst (HBeta, HY, and HZSM-5), including the mesoporous catalyst of Al-MCM-41. The mask was pyrolyzed in a fixed bed reactor, and the pyrolysis gases evolved in the reactor was routed to a secondary reactor inside which the zeolite catalyst was loaded. It was chosen 550 C as the CFP temperature to compare the catalyst performance for the production of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) because this temperature gave the highest oil yield (80.7 wt%) during the non-catalytic pyrolysis process. The large pore zeolite group of HBeta and HY led to 134% and 67% higher BTEX concentrations than HZSM-5, respectively, likely because they had larger pores, higher surface areas, and higher acid site density than the HZSM-5. This is the first report of the effect of zeolite characteristics on BTEX production via CFP.","output":"Production of value-added aromatics from wasted COVID-19 mask via catalytic pyrolysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The hazards associated with radium-containing materials were largely unknown when they were first introduced into household and other products over a century ago. Radium was also originally thought to have beneficial health properties, leading to confusion amongst the public about the safety of radium in household products and food items. When the adverse health effects associated with radium were discovered and became well known, radium products became unpopular and were prohibited in some countries. In the United States, after the hazards associated with radium became known, radium was first regulated by individual states in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Later, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was given a role in the regulation of discrete sources of radium with the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. After passage of the Act, the NRC began to systematically identify sites around the country where radium was used and reached out to site owners to determine whether existing radium contamination could pose a risk to public health and safety and the environment. The NRC devised a graded approach in response to its new regulatory responsibilities to address potential public health and safety issues at legacy radium sites. By September 2019, the NRC had dispositioned all the sites that were identified as having potential contamination from historical radium within its regulatory purview in non-Agreement States. The staff worked with site owners and federal, state and local officials, as needed, to properly disposition the sites to ensure that each site either meets the applicable criteria for unrestricted use or has controls in place to limit access during remediation so that no site poses an unacceptable risk to public health and safety and the environment.","output":"Management and cleanup of legacy radium-contaminated sites in the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To describe clinical characteristics and management of intensive care units (ICU) patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and to determine 90-day mortality after ICU admission and associated risk factors.

PDCoV primarily infects the small intestine instead of the large intestine in vivo However, the underlying mechanism of PDCoV tropism to different intestinal segments remains poorly understood as a result of the lack of a suitable in vitro intestinal model that recapitulates the cellular diversity and complex functions of the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we established the PDCoV infection model of crypt-derived enteroids from different intestinal segments. Enteroids were susceptible to PDCoV, and multiple types of different functional intestinal epithelia were infected by PDCoV in vitro and in vivo We further found that PDCoV favorably infected the jejunum and ileum and restrictedly replicated in the duodenum and colon. Mechanistically, enteroids from different intestinal regions displayed a distinct gene expression profile, and the differential expression of primary viral receptor host aminopeptidase N (APN) instead of the interferon (IFN) responses determined the susceptibility of different intestinal segments to PDCoV, although PDCoV substantially elicited antiviral genes production in enteroids after infection. Additional studies showed that PDCoV infection significantly induced the expression of type I and III IFNs at the late stage of infection, and exogenous IFN inhibited PDCoV replication in enteroids. Hence, our results provide critical inputs to further dissect the molecular mechanisms of PDCoV-host interactions and pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE The zoonotic potential of the PDCoV, a coronavirus efficiently infecting cells from a broad range species, including porcine, chicken, and human, emphasizes the urgent need to further study the cell and tissue tropism of PDCoV in its natural host. Herein, we generated crypt stem cell-derived enteroids from porcine different intestinal regions, which well recapitulated the events in vivo of PDCoV infection that PDCoV targeted multiple types of intestinal epithelia and preferably infected the jejunum and ileum over the duodenum and colon. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that the expression of APN receptor rather than the IFN responses determined the susceptibility of different regions of the intestines to PDCoV infection, though PDCoV infection markedly elicited the IFN responses. Our findings provide important insights into how the distinct gene expression profiles of the intestinal segments determine the cell and tissue tropism of PDCoV.","output":"Aminopeptidase N Expression, Not Interferon Responses, Determines the Intestinal Segmental Tropism of Porcine Deltacoronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic declared in March 2020, has generated worldwide concern due to its effect on the health of the population and the potential health collapse The strategy of \\"flattening the curve\\" through social distancing made it possible to adapt the resources of the health system to patients with COVID-19, but results in other areas of health could not be predicted The objective of this work was to analyze the consequences of the pandemic on liver transplantation in general and for hepatocarcinoma (HCC) The following studies were carried out: a) a retrospective analysis using data from the CRESI / INCUCAI to compare admission to the waiting list, mortality on the list, donation and liver transplantation from 03/20 to 08/15, 2019 and the same period in 2020, and b) a survey of the transplant centers with the highest transplant activity to assess the effect of the measures taken in different institutional and regional situations The first analysis showed a 55% decrease in liver transplants, with a similar reduction in donation and admission to the liver waiting list;while HCC transplantation rose from 10% in 2019 to 22% in 2020 The second analysis showed that the occupancy rate of beds by COVID-19 patients / week was variable: from 0 4% to 42 0% The number of surgeries, hepato-bilio-pancreatic, resection of HCC and liver transplantation, were reduced by 47%, 49%, 31% and 36% respectively The reduction in transplant activity mainly affected centers with high occupancy due to COVID-19 The final long-term outcome will need to be assessed La pandemia COVID-19 declarada en marzo del 2020, ha generado preocupacin mundial por su efecto en la salud de la poblacin y el potencial colapso sanitario La estrategia de \\"aplanar la curva\\" mediante el distanciamiento social permiti adaptar los recursos del sistema de salud a pacientes con COVID-19, pero no se pudo prever su repercusin en otras reas de la salud El objetivo de este trabajo fue analizar las consecuencias de la pandemia sobre el trasplante heptico en general y por hepatocarcinoma (HCC) Fueron realizados los siguientes estudios: a) un anlisis retrospectivo utilizando datos del CRESI/INCUCAI para comparar ingreso en lista de espera, mortalidad en lista, donacin y trasplante heptico desde 20/03 a 15/08, 2019 e igual periodo de 2020, y b) una encuesta a los centros de trasplante de mayor actividad trasplantolgica para valorar el efecto de las medidas tomadas en diferentes situaciones institucionales y regionales El primer anlisis evidenci una disminucin del 55% de los trasplantes hepticos, con una reduccin similar en la donacin y en el ingreso a lista de espera heptica;mientras que el trasplante por HCC ascendi de 10% en 2019 a 22% en 2020 El segundo anlisis, mostr que la tasa de ocupacin de camas por pacientes COVID-19/semana fue variable: de 0 4% al 42 0% El nmero de cirugas, hepato-bilio-pancretica, reseccin de HCC y trasplante heptico, se redujeron en 47%, 49%, 31% y 36% respectivamente La reduccin de la actividad trasplantolgica afect mayormente los centros con alta ocupacin por COVID-19 El impacto final a largo plazo deber evaluarse","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic in liver transplantation in Argentina.

Data related to COVID-19, dietary therapy and herbal medicine were systematically searched and gathered in scholarly materials. The search strategy included all terms that contain key words in relation to COVID-19 and treatment using traditional approach. Over 188 published articles on COVID-19 virus that included the virus biology, pathogenesis and immunology in relation to the traditional medicines, nutritional immunology, steaming practice, medicinal plants and nutritional contents of medicinal plants were obtained after individual manual screening. Given the relatively lower cases of the pandemic in Africa and the approach that Tanzania and some other African countries have used, it is undeniable that other factors than host-pathogen interaction determine the severity of the infection by the SARS-CoV-2 to necessitate multiple approaches to contain the disease. The authors conclude that traditional medicines potentially contain variable compounds with immunological, antiviral activity and nutritional value which, combined with steaming practice, can limit the virus impact while providing relief or protection to patients against the disease and be the key local interface remedy in keeping the COVID- 19 low in Tanzania and other African countries to contain the pandemic.","output":"SARS CoV-2 structure, biology, immunology and clinical course: exploring the value of traditional medicine in limiting COVID-19 individual risk and disease outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aim was to understand the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the levels of anxiety, depression, and burnout of healthcare workers (HCWs) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

It has commonly been associated with pulmonary manifestations and there is a growing body of evidence of multisystem involvement of the virus. As evidenced by various case reports and cohort studies, COVID-19-associated coagulopathy has been a common manifestation amongst the critically ill and has been associated with increased mortality. The presence of venous thromboembolic events in patients who are critically ill due to COVID-19 has prompted the adoption of anticoagulation regimens aimed at preventing thromboembolic phenomena. Coagulation abnormalities have also been implicated in the progression and the severity of COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). There is strong evidence that D-dimer levels help predict which patients are at risk of thromboembolic events, progression to ARDS, DIC, immune dysregulation and mortality. We will review the utility of D-dimer as screening tool and in the risk stratification of COVID-19 patients prone to developing thromboembolic events, DIC, immune dysregulation and death. To date, the studies that have been published show the presence of elevated D-dimer levels in both the adult and pediatric populations and the measured level correlates with disease severity. Studies have also shown the relative increase of D-dimer levels in non-survivors compared to survivors. The elevation of D-dimer levels has shown to guide clinical decision making, namely the initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation and mortality benefit in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to severe non COVID-19 pneumonia. Although the current body of literature suggested the use of D-dimer as a risk stratification tool and as a test to augment clinical judgement regarding the initiation of anticoagulation, randomized control trials are needed to fully understand the relationship between COVID-19 infection and the efficacy of D-dimer assays in clinical decision making.","output":"Utility of D-dimer as a Prognostic Factor in SARS CoV2 Infection: A Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Equine arteritis virus (EAV), the prototype Arterivirus, is a positive-stranded RNA virus that expresses its replicase in the form of two large polyproteins of 1,727 and 3,175 amino acids. The functional replicase subunits (nonstructural proteins), which drive EAV genome replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription, are generated by extensive proteolytic processing. Subgenomic mRNA transcription involves an unusual discontinuous step and generates the mRNAs for structural protein expression. Previously, the phenotype of mutant EAV030F, which carries a single replicase point mutation (Ser-2429-->Pro), had implicated the nsp10 replicase subunit (51 kDa) in viral RNA synthesis, and in particular in subgenomic mRNA transcription. nsp10 contains an N-terminal (putative) metal-binding domain (MBD), located just upstream of the Ser-2429-->Pro mutation, and a helicase activity in its C-terminal part. We have now analyzed the N-terminal domain of nsp10 in considerable detail. A total of 38 mutants, most of them carrying specific single point mutations, were tested in the context of an EAV infectious cDNA clone. Variable effects on viral genome replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription were observed. In general, our results indicated that the MBD region, and in particular a set of 13 conserved Cys and His residues that are assumed to be involved in zinc binding, is essential for viral RNA synthesis. On the basis of these data and comparative sequence analyses, we postulate that the MBD may employ a rather unusual mode of zinc binding that could result in the association of up to four zinc cations with this domain. The region containing residue Ser-2429 may play the role of \\"hinge spacer,\\" which connects the MBD to the rest of nsp10. Several mutations in this region specifically affected subgenomic mRNA synthesis. Furthermore, one of the MBD mutants was replication and transcription competent but did not produce infectious progeny virus. This suggests that nsp10 is involved in an as yet unidentified step of virion biogenesis.","output":"The predicted metal-binding region of the arterivirus helicase protein is involved in subgenomic mRNA synthesis, genome replication, and virion biogenesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More than 5.89 million people have died from COVID-19.

We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases. METHODS: We collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation. FINDINGS: Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 178 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 169-192) and to hospital discharge to be 247 days (229-281). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70a??117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 367% (95% CrI 356-380). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 138% (123-153), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (032% [027-038] in those aged <60 years vs 64% [57-72] in those aged &#8805;60 years), up to 134% (112-159) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 14% [04-35] in those aged <60 years [n=360] and 45% [18-111] in those aged &#8805;60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 066% (039-133), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 184% (110-376) in those aged 80 years or older.

We rely on a single camera because of the deployment cost. The system recognizes people from a video and estimates the interpersonal distance for close-contact detection. The challenge is the occlusion of people, which leads to false negatives in close-contact detection. To solve the problem, we leverage the observation that most false negatives in human detection are caused by occlusion owing to other people. This is because there are few obstacles in sports facilities. Based on the above observation, we assume that a person still exists near the last detected position even when s/he disappears in the proximity of other people.

Patients' family members who visited outpatient departments were approached and interviewed about their sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge of Ebola, attitude towards vaccination practice and their WTP for a hypothetical Ebola vaccine. A multivariable linear regression model assessed the relationship between these explanatory variables and WTP. Results: During the study, 500 participants were approached and interviewed. There were 424 (84.8%) respondents who completed the interview and 74% (311/424) expressed their acceptance for an Ebola vaccine. There were 288 participants who were willing to pay for an Ebola vaccine (92.6% out of 311). The mean of WTP was US$2.08 (95% CI: 1.75-2.42). The final multivariable model indicated that young age, high educational attainment, working as a private employee, entrepreneur or civil servant (compared to farmers), being unmarried, and residing in a suburb (compared to a city) were associated with higher WTP. Conclusions: Although the proportion of the participants who would accept the Ebola vaccine was relatively high, the amount they were willing to pay for Ebola vaccine was very low. This finding would indicate the need of subsidies for Ebola vaccine in the country.","output":"Willingness-to-pay for a hypothetical Ebola vaccine in Indonesia: A cross-sectional study in Aceh."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, the effect of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on electrical energy storage technologies was investigated.

METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort of consecutive adults evaluated in the emergency department and/or admitted with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across 31 hospitals in four countries (1 February 2020-16 June 2020). The primary outcome was the incidence rate of cerebrovascular events, inclusive of acute ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhages (ICH), and cortical vein and/or sinus thrombosis (CVST). RESULTS: Of the 14,483 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, 172 were diagnosed with an acute cerebrovascular event (1.13% of cohort; 1130/100,000 patients, 95%CI 970-1320/100,000), 68/171 (40.5%) were female and 96/172 (55.8%) were between the ages 60 and 79 years. Of these, 156 had acute ischemic stroke (1.08%; 1080/100,000 95%CI 920-1260/100,000), 28 ICH (0.19%; 190/100,000 95%CI 130-280/100,000), and 3 with CVST (0.02%; 20/100,000, 95%CI 4-60/100,000). The in-hospital mortality rate for SARS-CoV-2-associated stroke was 38.1% and for ICH 58.3%. After adjusting for clustering by site and age, baseline stroke severity, and all predictors of in-hospital mortality found in univariate regression (p < 0.1: male sex, tobacco use, arrival by emergency medical services, lower platelet and lymphocyte counts, and intracranial occlusion), cryptogenic stroke mechanism (aOR 5.01, 95%CI 1.63-15.44, p < 0.01), older age (aOR 1.78, 95%CI 1.07-2.94, p = 0.03), and lower lymphocyte count on admission (aOR 0.58, 95%CI 0.34-0.98, p = 0.04) were the only independent predictors of mortality among patients with stroke and COVID-19.

METHODS: In a retrospective observational population-based quality registry study covering a population of 1.7 million, we studied the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), admissions to specialist healthcare and the intensive care unit (ICU), and all-cause case fatality in different language groups between 27th February and 3rd August 2020 in Southern Finland. A first language other than Finnish, Swedish or Smi served as a surrogate marker for a foreign ethnic background. RESULTS: In total, 124 240 individuals were tested, and among the 118 300 (95%) whose first language could be determined, 4005 (3.4%) were COVID-19-positive, 623 (0.5%) were admitted to specialized hospitals, and 147 (0.1%) were admitted to the ICU; 254 (0.2%) died. Those with a foreign first language had lower testing rates (348, 95%CI 340C355 versus 758, 95%CI 753C762 per 10 000, p < 0.0001), higher incidence (36, 95%CI 33C38 versus 22, 95%CI 21C23 per 10 000, p < 0.0001), and higher positivity rates (103, 95%CI 96C109 versus 29, 95%CI 28C30 per 1000, p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in ICU admissions, disease severity at ICU admission, or ICU outcomes. Case fatality by 90 days was 7.7% in domestic cases and 1.2% in those with a foreign first language, explained by demographics (age- and sex-adjusted HR 0.49, 95%CI 0.21C1.15). CONCLUSIONS: The population with a foreign first language was at an increased risk for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, but when hospitalized they had outcomes similar to those in the native, domestic language population.

DESIGN: Quantitative systematic review with meta\\\\analyses where appropriate. DATA SOURCES: Medline, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library (from database inception to 31 July 2019). REVIEW METHODS: Studies presenting data on individual sources of inaccuracy in the manual measurement of adult RR were analysed, assessed for quality, and grouped according to the source of inaccuracy investigated. Quantitative data were extracted and synthesized and meta\\\\analyses performed where appropriate. RESULTS: Included studies (N = 49) identified five sources of inaccuracy. The awareness effect creates an artefactual reduction in actual RR, and observation methods involving shorter counts cause systematic underscoring. Individual RR measurements can differ substantially in either direction between observations due to inter\\\\ or intra\\\\observer variability. Value bias, where particular RRs are over\\\\represented (suggesting estimation), is a widespread problem. Recording omission is also widespread, with higher average rates in inpatient versus triage/admission contexts. CONCLUSION: This review demonstrates that manually measured RR data are subject to several potential sources of inaccuracy. IMPACT: RR is an important indicator of clinical deterioration and commonly included in track\\\\and\\\\trigger systems. However, the usefulness of RR data depends on the accuracy of the observations and documentation, which are subject to five potential sources of inaccuracy identified in this review. A single measurement may be affected by several factors. Hence, clinicians should interpret recorded RR data cautiously unless systems are in place to ensure its accuracy. For nurses, this includes counting rather than estimating RRs, employing 60\\\\s counts whenever possible, ensuring patients are unaware that their RR is being measured, and documenting the resulting value. For any given site, interventions to improve measurement should take into account the local organizational and cultural context, available resources, and the specific measurement issues that need to be addressed.","output":"Quantitative systematic review: Sources of inaccuracy in manually measured adult respiratory rate data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 affects women in ways unique to the impacts of structural inequalities related to gender, sexuality, disability, race, and socioeconomic status.

The low percentage of children with asymptomatic cases compared with mild illness and moderate illness could be correlated with the rare cases of MIS-C.

Thermal image analysis was used to obtain the face thermograms of the participants. The results clearly showed the retention effect of the face masks on the exhaled air, leading to lower CO2 concentration in the classroom and higher O-2 concentration and humidity. It was also found that the continuous wear of a face mask for 40-45 min provoked an increment of the facial skin temperature under the mask to 37 degrees CC and even more.

We have shown that fresh human platelets (Plts) and platelet extracellular vesicles mitigate vascular leak in murine models of injury. Here, we investigate the potential of freeze-dried platelets (FDPlts) to attenuate pulmonary vascular permeability, decrease inflammation and promote clotting in a murine model of HS. METHODS Human FDPlts were characterized utilizing in vitro assays of platelet marker expression, aggregation, coagulation and endothelial cell permeability. An intravital model of vascular injury in the mouse cremaster muscle was used to assess the ability of FDPlts to incorporate into clots. Mice subjected to controlled hemorrhage for 90 minutes were 1) lactated Ringer's solution (LR), 2) FDPlts, 3) fresh human Plts, 4) murine whole blood (WB) and 5) shams (only instrumented). HS mouse endpoints included coagulation, pulmonary vascular permeability and lung injury. RESULTS FDPlts expressed platelet specific markers and retained functionality similar to fresh Plts. In in vitro assays of platelet aggregation differences were noted. In vivo, FDPlts and Plts were found to incorporate into clots in post capillary venules in the mouse cremaster. HS mice resuscitated with LR displayed increased pulmonary vascular permeability compared to sham (sham, 686.6359.7; shock+LR, 2637954.7; p=0.001), treatment with FDPlts or WB attenuated permeability compared to shock: (shock+FDPlts, 1328462.6; p=0.05), and (shock+WB, 1024370.5; p=0.0108). However, Plts (Day 1-3) did not attenuate vascular leak in HS mice compared to shock (shock+Plts, 36011581; p=0.33). CONCLUSIONS FDPlts contribute to clot formation similar to fresh human Plts. FDPlts also attenuated vascular permeability in vitro and in vivo. Mouse WB resuscitation but not fresh Plts attenuated vascular permeability after HS. These data suggest that the effect of FDPlts may be a suitable alternative to fresh Plts in modulating hemostasis and the endotheliopathy associated with injury.

During lockdown, children from families with low educational levels and financial difficulties not only tended to live in poor housing conditions, but were also exposed to negative health determinants such as noise and tobacco smoke;they took less physical exercise, had a poorer diet, spent more time in front of screens and had less social contact. A notable social gradient was found in most of the variables analyzed.

Although the pandemic has an all-round impact on medical work, the degree of its impact on endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is unclear. METHODS: We continuously included AIS patients with large artery occlusion who underwent EVT in a comprehensive stroke center before and during the Wuhan shutdown. The protected code stroke (PCS) for screening and treating AIS patients was established during the pandemic. The efficacy and safety outcomes including the rate of successful reperfusion (defined as modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) graded 2b or 3) and time intervals for reperfusion were compared between two groups: pre-pandemic and pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 55 AIS patients who received EVT were included. The baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. The time from hospital arrival to puncture (174 vs 125.5 min; p=0.002) and time from hospital arrival to reperfusion (213 vs 172 min; p=0.047) were significantly prolonged in the pandemic group compared with the pre-pandemic group. The rate of successful reperfusion was not significantly different between the two groups (85.7% (n=18) vs 88.2% (n=30); OR 0.971, 95% CI 0.785 to 1.203; p=1.000). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest a proper PCS algorithm which combines the COVID-19 screening and protection measures could decrease the impact of the disease on the clinical outcomes of EVT for AIS patients to the lowest extent possible during the pandemic.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the process and outcome of thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in Turkey.

METHODS Included in retrospective analysis were patients who underwent transbrachial coil embolization of cerebral aneurysms in the posterior cerebral circulation by direct VA cannulation of a GC from 2007 to 2013. Investigated were patient characteristics, preoperative sizes of aneurysms, aneurysms location, the angle formed by the target VA and the subclavian artery (AVS), and the VA diameter at the level of the fourth cervical vertebral body (VAD) in the side of the transbrachial access route. RESULTS Thirty-one patients with 32 aneurysms met our criteria. The locations of aneurysms were the VA (n = 16), basilar artery (BA) tip (n = 10), BA trunk (n = 3), BA superior cerebellar artery (n = 1), BA anterior inferior cerebellar artery (n = 1), and VA posterior inferior cerebellar artery (n = 1). The right brachial artery was punctured in 27 cases with 28 aneurysms as transbrachial direct cannulation of a GC, and left was in 4 cases with 4 aneurysms. The average AVS, ranging from 45 to 95, was 77, and the average VAD, ranging from 3.18 to 4.45 mm, was 3.97 mm.

We collected demographic characteristics, exposure history, and course of action of COVID-19 cases. We described the demographic and case characteristics of these cases to show the basic characteristics of COVID-19 cases in both provinces. Combined with the spatial analysis of confirmed cases, the distribution law of the number of confirmed cases in different regions was analyzed. We exhibit the relationship among COVID-19 cases with a transmission network. The transmission characteristics of COVID-19 were analyzed through the transmission network. Mainly cases in Liaoning and Jilin provinces were imported cases from other provinces and the vast majority of these cases were related to Hubei province. The number of confirmed cases in different regions was positively correlated with their GDP and population. The main clinical symptoms of the cases were fever. Judge from the transmission network relationship between the 2 provinces, the transmission chain in Liaoning province contains fewer cases than that in Jilin province. The main transmission routes of the local cases in the 2 provinces were the family members, and the infection of the imported cases were mainly occurred in public places. It was estimated that the unidentified asymptomatic infected cases in the 2 provinces account for approximately 7.3% of the total number of infected cases.

OBJECTIVE: Using a general inductive approach, this qualitative study aims to describe how the COVID-19 pandemic reflects on seafarers' well-being. The study focused on obtaining personal experiences from seafarers on board, and seafarers at home, relating to the current world pandemic. METHODS: A convenience sample consisting of 752 seafarers from the international seafarers' population participated in an online study in spring 2020. The questionnaire used included questions relating to basic sociodemographic and work characteristics, and one open question which addressed seafarers' personal experiences. The data obtained was analysed by thematic analysis. RESULTS: The emerged themes included mental, physical, social and economic well-being. Most of the answers of seafarers located on board related to threatened mental, physical and social well-being, while seafarers at home reported mostly on threats to their economic well-being. CONCLUSION: Seafarers' well-being is seriously threatened by preventive measures relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, simply raising empiric MAP targets during CPB might result in MAP above the upper limit of autoregulation (ULA), causing cerebral hyperperfusion in some patients and predisposing them to cerebral dysfunction after surgery. We hypothesized that MAP above an ULA during CPB is associated with postoperative delirium. METHODS Autoregulation during CPB was monitored continuously in 491 patients with the cerebral oximetry index (COx) in this prospective observational study. COx represents Pearson's correlation coefficient between low-frequency changes in regional cerebral oxygen saturation (measured with near-infrared spectroscopy) and MAP. Delirium was defined throughout the postoperative hospitalization based on clinical detection with prospectively defined methods. RESULTS Delirium was observed in 45 (9.2%) patients. Mechanical ventilation for >48 h [odds ratio (OR), 3.94; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.72-9.03], preoperative antidepressant use (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.29-6.96), prior stroke (OR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.12-6.96), congestive heart failure (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.28-5.62), the product of the magnitude and duration of MAP above an ULA (mm Hg h; OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.15), and age (per year of age; OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07) were independently associated with postoperative delirium.

We computationally contrasted the binding interactions between human ACE2 and coronavirus spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of the 2002 epidemic-causing SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and bat coronavirus RaTG13 using the Rosetta energy function. We find that the RBD of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly optimized to achieve very strong binding with human ACE2 (hACE2) which is consistent with its enhanced infectivity. SARS-CoV-2 forms the most stable complex with hACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 (23% less stable) or RaTG13 (11% less stable). Notably, we calculate that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD lowers the binding strength of angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1) which is the native binding partner of ACE2 by 44.2%. Strong binding is mediated through strong electrostatic attachments with every fourth residue on the N-terminus alpha-helix (starting from Ser19 to Asn53) as the turn of the helix makes these residues solvent accessible. By contrasting the spike protein SARS-CoV-2 Rosetta binding energy with ACE2 of different livestock and pet species we find strongest binding with bat ACE2 followed by human, feline, equine, canine and finally chicken. This is consistent with the hypothesis that bats are the viral origin and reservoir species.

Furthermore, this study aimed at investigating if a difference in patients characteristics, clinical management, and outcomes was present during time. DESIGN comparison of different periods in a clinical cohort. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS for each patient who accessed the ED and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 swab, the ED medical record was collected and a descriptive analysis was performed on demographical characteristics, pre-existing comorbidities, parameters measured at triage, imaging exams results, lab tests results, separately for patients admitted at the ED in four different periods. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES discharge from ED, admission to hospital wards (low and high intensity of care), short term in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay. The association between patients' characteristics and the main outcomes was measured using multivariable logistic models. RESULTS age of patients increased significantly from March to April, together with female prevalence and associated comorbid conditions. A significant difference in symptoms at presentation was not observed nor it was in laboratory test results. Severity at triage and need of intensive care resources were higher in the first weeks, together with the typical clinical presentation with respiratory failure and imaging with signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Accordingly, in-hospital mortality was higher in the first period. Nevertheless, nearly half of patients in the first period were discharged directly from ED showing mild COVID-19 cases. On the contrary, in April an increasing need of hospitalisation in low intensity of care beds was observed, whereas mild cases stopped to access the ED.

Difference-in-difference analysis of PM2.5 and NO2 measured at 93 sites were used to estimate the change in citywide pollution attributable to the shutdown. We also quantified how these pollutant changes varied among different demographic groups using difference-in-difference analyses stratified by neighborhood poverty levels and rates of PM2.5-attributable health outcomes. Spatial patterns of PM2.5 and NO2 were interpolated across NYC by fitting land-use regression models to measurements at the 93 sites.

We estimate that citywide average PM2.5 and NO2 decreased by approximately 25% and 29%, respectively, due to the shutdown. Weather readings show little evidence that meteorology biased our results in the direction of our findings.

Thus far, the integrated assessment modelling community and the IPCC have neglected to consider degrowth scenarios, where economic output declines due to stringent climate mitigation. Hence, their potential to avoid reliance on negative emissions and speculative rates of technological change remains unexplored. As a first step to address this gap, this paper compares 1.5 C degrowth scenarios with IPCC archetype scenarios, using a simplified quantitative representation of the fuel-energy-emissions nexus.

This study involved in 963 ACS patients and 932 control subjects from a Chinese population. All participants were genotyped for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of MIF gene rs2070766 using SNPscan?. A nomogram model using MIF genetic variation and clinical variables was established to predict risk of ACS. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were monitored during a follow-up period. The frequency of rs2070766 GG genotype was higher in ACS patients than in control subjects (6.2 vs 3.8%, p = 0.034). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that individuals with mutant GG genotype had a 1.7-fold higher risk of ACS compared with individuals with CC or CG genotypes. Using MIF rs2070766 genotypes and clinical factors, we developed a nomogram model to predict risk of ACS. The nomogram model had a good discrimination with an area under the curve of 0.781 (95% CI: 0.759C0.804), concordance index of 0.784 (95% CI: 0.762C0.806) and well-fitted calibration. During the follow-up period of 25 months, Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated that ACS patients carrying GG phenotype developed more MACE compared to CC or CG carriers (p < 0.05).

Lack of diagnostic microbiological data may prolong empiric broad-spectrum therapy. Here we evaluate the use of the BioFire FilmArray pneumonia panel (PP), a novel rapid diagnostic test, and antibiotic decisions among intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of adult ICU patients admitted with COVID-19 between January 2020 and May 2021 at an academic medical center. ICU patients who underwent bronchoscopy/bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with PP (PP group) were matched by age (< 65 or 65), BMI (< 30 or 30), and BAL date (within 60 days) to ICU patients who did not undergo BAL (no-BAL group). PP patients were matched by age and BMI to ICU patients who underwent BAL without PP (no-PP group). Antibiotic use was compared between groups. Chi squared analysis, t-test, and ANOVA were used for comparisons as appropriate. RESULTS: 65 patients were included; the majority were male (65%), < 65 years (86%), and had BMI 30 (54%) (Table 1). Only 17 no-PP matches were identified for PP patients due to infrequent BALs. Similar proportion of patients in PP and no-PP groups had organisms identified from BAL (54% vs. 47%, p=0.65). Among PP patients with a detected organism, all (n=13) had subsequent changes in antibiotic regimen 72 hours after BAL; 10/13 (77%) had a change targeted to detected organism and 5/13 (39%) had antibiotic narrowing. Among PP patients with no detected organism, only 4/11 (36%) had antibiotic narrowing or maintenance off antibiotics. In all groups, average antibiotic use exceeded 70% of admission duration.

In this descriptive analysis, antibiotic management did not differ significantly with use of PP. While most patients with detected organism on PP had targeted antibiotic changes, a negative PP did not appear to influence antibiotic narrowing.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional survey study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the obstetrics and gynecology residency training program in Italy. An online survey with 45 questions was sent and completed anonymously by residents after accepting an informed consent. The invitation to the online survey was sent to all the Italian residents in obstetrics and gynecology. Those on maternity leave at the time of the study were excluded. Residents were asked about their routinely activity before the COVID-19 pandemic, and to report the reduction in their clinical practice. They were also asked about psychological impact of COVID-19 on their clinical practice. RESULTS: 933 Italian residents in obstetrics and gynecology, were invited for this survey study. Four-hundred and seventy-six (51 %) completed the survey and were included in the study. Three-hundred and eighty-seven (81.3 %) were female, and 89 (18.7 %) were male. Residents age ranged from 25 to 42. In 71,8 % (342/476) of the cases residents work in a COVID-19 reference Hospitals. One-hundred and eighty-four out of 76 residents (38.6 %) were tested on RT-PCR assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens, and of them 12/184 (6.5 %) were positive to SARS-COV-2. Regarding the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), 267 (56.1 %) reported to receive adequate device, and 379 (79.6 %) felt to be well informed about prevention and management protocols. Three-hundred and thirty-one residents (69.5 %) reported to have managed COVID-19 positive patients. For 54,7 % of respondent residents, training activity in general decreased significantly during the COVID-19 epidemic. A one-third reduction was reported in 31,4 % of the cases, whereas a total suspension of the training in 9,9 % of the cases. In 89,3 % of cases the reduction was caused by the reorganization of work. Anxiety about the professional future was reported in 84 % of the residents, and 59 % of them had the perception that their training was irreversibly compromised.

Immunocompromised individuals are highly susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Whether vaccine-induced immunity in these individuals involves the oral cavity, a primary site of infection, is presently unknown. Methods. Immunocompromised individuals (n=404) and healthy controls (n=82) participated in a prospective clinical trial encompassing two doses of the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. Immunocompromised individuals included primary immunodeficiencies (PID) and secondary immunodeficiencies caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)/chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T), solid organ transplantation (SOT), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Saliva and serum samples were collected at four time points from the first vaccine dose until 2 weeks after second dose. SARS-CoV-2 spike specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses were quantified by a multiplex bead-based assay in saliva and correlated to paired serum IgG titers determined by Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay. Results. IgG responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike full-length trimeric glycoprotein (Spike-f) and S1 subunit in saliva in the HIV and HSCT/CAR-T groups were comparable to healthy controls. In contrast, PID, SOT, and CLL patients all displayed weaker responses which were mainly influenced by disease parameters or immunosuppressants. Salivary IgG levels strongly correlated with serum IgG titers on days 21 and 35 (rho=0.8079 and 0.7768, p=<0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for the predictive power of salivary IgG yielded AUC=0.95, PPV=90.7% for the entire cohort on D35. Conclusions.

We describe the process and outcomes of a new proactive, virtual nurse-led, resource center navigation model enhanced by using volunteer patient navigators. Using known patient risk factors, this model provides interventions to reduce barriers to care, with an emphasis on non-English-speaking populations. METHODS: Patients were included if they (1) were in active cancer treatment and (2) had one or more known risk factors: distance from cancer hospital, needing complex care, 65 years or older, malignant hematological diagnosis, new treatment start, lives alone, non-English speaker, or a new hospital discharge. Nurse navigators triaged referrals to appropriate team members who identified and addressed barriers to care. RESULTS: The program engaged with 586 adult cancer patients over 1459 encounters. The most common risk factors included distance (59.7%), complex care (48.8%), and new treatment start (43.5%). The most common interventions were core education (69.4%), emotional support (61.2%), and education (35.7%).

Larger droplets can travel further from the source before getting pulled into the sink by virtue of their larger inertia, and their maximum traveled distance is determined analytically. We investigate the effects of gravity, and we find that there are three distinct droplet behaviors categorized by their relative sizes: small, intermediate-sized, and large. Counterintuitively, we find that the droplets with a minimum horizontal range are neither small nor large, but of intermediate size. Furthermore, we show that in conditions of regular human respiration, these intermediate-sized droplets range in size from a few m to a few hundred m.

Plasmatic levels of interleukin 6 (IL6), C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble-IL2 receptor (IL2R&#945;), procalcitonin (PCT) and ferritin were measured using chemiluminescence assay. Complete blood count was performed by Convergys 3X? hematology analyzer. Our results demonstrated that the peripheral blood levels of IL6, PCT, CRP, ferritin, IL2R&#945;, white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count (NEU), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (d-NLR) were significantly higher in severe forms of COVID-19.

Kinetic characterization of small biochemicals is particularly challenging, and has required sensor developers to find solutions to compensate for the lack of sensitivity of their instruments. In this regard, surface chemistry plays a crucial role. The ligands need to be efficiently immobilized on the sensor surface, and probe distribution, maintenance of their native structure and efficient diffusion of the analyte to the surface need to be optimized. In order to enhance the signal generated by low molecular weight targets, surface plasmon resonance sensors utilize a high density of probes on the surface by employing a thick dextran matrix, resulting in a three-dimensional, multilayer distribution of molecules. Despite increasing the binding signal, this method can generate artifacts, due to the diffusion dependence of surface binding, affecting the accuracy of measured affinity constants. On the other hand, when working with planar surface chemistries, an incredibly high sensitivity is required for low molecular weight analytes, and furthermore the standard method for immobilizing single layers of molecules based on self-assembled monolayers (SAM) of epoxysilane has been demonstrated to promote protein denaturation, thus being far from ideal. Here, we will give a concise overview of the impact of tridimensional immobilization of ligands on label-free biosensors, mostly focusing on the effect of diffusion on binding affinity constants measurements. We will comment on how multilayering of probes is certainly useful in terms of increasing the sensitivity of the sensor, but can cause steric hindrance, mass transport and other diffusion effects. On the other hand, probe monolayers on epoxysilane chemistries do not undergo diffusion effect but rather other artifacts can occur due to probe distortion.

However, aggregate categories like BAME mask internal diversities and differences and limit the scope for understanding why disproportionalities occur and appropriate interventions. This paper responds to calls for disaggregated and in-depth participatory community based research to improve culturally nuanced understanding of health inequalities and COVID-19 impacts. METHODS: The paper draws from weekly zoom discussions and data from a google-forms on-line survey (n = 103) that the Zimbabwean community conducted to establish and examine COVID-19 experiences of Zimbabwean health and care workers in the UK. Our interpretive approach used MAXQDA software for qualitative data analysis; to code and categorise responses to open ended survey questions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS: Discursive analysis of this community data shows that health and social care worker experiences included recurrent and widely reported themes such as discrimination in allocation of equipment, moral injury and trauma that may lead to long- term mental health problems. These results confirm diversity of experiences amongst health care professionals when compared to other ethnic groups and by gender. They reinforce the case for monitoring, for after care research and support, including that which draws on community-based capital.","output":"At the deep end: COVID-19 experiences of Zimbabwean health and care workers in the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interventional embolization and minimally invasive thermal ablation are common clinical methods for treatment of unresectable solid tumors, but they both have many insurmountable disadvantages.

METHODS A retrospective audit of hospital inpatient admissions over a five-year period was undertaken, and a wide range of admission-related data were collected for a sample of 7,548 admissions. Hospitalisations were costed using the diagnosis related group methodology. A series of descriptive, univariate and multivariate regression analyses were undertaken. RESULTS The mean hospitalisation cost for Type 1 diabetes was 4,027 and for Type 2 diabetes was 5,026 per admission. Sex, admission type and length of stay were significantly associated with hospitalisation costs for admissions with a primary diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes. Age, admission type, diagnosis status, complications status, discharge destination, length of stay and year were significantly associated with hospitalisation costs for admissions with a primary diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes. Length of stay was associated with higher mean costs, with each additional day increasing Type 1 diabetes costs by 260 (p=0.001) and Type 2 diabetes by 216 (p<0.001). Unscheduled admissions were associated with significantly lower costs than elective admissions; 1,578 (p=0.035) lower for Type 1 diabetes and 2,108 (p<0.001) lower for Type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS This study presents estimates of the costs of diabetes care in the Irish public hospital system and identifies the factors which influence costs for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.

Prior to modern therapy, post-stroke mortality was approximately 10% in the acute period, with nearly one-half of the patients developing moderate-to-severe disability. The most fundamental aspect of acute stroke management is time is brain. In acute ischemic stroke, the primary therapeutic goal of reperfusion therapy, including intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV TPA) and/or endovascular thrombectomy, is the rapid restoration of cerebral blood flow to the salvageable ischemic brain tissue at risk for cerebral infarction. Several landmark endovascular thrombectomy trials were found to be of benefit in select patients with acute stroke caused by occlusion of the proximal anterior circulation, which has led to a paradigm shift in the management of acute ischemic strokes. In this modern era of acute stroke care, more patients will survive with varying degrees of disability post-stroke. A comprehensive stroke rehabilitation program is critical to optimize post-stroke outcomes. Understanding the natural history of stroke recovery, and adapting a multidisciplinary approach, will lead to improved chances for successful rehabilitation.

Nowadays, the world is in the grip of the Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID 19) pandemic. In these patients, cytokine storm is associated with disease severity. In consideration of the role of vitamin D in the immune system, aim of this study was to analyse vitamin D levels in patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and to assess any correlations with disease severity and prognosis. METHODS: In this retrospective, observational study, we analysed demographic, clinical and laboratory data of 42 patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19, treated in Respiratory Intermediate Care Unit (RICU) of the Policlinic of Bari from March, 11 to April 30, 2020. RESULTS: Eighty one percent of patients had hypovitaminosis D. Based on vitamin D levels, the population was stratified into four groups: no hypovitaminosis D, insufficiency, moderate deficiency, and severe deficiency. No differences regarding demographic and clinical characteristics were found. A survival analysis highlighted that, after 10 days of hospitalization, severe vitamin D deficiency patients had a 50% mortality probability, while those with vitamin D  10 ng/mL had a 5% mortality risk (p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was found in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure, treated in a RICU. Patients with severe vitamin D deficiency had a significantly higher mortality risk.

Given varying risk factors among Latinx, we also evaluate associations for percentages of residents from specific Latin American-origin groups. RESULTS: Percentage of foreign-born residents is positively associated with COVID-19 case rate (IRR=1.106; 95%CI: 1.074-1.139). Adjusted associations for percentage Latinx are non-significant for all counties combined, but this obscures heterogeneity.

Excess winter mortality (EWM) is a measure of the net effect of all competing forces operating each winter, including influenza(s) and non-influenza pathogens. In this study over 2400 data points from 97 countries are used to look at the net effect of influenza vaccination rates in the elderly aged 65+ against excess winter mortality (EWM) each year from the winter of 1980/81 through to 2019/20. The observed international net effect of influenza vaccination ranges from a 7.8% reduction in EWM estimated at 100% elderly vaccination for the winter of 1989/90 down to a 9.3% increase in EWM for the winter of 2018/19. The average was only a 0.3% reduction in EWM for a 100% vaccinated elderly population. Such outcomes do not contradict the known protective effect of influenza vaccination against influenza mortality per sethey merely indicate that multiple complex interactions lie behind the observed net effect against all-causes (including all pathogen causes) of winter mortality. This range from net benefit to net disbenefit is proposed to arise from system complexity which includes environmental conditions (weather, solar cycles), the antigenic distance between constantly emerging circulating influenza clades and the influenza vaccine makeup, vaccination timing, pathogen interference, and human immune diversity (including individual history of host-virus, host-antigen interactions and immunosenescence) all interacting to give the observed outcomes each year. We propose that a narrow focus on influenza vaccine effectiveness misses the far wider complexity of winter mortality. Influenza vaccines may need to be formulated in different ways, and perhaps administered over a shorter timeframe to avoid the unanticipated adverse net outcomes seen in around 40% of years.","output":"System Complexity in Influenza Infection and Vaccination: Effects upon Excess Winter Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we investigate the cues of COVID-19 on sustained phonation of Vowel-/i/, deep breathing and number counting data of the DiCOVA dataset.

OBJECTIVE: We addressed two related questions: How did emotions change across various stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to what extent were preventive behaviors predicted by emotional reactions and information acquisition? METHODS: We conducted a four-wave longitudinal study in the United States and China across four stages of the pandemic: prepandemic, onset of viral outbreak, ongoing risk, and contained risk. We measured emotions, life satisfaction, preventive behaviors, acquisition of COVID-19 related information, and risk perceptions. We used the Emotional Recall Task (ERT) to investigate people's emotions. By allowing people to describe their emotional experience in their own words, the ERT evaluates each individual based on emotions relevant to their personal experience, making it more suitable for a wider range of contexts and social groups. RESULTS: Boredom, anxiety, fear, and worry were common emotional reactions to the pandemic as it emerged. Surprisingly, participants' emotional experience did not mirror infection and death rates: Instead of negative emotions growing as the virus spread, emotions soon reverted back to normality. This pattern held regardless of whether the viral spread was contained. Consequently, people's preventive behaviors were predicted by fear, anxiety, and worry only at the onset of the viral outbreak. In contrast, actively acquiring information and knowledge about COVID-19 had a more enduring effect on the engagement of preventive behaviors in both countries.

We used a time-dependent Poisson regression model to estimate rate ratios (RRs) for demographic and clinical factors associated with COVID-19 hospitalisation or death 14 days or more after the first vaccine dose, stratified by vaccine type. FINDINGS: Between Dec 8, 2020, and April 18, 2021, 2 572 008 individuals received their first dose of vaccine841 090 (327%) received BNT162b2 and 1 730 918 (673%) received ChAdOx1. 1196 (<01%) individuals were admitted to hospital or died due to COVID-19 illness (883 hospitalised, of whom 228 died, and 313 who died due to COVID-19 without hospitalisation) 14 days or more after their first vaccine dose. These severe COVID-19 outcomes were associated with older age (80 years vs 18C64 years adjusted RR 475, 95% CI 385C587), comorbidities (five or more risk groups vs less than five risk groups 424, 334C539), hospitalisation in the previous 4 weeks (300, 247C365), high-risk occupations (ten or more previous COVID-19 tests vs less than ten previous COVID-19 tests 214, 162C281), care home residence (163, 132C202), socioeconomic deprivation (most deprived quintile vs least deprived quintile 157, 130C190), being male (127, 113C143), and being an ex-smoker (ex-smoker vs non-smoker 118, 101C138). A history of COVID-19 before vaccination was protective (040, 029C054). INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths were uncommon 14 days or more after the first vaccine dose in this national analysis in the context of a high background incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and with extensive social distancing measures in place. Sociodemographic and clinical features known to increase the risk of severe disease in unvaccinated populations were also associated with severe outcomes in people receiving their first dose of vaccine and could help inform case management and future vaccine policy formulation.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Serum (n = 96) and plasma (n = 96) samples from patients with COVID-19 (acute, severe and fatal illness) from two independent hospitals in China were analyzed by LC-MS. Samples from healthy volunteers and from patients with pneumonia caused by other viruses (i.e. negative RT-PCR for COVID-19) were used as controls. Seven different ML-based models were built: PLS-DA, ANNDA, XGBoostDA, SIMCA, SVM, LREG and KNN. RESULTS: The PLS-DA model presented the best performance for both datasets, with accuracy rates to predict the diagnosis, severity and fatality of COVID-19 of 93%, 94% and 97%, respectively. Low levels of the metabolites ribothymidine, 4-hydroxyphenylacetoylcarnitine and uridine were associated with COVID-19 positivity, whereas high levels of N-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate, cysteinylglycine, methyl isobutyrate, l-ornithine and 5,6-dihydro-5-methyluracil were significantly related to greater severity and fatality from COVID-19.

Most recent decades have seen exponential increases in nearly all environments, including rural/remote areas and lower atmospheric regions. Because of unique physiologies, some species of flora and fauna are sensitive to exogenous EMF in ways that may surpass human reactivity. There is limited, but comprehensive, baseline data in the U.S. from the 1980s against which to compare significant new surveys from different countries. This now provides broader and more precise data on potential transient and chronic exposures to wildlife and habitats. Biological effects have been seen broadly across all taxa and frequencies at vanishingly low intensities comparable to today's ambient exposures. Broad wildlife effects have been seen on orientation and migration, food finding, reproduction, mating, nest and den building, territorial maintenance and defense, and longevity and survivorship. Cyto- and geno-toxic effects have been observed. The above issues are explored in three consecutive parts: Part 1 questions today's ambient EMF capabilities to adversely affect wildlife, with more urgency regarding 5G technologies. Part 2 explores natural and man-made fields, animal magnetoreception mechanisms, and pertinent studies to all wildlife kingdoms. Part 3 examines current exposure standards, applicable laws, and future directions. It is time to recognize ambient EMF as a novel form of pollution and develop rules at regulatory agencies that designate air as 'habitat' so EMF can be regulated like other pollutants. Wildlife loss is often unseen and undocumented until tipping points are reached. Long-term chronic low-level EMF exposure standards, which do not now exist, should be set accordingly for wildlife, and environmental laws should be strictly enforced.","output":"Effects of non-ionizing electromagnetic fields on flora and fauna, part 1.

We review the development of HIV/AIDS surveillance and its multiple data sources to monitor the dynamics of HIV/AIDS in China. The surveillance system for HIV/AIDS in China was initiated in 1986. It has evolved in three stages: (1) passive surveillance, (2) HIV sentinel surveillance with coexisting active surveillance and passive surveillance, and (3) comprehensive surveillance. In parallel with the evolution of the surveillance system itself, the HIV epidemic in China has gone through increasing stages of complexity, through an Introduction Phase, a Spreading Phase, and a Rapidy Spreading Phase. More reliable data from improved surveillance suggest that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is expanding in China. HIV infections among 2005 estimates remain concentrated among injection drug users (IDUs), those buying and selling sex, and men who have sex with men. Better HIV/AIDS surveillance synthesizes multiple data sources to provide a more accurate picture of the dynamics of specific HIV/AIDS circumstances in different areas of China. Improved surveillance is meaningful insofar as data are used to implement more effective HIV prevention programs in China.

Many existing methods only use the historical time series information for prediction, which ignores the effect of spatial correlations of neighboring regions and temporal correlations of different time periods. Mining spatiotemporal information for risk prediction is a significant and challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end spatiotemporal deep neural network structure for influenza risk prediction. The proposed model mainly consists of two parts. The first stage is the spatiotemporal feature extraction stage where two-stream convolutional and recurrent neural networks are constructed to extract the different regions and time granularity information. Then, a dynamically parametric-based fusion method is adopted to integrate the two-stream features and making predictions. In our work, we demonstrate that our method, tested on two influenza-like illness (ILI) datasets (US-HHS and SZ-HIC), achieved the best performance across all evaluation metrics.

Demographic data, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and based on the clinical classification of severity, patients were divided into groups 1 (mild) and 2 (severe/critical). A semiquantitative visual score was used to estimate the lesion extent. A three-dimensional slicer was used to precisely quantify the volume and CT value of the lung and lesions. Correlation coefficients of the quantitative CT parameters, semiquantitative visual score, and clinical classification were calculated using Spearman's correlation. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to compare the accuracies of quantitative and semi-quantitative methods. RESULTS There were 59 patients in group 1 and 128 patients in group 2. The mean age and sex distribution of the two groups were not significantly different. The lesions were primarily located in the subpleural area.

Currently, there are only limited studies focusing on a long-term effect of HBCT, which means it is essential to do more research in this study field. AIM: This study aimed at investigating a 1-year effect of a randomized controlled study using Cardiac Rehabilitation through the Global Position System (CR-GPS) compared to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. Study focused on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with coronary heart disease (CAD). DESIGN: A long-term follow-up of a randomized study. SETTING: Patients were enrolled, and the intervention was performed in an outpatient or homebased model. The results were obtained and evaluated in a hospital. POPULATION: Patients who participated in the CR-GPS study were diagnosed with CAD with low to moderate cardiovascular risk. METHODS: Patients enrolled in the study were eligible participants who had previously completed a 12-week HBCT program using a wrist heart rate (HR) monitor or attended a traditional CBCR. Primary outcome was the change in CRF expressed in peak oxygen uptake (pVO2), and the secondary outcomes were self-reported HRQL, objectively measured anthropometric characteristics, and mortality and hospitalization rates. RESULTS: 44 patients (76%) completed the long-term follow-up. The average peak of pVO2 was higher after 1-year follow-up in the telerehabilitation group (HBCT 25.5 ml / kg / min compared to the active control group CBCR 23.6 ml / kg / min p = 0.047). No statistically significant difference between the two groups was found after long-term follow-up for the parameter HRQL.

METHODS: a record-based study was carried out using the test-negative design from October 2018 to September 2019 to calculate the influenza VE. HCWs with influenza like illness (ILI) were screened to detect the positive cases, and the vaccination status was determined based on vaccination database. VE was assessed from the ratio of the odds of vaccination among positive cases to the odds of vaccination among negative controls. Statistical analysis Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted VE. RESULTS: a total of 556 HCWs presented with ILI, 65.6% were females, and 54.1% were nurses, 152 HCWs (27.3%) had laboratory-confirmed influenza, shows two peaks in January and March 2019. VE for all types was 35.0% and rose to 42.0% after adjustment for HCWs age, gender, nationality, and job position, influenza A (H3N2) VE was 78.0%. H1N1 VE was 55.0% but no significant VE for type B was found. CONCLUSION: Our VE estimates are in agreement with VE estimates published for that season. The use of quadrivalent vaccine with two stains of influenza B is recommended.","output":"Seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness among health-care workers in Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, KSA, 2018-2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is necessary to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the test reagents and assay platforms are varied and may not be sufficiently robust to diagnose COVID-19. METHODS: We reviewed 85 studies (21 530 patients), published from five regions of the world, to highlight issues involved in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the early phase of the pandemic. All relevant articles, published up to 31 May 2020, in PubMed, BioRiXv, MedRiXv and Google Scholar, were included. We evaluated the qualitative (9749 patients) and quantitative (10 355 patients) performance of RT-PCR and serologic diagnostic tests for real-world samples, and assessed the concordance (5538 patients) between test performance in meta-analyses. Synthesis of results was done using random effects modelling and bias was evaluated according to QUADAS-2 guidelines. RESULTS: The RT-PCR tests exhibited heterogeneity in the primers and reagents used. Of 1957 positive RT-PCR COVID-19 participants, 1585 had positive serum antibody (IgMIgG) tests (sensitivity 0.81, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.90). While 3509 of 3581 participants RT-PCR negative for COVID-19 were found negative by serology testing (specificity 0.98, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.99). The chemiluminescent immunoassay exhibited the highest sensitivity, followed by ELISA and lateral flow immunoassays. Serology tests had higher sensitivity and specificity for laboratory approval than for real-world reporting data. DISCUSSION: The robustness of the assays/platforms is influenced by variability in sampling and reagents. Serological testing complements and may minimise false negative RT-PCR results. Lack of standardised assay protocols in the early phase of pandemic might have contributed to the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Meta-analysis of the robustness of COVID-19 diagnostic kit performance during the early pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the years, probably also because his extensive experience as a rower, John had steered the journal over troubled waters generated by international controversies on infectious disease management and priorities.

However, in many real-world situations, disruptions cannot be adequately measured in advance. Moreover, using disruptions in the designing phase through the common two-stage stochastic programming models impose high costs on the network, since they cannot be updated based on unpredicted disruptions. This paper proposes an updatable two-phase approach which deals with disruptions in the operational phase, not in the strategic design phase. In the first step, called the proactive phase, a nominal platelet supply chain network is designed under operational uncertainty, using the whole-blood collection method. In the event of disruptions, the second step, called the reactive phase, is applied, and the tailored network is updated based on the realized data, using apheresis as the collection mechanism. The operational risks are captured using a fuzzy programming approach in the model. Based on the real data from Fars province of Iran, we compare the performance of the two-phase approach with the commonly used approaches in the literature, resulting in more flexible decisions, and consequently, less conservatism degree rather than the existing approaches.","output":"A reactive phase against disruptions for designing a proactive platelet supply network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a linear model of infection probability, and prove that this is a good approximation to a more refined model in which we assume infections come from a series of independent risks.

Our study included all patients on dialysis recorded in the French REIN Registry in April 2020. Clinical characteristics at last follow-up and the evolution of COVID-19 illness severity over time were recorded for diagnosed cases (either suspicious clinical symptoms, characteristic signs on the chest scan or a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 1,621 infected patients were reported on the REIN registry from March 16th, 2020 to May 4th, 2020. Of these, 344 died. The prevalence of COVID-19 patients varied from less than 1% to 10% between regions. The probability of being a case was higher in males, patients with diabetes, those in need of assistance for transfer or treated at a self-care unit. Dialysis at home was associated with a lower probability of being infected as was being a smoker, a former smoker, having an active malignancy, or peripheral vascular disease. Mortality in diagnosed cases (21%) was associated with the same causes as in the general population. Higher age, hypoalbuminemia and the presence of an ischemic heart disease were statistically independently associated with a higher risk of death. Being treated at a selfcare unit was associated with a lower risk. Thus, our study showed a relatively low frequency of COVID-19 among dialysis patients contrary to what might have been assumed.","output":"Low incidence of SARS-CoV-2, risk factors of mortality and the course of illness in the French national cohort of dialysis patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diphtheria is a respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae.

This work presents comparisons and valorization of vermicomposts (VCs) and composts (Cs) prepared from various biowastes generated in households and private gardens, in terms of their practical use. The tested VCs and Cs were subjected to chemical analyses to assess the amounts of macro- (N, P, K, S, Mg, Ca, Na) and micronutrients (Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Ni), as well as contents of organic matter (OM), total organic carbon (TOC), humic compounds (HS) and labile and water extractable organic carbon (LC, WEOC). Moreover, humification indexes (HR, HI, DP) were determined. The amounts of macro- and micronutrients, OM, TOC, LC, WEOC were greater for vermicomposts. Regardless of these differences, both vermicomposts and composts were characterized by considerable amounts of organic matter ranging from 325 to 631 gkg?1 and TOC amounting from 82 to 270 gkg?1. Moreover, the tested organic fertilizers were characterized by high contents of N (7C21.5 gkg?1), K (3.7C24.4 gkg?1), Ca (12.2C44.0 gkg?1), Fe (133.1C333.8 mgkg?1) and Mn (71.5C113.8 mgkg?1). The analyzed VCs and Cs did not exceed the permissible amounts of heavy metals (Cr, Pb) and contained a comparable amount and quality of humus compounds. The level of CHS ranged from 29.6 to 41 gkg?1 for vermicomposts, and from 19.8 to 51.8 gkg?1 for composts. The humification indexes indicate that VCs and Cs were wellCmatured despite different composting conditions. The HI values for VCs ranged from 8.3% to 10% and for Cs amounted from 12.2% to 16.8%. Similarly, the HR values were higher for composts (24.3C33%) in comparison to VCs (15.2C20.1%). Vermicomposting and composting of biowaste is economically and environmentally justified.

Records and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) of patients who had undergone isolated bilateral sagittal split osteotomy setback between January 1, 2013 and March 16, 2020 at a single institution were reviewed retrospectively. The primary outcome variable was upper airway volume dimension change, and the predictor variable was the magnitude of mandibular setback as measured by six different methods. Thirty-one patients were included in the study, with a mean mandibular setback ranging from 1.41 mm to 6.11 mm. None of the predictor variables showed an association with oropharyngeal (P = 0.54) or hypopharyngeal (P = 0.33) volume. Stepwise regression analysis failed to show any significant relationships. Similarly, there was no statistically significant association between any of the predictor variables and oropharyngeal (P = 0.44) or hypopharyngeal (P = 0.74) minimum axial area. The results showed that no correlation exists between the magnitude of mandibular setback and the amount of static airway dimensional changes; therefore, it may not be possible to predict whether obstructive sleep apnea will develop following mild to moderate mandibular setback based upon CBCT measurements.","output":"Are we able to predict airway dimensional changes in isolated mandibular setback?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: When reopening universities in times of COVID-19, students still have to adhere to COVID-19 behavioral guidelines.

It has also been demonstrated that multiple subsets of dendritic cells (DC), including DC-SIGN(+) cells, become significantly depleted in the blood and lymphoid tissues of AIDS patients, which may contribute to the failure in initiating effective host immune responses. The mechanism for DC depletion, however, is unclear. It is also known that vast quantities of viral envelope protein gp120 are shed from maturing HIV-1 virions and form circulating immune complexes in the serum of HIV-1-infected individuals, but the pathological role of gp120 in HIV-1 pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a previously unrecognized mechanism of DC death in chronic HIV-1 infection, in which ligation of DC-SIGN by gp120 sensitizes DC to undergo accelerated apoptosis in response to a variety of activation stimuli. The cultured monocyte-derived DC and also freshly-isolated DC-SIGN(+) blood DC that were exposed to either cross-linked recombinant gp120 or immune-complex gp120 in HIV(+) serum underwent considerable apoptosis after CD40 ligation or exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1. Furthermore, circulating DC-SIGN(+) DC that were isolated directly from HIV-1(+) individuals had actually been pre-sensitized by serum gp120 for activation-induced exorbitant apoptosis. In all cases the DC apoptosis was substantially inhibited by DC-SIGN blockade. Finally, we showed that accelerated DC apoptosis was a direct consequence of excessive activation of the pro-apoptotic molecule ASK-1 and transfection of siRNA against ASK-1 significantly prevented the activation-induced excessive DC death. Our study discloses a previously unknown mechanism of immune modulation by envelope protein gp120, provides new insights into HIV immunopathogenesis, and suggests potential therapeutic approaches to prevent DC depletion in chronic HIV infection.","output":"Binding of HIV-1 gp120 to DC-SIGN Promotes ASK-1-Dependent Activation-Induced Apoptosis of Human Dendritic Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many countries have taken non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and push the recovery of national economie","output":"The Effect of Control Measures on COVID-19 Transmission and Work Resumption: International Evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: To highlight the current challenges in diagnosis and clinical care of pediatric rheumatic disease and barriers to research and education of pediatric rheumatologists worldwide. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies and reports demonstrate a paucity of studies on epidemiology, outcomes, and management guidelines from many regions of the world. There have been noteworthy efforts to bridge the gap in under resourced areas. An analysis of the global burden of rheumatic disease has demonstrated that while understudied, musculoskeletal diseases are prevalent and increasingly contribute to loss of years of healthy life. In juvenile idiopathic arthritis, two milestone publications in global pediatric rheumatology have recently been published. An international study evaluated the epidemiology, treatment, and outcomes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and demonstrated global diversity in both clinical manifestations and outcomes. Notably, the first guidelines for managing pediatric rheumatic disease in a less resourced setting have been published for juvenile idiopathic arthritis. This document offers the first publication targeted to address challenges faced by pediatric rheumatology caregivers in low-resourced settings. These documents serve as exemplars for international collaboration in pediatric rheumatology and can be used as models for other pediatric rheumatic disease research. Other efforts are making progress in various arenas towards increasing access to care, education, and training in pediatric rheumatology. SUMMARY: The global burden of rheumatic disease in the pediatric population is poorly understood but unrecognized disease greatly impacts the overall morbidity and mortality in this population.

In BM, CYP1B1-mediated metabolism of 7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) suppresses HSPC colony formation within 6 h, whereas benzo(a)pyrene (BP) generates protective cytokines. MSC, enriched from adherent BM cells, yielded the bone marrow stromal, BMS2, cell line. These cells express elevated basal CYP1B1 that scarcely responds to Ah receptor (AhR) inducers. BMS2 cells exhibit extensive transcriptome overlap with leptin receptor positive mesenchymal stem cells (Lepr+ MSC) that control the hematopoietic niche. The overlap includes CYP1B1 and the expression of HSPC regulatory factors (Ebf3, Cxcl12, Kitl, Csf1 and Gas6). MSC are large, adherent fibroblasts that sequester small HSPC and macrophage in the BM niche (Graphic abstract). High basal CYP1B1 expression in BMS2 cells derives from interactions between the Ah-receptor enhancer and proximal promoter SP1 complexes, boosted by autocrine signaling. PAH effects on BMS2 cells model Lepr+MSC niche activity. CYP1B1 metabolizes DMBA to PAHDE, producing p53-mediated mRNA increases, long after the in vivo HSPC suppression. Faster, direct p53 effects, favored by stem cells, remain possible PAHDE targets. However, HSPC regulatory factors remained unresponsive. BP is less toxic in BMS2 cells, but, in BM, CYP1A1 metabolism stimulates macrophage cytokines (Il1b > Tnfa> Ifng) within 6 h.

Conclusions The study showed that in patients with CVDs treated with various drugs the CoQ10 plasma level is statistically significantly lower than in practically healthy individuals. So, to avoid the adverse reactions connected with low CoQ10 plasma levels, it is recommended to adjust the therapy to maintain its constant level.","output":"The particulars of certain drugs' effect on the endogenous coenzyme Q10 plasma level in patients with cardiovascular diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic restrictions on the change in muscle mass in older patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), who were not infected with COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, data were obtained from outpatients who underwent bioelectrical impedance analysis at least twice before April 2020 and at least once thereafter. Skeletal muscle mass index (SMI, kg/m(2)) was calculated as appendicular muscle mass (kg) divided by height squared (m(2)). Change in SMI (kg/m(2)/year) was calculated as (follow-up SMIbaseline SMI/follow-up period). The differences between the changes in SMI before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated using paired t test. Results: This study recruited 56 patients, with a mean (SD) age of 75.2 (7.1) years. SMI changed from 6.7 (0.9) to 6.8 (0.9) kg/m(2) before the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas SMI changed from 6.8 (0.9) to 6.6 (0.9) kg/m(2) after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. SMI decreased after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with before the pandemic (?0.117 (0.240) vs. 0.005 (0.289) kg/m(2)/year, p = 0.049).

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper was to examine the applicability of the classical hierarchy of hazard control technologies in resource-constrained health care settings. METHODS: Using a biologic and chemical hazard example, the hazard control hierarchy was applied for risk mitigation. FINDINGS: Even when resource constraints force a reordered selection of hazard control elements, risk reduction can be achieved across a variety of hazard classes. CONCLUSION: For LMICs with limited resources, the hazard control hierarchy can be effectively employed, although the selection of methods may be reordered, to achieve significant hazard control.

In total 25 O-glycosites were identified, with similar patterns in the two ectodomains of different cell origin, and a distinct pattern of the monomeric RBD. Strikingly, 16 out of 25 O-glycosites were located within three amino acids from known N-glycosites. However, O-glycosylation was primarily found on peptides that were unoccupied by N-glycans, and otherwise had low overall occupancy.

The purpose of this paper is to characterise growth and metabolic performance of BSF larvae on substrate moisture contents from 45 to 85%. Larvae developed into prepupae only at 45-75% substrate moisture content. Within this interval, the maximal specific growth rate was highest (0.73 day-1), the growth period shortest (13 days), and the maximal dry weight lowest (88 mg) at 45% moisture content. Differences in cost of growth and maintenance were not observed at the different substrate moisture contents, and differences in larval performance were likely associated to differences in co-occurring microbial activities. As much as 22% of the substrate carbon was emitted as CO2 at 45% moisture content by microorganisms, measured as the difference between total respiration and larval respiration, whereas microbial CO2 production amounted to only 3% of the substrate carbon at 75% moisture content. As consequence of the high specific growth rate and short growth phase, the overall net growth efficiency was higher at 45% moisture content (0.62) than at 75% moisture content (0.52). Overall, the metabolic performance of the BSF larvae was insensitive to differences in substrate moisture content.

In this modeling exercise, we extracted the number of daily reported cases of COVID-19 in Okinawa from October 1 to November 30, 2020, and explored possible scenarios for decreasing COVID-19 incidence by combining population-wide screening and/or social distancing policy. We reveal that permanent lockdown can be theoretically replaced by mass testing but sufficient target population at an adequate frequency must be mobilized. In addition, solely imposing a circuit breaker will not bring a favorable outcome in the long run, and mass testing presents implications for minimizing a period of lockdown. Our results highlight the importance of incentivizing citizens to join the frequent testing and ensure their appropriate isolation. This study also suggests that early containment of COVID-19 will be feasible in prefectures where the mobility is low and/or can be easily controlled for its geographic characteristics.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A single-center retrospective study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 1 through August 31, 2020 to evaluate whether outpatient insulin use, HbA1c, glucose on admission, or average glucose during admission was associated with intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation (ventilator) requirement, or mortality. RESULTS: Among 111 patients with DM, 48 (43.2%) were on outpatient insulin and the average HbA1c was 8.1% (65 mmol/mol). The average glucose on admission was 187.0102.94 mg/dL and the average glucose during hospitalization was 173.439.8 mg/dL. Use of outpatient insulin, level of HbA1c, glucose on admission, or average glucose during hospitalization was not associated with ICU admission, ventilator requirement, or mortality among patients with COVID-19 and DM.

Full AKI diagnosis according to KDIGO criteria can result in delayed interventions at admission in ICU, giving potential benefits to alternatives in early diagnosis. Cruz and NEFROINT research group described a scale for prediction of severe AKI, based on risk factors and establishing creatinine cuts as markers of kidney distress.(1) Our aim is to describe the predictive capacity of small changes in serum creatinine correlating with clinical risk factors in adult critical care patients. (1). Clin J Am Soc Nephrol (2014) 9, 663-672. METHOD: We retrospectively selected from our Critical Care Nephrology database adult patients admitted in any of our hospital\`s ICU between February to August 2020, excluding those at admission with diagnosis of AKI, serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dl, or those receiving dialysis (acute or chronic) or kidney transplantation. We defined AKI according to KDIGO criteria. We calculated Cruz et al scale of prediction of severe AKI. The minimally acceptable criteria for this test was a sensitivity of 95%. A point estimate and confidence intervals of sensitivity and specificity were derived from a contingency table. RESULTS: From 1204 new ICU patients, according to selection criteria we found 372 patients (women 40.3%), with mean age of 60.9 years (range 18-98), mainly hospitalized for medical conditions. Mean values of APACHE II was 22.9. Hemodynamic support was required in 41.1% of patients and mechanical ventilation in 58.6% of patients. (Table 1). AKI KDIGO 2-3 was diagnosed in 65 (26.8%) of patients. Creatinine at admission was statistically different in patients that developed AKI (CI 0.95 -0.51 - 0.15 mg/dl, p=0.0004). Requirement of hemodynamic (p = 0.003) and ventilatory support (p = 0.009), sepsis (p = 0.003), and diagnosis of COVID-19 (p = 0.03) were more frequent in patients who developed AKI. Clinical risk for severe AKI was present in 356 patients (95.7%): 66,5% at very high risk, 9,8% at high risk and 19,2% at moderate risk. Patients without risk criteria were classified as low risk (4,3%). In patients with risk factors for AKI, and a significative increase in creatinine adjusted to risks, diagnostic performance for predicting diagnosis of KDIGO 2-3 AKI had a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 89% (CI95% 79 C 95%), 58% (CI95% 52 C 64%), 0.31 (CI95% 0.25 C 0.39) and 0.96 (CI95% 0.92 C 0.98) respectively (Figure). Renal replacement therapy was required in 39 (60%) of patients with severe AKI (incidence 10.5%).

We used linked national health records (demographic, death certificate, admissions and PCR testing data) to calculate rates of COVID-19 infection and death up to 31 July 2020. Our primary definition of COVID-19-related death was mention of COVID-19 on the death certificate. General population data from Public Health England and the Office for National Statistics were used for comparison. We also describe COVID-19-related hospital admissions and all-cause deaths. RESULTS: We identified a cohort of 168 680 people with RAIRD, of whom 1874 (1.11%) had a positive COVID-19 PCR test. The age-standardised infection rate was 1.54 (95% CI 1.50C1.59) times higher than in the general population. 713 (0.42%) people with RAIRD died with COVID-19 on their death certificate and the age-sex-standardised mortality rate for COVID-19-related death was 2.41 (2.30C2.53) times higher than in the general population. There was no evidence of an increase in deaths from other causes in the RAIRD population.

The loss of islets is due to the hypoxic conditions islets experience during revascularization, resulting in apoptosis. Therefore, to reduce the therapeutic dosage required to achieve normoglycemia, pre-vascularization of the subcutaneous space has been pursued. In this study, we highlight a biomaterial-based approach using a methacrylic acid copolymer coating to generate a robust pre-vascularized subcutaneous cavity for islet transplantation. We also devised a simple, but not-trivial, procedure for filling the cavity with an islet suspension in collagen. We show that the pre-vascularized site can support a marginal mass of islets to rapidly return streptozotocin-induced diabetic SCID/bg mice to normoglycemia. Furthermore, immunocompetent Sprague Daley rats remained normoglycemia for up to 70 days until they experienced graft destabilization as they outgrew their implants. This work highlights methacrylic acid-based biomaterials as a suitable pre-vascularization strategy for the subcutaneous space that is scalable and doesnt require exogenous cells or growth factors. Summary In this study methacrylic acid copolymer coated tubes generated a robust vascular response in the subcutaneous space, which was critical to support islet transplantation in a streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model. More importantly, the subcutaneous pre-vascularization approach using this copolymer coating was scalable into a larger allogeneic rat model and returned animals to normoglycemia for up to 70 days.

However, of these four countries, only Ethiopia has introduced human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination at the national level in 2018 and India in a few states in 2016. Our study objective was to estimate the potential health impact of HPV vaccination among ten cohorts of 9-year-old girls from 2021-2030 in Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan using two independent mathematical models, and assess similarities and differences in vaccine impact projections through comparative modelling analysis. Methods: Using two widely published models (Harvard and PRIME) to estimate HPV vaccination impact, we simulated a vaccination scenario of 90% annual coverage among 9-year-old girls from 2021-2030 in Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan. We estimated the potential health impact in terms of cervical cancer cases, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted among vaccinated cohorts from the time of vaccination until 2100. We also conducted a comparative modelling analysis to understand the differences in vaccine impact estimates generated by the two models. Results: Prior to harmonising model assumptions, the range between the PRIME model and the Harvard model for the potential health impact of HPV vaccination in terms of the number of cervical cancer cases averted among girls vaccinated 2021-2030 between the year of vaccination and 2100 was: 262,000 to 270,000 in Ethiopia; 1,640,000 to 1,970,000 in India; 330,000 to 336,000 in Nigeria; and 111,000 to 133,000 in Pakistan. When harmonising model assumptions, alignment on HPV type distribution significantly narrowed the differences in vaccine impact estimates. Conclusions: The main difference in estimates for cases, deaths, and DALYs averted by vaccination between the models are due to variation in interpretation around data on cervical cancer attribution to HPV-16/18; differences in estimates for DALYs averted are additionally due to differences in age-specific remaining life expectancy over time between the two models. As countries make progress towards the World Health Organization targets for cervical cancer elimination, continued explorations of underlying differences in model inputs, assumptions, and results when examining cervical cancer prevention policy will be critical.","output":"Projections of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination impact in Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan: a comparative modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivos Monitorar o impacto da Pandemia de COVID-19 nas transfus?es no centro cirrgico, para gest?o de estoque de hemocomponentes e redefini??o de estoque de seguran?a.

This deadly virus is infecting people rapidly and has targeted 4.93 million people across the world, with 227 K people being infected only in Italy. Cases of nCOV are quickly increasing whereas the number of nCOV test kits available in hospitals are limited. Under these conditions, an automated system for the classification of patients into nCOV positive and negative cases, is a much needed tool against the pandemic, helping in a selective use of the limited number of test kits. In this research, Convolutional neural network-based models (one block VGG, two block VGG, three block VGG, four block VGG, LetNet-5, AlexNet, and Resnet-50) have been employed for the detection of Corona-virus and SARS_MERS infected patients, distinguishing them from the healthy subjects, using lung X-ray scans, which has proven to be a challenging task, due to overlapping characteristics of different corona virus types. Furthermore, LSTM model has been used for time series forecasting of nCOV cases, in the following 10 days, in Italy. The evaluation results obtained, proved that the VGG1 model distinguishes the three classes at an accuracy of almost 91%, as compared to other models, whereas the approach based on the LSTM predicts the number of nCOV cases with 99% accuracy.","output":"Evaluation of Deep learning approaches for Identification of different Corona-Virus species and time series prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The next chapter of the robotics revolution is well underway with the deployment of robots for a broad range of commercial use cases.

In vivo results and complementary molecular modelling presented in this communication indicate bisartans may be beneficial for the treatment of not only heart disease, diabetes, renal dysfunction, and related illnesses, but possibly COVID-19. Bisartans are novel bis-alkylated imidazole sartan derivatives bearing dual symmetric anionic biphenyl tetrazole moieties. In silico docking and molecular dynamics studies revealed bisartans exhibited higher binding affinities for the ACE2/spike protein complex (PDB 6LZG) compared to all other known sartans. They also underwent stable docking to the Zn2(+) domain of the ACE2 catalytic site as well as the critical interfacial region between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain. Additionally, semi-stable docking of bisartans at the arginine-rich furin-cleavage site of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (residues 681-686) required for virus entry into host cells, suggest bisartans may inhibit furin action thereby retarding viral entry into host cells. Bisartan tetrazole groups surpass nitrile, the pharmacophoric warhead of PF-07321332, in its ability to disrupt the Cysteine Charge Relay System of 3CLpro.

FACESEC evaluation is performed along four dimensions of adversarial modeling: the nature of perturbation (e.g., pixel-level or face accessories), the attacker's system knowledge (about training data and learning architecture), goals (dodging or impersonation), and capability (tailored to individual inputs or across sets of these). We use FACESEC to study five face recognition systems in both closed-set and open-set settings, and to evaluate the state-of-the-art approach for defending against physically realizable attacks on these. We find that accurate knowledge of neural architecture is significantly more important than knowledge of the training data in black-box attacks. Moreover, we observe that open-set face recognition systems are more vulnerable than closed-set systems under different types of attacks. The efficacy of attacks for other threat model variations, however, appears highly dependent on both the nature of perturbation and the neural network architecture. For example, attacks that involve adversarial face masks are usually more potent, even against adversarially trained models, and the ArcFace architecture tends to be more robust than the others.","output":"FACESEC: A Fine-grained Robustness Evaluation Framework for Face Recognition Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: This study was aimed to investigate the knowledge and practice about COVID-19 among adults living in capital of Telangana, India.

Graduates of the 2020 spring semester were mostly concerned as they had to graduate under extraordinary conditions. Moreover, the new graduate physiotherapists are expected to be much more concerned as they also have a risk of close contact with patients with COVID-19 when they are employed. However, their concerns about treating COVID-19 patients have not been assessed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the attitudes of physiotherapists, who graduated in the spring semester of 2020, toward the patients with COVID-19. Material and Methods: Physiotherapists who graduated in spring 2020 from different universities across Turkey were included in the study. Participants were contacted via telecommunication groups. A questionnaire was developed specifically for this study and its digital form was prepared via Google Forms. The questionnaire consists of 7 questions that assess participants concerns about COVID-19 and their attitudes toward these patients. Results: A total of 150 new graduate physiotherapists from 10 universities were included. Twenty percent of the participants were male. The mean age of the participants was 22.7  1.43 years. Forty-three percent of the participants have moderate knowledge of how to approach COVID-19 patients. In addition, 38.7% of the physiotherapists were found to have a moderate level of self-confidence in treating COVID-19 patients and 46.7% of the participants stated that they have little knowledge about the treatment. Conclusion: This study showed that most of the new graduate physiotherapists feel that they do not have enough knowledge about how to approach those with COVID-19 and would avoid treating them. This result would be a consequence of the novelty of the virus and, thus, the lack of education about its treatment.

Although clinical trials of biomarker-led drug therapies have delivered significant recent advances, there remains a need to understand the clinical utility of genomic profiling of cancer as a means to match patients with recurrent or metastatic salivary gland cancer to clinical trial therapies. In total, 209 patients with salivary gland cancers were profiled with 24 gene (n = 209)) and >325 gene (n = 32) DNA-based next-generation sequencing panels. A retrospective systematic evaluation was performed to identify the frequency of available matched drug therapies within clinical trials based on the results. The matches were then stratified based upon the level of evidence supporting the drug-biomarker combination being investigated using the ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of Molecular Targets (ESCAT) to determine the strength of the clinical rationale for each gene-drug match identified. DNA-based next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis was successful in 175/209 (84%) patients with salivary gland cancer. Using the 24-gene NGS panel, actionable alterations were identified in 27% (48/175) patients. Alterations were most frequent in salivary duct carcinoma (88%) characterized by TP53 and/or PIK3CA mutations, with matched trials available for 63% (10/16). In ACC, biomarker-matched trials were available for 7% (8/115), and no genomic alterations were found in 96/115 (83%) of ACC patients. TP53 was the most frequently altered gene across all subtypes; however, there were no trials recruiting based on TP53 status. In 32 ACC patients with no genomic alterations using the 24-gene panel, a broader (>325 gene) panel identified alterations in 87% (27/32) of cases with biomarker-matched trials available in 40% (13/32) cases. This study identified that genomic profiling using focused (24-gene) NGS panels has potential utility in matching to trial therapies for most patients with non-ACC salivary gland cancer.

METHODS A retrospective cohort study was used consisting of all pregnant women who delivered between 01 January 2013 and 31 December 2018, using administrative health datasets. Outcomes were defined as receipt of influenza or pertussis vaccination in any one of the relevant data sources (National Immunisation Register, Proclaims, or Pharmaceutical collection) during their eligible pregnancy. Ethnicity was prioritised as Mori (NZ indigenous), Pacific, Asian, and Other or NZ European and deprivation was defined using New Zealand Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). RESULTS Between 2013 and 2018, Asian women had the highest maternal vaccination coverage (36%) for pertussis, while Mori and Pacific women had the lowest, 13% and 15% respectively. Coverage of pertussis vaccination during pregnancy in low deprivation Mori women was 24% and 28% in Pacific women. This is in comparison to 30% and 25% in high deprivation Asian and European/Other women, respectively. Similar trends were seen for influenza. CONCLUSION Between 2013 and 2018 maternal vaccination coverage increased for pertussis and influenza.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are newer US FDA-approved alternatives to warfarin and include dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban. The efficacy of DOACs is heavily researched, but few studies have evaluated their bleeding risk. OBJECTIVES This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates which DOAC has the lowest bleeding risk in elderly patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). METHODS CINAHL and MEDLINE databases were searched using specific keywords, and 244 results were identified and screened. Inclusion criteria required a major bleeding event requiring hospitalization as an outcome and excluded patients with severe renal failure. Articles that met inclusion criteria were assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane Tool to Assess Risk of Bias in Cohort Studies. Review Manager (version 5) was used to perform the random-effects model meta-analysis. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Six articles met inclusion criteria and encompassed 446,042 patients in total. Apixaban and dabigatran had statistically significant risk reductions compared with warfarin, whereas rivaroxaban did not (HR 0.60 [95% CI 0.52-0.69], p < 0.00001; HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.70-0.90], p = 0.0005; HR 1.03 [95% CI 0.86-1.22], p = 0.77, respectively.) Data regarding edoxaban were limited and thus not included in the analysis. CONCLUSION Apixaban and dabigatran have a significantly decreased major bleeding risk (40 and 21%, respectively) compared with warfarin.

We evaluated whether continuation versus discontinuation of RAASi were associated with short term clinical or biochemical outcomes. METHODS: The RAAS-COVID-19 trial was a randomized, open label study in adult patients previously treated with RAASi who are hospitalized with COVID-19 (NCT04508985). Participants were randomized 1:1 to discontinue or continue RAASi. The primary outcome was a global rank score calculated from baseline to day 7 (or discharge) incorporating clinical events and biomarker changes. Global rank scores were compared between groups using the Wilcoxon test statistic and the negative binomial test (using incident rate ratio [IRR]) and the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: Overall, 46 participants were enrolled; 21 participants were randomized to discontinue RAASi and 25 to continue. Patients mean age was 71.5 years and 43.5% were female. Discontinuation of RAASi, versus continuation, resulted in a non-statistically different mean global rank score (discontinuation 6 [standard deviation [SD] 6.3] vs continuation 3.8 (SD 2.5); p= 0.60). The negative binomial analysis identified that discontinuation increased the risk of adverse outcomes (IRR 1.67 [95% CI 1.06 to 2.62]; p=0.027); RAASi discontinuation increased brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels (% change from baseline: +16.7% vs. -27.5%; p= 0.024) and the incidence of acute heart failure (33% vs. 4.2%, p=0.016). CONCLUSION: RAASi continuation in participants hospitalized with COVID-19 appears safe; discontinuation increased BNP levels and may increase risk of acute heart failure; where possible, RAASi should be continued.","output":"A Randomized Controlled Trial of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitor Management in Patients Admitted in Hospital with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The molecular electronic density theory (MEDT) was invested to elucidate the chemo-, regio- and stereo-selectivity of the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between Diazomethane (DZM) and Psilostachyin (PSH).

We conducted individual-participant-data (IPD) meta-analyses to compare S-1/cisplatin versus other third-generation anti-cancer medications plus cisplatin regimens with the goal of determining whether or not S-1/cisplatin was the ideal choice for treatment accompanied by radiotherapy (RT). METHODS A thorough search was performed using multiple electronic databases. We integrated the IPD of each trial and analyzed the resulting meta-database. The primary endpoint was the overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints included the progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), toxicities, and treatment delivery. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on baseline characteristics. Statistical analyses were stratified by trials. RESULTS Three randomized control trials (WJOG5008L study, SPECTRA study, and TORG1018 study) were found. Of the 316 patients enrolled in those studies, 159 received S-1/cisplatin (SP), and 157 were assigned to other combination chemotherapy. The median OS for the SP arm was 48.2 months, and that of the non-SP arm was 42.4 months. The combined hazard ratio (HR) for the OS was 0.895 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.638-1.256), and no heterogeneity was noted among the trials (test for heterogeneity, p = 0.87; I2 = 0). The median PFS for the SP and non-SP arms was 12.8 and 14.0 months, respectively. The corresponding HR for the PFS was 1.022 (95% CI 0.776-1.347), and there was evidence of moderate heterogeneity among the trials (test for heterogeneity, p = 0.16; I2 = 0.46). The ORRs were 69.7% (95% CI 62.1-76.7%) and 70.9% (95% CI 63.7-78.1%) in the SP and non-SP arms, respectively. The toxicity profile showed that SP caused significantly fewer instances of grade 3-4 leukopenia and neutropenia than non-SP regimens. CONCLUSION No marked differences were detected in the OS, PFS, or ORR between the SP and non-SP arms. SP had significantly less myelosuppression and better treatment compliance as a chemotherapy regimen for concurrent chemoradiation in locally advanced NSCLC than non-SP regimens.","output":"Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin + S-1 versus cisplatin + other third-generation agents for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis of individual participant data."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Past studies on altered taste function in individuals with type 1 diabetes have yielded inconsistent results. We therefore evaluated taste recognition and possible association with personal and diseases characteristics in young individuals with type 1 diabetes and healthy controls. Taste recognition and intensity for 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP), quinine, citric acid, sucrose, and sodium chloride were assessed using a filter paper method in 276 participants with type 1 diabetes and 147 healthy controls. Personal and clinical data were recorded for all participants during a baseline visit. Regression analysis was adjusted for sex, age, and standardized BMI. Overall, 47% of participants with type 1 diabetes vs. 63.5% of healthy controls recognized all tastes (p = 0.006). Moreover, a lower capacity for recognizing the bitter taste of PROP and the sour taste of citric acid was found in participants with type 1 diabetes compared to healthy controls (p = 0.014 and p = 0.003, respectively). While no significant effect of glycemic control on taste recognition was found, an association with lower age at onset emerged.

METHODS Temperature data between April 1995 and June 2008 were collected from 588 patients and analyzed in a retrospective cohort study by observers blinded to outcome. The time needed to achieve an esophageal temperature of less than 34C was recorded. Survival and neurological outcomes were determined within six months after cardiac arrest. RESULTS The median time from restoration of spontaneous circulation to reaching a temperature of less than 34C was 209 minutes (interquartile range [IQR]: 130-302) in patients with favorable neurological outcomes compared to 158 min (IQR: 101-230) (P < 0.01) in patients with unfavorable neurological outcomes. The adjusted odds ratio for a favorable neurological outcome with a longer time to target temperature was 1.86 (95% CI 1.03 to 3.38, P = 0.04).

This review assesses the current CT methods for obtaining bronchial wall parameters and their comparison between populations. METHODS A systematic review of MEDLINE and Embase was conducted following PRISMA guidelines (last search date 25th October 2021). Methodology data was collected and summarised. Values of percentage wall area (WA%), wall thickness (WT), summary airway measure (Pi10), and luminal area (Ai) were pooled and compared between populations. RESULTS A total of 169 articles were included for methodologic review; 66 of these were included for meta-analysis. Most measurements were obtained from multiplanar reconstructions of segmented airways (93 of 169 articles), using various tools and algorithms; third generation airways in the upper and lower lobes were most frequently studied. COPD (12,746) and smoking (15,092) populations were largest across studies and mostly consisted of men (median 64.4%, IQR 61.5 - 66.1%). There were significant differences between populations; the largest WA% was found in COPD (mean SD 62.93  7.41%, n = 6,045), and the asthma population had the largest Pi10 (4.03  0.27 mm, n = 442). Ai normalised to body surface area (Ai/BSA) (12.46  4 mm2, n = 134) was largest in the never-smoking population. CONCLUSIONS Studies on CT-derived bronchial parameter measurements are heterogenous in methodology and population, resulting in challenges to compare outcomes between studies. Significant differences between populations exist for several parameters, most notably in the wall area percentage; however, there is a large overlap in their ranges. KEY POINTS ? Diverse methodology in measuring airways contributes to overlap in ranges of bronchial parameters among the never-smoking, smoking, COPD, and asthma populations. ? The combined number of never-smoking participants in studies is low, limiting insight into this population and the impact of participant characteristics on bronchial parameters. ?

METHODS This cohort is located in Isfahan, Iran. The first phase was initiated in 2006 with 2523 participants (1275 males, 1248 females). The participants were selected using multi-stage cluster sampling from the general residents of Isfahan, Iran. The study had two phases (2006 and 2011) and its third stage is planned for 2020-2021. RESULTS The prevalence of thyroid function states was euthyroid (89.3%, 95% CI: 88%-90%), overt hypothyroidism (2.8%, 95% CI: 2%?3%), subclinical hypothyroidism (5.8%, 95% CI: 4%-6%), overt hyperthyroidism (0.8%, 95% CI: 0.4%?1%), and subclinical hyperthyroidism (0.99%, 95% CI: 0.6%-1%). Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism were significantly associated with goiter. The incidence of thyroid dysfunction was reported as follows: overt hypothyroidism (2.7, 95% CI: 1.6-3.7), subclinical hypothyroidism (20.6, 95% CI: 18-23), overt hyperthyroidism (1.9, 95% CI: 1-2.7) and subclinical hyperthyroidism (2.7, 95% CI: 1.6-3.7) per 1000 (person-year). CONCLUSION We assessed the prevalence and incidence of thyroid disorders in Isfahan in the first and second phase, respectively. We are conducting the third phase of the ITCS in order to study the associations between thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) level and environmental factors such as infection.","output":"Isfahan Thyroid Cohort Study (ITCS)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current Ebola virus outbreak has highlighted the uncertainties surrounding many aspects of Ebola virus virology, including routes of transmission.

The aim of this research is to study early psychological responses to the pandemic in the Spanish general population, focusing on gender differences. Methods: Nine to 14 days after the declaration of a state of emergency an online survey was conducted assessing sociodemographic, health, behavioral and COVID-19-related variables. Mental health status was evaluated by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Self-Care Scale (SCS). Results: The study included 3520 respondents: 2611 women and 909 men. Women scored significantly higher in DASS-21 and IES-R (p < 0.05) and were more likely to somatize, suffer from hypochondriasis, sleeping disturbances and claustrophobia (p < 0.05). Being a woman can be considered a risk factor for intrusive thoughts, avoidance mechanisms, stress and anxiety (Odd Ratio = 2.7/2.3/2.3/1.6). The risk of presenting posttraumatic symptoms and emotional distress was greater in women (Odd Ratio = 6.77/4.59). General linear models to predict IES-R and DASS-21 scores clarified which variables were gender specific, such as main concerns. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that at early stages of the pandemic, women mental health was more impacted and that both genders show different concerns.

Smartphone apps provide the opportunity to measure cognitive impairments in an accessible way; however, more research is needed to validate these cognitive assessments in schizophrenia. We assessed the initial accessibility, validity, and reliability of a smartphone-based cognitive test to measure cognition in schizophrenia. A total of 29 individuals with schizophrenia and 34 controls were included in the analyses. Participants completed the standard pen-and-paper Trail Making Tests (TMT) A and B, and smartphone-based versions, Jewels Trail Tests (JTT) A and B, at the single in-lab visit. Participants were asked to complete the JTT remotely once per week for three months. We also investigated how subjective sleep quality and mood may affect cognitive performance longitudinally. In-lab and remote JTT scores moderately and positively correlated with in-lab TMT scores. Moderate test-retest reliability was observed across the in-lab, first remote, and last remote completion times of the JTT. Additionally, individuals with schizophrenia had significantly lower performance compared to controls on both the in-lab JTT and TMT. Self-reported mood had a significant effect on JTT A performance over time but no other significant relationships were found remotely.

So, our daily life as well as social behavior is strongly influenced by social media or networks in urban areas. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, people are living online mostly. It is observed from various studies that depression, loneliness, monotonousness, etc., can be overcome easily at home through social media. Human beings never feel alone with good connectivity through social networking. Hence, it may be concluded that social media can stimulate people to be social, friendly, energetic, and also creative. Improvement of social behavior also depends on valuable vacation time and frequent traveling. Three different mental states, i.e., happy, normal or moderate, and depressed, can be easily detected through various exchanges of messages between close friends and the greater circle of friends. Even psychological behavior and various characteristics of people can also be identified through social media for the betterment of society and people.

Given a text of length n and a pattern of length m, we are asked to output the distance between the pattern and every n-substring of the text. A basic variant of this problem is computation of Hamming distances, that is counting the number of mismatches (different characters aligned), for each alignment. Other popular variants include [Formula: see text] distance (Manhattan distance), [Formula: see text] distance (Euclidean distance) and general [Formula: see text] distance. While each of those problems trivially generalizes classical pattern-matching, the efficient algorithms for them require a broader set of tools, usually involving both algebraic and combinatorial insights. We briefly survey the history of the problems, and then focus on the progress made in the past few years in many specific settings: fine-grained complexity and lower-bounds, [Formula: see text] multiplicative approximations, k-bounded relaxations, streaming algorithms, purely combinatorial algorithms, and other recently proposed variants.","output":"Recent Advances in Text-to-Pattern Distance Algorithms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficacy of corticosteroids and its use for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections is controversial.

With the rise of antibiotic resistance, colistin has been used increasingly as a last-line therapy for multidrug-resistant GNIs. We evaluated the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and mortality among patients receiving colistin or one of the new -lactam/-lactamase inhibitors (L + LI) (ceftazidime/avibactam, ceftolozane/tazobactam, or meropenem/vaborbactam). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Premier Healthcare Database. The cohort included propensity score-matched adults with an inpatient stay between January 2016 and December 2018. Patients given both colistin and BL + BLI as treatment for  72 h were excluded. AKI was defined as acute renal failure or dialysis during hospitalization with antibiotic administration. Propensity score matching was used to control for selection bias and confounding. Logistic regression evaluated associations between treatment, AKI, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The total number of patients in the matched cohorts were 256 in each. Overall, 23.8% and 13.3% of patients receiving colistin or new L + LI agents, respectively, experienced AKI during hospitalization (p = 0.002); odds of AKI for colistin were 3.0 (95% CI 1.71, 5.21). Following propensity score-matching, patients without baseline renal disease experienced AKI during hospitalization to a higher degree in the colistin group compared to the L + LI group (17.1% vs. 6.8%); colistin use was associated with 3.7 times higher odds (95% CI 1.84, 7.42) of AKI compared to L + LI agents. The odds of mortality in patients on colistin developing AKI were more than three times that of patients receiving a BL + BLI agent who developed AKI. Among patients receiving colistin, incident AKI was associated with 6.1 times higher odds (95% CI 2.53, 14.71) of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving colistin for GNIs had significantly higher odds of AKI and mortality than those receiving L + LI.

The prospects and challenges associated with these approaches are discussed. ABSTRACT: Crop improvement relies on modulating the genes and genomic regions underlying key traits, either directly or indirectly. Direct approaches include overexpression, RNA interference, genome editing, etc., while breeding majorly constitutes the indirect approach. With the advent of latest tools and technologies, these strategies could hasten the improvement of crop species. Next-generation sequencing, high-throughput genotyping, precision editing, use of space technology for accelerated growth, etc. had provided a new dimension to crop improvement programmes that work towards delivering better varieties to cope up with the challenges. Also, studies have widened from understanding the response of plants to single stress to combined stress, which provides insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating tolerance to more than one stress at a given point of time. Altogether, next-generation genetics and genomics had made tremendous progress in delivering improved varieties; however, the scope still exists to expand its horizon to other species that remain underutilized. In this context, the present review systematically analyses the different genomics approaches that are deployed for trait discovery and improvement in major species that could serve as a roadmap for executing similar strategies in other crop species. The application, pros, and cons, and scope for improvement of each approach have been discussed with examples, and altogether, the review provides comprehensive coverage on the advances in genomics to meet the ever-growing demands for agricultural produce.

Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel method to synthesize blurry images from sharp images by analyzing the mechanisms of the thermal detector. Further, we propose a novel blur kernel rendering method, which combines our proposed motion blur model with the inertial sensor in the thermal image domain. The accuracy of the blur kernel rendering method is evaluated by the task of thermal image deblurring. We construct a synthetic blurry image dataset based on acquired thermal images using an infrared camera for evaluation. This dataset is the first blurry thermal image dataset with ground-truth images in the thermal image domain. Qualitative and quantitative experiments are extensively carried out on our dataset, which show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","output":"Motion Blur Kernel Rendering Using an Inertial Sensor: Interpreting the Mechanism of a Thermal Detector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine hesitancy has been on the rise throughout much of the world for the past two decades. At the same time, existing pro-vaccination public health communication strategies have proven ineffective. We present a novel approach to increase vaccination intentions, which appeals to individuals' other-regarding preferences. Specifically, we assess how vaccination intentions are influenced by the presence of people who cannot vaccinate, such as the immunosuppressed, newborns or pregnant women, using a game where there is a passive player whose welfare depends on the decisions of other, active players. Results from a survey experiment targeting parents and from a laboratory experiment provide support for a twofold positive effect of the presence of the passive player on vaccination intentions. These findings suggest messages that invoke altruistic, other-regarding preferences may be an effective approach to increasing vaccination intentions. Our findings could be extended to other campaigns where the population is invited to adopt behaviors that can help the most susceptible people, as is the case of the self-quarantine measures adopted during the outbreak of CoVID-19 at the beginning of 2020. If the attention of people is focused on the positive effect that they can have on those that cannot protect themselves, then the message may be more effective and people may be more responsive.","output":"Altruism and Vaccination Intentions: Evidence from Behavioral Experiments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, a utility-based multicriteria model is proposed to support the physicians to deal with an important medical decisionthe screening decision problemgiven the squeeze put on resources due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some previous evidence has suggested COVID-19-associated strokes are more severe with worse outcomes for patients, but further studies are needed to confirm these findings. The aim of this study was to determine the association between COVID-19 and mortality for patients with ischaemic stroke in a large multicentre study. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using electronic medical records of inpatients from 50 healthcare organizations, predominately from the USA. Patients with ischaemic stroke within 30 days of COVID-19 were identified. COVID-19 was determined from diagnosis codes or a positive test result identified with CO-VID-19-specific laboratory codes between January 20, 2020, and October 1, 2020. Historical controls with ischaemic stroke without COVID-19 were identified in the period January 20, 2019, to October 1, 2019. 1:1 propensity score matching was used to balance the cohorts with and without CO-VID-19 on characteristics including age, sex, race and comorbidities. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for all-cause 60-day mortality by COVID-19 status were produced. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 954 inpatients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19. During the same time period in 2019, there were 48,363 inpatients with ischaemic stroke without COVID-19 (historical controls). Compared to patients with ischaemic stroke without COVID-19, patients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19 had a lower mean age, had a lower prevalence of white patients, a higher prevalence of black or African American patients and a higher prevalence of hypertension, previous cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, neoplasms, and mental disorders due to known physiological conditions. After propensity score matching, there were 952 cases and 952 historical controls; cases and historical controls were better balanced on all included characteristics (all p > 0.05). After propensity score matching, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed the survival probability was significantly lower in ischaemic stroke patients with COVID-19 (78.3% vs. 91.0%, log-rank test p < 0.0001). The odds of 60-day mortality were significantly higher for patients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19 compared to the propensity score-matched historical controls (odds ratio: 2.51 [95% confidence interval 1.88-3.34]).

The aim of the study is to explore, by observation and literature review, the cities' readiness for possible pandemics or emergencies within the framework of the concept of urban immunity. Based on the elements necessary for the provision of immunity in humans, the requirements for urban immunity, the health of the infrastructure and superstructure of the soil, the resources and sustainability of a city, its resilience and growth control are discussed within the framework of urban management. In addition, the study identifies three indispensable actors for urban immunity: i) central governments, ii) local governments, and iii) citizens. Immunized cities can be defined as cities with healthy infrastructure and superstructure factors of urban soil aiming at economic and ecological sustainability that have achieved a planned and controlled growth momentum, governed by public policies created with the understanding of local welfare and democracy in cooperation with local governments, citizens, and the central government.

Alternative forms of covariate representations for the features derived from these modern data modalities should be considered that can utilize their intrinsic interconnection. The connectivity information between these features can be represented as an individual-specific network defined by a set of nodes and edges, the strength of which can vary from individual to individual. Global or local graph-theoretical features describing the network may constitute potential prognostic biomarkers instead of or in addition to traditional covariates and may replace the often unsuccessful search for individual biomarkers in a high-dimensional predictor space. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review to identify, collate and critically appraise the state-of-art in the use of individual-specific networks for prediction modelling in medicine and applied health research, published during 2000-2020 in the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus and Embase. RESULTS: Our scoping review revealed the main application areas namely neurology and pathopsychology, followed by cancer research, cardiology and pathology (N = 148). Network construction was mainly based on Pearson correlation coefficients of repeated measurements, but also alternative approaches (e.g. partial correlation, visibility graphs) were found. For covariates measured only once per individual, network construction was mostly based on quantifying an individual's contribution to the overall group-level structure. Despite the multitude of identified methodological approaches for individual-specific network inference, the number of studies that were intended to enable the prediction of clinical outcomes for future individuals was quite limited, and most of the models served as proof of concept that network characteristics can in principle be useful for prediction. CONCLUSION: The current body of research clearly demonstrates the value of individual-specific network analysis for prediction modelling, but it has not yet been considered as a general tool outside the current areas of application. More methodological research is still needed on well-founded strategies for network inference, especially on adequate network sparsification and outcome-guided graph-theoretical feature extraction and selection, and on how networks can be exploited efficiently for prediction modelling.","output":"Individual-specific networks for prediction modelling - A scoping review of methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Eccentric strength training represents a robust rehabilitation and therapy capability, which is inherently oxygen efficient. The oxygen efficient properties of eccentric training are uniquely suited for elderly people with impaired cardiopulmonary capacity.

Synthesis of conformal wearable and wireless inertial sensor systems with eccentric strength training enables the evolution of Virtual Proprioception for eccentric training. The conformal properties of the wearable and wireless inertial sensor, such as the BioStamp nPoint, feature the ability to flexibly mount by adhesive to effectively any segment of the human anatomy, such as about the forearm near the wrist for quantifying a biceps curl. Using Virtual Proprioception for eccentric training with a conformal wearable and wireless inertial sensor, such as the BioStamp nPoint, the eccentric phase can be emphasized by visualized feedback of the associated gyroscope signal with a predefined threshold.

In the unanesthetized rat, frequency of breathing was significantly decreased and tidal volume, expiratory resistance, and inspiratory and expiratory times tended to increase. For several of these variables, the largest response also occurred at 78 weeks and seemed to be exacerbated by CO(2) challenge.

Alignment-based and profile-based searches are commonly employed for characterization of assembled viral contigs from high-throughput sequencing data.

Here, we present a novel short k-mer based sequence scoring method that generates robust sequence information for training machine learning classifiers. We trained 18 classifiers for the task of distinguishing viral RNA from human transcripts. We challenged our models with very stringent testing protocols across different species and evaluated performance against BLASTn, BLASTx and HMMER3 searches. For clean sequence data retrieved from curated databases, our models display near perfect accuracy, outperforming all similar attempts previously reported. On de novo assemblies of raw RNA-Seq data from cells subjected to Ebola virus, the area under the ROC curve varied from 0.6 to 0.86 depending on the software used for assembly.

The typical medication discovery strategy requires several years of rigorous research and development as well as a significant financial commitment, which is not feasible in the face of the current epidemic.

These targets are critical for viral replication and infection propagation because they play a key role in replication/transcription and host cell recognition. Molecular docking revealed that the antiviral medication mozenavir showed a stronger affinity for SARS-CoV-2 target proteins than reference medicines in this investigation. We discovered that mozenavir increases the complex's stability and validates the molecular docking findings using molecular dynamics modelling. Furin, a target protein of COVID-19, has a greater binding affinity (-12.04 kcal/mol) than other COVID-19 target proteins, forming different hydrogen bonds and polar and hydrophobic interactions, suggesting that it might be used as an antiviral treatment against SARS-CoV-2.

Sociodemographic (including age, sex, Index of Multiple Deprivation, ethnicity coded as White/non-White) and clinical variables were described. The primary outcome was timing of referral to palliative care. Associations between ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation with the primary outcome were explored using multivariable regression.

Because many primary care providers lacked familiarity and comfort prescribing PrEP, at our institution PrEP prescribing was concentrated among the infectious disease specialists, effectively limiting access. This project sought to increase the number of patients receiving new prescriptions for PrEP. The interventions targeted primary care providers (including internal medicine and family medicine), and were designed to increase the number of unique providers offering PrEP to their patients. The overall strategy was to expand the clinical scope of practice for primary care providers through education and provision of detailed care templates in the electronic health record. These initiatives were implemented through a series of informal PlanCDoCStudyCAct cycles, then generalised throughout the medical system. To evaluate the success of the project, we queried the electronic medical record for all new prescriptions for PrEP, with provider name and specialty, for all outpatients 18 years of age and older from 2012 through 2020. In 2015, prior to the intervention, only 78 patients received new prescriptions for PrEP at our institution, and only 38% (30 of 78) of these were from primary care clinicians. After the intervention, the number of patients receiving PrEP increased to 190 in 2019, with 85% (162 of 190) prescribed by primary care providers. In addition, the number of primary care providers making a new prescription for PrEP increased from 20 in 2015 to 73 in 2019.

One approach to managing increased patient volumes during a pandemic involves the implementation of telephone-based triage systems. During a pandemic, telephone triage hotlines can be employed in innovative ways to conserve medical resources and offer useful population-level data about disease symptomatology and risk factor profiles. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe and evaluate the COVID-19 telephone triage hotline used by a large academic medical center in the midwestern United States. METHODS: Michigan Medicine established a telephone hotline to triage inbound patient calls related to COVID-19. For calls received between March 24, 2020, and May 5, 2020, we described total call volume, data reported by callers including COVID-19 risk factors and symptomatology, and distribution of callers to triage algorithm endpoints. We also described symptomatology reported by callers who were directed to the institutional patient portal (online medical visit questionnaire). RESULTS: A total of 3929 calls (average 91 calls per day) were received by the call center during the study period. The maximum total number of daily calls peaked at 211 on March 24, 2020. Call volumes were the highest from 6 AM to 11 AM and during evening hours. Callers were most often directed to the online patient portal (1654/3929, 42%), nursing hotlines (1338/3929, 34%), or employee health services (709/3929, 18%). Cough (126/370 of callers, 34%), shortness of breath (101/370, 27%), upper respiratory infection (28/111, 25%), and fever (89/370, 24%) were the most commonly reported symptoms. Immunocompromised state (23/370, 6%) and age >65 years (18/370, 5%) were the most commonly reported risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The triage algorithm successfully diverted low-risk patients to suitable algorithm endpoints, while directing high-risk patients onward for immediate assessment.

Meanwhile, emerging markers pre-brain natriuretic peptide, fibrinogen, and albumin levels are significantly associated with low FT3 (p < 0.001). The new risk death score based on biomarkers can be used to well predict the outcomes of CAD patients (C index of 0.764, 95% CI = 0.731C0.797).

Besides, the prognostic model based on FT3 provides a useful tool for the death risk stratification of CAD patients.","output":"Free Triiodothyronine Connected With Metabolic Changes in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease by Interacting With Other Functional Indicators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Viral nosocomial infections (NIs) in children are common and most frequently affect the gastrointestinal or respiratory tract. Few studies are dedicated to this topic. We aimed to determine incidence and characteristics of these specific viral NIs at our hospital. METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of nosocomial gastroenteritis and respiratory tract infections (RTIs) of hospitalized patients at the University Children's Hospital Basel over a 12-month period. Patients with new-onset gastroenteritis or RTI during hospitalization or a physician diagnosis of NI on discharge were included for analysis. NIs were defined by use of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations and specific agents' incubation periods. RESULTS Overall, 5493 patients were hospitalized accounting for 22,251 hospital days. Forty-five (0.8%) patients acquired an NI: 15 cases of gastroenteritis (mean age, 9.9 months; range: 3-24; NI incidence: 0.7 per 1000 hospitalization days) and 30 cases of RTI (mean age, 63.7 months; range: 1-174; NI incidence: 1.3 per 1000 hospitalization days). Main agents were rotavirus (10/15 gastroenteritis, 67%) and rhinovirus (22/30 nosocomial RTI; 73%). Physicians reported 9 cases of NI, of which 2 (22%) did not fulfill the criteria for an NI, 3 were surgical site infections, 1 was a case of rotavirus gastroenteritis and 3 were RTIs by rhinovirus. CONCLUSIONS Viral NIs, especially caused by rotavirus and rhinovirus, are frequent in children of all ages but underestimated if exclusively reported by physicians. Prospective studies should further investigate the role and epidemiology of rhinovirus in nosocomial RTI, ideally by use of automated information technology support.","output":"A retrospective analysis of nosocomial viral gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unilateral laparoscopic ovariectomy was attempted in a red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with an ovarian cyst through single portal access.

However, the fabrication processes used to create hydrophobic materials are typically time-consuming and costly. Thus, this study aims to create hydrophobic materials based on low-cost manufacturing. In this study, polylactic acid (PLA) was mixed with various concentrations of hexadecyltrimethoxysilane (HDTMS) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) with the aid of solvents, chloroform, and acetone, through the solvent casting and melt extrusion process, which is capable of producing hydrophobic PLA filaments suitable for additive manufacturing (AM). Water contact angle (WCA) measurements were performed to verify the improved hydrophobicity of PLA/HDTMS/PTFE filaments. According to the results, it was discovered that the best filament WCAs were achieved with 2 g (10 wt%) of PLA, 0.2 ml of HDTMS, and 1 ml of PTFE (2 g PLA + 0.2 ml HDTMS + 1 ml PTFE), producing an average WCA of 131.6 and the highest WCA of 132.7. These results indicate that adding HDTMS and PTFE to PLA significantly enhances filament hydrophobicity. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques were utilized to characterize the surface morphology, molecular interactions, and thermal decompositions of the prepared PLA/HDTMS/PTFE filaments. This study revealed that compared to 2 g of pure PLA filament, HDTMS and PTFE altered the microstructure of the filament. Its thermal degradation temperature was impacted, but the melting temperature was not. Therefore, the PLA/HDTMS/PTFE filament is good enough to be printed by the fused filament fabrication (FFF) AM process.

Here, we explore the clinical significance of CTCs and T lymphocyte subtypes in patients with pancreatic cancer. A total of 106 patients with the pancreatic cancer were enrolled in this study. The enrichment and identification of CTCs were achieved before treatment by a PatrolCTC detection technique. Flow cytometry (FACS) was used to characterize CD4, CD8, natural killer (NK) cells, and Tregulatory (Treg) lymphocyte subtypes. Interleukin-2 (IL-2), Interleukin-4 (IL-4), Interleukin-17A (IL-17A), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), and Interferon  (IFN-) were measured by meso-scale discovery (MSD) assay. Among these patients, 44 (41.5%) patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) were female and 62 (58.5%) cases were male. Case numbers with IICIV tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages were 32 (30.2%), 50 (47.2%), and 24 (22.6%), respectively. The positive rate of CTCs before surgery was 37.5% (12/32), 88.0% (44/50) and 100% (24/24) in stage II, III, and IV patients, respectively. Total CTCs, mixed CTCs, and mesenchymal CTCs (MCTCs) were strongly relevant to shorter progression-free survival (PFS) of the patients. In addition, total CTCs (6) and positive MCTCs were also significantly correlated with recurrence and metastasis. The patients with high CTCs also had low levels of CD4, CD4/CD8 ratio, NK cells, IL-2, and IFN. In contrast, Treg cells had significant elevation in PDAC patients. These results indicated that CTCs number in PDAC patients was an independent indicator for worse PFS. High CTCs also had strong correlation with weak cellular immunity functions.","output":"The clinical significance of circulating tumor cells and T lymphocyte subtypes in pancreatic cancer patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundSubstantial evidence suggests that severe Covid-19 leads to an increased risk of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE). We aimed to quantify the risk of VTE associated with ambulatory Covid-19, study the potential protective role of vaccination, and establish key clinical and genetic determinants of post-Covid VTE. MethodsWe analyzed a cohort of ambulatory Covid-19 patients from UK Biobank, and compared their 30-day VTE risk with propensity-score-matched non-infected participants. We fitted multivariable models to study the associations between age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic status, obesity, vaccination status and inherited thrombophilia with post-Covid VTE. ResultsOverall, VTE risk was nearly 20-fold higher in Covid-19 vs matched non-infected participants (hazard ratio [HR] 19.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 11.50 to 33.05). However, the risk was substantially attenuated amongst the vaccinated (HR: 2.79, 95% CI 0.82 to 9.54). Older age, male sex, and obesity were independently associated with higher risk, with adjusted HRs of 2.00 (1.61 to 2.47) per 10 years, 1.66 (1.28 to 2.15), and 1.85 (1.29 to 2.64), respectively. Further, inherited thrombophilia led to an HR 2.05, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.66. ConclusionsAmbulatory Covid-19 was associated with a striking 20-fold increase in incident VTE, but no elevated risk after breakthrough infection in the fully vaccinated. Older age, male sex, and obesity were clinical determinants of Covid-19-related VTE. Additionally, inherited thrombophilia doubled risk further, comparable to the effect of 10-year ageing. These findings reinforce the need for vaccination, and call for targeted strategies to prevent VTE during outpatient care of Covid-19.","output":"Venous Thromboembolism in Ambulatory Covid-19 patients: Clinical and Genetic Determinants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza viruses pose a substantial threat to human and animal health worldwide. Recent studies in mouse models have revealed an indispensable role for the innate immune system in defense against influenza virus. Recognition of the virus by innate immune receptors in a multitude of cell types activates intricate signaling networks, functioning to restrict viral replication. Downstream effector mechanisms include activation of innate immune cells and, induction and regulation of adaptive immunity. However, uncontrolled innate responses are associated with exaggerated disease, especially in pandemic influenza virus infection. Despite advances in the understanding of innate response to influenza in the mouse model, there is a large knowledge gap in humans, particularly in immunocompromised groups such as infants and the elderly. We propose here, the need for further studies in humans to decipher the role of innate immunity to influenza virus, particularly at the site of infection.

This practice ensures the proper development of vegetative and reproductive organs on the one hand, and on the other, the development of high-quality grapes which can be hampered by overly abundant water application. In previous work, we have developed and demonstrated an irrigation model suitable for high-quality grape production in semi-arid areas. Here, we tackle the question of proper irrigation initiation datesshould one wait for vines to develop drought stress before the initiation of irrigation, or rather commence irrigation earlier? Our results show that vines which undergo initial irrigation late in the growing season tend to develop a lower midday stem water potential even after irrigation initiation. In addition, these vines tend to produce a lower number of bunches per vine and smaller berry size, leading to lower yields. The wine produced from the late-irrigated treatments had a higher phenolic content, primarily due to higher levels of catechin and epicatechin. Their levels increased as irrigation initiation dates were delayed, while caffeic acid levels showed an opposite trend. Late irrigation also led to higher color intensities compared to those of irrigation at earlier stages, due to higher levels of most anthocyanins. Finally, we show that the overall wine sensory score, representing its overall quality, was approximately five points higher for wines made from delayed irrigation treatments compared to wines made from early season irrigation treatments.","output":"The Effect of Irrigation-Initiation Timing on the Phenolic Composition and Overall Quality of Cabernet Sauvignon Wines Grown in a Semi-Arid Climate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Following the announcement of the World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2020, of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 as a global and emergency state of international health emergency;posing a serious threat to the physical health and lives of individuals transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact The virus causes respiratory symptoms and damages to other organs, sometimes leading to death in case of exacerbation of symptoms AIM: This study was conducted through reviewing various articles related to COVID-19 disease, with the purpose of reviewing the epidemiology, prevention and control strategies of COVID-19 coronavirus in Iran METHODS: In the present review study, the articles indexing in the Persian and Latin databases of SID, Magiran, PubMed, Scopus, Scholar, Web of Science, Embase, MedRxiv, and WHO were examined based on MESH keywords Finally, 38 articles, 5 protocols and reports were reviewed RESULTS: According to the report of the WHO on July 22, 2020, 14,765,256 people worldwide have been infected and 612,054 people have died of this virus Moreover, in Iran, according to the WHO report, 278,827 people were infected and 14,634 people died of the virus until July 22, 2020 Respiratory droplets are the main way of transmission and it can also be transmitted through close contact According to research, 51% of patients with chronic disease show symptoms such as fever (83%), cough (82%), shortness of breath (31%), muscle pain (11%), fatigue (9%), headache (8%), sore throat (5%), had rhinorrhea (4%), chest pain (2%), diarrhea (2%), and nausea and vomiting (1%) There is currently no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and clinical treatment for COVID-19 has so far been limited to prophylaxis and palliative care Quarantine alone is not enough to prevent the spread of COVID-19 Basic health measurements to prevent the spread of the disease include frequent handwashing and the use of personal protective equipment such as masks CONCLUSION: Extensive research can be the key to solve the existing challenges in the prevention, control, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease The best ways to fight the new corona disease include educating the people, providing accurate information, providing personal protective equipment, canceling meetings and emphasizing citizens homeliving and regular handwashing, observing social distancing, and finally identifying suspicious cases and quarantine","output":"Epidemiology, prevention and control strategies of coronavirus covid 19 in iran: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Secondary traumatization exposure and mental health conditions of health care workers gained importance during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic period.

Two hundred fifty-one health care workers from different units/services and 312 non-medical worker adults attended to the research. Health care workers were divided into two groups based on working with COVID-19 patients at the frontline or not. The data were collected via Introductory Information Form, Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS) and Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) between 22 May and 30 May 2020. RESULTS: Among the 563 participants, 251 (44.6%) were health care workers and 312 (55.4%) were non-medical workers. The anxiety, depression and secondary traumatization scores of the frontline health care workers for the COVID-19 were found to be significantly higher than those of the other health workers or non-medical workers (p < .001).

METHODS: Using VigiBase(?), the WHO pharmacovigilance database, we performed a disproportionality analysis (case/non-case study). Cases were reports of fatal outcomes with the drugs of interest and non-cases were all other reports for these drugs registered between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2019. Data with hydroxychloroquine (or metformin) alone were compared with the association hydroxychloroquine + metformin. Results are reported as ROR (reporting odds ratio) with their 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Of the 10,771 Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR) involving hydroxychloroquine, 52 were recorded as fatal outcomes. In comparison with hydroxychloroquine alone, hydroxychloroquine + metformin was associated with an ROR value of 57.7 (23.9C139.3). In comparison with metformin alone, hydroxychloroquine + metformin was associated with an ROR value of 6.0 (2.6C13.8).

SLND assimilated into routine surgical practice because it increases precision of surgical staging and may reduce morbidity compared to a full, systematic LND. Previous research focussed on the accuracy of SLND. Patient centred outcomes have never been conclusively demonstrated. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate patient centred outcomes of SLND for endometrial cancer patients. Literature published in the last five years (January 2015 to April 2020) was retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library, across five domains: (1) perioperative outcomes; (2) adjuvant treatment; (3) patient-reported outcomes (PROs); (4) lymphedema, and (5) cost. Covidence software ascertained a standardised and monitored review process. We identified 21 eligible studies. Included studies were highly heterogeneous, with widely varying outcome measures and reporting. SLND was associated with shorter operating times and lower estimated blood loss compared to systematic LND, but intra-operative and post-operative complications were not conclusively different. There was either no impact, or a trend towards less adjuvant treatment used in patients with SLND compared to systematic LND. SLND had lower prevalence rates of lymphedema compared to systematic LND, although this was shown only in three retrospective studies. Costs of surgical staging were lowest for no node sampling, followed by SLND, then LND. PROs were unable to be compared because of a lack of studies. The quality of evidence on patient-centred outcomes associated with SLND for surgical staging of endometrial cancer is poor, particularly in PROs, lymphedema and cost.

METHODS: A pre-piloted questionnaire was distributed between October 2017 and January 2018 to primary care professionals attending the Royal College of General Practitioners and Best Practice in Primary Care conferences, via a link in PHE Vaccine Updates and through professional networks. Survey results were analysed to give descriptive statistics, and responses by respondent characteristics: profession, region, practice size, and frequency of seeing migrant patients. Responses were considered on a per question basis with response rates for each question presented with the results. RESULTS: Four hundred fourteen questionnaires were returned with responses varying by question, representing an estimated 5.7% of English GP practices overall. Only 14% of respondents practices systematically identified migrant patients for testing. Universal opt-out testing was offered to newly registering migrant patients by 18% of respondents for hepatitis B, 17% for hepatitis C and 21% for HIV. Knowledge of healthcare entitlements varied; fewer clinical staff knew that general practice consultations were free to all migrants (76%) than for urgent care (88%). Performance payment structure (76%) had the greatest reported influence on testing, followed by PHE and Clinical Commissioning Group recommendations (73% each). Language and culture were perceived to be the biggest barriers to accessing care. CONCLUSIONS: BBV testing for migrant patients in primary care is usually ad hoc, which is likely to lead to testing opportunities being missed. Knowledge of migrants entitlements to healthcare varies and could affect access to care. Interventions to improve professional awareness and identification of migrant patients requiring BBV testing are needed to reduce the undiagnosed and untreated burden of BBVs in this vulnerable population.","output":"What do primary care staff know and do about blood borne virus testing and care for migrant patients?

Whether washed microbiota transplantation (WMT) is an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients suspected of having GMD by restoring the gut microbiota is unknown. This study is designed to explore the efficacy and safety of WMT in COVID-19 patients suspected of having GMD. METHODS: This is a randomized, multicenter, single-blind prospective study. COVID-19 patients suspected of having GMD will be randomly divided to receive routine treatment only or to receive routine treatment and WMT. The frequency of WMT will be once a day for three consecutive days. Laboratory and imaging examinations will be performed at admission, 1 and 2 weeks after treatment, and on the day of discharge. Then a telephone follow-up will be conducted at 1st week, 2nd week, and 6th month after discharge. The clinical efficacy and safety of WMT in COVD-19 patients suspected of having GMD and the effects of WMT on the organ function, homeostasis, inflammatory response, intestinal mucosal barrier function, and immunity of the patients will be evaluated. RESULTS: By following the proposed protocol, WMT is expected to be efficacious and safe for the treatment of COVID-19 patients suspected of having GMD, and the therapeutic effect is expected to be associated with improvement of the intestinal mucosal barrier function, inflammatory response, and immunity. CONCLUSION: The findings from this study may offer a new approach for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 patients suspected of having GMD.

The fragile and weak health system in the country is also riddled with a lot of sub-optimal health indicators including reproductive health. It is important to anticipate and look out for these effects in order to plan for and ensure early detection and necessary intervention to mitigate such. This paper discusses the potential effect of COVID-19 on reproductive health indicators in Nigeria. The reproductive health indices of a population have far and wide reaching impact on the health status of the population. However, reproductive health indicators are usually among the worst hit during health emergencies or disasters as seen in the Ebola pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa.

The bifunctional nsp14 contains 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) and guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domains. While the latter presumably supports mRNA capping, ExoN is thought to mediate proofreading during genome replication. In line with such a role, ExoN knockout mutants of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were previously reported to have crippled but viable hypermutation phenotypes. Remarkably, using reverse genetics, a large set of corresponding ExoN knockout mutations has now been found to be lethal for another betacoronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). For 13 mutants, viral progeny could not be recovered, unless-as happened occasionally-reversion had first occurred. Only a single mutant was viable, likely because its E191D substitution is highly conservative. Remarkably, a SARS-CoV-2 ExoN knockout mutant was found to be unable to replicate, resembling observations previously made for alpha- and gammacoronaviruses, but starkly contrasting with the documented phenotype of ExoN knockout mutants of the closely related SARS-CoV. Subsequently, we established in vitro assays with purified recombinant MERS-CoV nsp14 to monitor its ExoN and N7-MTase activities. All ExoN knockout mutations that proved lethal in reverse genetics were found to severely decrease ExoN activity while not affecting N7-MTase activity. Our study strongly suggests that CoV nsp14 ExoN has an additional function, which apparently is critical for primary viral RNA synthesis and thus differs from the proofreading function that, based on previous MHV and SARS-CoV studies, was proposed to boost longer-term replication fidelity.IMPORTANCE The bifunctional nsp14 subunit of the coronavirus replicase contains 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) and guanine-N7-methyltransferase domains. For the betacoronaviruses MHV and SARS-CoV, ExoN was reported to promote the fidelity of genome replication, presumably by mediating a form of proofreading. For these viruses, ExoN knockout mutants are viable while displaying an increased mutation frequency. Strikingly, we have now established that the equivalent ExoN knockout mutants of two other betacoronaviruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, are nonviable, suggesting an additional and critical ExoN function in their replication. This is remarkable in light of the very limited genetic distance between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which is highlighted, for example, by 95% amino acid sequence identity in their nsp14 sequences. For (recombinant) MERS-CoV nsp14, both its enzymatic activities were evaluated using newly developed in vitro assays that can be used to characterize these key replicative enzymes in more detail and explore their potential as target for antiviral drug development.","output":"The Enzymatic Activity of the nsp14 Exoribonuclease Is Critical for Replication of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article presents the results of a study aimed at identifying the problems of maintaining a healthy lifestyle in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Inappropriate utilization of ABHR could have detrimental effects, most importantly during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which include exposure of healthcare professionals to healthcare-associated infections and the development of resistant microorganisms. In a hospital setting, the utilization of ABHR among frontline healthcare workers including pharmacy professionals is low. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the current practice of hand rubbing among pharmacy professionals in public hospitals of Addis Ababa during the pandemic of COVID-19. METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional study using a self-reported questionnaire conducted among pharmacy professionals in public hospitals found in Addis Ababa from 10th May to 9th June, 2020 to recognize ABHR utilization rate. Data were collected on a sample of 384 pharmacy professional by a self-administered questionnaire. Data analysis was done using software for the statistical package for social science version 25.0. To identify the significant predictors of ABHR utilization practice bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions were carried out. Crude odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval were calculated to determine the predictors. RESULTS: Out of 384 participants, three hundred and four participants were included in the final analyses after the exclusion of incomplete responses. Female participants represented 41.4% of the study participants. More than half (58.9%) of the pharmacy professionals had sufficient knowledge on ABHR utilization for COVID-19 prevention. Similarly, 56.6% of pharmacy professionals had positive attitude towards ABHR for COVID-19 prevention. But only 35.9% of the study participants had good ABHR utilization practice. CONCLUSION: Despite the modest level of knowledge and attitude towards ABHR, pharmacy professionals utilization practice of ABHR for COVID-19 prevention was found to be suboptimal.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the agreement of the commercial in-clinics VacciCheck test compared to VN. A total of 106 canine sera were analyzed using both methods. The best agreement was obtained using a protective threshold of 1:32. VacciCheck showed 95.5% sensitivity, 87.2% specificity, and 92.5% accuracy. The Cohen's kappa coefficient between methods was 0.84 (CI 95% 0.73 to 0.95), revealing an optimal agreement between the two methods (p = 0.0073). The evaluation of discordant results reveal that most samples had less than 1.5 dilution difference, and that usually did not affect the classification as protected or non-protected. Results also suggest that, in dubious cases, especially when a protective result is expected, retesting is advisable.

We aimed to assess the complications and in-hospital mortality rate of Hispanic diabetic trauma patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out using data from the Puerto Rico Trauma Hospital databank. Patients were matched based on gender, age, mechanism of injury, Glasgow Coma Scale, and Injury Severity Score using propensity-score matching. From 2000 to 2014, a total of 1134 patients with DM were compared to 1134 patients who did not have DM. The outcomes measured were hospital and TICU lengths of stay, days on mechanical ventilation, complications, and in-hospital mortality rate. A logistic regression model was carried out to evaluate the relationship of DM with complications and mortality after trauma. RESULTS: Hispanic patients with DM had longer hospital and TICU stays and required mechanical ventilation for extended periods. Complications, predominantly of an infectious nature, were more common among DM patients than they were among non-DM patients: 31.3% in the DM group vs. 11.6% in the non-DM group (OR 3.46; 95% CI 2.77C4.31). Despite an increase in the number of complications, DM was not associated with higher in-hospital mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: DM is associated with a twofold increase in complications in Hispanic diabetic trauma patients, which may account for their longer hospital and TICU stays.

From the results, it is observed that the first stage model provides an optimal number of bins required and allocation of it at minimum cost. Taking it as input for the second stage model, it identifies the best locations for centralized and decentralized composting plants. The result also reveals that decentralized composting plants are more economical than centralized plants.

Therefore, in line with the demands of the times, this study sought to determine the applicability of online active learning to dental education. METHODS: This study was conducted in the second semester of 2020 at a school of dentistry in a selective university in Korea. A total of 114 dental students were recruited. Participants were assigned to four different groups (lecture and discussion [LD], lecture and discussion with instructors worksheet [LW], self-study and discussion [SSD], and self-study and discussion with instructors worksheet [SW]) using the random breakout room function in the Zoom video conference application. Their final test scores were then analyzed using analysis of variance and the online active learning results were compared with the offline learning results. RESULTS: The scores were highest for the transfer type items in the SSD group, followed by the SW group and the two lecture groups, which had no significant differences. These scores and pattern differences between the groups were similar for all items. The results suggested that studying by oneself rather than simply listening to lectures enhanced the effects of the discussions and led to higher learning outcomes. In addition, the effect of the instructor's intervention in the middle of the discussion varied depending on the pre-learning activities of discussion. As with previous offline experiments, self-study followed by group discussion had higher learning outcomes for both the verbatim and transfer type items.

METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study describing all consecutive patients age 65 or older with confirmed COVID-19 who presented to the emergency department or were hospitalized at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center between March 6 and April 7, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 531 patients were evaluated, including 116 (21.8%) with previously diagnosed dementia, and 415 without dementia. Patients with dementia had higher mortality (50.0%versus 35.4%, pa??=a??0.006); despite similar comorbidities and complications, multivariate analysis indicated the association was dependent on age, sex, comorbidities, and code status. Patients with dementia more often presented with delirium (36.2%versus 11.6%, pa??<a??0.001) but less often presented with multiple other COVID-19 symptoms, and these findings remained after adjusting for age and sex.

Outbreaks of measles and coronavirus have been particularly acute among Orthodox Jewish neighbourhoods in North America, Europe and Israel, yet no comparative studies have been conducted to discern the shared and situated influences on vaccine decision-making. This paper synthesises qualitative research into vaccine decision-making among Orthodox Jews in the United Kingdom and Israel during the 2014-15 and 2018-19 measles epidemics, and 2020-21 coronavirus pandemic. The methods integrate 66 semi-structured informal interviews conducted with parents, formal and informal healthcare practitioners, and religious leaders, as well as analysis of tailored non-vaccination advocacy events and literature. The paper argues that the discourse of 'religious' exemption and opposition to vaccination obscures the diverse practices and philosophies that inform vaccine decisions, and how religious law and leaders form a contingent influence. Rather than viewing religion as the primary framework through which vaccine decisions are made, Orthodox Jewish parents were more concerned with safety, trust and choice in similar ways to 'secular' logics of non-vaccination. Yet, religious frameworks were mobilised, and at times politicised, to suit medico-legal discourse of 'exemption' from coercive or mandatory vaccine policies. By conceptualising tensions around protection as 'political immunities,' the paper offers a model to inform social science understandings of how health, law and religion intersect in contemporary vaccine opposition.","output":"\\"If a rabbi did say 'you have to vaccinate,' we wouldn't\\": Unveiling the secular logics of religious exemption and opposition to vaccination."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gene Ontology (GO) is widely used in the biological domain. It is the most comprehensive ontology providing formal representation of gene functions (GO concepts) and relations between them. However, unintentional quality defects (e.g. missing or erroneous relations) in GO may exist due to the large size of GO concepts and complexity of GO structures. Such quality defects would impact the results of GO-based analyses and applications. In this work, we introduce a novel evidence-based lexical pattern approach for quality assurance of GO relations. We leverage two layers of evidence to suggest potentially missing relations in GO as follows. We first utilize related concept pairs (i.e. existing relations) in GO to extract relationship-specific lexical patterns, which serve as the first layer evidence to automatically suggest potentially missing relations between unrelated concept pairs. For each suggested missing relation, we further identify two other existing relations as the second layer of evidence that resemble the difference between the missing relation and the existing relation based on which the missing relation is suggested. Applied to the 15 December 2021 release of GO, this approach suggested a total of 866 potentially missing relations. Local domain experts evaluated the entire set of potentially missing relations, and identified 821 as missing relations and 45 indicate erroneous existing relations.

The results showed that hypertension, a lactate dehydrogenase level > 211.5 U/L, an interleukin 6 (IL-6) level > 12.5 pg/ml, and a NK lymphocyte percentage > 0.5% were associated with prolonged viral clearance. Therefore, we showed that a history of hypertension, an elevated IL-6 level, and an elevated percentage of NK cells were risk factors for prolonged viral clearance.","output":"Risk Factors for Prolonged Viral Clearance in Adult Patients with COVID-19 in Beijing, China: A Prospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the Fourth Industrial Revolution era, data-based business management activities among enterprises proliferated are mainly based on digital transformation.

Accurate forecast/mining of the spread process is often hard to be achieved by using statistical or mechanical models. Here we propose a new reverse problem, which aims to identify the stochastically spatial spread process itself from observable information regarding the arrival history of infectious cases in each subpopulation. We solved the problem by developing an efficient optimization algorithm based on dynamical programming, which comprises three procedures: 1) anatomizing the whole spread process among all subpopulations into disjoint componential patches; 2) inferring the most probable invasion pathways underlying each patch via maximum likelihood estimation; and 3) recovering the whole process by assembling the invasion pathways in each patch iteratively, without burdens in parameter calibrations and computer simulations. Based on the entropy theory, we introduced an identifiability measure to assess the difficulty level that an invasion pathway can be identified. Results on both artificial and empirical metapopulation networks show the robust performance in identifying actual invasion pathways driving pandemic spread.","output":"Identifying Spatial Invasion of Pandemics on Metapopulation Networks Via Anatomizing Arrival History"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread rapidly around the globe since December 2019 creating much uncertainty among medical staff. Due to close patient contact, medical assistants are at increased risk of an infection. Several studies have investigated psychological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on medical staff, yet studies in the outpatient setting are scarce and studies addressing medical assistants are lacking. This study aimed to investigate pandemic-related stressors, attitudes, and work outcomes among medical assistants and to identify possible determinants. METHODS: The population under study were medical assistants across entire Germany. A self-devised online questionnaire was published between April 7th, 2020, and April 14th. including questions on pandemic-related stressors, attitudes and work outcomes. Additionally, symptoms of depression and anxiety disorder were measured by PHQ-2 and GAD-2, respectively. Logistic regression was performed to identify possible determinants. RESULTS: 2150 medical assistants provided complete data (98.0% female, mean age 37.6 years). Major stressors were uncertainty about the temporal scope of the pandemic (95.1% agreement), about how to act correctly (77.5%), feelings of not being allowed to let patients down (75.9%), uncertainty about one's financial situation (67.4%) and about contact persons for further information (67.1%). One third (29.9%) of the study population screened positively for depression and 42.6% for anxiety disorder. Feeling burdened by one's financial situation was significantly associated with working in specialist practices (1.32 [1.08-1.62]), caring for children (1.51 [1.22-1.87]), depression (1.28 [1.01-1.62]), and anxiety disorder (1.93 [1.55-2.39]).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical and radiologic data of all consecutive patients treated at our institution from September 2012 to October 2013 for an intracranial aneurysm by using a LEO Baby stent were retrospectively analyzed. Immediate and midterm clinical and anatomic follow-up of each patient is reported. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients with 29 aneurysms were treated with LEO Baby stents at our institution. The mean age of patients was 48 years; 20 patients were women (71%). One patient was treated in the acute phase of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. In 8 procedures, a double-lumen-catheter balloon was used for balloon-then-stent-assisted coiling. In 3 cases, a LEO Baby stent was used in a Y-, T-, and telescopic dual-stent configuration. In 18 cases, a single LEO Baby stent was used. In 2 cases, technical failure to deploy the stent resulted in acute parent artery thrombosis. In 3 further cases, thromboembolic complications occurred intraoperatively. MR imaging and angiographic midterm follow-up showed complete aneurysm occlusion for 96% of the followed patients (27/29).

Recent reviews have documented the impacts of structural interventions on HIV prevention, but evidence about the effects of cash transfer programs on HIV prevention has not been systematically reviewed for several years. METHODS AND FINDINGS We did a systematic review of published and unpublished literature to update and summarize the evidence around cash programs for HIV prevention from January 2000 to December 17, 2020. We included studies with either a cash transfer intervention, savings program, or program to reduce school costs. Included studies measured the program's impact on HIV infection, other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), or sexual behaviors. We screened 1,565 studies and examined 78 in full-text review to identify a total of 45 peer-reviewed publications and reports from 27 different interventions or populations. We did not do a meta-analysis given the range of outcomes and types of cash transfer interventions assessed. Most studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (N = 23; South Africa, Tanzania, Malawi, Lesotho, Kenya, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and eSwatini) followed by Mexico (N = 2), the United States (N = 1), and Mongolia (N = 1)). Of the 27 studies, 20 (72%) were randomized trials, 5 (20%) were observational studies, 1 (4%) was a case-control study, and 1 (4%) was quasi-experimental. Most studies did not identify a strong association between the program and sexual behaviors, except sexual debut (10/18 finding an association; 56%). Eight of the 27 studies included HIV biomarkers, but only 3 found a large reduction in HIV incidence or prevalence, and the rest found no statistically significant association. Of the studies that identified a statistically significant association with other STIs (N = 4/8), 2 involved incentives for staying free of the STI, and the other 2 were cash transfer programs for adolescent girls that had conditionalities related to secondary schooling. Study limitations include the small number of studies in key populations and examining interventions to reduce school costs and matched saving programs. CONCLUSIONS The evidence base for large-scale impacts of cash transfers reducing HIV risk is limited; however, government social protection cash transfer programs and programs that incentivize school attendance among adolescent girls and young women show the greatest promise for HIV prevention.","output":"Cash transfers for HIV prevention: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJETIVE: To evaluate SAR-COV-2 pacients' features To analyse de diferences between those who required hospital care and those who didn't DESIGN: Observational, descriptive and retrospective study SETTING: Twomedical practices of an urban health center in Salamanca (Spain) PARTICIPANTS: 18 years diagnosed with SAR-CoV-2 between March 11th and April 20th MAIN MEASUREMENTS: clinical-epidemiological chatacteristics, diagnosis, treatment and outcome at the end of study RESULTS: 122 patients (63 9% female), 19 7% social and health care workers y 4 9% from nursing homes Predominant age group: 46-60 years 67 2% without comorbility Predomint symptoms: low-grade fever (73 5%), cough (65 2%) y fever (43%) Average age of the patients requiring hospital care was higher: 59 85 (DE16 22) versus 50 78 (DE17 88) P= 013 63 6% of all the patients monitored by Primary Health Care and 14 1% of patients that required assistance did not present dyspnea P= 001 Only 2 5% of the hospital-assisted patients, compared to 61 5% of Primary Health Care, were not tested P= 0001 26 patients were attendedn at an emergency room: 11(9%) stayed and 2 (1 6%) passed away No antibiotic or inhaler treatment for 52 5% and 70 5% respectively The most used antipyretic treatment was paracetamol (78 7%) CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence in females, comorbility-free patients and in age range: 46-60 years Complementary and confirmatory test were performed mainly in hospital care Predominance of mild symptoms and favourable evolution Highliting the role played by Primary Health Care in detection, early intervention and monitoring of severe cases","output":"[Characteristics and evolution of COVID-19 in an urban Health Center at the pandemic beginning']"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Convalescent plasma (CP) is widely used to treat Covid-19, but without formal evidence of efficacy.

In addition, disposable masks are in short supply, while military chemical-biological-radiological-nuclear masks can be disinfected then reused. It is unknown whether such masks might be appropriate for civilians with minimal training in their use. Accordingly, we compared the Australian Defence Force in-service chemical-biological-radiological-nuclear Low Burden Mask (AirBoss Defense, Newmarket, Canada) with polypropylene N95 masks and non-occlusive glasses worn during simulated tasks performed by civilian clinicians in an Australian tertiary referral hospital intensive care unit. After brief training in the use of the Low Burden Mask, participants undertook a simulated cardiac arrest scenario. Previous training with polypropylene N95 masks had been provided. Evaluation of 10 characteristics of each mask type were recorded, and time to mask application was assessed. Thirty-three participants tested the Low Burden Mask, and 28 evaluated polypropylene N95 masks and glasses. The Low Burden Mask was donned more quickly: mean time 7.0 (standard deviation 2.1) versus 18.3 (standard deviation 6.7) seconds; P = 0.0076. The Low Burden Mask was rated significantly higher in eight of the 10 assessed criteria, including ease of donning, comfort (initially and over a prolonged period), fogging, seal, safety while removing, confidence in protection, and overall. Visibility and communication ability were rated equally highly for both systems. We conclude that this air-purifying full-face mask is acceptable to clinicians in a civilian intensive care unit. It enhances staff confidence, reduces waste, and is likely to be a lower logistical burden during a prolonged pandemic.

In addition, given the politicization of some social distancing rules (e.g., mask wearing), we explored whether those who adhere to strong political ideologiesparticularly conservative ideologieswould be more likely to rule-break. Moderation analyses indicated that boredom proneness and social (but not fiscal) conservatism were indeed predictive of rule-breaking.

METHODS: Primary culture of mouse peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with Kappa Cg. The supernatant and cell lysate were used for ELISA, western blotting, immunofluorescence. Cg-induced mouse colitis was also developed. RESULTS: Here we show that Cg activates peritoneal macrophages to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1?. While Cg-induced TNF production/secretion depends on TLR4/MyD88 signaling, the production of pro-IL-1? relies on TLR4/TRIF/SYK/reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway. The maturation of pro-IL1? into IL-1? is dependent on canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation via Pannexin-1/P2X7/K+ efflux signaling. In vivo, Cg-induced colitis was reduced in mice in the absence of NLRP3 inflammasome components.

To reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the Italian Government decision-makers issued a series of law decrees that imposed measures limiting social contacts, stopped non-essential production activities, and restructured public health care in order to privilege assistance to patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Health care services were substantially limited including planned hospitalization and elective surgeries. These substantial measures were criticized due to their impact on individual rights including freedom and autonomy, but were justified by the awareness that hospitals would have been unable to cope with the surge of infected people who needed treatment for COVID-19. The imbalance between the need to guarantee ordinary care and to deal with the pandemic, in a context of limited health resources, raises ethical concerns as well as clinical management issues. The emergency scenario caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the lockdown phase, led the Government and health care decision-makers to prioritize community safety above the individuals rights. This new community-centered approach to clinical care has created tension among the practitioners and exposed health workers to malpractice claims.

Previous studies have shown that the ACE inhibitor captopril (Cap) may be a potent therapeutic drug for ALI. However, the mechanisms of its protective effects on ALI are still largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Cap on preventing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury and further investigated the underlying mechanisms of these protective effects. Rats were intraperitoneally pretreated with Cap (50 mg/kg) 30 min prior to an intravenous administration of LPS (7.5 mg/kg). Furthermore, following a 30-min pretreatment with Cap (10 mol/mL) or combined with the ACE2 inhibitor MLN4760 (10 mol/mL), rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) were stimulated with LPS (1 mg/mL). Captopril pretreatment significantly attenuated LPS-induced pathophysiological changes in the lung, inhibited secretion of tumor necrosis factor  and interleukin 6, reduced the ratio of Ang II to Ang-1-7, and reversed the increased ratio of ACE to ACE2, which was remarkably decreased from 7.07 (LPS only) to 1.71 (LPS + Cap). The protective effects of Cap on ALI were also confirmed by in vitro studies, in which Cap suppressed LPS-induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and modulated the expression levels of ACE and ACE2. After Cap pretreatment, the ratio of ACE to ACE2 expression was remarkably decreased from 5.18 (LPS alone) to 1.52 (LPS + Cap). Furthermore, Cap given before LPS administration led to inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) 1/2, and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) phosphorylation in PMVECs, whereas MLN4760 abolished the protective effects of Cap on LPS-induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and abolished Cap-induced blockade of p38MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK phosphorylation. Our findings reveal that Cap exerts protective effects on LPS-induced lung injury and the cytotoxicity of PMVECs, and these effects may, at least in part, regulate the balance of ACE and ACE2 expression and inhibit the activation of MAPKs.","output":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury by regulating the balance between angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase activation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan has caused an outbreak and become a major public health issue in China and great concern from international community. Myocarditis and myocardial injury were suspected and may even be considered as one of the leading causes for death of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we focused on the condition of the heart, and sought to provide firsthand evidence for whether myocarditis and myocardial injury were caused by COVID-19. METHODS: We enrolled patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 retrospectively and collected heart-related clinical data, mainly including cardiac imaging findings, laboratory results and clinical outcomes. Serial tests of cardiac markers were traced for the analysis of potential myocardial injury/myocarditis. RESULTS: 112 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in our study. There was evidence of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients and 14 (12.5%) patients had presented abnormalities similar to myocarditis. Most of patients had normal levels of troponin at admission, that in 42 (37.5%) patients increased during hospitalization, especially in those that died. Troponin levels were significantly increased in the week preceding the death. 15 (13.4%) patients have presented signs of pulmonary hypertension. Typical signs of myocarditis were absent on echocardiography and electrocardiogram. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical evidence in our study suggested that myocardial injury is more likely related to systemic consequences rather than direct damage by the 2019 novel coronavirus.

It allows using a pair of any oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. Nevertheless, it may be difficult to ascribe a particular physicochemical property of the resulting PEM to a structural or chemical feature of a single component. A solution to this problem is based on the application of a polycation and a polyanion obtained by proper modification of the same parent polymer. Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) were prepared using the LbL technique from hydrophilic and amphiphilic derivatives of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH). PAH derivatives were obtained by the substitution of amine groups in PAH with sulfonate, ammonium, and hydrophobic groups. The PEMs were stable in 1 M NaCl and showed three different modes of thickness growth: exponential, mixed exponential-linear, and linear. Their surfaces ranged from very hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Root mean square (RMS) roughness was very variable and depended on the PEM composition, sample environment (dry, wet), and the polymer constituting the topmost layer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging of the surfaces showed very different morphologies of PEMs, including very smooth, porous, and structured PEMs with micellar aggregates. Thus, by proper choice of PAH derivatives, surfaces with different physicochemical features (growth type, thickness, charge, wettability, roughness, surface morphology) were obtained.","output":"Tuning the Surface Properties of Poly(Allylamine Hydrochloride)-Based Multilayer Films"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to this year's pandemic generated by the COVID 19 virus, eLearning and mLearning are here to stay more than ever.

On-site disinfection/sterilization with real-time monitoring of biomedical waste generated from the medical facilities is mandatory to prevent hospital-acquired infection (HAI). In this study, the life cycle assessment of two technologies, i.e., microwave (radiation-based) and autoclave (steam-based) were performed to summarize the inside-out evaluation of both technologies in terms of efficiency, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness. The results of disinfection efficacy indicated a log 10 reduction (almost 100%) in the vegetative load of microorganisms compared to the control, showing a similar level of disinfection efficacy of both strategies. Additionally, both technologies were compared on several parameters, and it was discovered that the autoclave uses more time and resources than the microwave. The total cost of an autoclave to the government is approximately double that of a microwave, while the operational cost of an autoclave is more than double that of a microwave. The findings from this study indicate that MACS may be used as a dry technique of biomedical disinfection, and its portability, tunability, and compactness make it a suitable alternative for biomedical disinfection and sterilization.

Previous interventions at the study site noted poor awareness on the need for inpatient Influenza vaccination(1). This study examines a vaccination reminder process using an electronic patient record (EPR) to identify high-priority eligible inpatients. METHODS: The study site is a 900-bed university teaching hospital with all clinical notes accessed via an EPR. We included a convenience sample of 750 adults aged50 years (mean age 75.9 +/? 0.4 years, 48% female) and high-priority for influenza vaccination (Age > 65 years and/or length of stay (LOS) >30 days) from October 1(st) 2020 to January 12(th) 2021. A live electronic dashboard identified eligible inpatients for vaccination, prompting vaccination reminders to the clinical teams via the antimicrobial pharmacist. Data was collected retrospectively. Logistic regression models reporting odds ratios were used to assess the association of these reminders with vaccine uptake. RESULTS: Over one third (35%, 264/750) of high-priority patients received the Influenza vaccine while inpatients, including 40% aged 80 years. The reminder was sent on 41% (305/750) of patients and was associated with an almost 50% higher likelihood of vaccination after adjusting for other covariates (Odds Ratio 1.48 (95% CI 1.00C2.20); p = 0.048). Other factors independently associated with vaccination were advancing age (Odds Ratio 2.69 (95% CI 1.12C6.47) for age  80 years); LOS (4% higher likelihood of vaccination for every additional day in hospital) and admission under geriatric medicine (Odds Ratio 3.71 (95% CI 2.45C5.62) when compared to other specialities). CONCLUSION: Our study shows relatively low uptake of inpatient Influenza vaccination and strategies to improve uptake are required. Reminders sent to clinical teams using the EPR appear to be an effective means of increasing Influenza vaccination and should be considered as part of this years inpatient vaccination drive.","output":"216 IMPROVING INPATIENT INFLUENZA VACCINATION RATESTHE VALUE OF AN ELECTRONIC PATIENT RECORD REMINDER SYSTEM"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to occur through a number of routes, including contact with contaminated surfaces. Many studies have used reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces, but seldom has viable virus been detected. This paper investigates the viability over time of SARS-CoV-2 dried onto a range of materials and compares viability of the virus to RNA copies recovered and whether virus viability is concentration dependent. Viable virus persisted for the longest time on surgical mask material and stainless steel, with a 99.9% reduction in viability by 122 and 114 h, respectively. Viability of SARS-CoV-2 reduced the fastest on a polyester shirt, with a 99.9% reduction within 2.5 h. Viability on the bank note was reduced second fastest, with 99.9% reduction in 75 h. RNA on all surfaces exhibited a 1-log reduction in genome copy number recovery over 21 days. The findings show that SARS-CoV-2 is most stable on nonporous hydrophobic surfaces. RNA is highly stable when dried on surfaces, with only 1-log reduction in recovery over 3 weeks. In comparison, SARS-CoV-2 viability reduced more rapidly, but this loss in viability was found to be independent of starting concentration. Expected levels of SARS-CoV-2 viable environmental surface contamination would lead to undetectable levels within 2 days. Therefore, when RNA is detected on surfaces, it does not directly indicate the presence of viable virus, even at low cycle threshold values. IMPORTANCE This study shows the impact of material type on the viability of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces. It demonstrates that the decay rate of viable SARS-CoV-2 is independent of starting concentration. However, RNA shows high stability on surfaces over extended periods. This has implications for interpretation of surface sampling results using RT-PCR to determine the possibility of viable virus from a surface, where RT-PCR is not an appropriate technique to determine viable virus. Unless sampled immediately after contamination, it is difficult to align RNA copy numbers to quantity of viable virus on a surface.","output":"Persistence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Virus and Viral RNA in Relation to Surface Type and Contamination Concentration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the need for training and re-certification of crew for the pandemic-related new normal and for a more sustainable cruise tourism industry.

To answer this question, we correlate findings of high-resolution CT (HRCT) with dyspnea scores and results of pulmonary function tests in patients during recovery from SARS. DESIGN: Retrospective follow-up cohort study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: Nineteen patients who recovered from SARS-related hospitalization. MEASUREMENTS: The study included HRCT scores (0 to 100), dyspnea scores (1 to 4), static and dynamic lung volumes, and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco). RESULTS: The interval between hospital discharge and HRCT study or functional assessment was 31.2  4.8 days (range, 25 to 38 days) [mean  SD]. All patients had HRCT abnormalities and were assigned to two groups: ground-glass opacity (GGO) only (n = 7, 36.8%) and GGO with fibrosis (GGO+F) [n = 12, 63.2%]. Most patients (16 of 19, 84.2%) had no zonal predominance.

METHODS: We used data from the UK Biobank, which included 15 871 people with gout. We used multivariable-adjusted logistic regression in the following analyses using a case-control study design: to test for an association between gout and COVID-19 diagnosis in the entire UK Biobank cohort (n=459 837); to test for an association between gout and COVID-19-related death in people who were known to have died or survived with COVID-19 (n=15 772); to test for an association between gout and COVID-19-related death in the entire UK Biobank cohort (n=459 837); and to assess risk of COVID-19-related death in a subset of patients from the UK Biobank cohort with prescription data, stratified by prescription of urate-lowering therapy and colchicine (n=341 398). Models 1 and 2 were adjusted for age group, sex, ethnicity, Townsend deprivation index, BMI, and smoking status. Model 2 was also adjusted for diagnosis of 16 other diseases that are established comorbidities of gout or established risk factors for COVID-19-related death. FINDINGS: Gout was associated with diagnosis of COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 120, 95% CI 111C129) but not with risk of COVID-19-related death in the cohort of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (120, 096C151). In the entire cohort, gout was associated with COVID-19-related death (129, 106C156); women with gout had an increased risk of COVID-19-related death (198, 134C294), whereas men with gout did not (116, 093C145). We found no significant differences in the risk of COVID-19-related death according to prescription of urate-lowering therapy or colchicine.

We present an all-comer data on peri-operative risk profile and in-hospital outcomes from Germany for patients treated by TAVI or isolated surgical aortic valve replacement (iSAVR) in 2020, providing an opportunity to compare study data with data from daily clinical practice. METHODS: Data concerning all isolated aortic valve procedures performed in Germany in 2020 were retrieved from the mandatory nationwide quality control program. Expected mortality was calculated with the annually revised German Aortic valve score (AKL-score) based on the data of either catheter-based (AKL-CATH) or isolated surgical (AKL-CHIR) aortic valve replacement in Germany from the previous year (2019). RESULTS: In 2020 21,903 TAVI procedures (20,810 transvascular (TV; vs. 2019: 22.973; ? 9.4%), 1093 transapical (TA; vs. 2019: 1413; ? 22.6%)) and 6144 (vs. 2019 7905; ? 22.5%) iSAVR were performed in Germany. Patients who received TAVI showed a significantly higher perioperative risk profile than patients undergoing iSAVR based on older age and more severe co-morbidities. While in-hospital mortality after TAVI (2.3%) was numerically lower than in 2019 (2.5%), this difference was not significant (p = 0.11). In-hospital mortality after iSAVR was identical in 2020 and 2019 (2.8%) and thus higher than after TAVI (p = 0.003), resulting in an observed expected mortality ratio of 1.02 after TAVI and 1.05 after iSAVR. After exclusion of the emergency procedures, in-hospital mortality did not differ significantly between the groups (TAVI 2.2% vs. iSAVR 1.9%, p = 0.26). CONCLUSION: Total numbers of both iSAVR and TAVI in Germany were lower in 2020 than in 2019, most likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the relative number of patients treated by TAVI as compared to iSAVR continues to increase. Despite older age and more severe comorbidities compared to patients undergoing iSAVR the in-hospital mortality after TAVI continued to decrease in 2020 and remains significantly lower than after iSAVR.

The aim is to share our experiences and outcomes during the first month of the Covid-19 pandemic, based on the strategies recommended and strategies we have implemented. METHODS: Our experience comes from our work at a referral hospital within the Spanish National Health System. Changes to clinical practice have largely been guided by the current evidence and four main principles: (1) patient and health-care worker protection, (2) uninterrupted necessary care, (3) conservation of health-care resources, (4) uninterrupted formation for residents. Based on these principles, changes in the service organization, elective clinical visits, emergency visits, surgical procedures, and inpatient and outpatient care were made. RESULTS: Using the guidance of experts, we were able to help the hospital address the demands of the Covid-19 outbreak. We reduced to a third of our orthopaedics and trauma hospital beds, provided coverage for general emergency services, and five ICUs, all continuing to provide care for our patients, in the form of 102 trauma surgeries, 6413 phone interviews and 520 emergency clinic visits. Also in the third week, we were able to restart morning meetings via telematics, and teaching sessions for our residents. On the other hand, eight of the healthcare personnel on our service (10.8%) became infected with Covid-19. CONCLUSIONS: As priorities and resources increasingly shift towards the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible to maintain the high standard and quality of care necessary for trauma and orthopaedics patients while the pandemic persists. We must be prepared to organize our healthcare workers in such a way that the needs of both inpatients and outpatients are met. It is still possible to operate on those patients who need it. Unfortunately, some healthcare workers will become infected. It is essential that we protect those most susceptible to severer consequences of Covid-19. Also crucial are optimized protective measures.","output":"Rethinking Trauma Hospital Services in one of Spain's Largest University Hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Process quality control of its ethanol precipitation is a topical issue in the pharmaceutical field. Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is commonly used for process quality analysis. However, establishing a robust and reliable quantitative model of complex process remains a challenge in industrial applications of NIR. In this paper, modeling design based on quality by design concept (QbD) was implemented for the ethanol precipitation process quality control of Honeysuckle flower. According to the 56 models' performances and 25 contour plots, quadratic model was the best with R(adj)(2) increasing from 0.1395 to 0.9085, indicating the strong interaction among spectral pre-processing methods, variable selection methods, and latent factors. SG9 and CARS was an appropriate combination for modeling. Furthermore, spectral assignment method was creatively introduced for variable selection. Another 56 models' performances and 25 contour plots were established. Compared with the chemometric variable selection method, spectral assignment combined with QbD concept made a higher R(pre)(2) and a lower RMSEP.

The objective of this study was to provide a comparative, prospective data analysis of CS components in an all-comers cohort and COVID-19 patients.

Clinical presentation, routine laboratory and von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen as well as CS components 3, 4 and activated 5 (C5a) were assessed. Also, total complement activity via the classical pathway (CH50) was determined. Levels of calprotectin in serum were measured using an automated quantitative lateral flow assay. We included 80 patients in this prospective trial. Of those 19 (23.7%) were tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Patients with COVID-19 had higher levels of CS components 5a and 4 (54.79 [24.14C88.79] ng/ml vs. 35 [23.15C46.1] ng/ml; p = 0.0433 and 0.3772 [ 0.1056] g/L vs. 0.286 [0.2375C0.3748] g/L; p = 0.0168). COVID-19 patients had significantly higher levels of vWF antigen when compared to the control group (288.3 [ 80.26] % vs. 212 [151C320] %; p = 0.0469). There was a significant correlation between CS C3 and 5a with vWF antigen (r(s) = 0.5957 [p = 0.0131] and r(s) = 0.5015 [p = 0.042]) in COVID-19 patients.

However, fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 has not been established to date. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the duration of fecal swab positivity in COVID-19 patients after pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test turned negative and to explore its potential for fecal-oral transmission. Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical records, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography (CT) findings of 17 COVID-19 patients confirmed by laboratory tests from January 22 to February 7, 2020 at a tertiary hospital was performed. The potential of fecal-oral transmission was assessed by detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in fecal swab samples. Results: A total of 16 patients (94.1%) had fever; other symptoms included dry cough, dyspnea, nausea, diarrhea, sore throat, fatigue, and muscle pain. Three patients had decreased white blood cell counts, 7 had decreased lymphocyte numbers, and 7 had increased C-reactive protein levels. Fecal samples of 11 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, of whom the time for the fecal samples to become SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-negative was longer in 10 patients than that for pharyngeal swab samples, and only one case exhibited a shorter time for his fecal sample to become SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-negative compared to his pharyngeal swab sample. The remaining 6 patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in fecal samples. Conclusion: In COVID-19 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in both pharyngeal swab and fecal samples, the time for the fecal samples to become SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-negative was generally longer than that in pharyngeal swab samples.

The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of bromhexine in intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Methods: An open-label randomized clinical trial study was performed in Tabriz, North-West of Iran. They were randomized to either the treatment with the bromhexine group or the control group, in a 1:1 ratio with 39 patients in each arm. Standard therapy was used in both groups and those patients in the treatment group received oral bromhexine 8 mg three times a day additionally. The primary outcome was a decrease in the rate of ICU admissions, intubation/mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Results: A total of 78 patients with similar demographic and disease characteristics were enrolled. There was a significant reduction in ICU admissions (2 out of 39 vs. 11 out of 39, P = 0.006), intubation (1 out of 39 vs. 9 out of 39, P = 0.007) and death (0 vs. 5, P = 0.027) in the bromhexine treated group compared to the standard group.

METHODS: The online survey, conducted on social media in May 2020, yielded 1393 responses across the country (66% from the Adriatic area). The questionnaire consisted of socio-demographic questions and questions on the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to PPE use. The &#967;2 test, t test, and multivariate logistic regression were used in data analysis. RESULTS: As many as 84.0% of participants reported the compliance with social distancing measures, while 52.8% reported using PPE (mask and/or gloves) when shopping or visiting friends and family. Participants demonstrated good knowledge (mean of 10.4 [95% CI 10.3-10.4] correct answers out of 13 questions) and neutral to moderately positive attitude about PPE use (mean of 36.6 [36.1-37.1] out of 50 points). Participants with higher education, women, and health care workers had a greater probability for having a high knowledge score. Women, older individuals, public transport users, people with more positive PPE use attitude, and those who complied with social distancing had a higher probability of PPE use, while health care workers and highly educated participants had a reduced probability of PPE use in public.

However, a limited information is available about which SARS-CoV-2 proteins are recognized by human B- and T-cell immune responses. Using a comprehensive computational prediction algorithm and stringent selection criteria, we have predicted and identified potent B- and T-cell epitopes in the structural proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The amino acid residues spanning the predicted linear B-cell epitope in the RBD of S protein (370-NSASFSTFKCYGVSPTKLNDLCFTNV-395) have recently been identified for interaction with the CR3022, a previously described neutralizing antibody known to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 through binding to the RBD of the S protein. Intriguingly, most of the amino acid residues spanning the predicted B-cell epitope (aa 331-NITNLCPFGEVFNATRFASVYAWNRK-356, 403-RGDEVRQIAPGQTGKIADYNYKLPD-427 and aa 437- NSNNLDSKVGGNYNYLYRLFRKSNL-461) of the S protein have been experimentally verified to interact with the cross-neutralizing mAbs (S309 and CB6) in an ACE2 receptor-S protein interaction independent-manner. In addition, we found that computationally predicted epitope of S protein (370-395) is likely to function as both linear B-cell and MHC class II epitope. Similarly, 403-27 and 437-461 peptides of S protein were predicted as linear B cell and MHC class I epitope while, 177-196 and 1253-1273 peptides of S protein were predicted as linear and conformational B cell epitope. We found MHC class I epitope 316-GMSRIGMEV-324 predicted as high af?nity epitope (HLA-A*02:03, HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*02:06) common to N protein of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (N317-325) was previously shown to induce interferon-gamma (IFN-) in PBMCs of SARS-recovered patients.

In this paper, we develop the first general decentralized cross-sector supply chain network model that captures the unique features of the scarce resources under fiscal-monetary policies. We formulate the model as a network equilibrium problem with finite-dimensional variational inequality theories. We then characterize the network equilibrium with a set of classic theoretical properties, as well as some novel properties (with $\\\\lambda_{min}$) that are new to the literature of network games application. Lastly, we provide a series of illustrative examples, including a medical glove supply chain, to showcase how our model can be used to investigate the efficacy of the imposed policies in relieving the supply chain distress and stimulating welfare.

In addition, the goal was to explore in more depth therapists views about the features that work and challenges of TR. A total of 850 therapists in the physio-, occupational-, speech and language-, and psychotherapy professions participated in the survey that included both quantitative and open-ended questions. The results show that 52% of all the therapists who participated in this study did take up TR with all or most of their clients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of all professionals who have carried out tele-rehabilitation during the pandemic, 46% planned to use TR regularly or probably also after the pandemic. There were also clear differences between the professions. Psychotherapists carried out TR during the pandemic and planned to use it also after the pandemic more often than the other professional groups. The qualitative analysis revealed that therapists identified several beneficial but also multiple challenging features of TR. Psychotherapists reported less challenges than other professions.

This study investigated the workload of HCWs responding to the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted from September 16 to October 15, 2020, involving 16 healthcare facilities (4 public medical centers, 12 tertiary-care hospitals) that provide treatment for COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Public medical centers provided the majority (69.4%) of total hospital beds for COVID-19 patients (n = 611), on the other hand, tertiary care hospitals provided the majority (78.9%) of critical care beds (n = 57). The number of beds per doctor (median [IQR]) in public medical centers was higher than in tertiary care hospitals (20.2 [13.0, 29.4] versus 3.0 [1.3, 6.6], P = 0.006). Infectious Diseases physicians are mostly (80%) involved among attending physicians. The number of nurses per patient (median [interquartile range, IQR]) in tertiary-care hospitals was higher than in public medical centers (4.6 [3.4C5] vs. 1.1 [0.8C2.1], P = 0.089). The median number of nurses per patient for COVID-19 patients was higher than the highest national standard in South Korea (3.8 vs. 2 for critical care). All participating healthcare facilities were also operating screening centers, for which a median of 2 doctors, 5 nurses, and 2 administrating staff were necessary.

METHODS: We used TriNetX, a global health collaborative clinical research platform collecting real-time electronic medical records data, which has one of the largest known global COVID-19 database. We included patients with chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorders (aNMD) [myasthenia gravis (MG), inflammatory myositis, and chronic inflammatory neuropathies (CIN)] and MS, based on the International Classification of Disease-10 (ICD-10) coding for one year before January 20th, 2020. We examined the use of IST, rate of COVID- 19, hospitalization, intubation, and mortality among the patients with aNMD and MS. RESULTS: A total of 33,451 patients with aNMD and 42,899 patients with MS were included. Among them, 111 (0.33%) patients with aNMD and 115 patients (0.27%) with MS had COVID-19.

Most of the phytoconstituents displayed good absorption and transport kinetics and were also found to display no associated mutagenic or adverse effect(s). Molecular docking analyses revealed that most of the WS phytoconstituents exhibited potent binding to human ACE2 receptor, SAR-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins as well as the two main SARS-CoV-2 proteases. Most of the phytoconstituents were predicted to undergo Phase-I metabolism prior to excretion. All phytoconstituents had favorable bioactivity scores with respect to various receptor proteins and target enzymes.

Furthermore, recent advances in the use of systems biology to probe the molecular networks driving immune response to vaccines (systems vaccinology) are revealing mechanistic insights and providing a new paradigm for the vaccine discovery and development process. Here, we review the known knowns and known unknowns of adjuvants, discuss these emerging concepts and highlight how our expanding knowledge about innate immunity and systems vaccinology are revitalizing the science and development of novel adjuvants for use in vaccines against COVID-19 and future pandemics.","output":"Emerging concepts in the science of vaccine adjuvants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A validated imaging marker for beta-cell mass would improve understanding of diabetes etiology and enable new strategies in therapy development.

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on people around the world and is expected to have a greater impact on people with disabilities. As a part of our Covid-19 pandemic study, we're looking at the impact of social support on patients with epilepsy (PWE). Objective: This study aims to assess social support and its effects on PWE during the Covid-19 pandemic. Patients and Methods: A total of 290 PWE were included in this study. Personal interviews with each patient were conducted using the Oslo Social Support Scale (OSSS 3) for measuring social support, the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHO 9) scale for diagnosing and assessing the severity of depression, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale for diagnosing and assessing the severity of anxiety (GAD 7). Results: During the pandemic, we observed a decrease in family support for PWE, which was associated with an increase in depression and anxiety. As the pandemic spreads, we found that a lack of social support is linked to an increase in depressive symptoms and seizures. Conclusion: Social support plays an important role in psychological well-being and for a better course of disease in PWE.

The virus has quickly spread to a large number of countries leading to a great number of deaths. Unfortunately, till today there is no specific treatment or vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. Most of the suggested treatment medications are based on in vitro laboratory investigations, experimental animal models, or previous clinical experience in treating similar viruses such as SARS-CoV-1 or other retroviral infections. The running of any clinical trial during a pandemic is affected at multiple levels. Reasons for this include patient hesitancy or inability to continue investigative treatments due to self-isolation/quarantine, or limited access to public places (including hospitals). Additional barriers relate to health care professionals being committed to other critical tasks or quarantining themselves due to contact with COVID-19 positive patients. The best research approaches are those that adapt to such external unplanned obstacles. Ongoing clinical trials before COVID-19 pandemic have the potential for identifying important therapies in the long-term if they can be completed as planned. However, these clinical trials may require modifications due a pandemic such as this one to ensure the rights, safety, and wellbeing of participants as well as medical staff involved in the conduction of clinical trials. Clinical trials initiated during the pandemic must be time-efficient and flexible due to high contagiousness of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the significant number of reported deaths, and time constraints needed to perform high quality clinical trials, enrolling adequate sample sizes. Collaboration between different countries as well as implementation of innovative clinical trial designs are essential to successfully complete such initiatives during the current pandemic. Studies looking at the long term sequalae of COVID-19 are also of importance as recent publications describe multi-organ involvement.

Our study aims to analyze the presence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions (OGDs) in patients with COVID-19 and to assess their onset and recovery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cross-sectional study was conducted in March 2021 retrospectively at Care Multispecialty Hospital, Vadodara. A total 301 patients were admitted, among those 280 qualify according to inclusion criteria and 3 patients denied to participate in the study. All patients presenting with laboratory-confirmed real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2 were included in the study. All 277 patients were undergone a diagnostic questionnaire through telephonic conversation which include patient main symptoms and self-assessment of loss of smell and taste and their onset and recovery. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-seven patients were included in this study. One hundred and fifty-three patients (55%) reported olfactory and gustatory disorders. Loss of taste and smell were more frequently reported in female patients (72.8%) than male patients (48%). Onset of these symptoms concomitant with other typical symptoms of COVID-19 is in 58.2% of cases. Recovery of symptoms in most patients was in 5C10 days and faster in younger patients.

Methods: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study carried out on cancer patients (n = 298). Results: We found that a majority of cancer patients were around 50 years old (hospitalized patients [HP]: 49.5  14.9; chemotherapy outpatients [COP]: 49.4  12.7), were female (HP: 74%; COP: 63.5%), and had received education at least up to elementary level (HP: 70%; COP: 80%). Breast cancer was the principal type of cancer (>34%) in both groups (HP and COP). The groups were comparable in age, sex distribution, place of origin, educational qualification, and type of cancer. Among HP, the experience and satisfaction scales of the NSNS showed good internal consistency (n = 235, &#945; >0.9, r > 0.7), while among COP, only the satisfaction scale showed good internal consistency (n = 62, &#945; = 1.00).

Overall, 177 COVID-19 cases were epidemiologically linked to the event, including seven hospitalisations and seven deaths (four in hospitalised persons). Investigation revealed noncompliance with CDC's recommended mitigation measures. To reduce transmission, persons should avoid large gatherings, practice physical distancing, wear masks, stay home when ill, and self-quarantine after exposure to a person with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Persons can work with local health officials to increase COVID-19 awareness and determine the best policies for organizing social events to prevent outbreaks in their communities. Persons should avoid large gatherings, practice physical distancing and hand hygiene, wear masks in public places, and stay home when ill to protect their family, friends, and the public.

Two possible hypotheses could explain this: protective adaptive immunity for influenza and other infections, or greater sensitivity to immunosenescence in the coronaviruses. Comparison of sex differences suggest an important role for adaptive immunity; but immunosenescence might also be relevant, if males experience faster immunosenescence.

METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with confirmed COVID\\\\19 from Wuhan Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China). Data were compared between those with and without myocardial injury. KaplanCMeier analysis and Cox regression models were used to describe the association between myocardial injury and poor prognosis. Simple correlation analyses were used to find factors associated with high\\\\sensitivity cardiac troponin I levels. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to explore the risk factors associated with myocardial injury. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the predictive value of the model. Of 353 patients included in the study, 79 presented myocardial injury. Patients with myocardial injury had higher levels of inflammation markers, poorer liver and kidney function, and more complications compared with patients without myocardial injury. High\\\\sensitivity cardiac troponin I levels were significantly associated with neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, creatinine, d\\\\dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and inflammatory cytokines and negatively associated with oxygen saturation. It was significantly associated with poor prognosis after adjusting for age, sex, and complications.

There is anecdotal evidence of successful induction and maintenance of remission with the monoclonal anti-IL-17A antibody secukinumab. Inhibition of IL-17A could therefore represent a potential new therapeutic option for the treatment of GCA. METHODS: This is a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, phase II study in which patients, treating physicians, and the associated clinical staff as well as the sponsor clinical team are blinded. It is designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of secukinumab compared to placebo in combination with an open-label prednisolone taper regimen. Patients included are na?ve to biological therapy and have newly diagnosed or relapsing GCA. Fifty patients are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 300 mg secukinumab or placebo subcutaneously at baseline, weeks 1, 2 and 3, and every 4 weeks from week 4. Patients in both treatment arms receive a 26-week prednisolone taper regimen. The study consists of a maximum 6-week screening period, a 52-week treatment period (including the 26-week tapering), and an 8-week safety follow-up, with primary and secondary endpoint assessments at week 28. Patients who do not achieve remission by week 12 experience a flare after remission or cannot adhere to the prednisolone tapering will enter the escape arm and receive prednisolone at a dose determined by the investigators clinical judgment. The blinded treatment is continued. Two optional imaging sub-studies are included (ultrasound and contrast-media enhanced magnetic resonance angiography [MRA]) to assess vessel wall inflammation and occlusion before and after treatment. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients in sustained remission until week 28 in the secukinumab group compared to the proportion of patients in the placebo group. A Bayesian approach is applied. DISCUSSION: The trial design allows the first placebo-controlled data collection on the efficacy and safety of secukinumab in patients with GCA.

Several deterministic and deep learning models have been employed in the recent years to forecast the concentration of particulate matter. Among them, deep learning models have shown promising results when it comes to modeling time series data and forecasting it. We have explored recurrent neural networks with LSTM model which shows potential to predict the particulate matter ([Formula: see text] ) based on multi-step multi-variate data of two of the most polluted regions of South Asia, Beijing, China and Punjab, Pakistan effectively. The LSTM model is tuned using Bayesian optimization technique to employ the appropriate hyper-parameters and weight initialization strategies based on the dataset. The model was able to predict [Formula: see text] for the next hour with root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.1913 (91.5% accuracy) and this error gradually increases with the number of time steps with next 24 hours steps prediction having RMSE of 0.7290. While in case of Punjab dataset with data recorded once a day, the RMSE for the next day forecast is 0.2192. These multi-step short-term forecasts would play a pivotal role in establishing an early warning system based on the air quality index (AQI) calculated and enable the government in enacting policies to contain it.","output":"Multi-step short-term [Formula: see text] forecasting for enactment of proactive environmental regulation strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study aimed to determine the effect of mental fatigue (MF) on total training volume (TTV; number of repetitions x number of sets x load) and on ratings of perceived exertion (RPE; Borg, 1982) in the half-back squat exercise (HBSE).

METHODS: A total of 109 patients with less than 5 years of CAPD for peritoneal ultrafiltration failure who switched to hemodialysis (withdrawal group) and 23 patients with more than 10 years of CAPD (long-term group) were retrospectively enrolled. Nonenhanced CT manifestations in both groups were compared, including thickening and calcification of the parietal peritoneum, calcification of the mesangial margin and free margin of the small intestine wall, and calcification of the mesentery and abdominal aorta. A risk stratification model was proposed based on CT manifestations with statistically significant differences. RESULTS: The presence of the following CT findings was significantly different between two groups: extensive thickening of the parietal peritoneum (78.9% vs. 21.7%, P < 0.01); severe calcification of the parietal peritoneum (60.6% vs. 8.7%, P < 0.01); calcification of the mesentery (32.1% vs. 4.3%, P < 0.05); and calcification of the free margin of the small intestine wall (49.5% vs. 13.0%, P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in calcification of the mesangial margin of the small intestine wall (40.3% vs. 30.4%) or in abdominal aortic calcification (56.9% vs. 61.1%) (P > 0.05).

Active mobility (walking, bicycling) is increasingly encouraged as a way to reduce traffic congestion and increase physical activity levels. However, it has raised concerns of increased exposure to UFP, due to increased breathing rates in traffic microenvironments, immediately close to their source. The recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) societal closures reduced commuting needs, allowing a natural experiment to estimate contributions from motorized traffic to UFP exposure while walking or bicycling. From late-March to mid-July 2020, UFP was repeatedly measured while walking or bicycling, capturing local COVID-19 closure (Phase 0) and subsequent phased re-opening (Phase 1, 2, 2.1 & 3). A DiSCmini continuously measured particle number concentration (PNC) in the walker/bicyclists breathing zone. PNC while walking or bicycling was compared across phased re-openings and the effect of ambient temperature, wind speed and direction, was determined using regression models. Approximately 40 repeated 20-minute walking and bicycling laps were made over 4 months during societal re-opening phases related to the COVID-19 pandemic, from late March to mid July 2020 in Copenhagen. Highest median PNC exposure of both walking (13,170 pt/cm3, standard deviation (SD): 3560 pt/cm3) and bicycling (21,477 pt/cm3, SD: 8964) was seen during societal closures (Phase 0) and decreased to 5,367 pt/cm3 (SD: 2949) and 8,714 pt/cm3 (SD: 4309) in Phase 3 of re-opening. These reductions in PNC were mainly explained by meteorological conditions, with most of the deviation explained by wind speed (14C22%) and temperature (13C10%). Highest PNC was observed along major roads and intersections. In conclusion, we observed decreases in UFP exposure while walking and bicycling during societal re-opening phases related to the COVID-19 pandemic, due largely to meteorological factors (e.g., wind speed and temperature) and seasonal variations in UFP levels.","output":"Exposure to ultrafine particles while walking or bicycling during COVID-19 closures: a repeated measures study in Copenhagen, Denmark"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientifically assessing the economic impact of major public health emergencies, containing their negative effects, and enhancing the resilience of an economy are important national strategic needs The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has, to date, been effectively contained in China, but the threat of imported cases and local risks still exist The systematic identification of the viruss path of influence and intensity is significant for economic recovery This study is based on a refined multi-regional general equilibrium analysis model, which measures the economic and industrial impacts at different epidemic risk levels in China and simulates development trends and the degree of damage to industries and the economy under changes to supplies of production materials and product demand The results show that, at the macroeconomic level, Chinas GDP will decline about 0 4% to 0 8% compared to normal in 2020, with an average drop of about 2% in short-term consumption, an average drop in employment of about 0 7%, and an average increase in prices of about 0 9% At the industry level, the epidemic will have the greatest short-term impact on consumer and laborintensive industries For example, the output value of the service industry will fall 6 3% compared to normal Looking at the impact of the epidemic on the industrial system, the province most affected by the epidemic is Hubei, which is the only province in China in the level-1 risk category As the disease spread outward from Hubei, there were clear differences in the main industries that were impacted in different regions In addition, simulation results of recovery intensity of regional economies under the two epidemic response scenarios of resumption of work and production and active fiscal stimulus policies show that an increase in fiscal stimulus policies produces a 0 3% higher rate of gross regional product growth but it causes commodity prices to rise by about 1 8% Measures to resume work and production offer a wider scope for industrial recovery","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on Chinas regional economies and industries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Misdiagnosis of pulmonary pathology may have several causes. Some of them are related to the unavailability of radiology specialists, the increasingly overwhelming number of Chest X-Ray images generated daily, or the respiratory disease by itself. Consequently, it might lead to radiologist burnout. Furthermore, an unusual location of pathological lung signs may lead to a misdiagnosis of severe pulmonary disease. Several pathological signs are observed from a Chest X-Ray and on different tissues: Heart and Pericardium, Hili, Mediastinum, Lungs, Pleura, and Chest wall. In the present study, a Deep Learning model is presented, which identifies several tissues and abnormal signs that may require a deeper evaluation. The model was trained using a total of 240,000 Chest X-Ray images, which can automatically identify several structures observed on a Chest X-Ray and some pathological signs of respiratory disease. The model reached 97% of accuracy. These results suggest that our model can be used as an automatic identifier of tissues and pathological signs from Chest X-Ray images. In consequence, it constitutes a meaningful and essential tool for preliminary studies of the severe respiratory disease since it can potentially decrease the number of false positives in the most common radiological examination ordered for patient evaluation. It also could be used for screening purposes to detect findings that may be useful in any pathology assessment, and in the decision-making process of conducting further image modality evaluations, such as CT.","output":"ToraxIA: Virtual Assistant for Radiologists Based on Deep Learning from Chest X-Ray"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The situation associated with the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19 in the world has had a significant impact on all sectors of the global economy The development of the Arctic shelf, as the most capital-intensive direction of the oil and gas complex, was also affected by macroeconomic circumstances that objectively arose during the post-pandemic At the same time, hydrocarbon production on the shelf of the Arctic implies intensive development of infrastructure, transport, loading of related industries, which allow generating significant multiplicative and complex-forming effects The development of offshore projects in the Arctic can become a driver, a locomotive of economic development not only in coastal regions, but also in the state as a whole ?

Methods: We prospectively studied the best timing for performing surgical tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients (n = 22) from April 2020 to May 2021 in the COVID-19 ICU attached to our COVID-19 hospital. The tracheotomised patients were followed up and the number and timing of the death were documented. Results: There were 14 males (male:female = 1.75:1). The mean duration of endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy was 14.4 days (range 10-22 days). The mean time for tracheostomy was 18.45 min (range 12-25 min). Five patients (22.7%) died after tracheostomy. The median time between tracheostomy and death was 4 days.

For FNSFs, early diagnosis and proper treatment are important. The objective of this study was to report FNSFs that occurred after excessive exercise using trampoline in middle-aged women. CASE SUMMARY: The patient was a 43-year-old woman who exercised jumping on a trampoline for 6 wk for 1-3 h a day to diet. Exercise includes repeated flexion-extension of the hip joint. The patient was admitted to the hospital due to sudden bilateral groin pain that occurred suddenly during a trampoline exercise. Hip magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral FNSFs. After 2 wk of follow-up with conservative treatment, the pain slightly decreased. However, it did not disappear completely. It was determined that it was difficult to control symptoms only by conservation treatment. Thus, closed reduction and internal fixation using a cannulated screw were performed for the more painful left hip joint. After operation, the pain was improved. Walking using crutches was possible. Follow-up MRI showed that the right femoral head signal was decreased compared to the left femoral head signal. Therefore, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and conservative treatment were provided. CONCLUSION: In middle-aged people, excessive trampoline exercise can repeat hip flexion and extension for a short period of time, leading to FNSFs.","output":"Femoral neck stress fractures after trampoline exercise: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a global pandemic, COVID\\\\19 impacts work\\\\related processes, placing strain upon many employees in project teams.

Increased physical activity (PA) is consistently associated with improved health and disease outcomes among early-stage survivors. However, there is a paucity of research on PA in patients with metastatic breast cancer, and existing PA interventions have exhibited low feasibility because of their focus on intense PA and/or requirement of on-site visits. Mobile health (mHealth)Cbased PA interventions may be particularly useful for patients with metastatic breast cancer because they allow for remote monitoring, which facilitates individual tailoring of PA recommendations to patients abilities and may minimize participant burden. However, no studies have examined mHealth PA interventions in patients with metastatic breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: We aim to address these critical research gaps by testing a highly tailored technology-based intervention to promote PA of any intensity (ie, light, moderate, or vigorous) by increasing daily steps in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The primary aim of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of the Fit2ThriveMB intervention. We will also examine outcome patterns suggesting the efficacy of Fit2ThriveMB on symptom burden, quality of life, and functional performance. METHODS: The Fit2ThriveMB trial is a two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial that will compare the effects of a smartphone-delivered, home-based PA intervention and an attention-control education condition on PA and quality of life in low-active female patients with metastatic breast cancer. A subsample (n=25) will also complete functional performance measures. This innovative trial will recruit 50 participants who will be randomized into the studys intervention or control arm. The intervention will last 12 weeks. The Fit2ThriveMB intervention consists of a Fitbit, coaching calls, and the Fit2ThriveMB smartphone app that provides self-monitoring, a tailored goal-setting tool, real-time tailored feedback, app notifications, and a group message board. Assessments will occur at baseline and post intervention. RESULTS: The Fit2ThriveMB study is ongoing. Data collection ended in February 2021. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study will provide the preliminary effect sizes needed to assemble an intervention that is to be evaluated in a fully powered trial. In addition, these data will provide essential evidence to support the feasibility and acceptability of using a technology-based PA promotion intervention, a scalable strategy that could be easily integrated into care, among patients with metastatic breast cancer.

Alimentary glucose absorption and intestinal disposal of blood glucose have not been directly compared between individuals or animals that underwent RYGB vs VSG. We evaluated in rats and humans how the gut epithelium adapts after surgery and the consequences on alimentary glucose absorption and intestinal disposal of blood glucose. METHODS Obese male rats underwent RYGB, VSG, or sham (control) operations. We collected intestine segments from all rats; we performed histologic analyses and measured levels of messenger RNAs encoding the sugar transporters SGLT1, GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, GLUT4, and GLUT5. Glucose transport and consumption were assayed using ex vivo jejunal loops. Histologic analyses were also performed on Roux limb sections from patients who underwent RYGB 1-5 years after surgery. Roux limb glucose consumption was assayed after surgery by positron emission and computed tomography imaging. RESULTS In rats and humans that underwent RYGB, the Roux limb became hyperplasic, with an increased number of incretin-producing cells compared with the corresponding jejunal segment of controls. Furthermore, expression of sugar transporters and hypoxia-related genes increased and the nonintestinal glucose transporter GLUT1 appeared at the basolateral membrane of enterocytes. Ingested and circulating glucose was trapped within the intestinal epithelial cells of rats and humans that underwent RYGB. By contrast, there was no hyperplasia of the intestine after VSG, but the intestinal absorption of alimentary glucose was reduced and density of endocrine cells secreting glucagon-like peptide-1 increased. CONCLUSIONS The intestine adapts differently to RYGB vs VSG.

Vitamin A deficiency in K14E7HPV expressing transgenic mice facilitates the formation of malignant cervical lesions. Infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer (CC), but viral infection alone does not guarantee the development of this malignancy. Indeed, deficiencies of dietary micronutrients could favor cervical cancer development in individuals that harbor HR-HPV infections. The status of retinoid levels, natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A, is important in maintaining cellular differentiation of the cervical epithelium. Moreover, many studies show a link between deficient intake of retinoids or alteration of the retinoid receptors and CC development. In spite of this, the effect of Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) in presence of HR-HPV oncoproteins on cervical carcinogenesis in vivo has not been reported. Transgenic mice expressing E6 or E7 oncoproteins (K14E6 or K14E7 mice, respectively) were used to evaluate the possible role of VAD in the development of malignant cervical lesions. The survival of the mice in VAD condition was studied and histopathological analysis and immunohistochemical detection of molecular cancer markers such as the tumor suppressor Retinoic Acid Receptor beta (RAR?), Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), Cleaved Caspase 3 and the tumor suppressor protein p16INK4A (inhibitor of CDK4) were performed. Our results show that K14E6/VAD mice showed moderate cervical dysplasia; notably, K14E7/VAD mice developed severe cervical dysplasia and cervical in situ carcinoma at an early age.

Our analysis was supported by host genetics, viral whole-genome sequencing, phylogenomic viral population analysis, and refined epidemiological data obtained from interviews with the involved subjects. The reinfection involved a 53-year-old woman with asthma (Case A), with a first COVID-19 episode in April 2020 and a much more severe second episode 4-1/2 months later, with SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in August, that required hospital admission.

For Brazilian seagrasses conservation, this scenario is especially challenging. An estimated area of +325a?km2 seagrass meadows was affected by the 2019 oil spill. However, this area is undoubtedly underestimated since seagrasses have not yet been adequately mapped along the 9000a?km-long Brazilian coast. In addition to scientific budget cuts, the flexibilization of public and environmental policies in recent years and absence of systematic field surveys due to COVID-19 has increased the underestimation of affected seagrass areas and ecosystem service losses due to the oil spill. Efforts to understand and solve the oil spill crisis were forced to stop (or slow down) due to COVID-19 and the economic crisis, leaving ecosystems and society without answers or conditions to identify the source(s) that was/were responsible for this spill, mitigate the damage to poor communities, promote adequate impact assessment or restoration plans, or properly monitor the environment. Our results highlight that pandemic and large-scale environmental disasters may have had a synergistic effect on the economy (e.g., artisanal fisheries and tourism), public health and ecology, mainly due to government inaction, social inequality and poorly studied tropical ecosystems. The results of this study also demonstrate the need to analyze the short- and long-term impacts of the combined effects (oil spill + COVID-19) on the recovery of the economy and coastal ecosystems.","output":"Oil spill + COVID-19: A disastrous year for Brazilian seagrass conservation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing guidelines have led to the limitation of hospital and clinic visits, with immunocompromised and high-risk patients advised to stay out of high-risk environments such as hospitals during non-emergent circumstances. Recruitment of study subjects is a Herculean task, and the limited number of patients seen face-to-face has required recruitment via telephone or virtual means. This presents difficulties in communication as well as missed opportunities. In this study, we evaluate precisely how challenging recruitment is during this time and compared these values to the relative 'ease' with which patients were recruited in the past. Method: Patients were identified and screened using EHRs (electronic health records), and health care providers were contacted regarding study involvement for potential subjects. Subjects were contacted via telephone, and a standardized script was followed by research coordinators conducting the calls to ensure uniformity. Unanswered calls were contacted a second time. Contacted patients were divided into four categories - those who did not pick up their telephones, those whose phone numbers were no longer in service, those who declined to participate, and those who agreed to participate. The number of willing subjects versus unwilling subjects was then compared to a previous study in which patients were recruited in a face-to-face environment. Furthermore, we evaluated the level of willingness patients expressed to participate during inperson introductions versus over the phone on a scale of willing, skeptical, and unwilling. Results: Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the development of many obstacles in patient recruitment. In our study, we found that although we are living in an era of advanced technology, patients still prefer face-to-face communication over virtual communication. When presented research studies face-to-face, patients showed more trust in the research coordinators as well as a greater sense of willingness to participate.","output":"Patient recruitment before and after the COVID-19 pandemic-impact of social distancing on communication and trust"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aims of this study were to characterize new SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled all over Italy and to reconstruct the origin and the evolutionary dynamics in Italy and Europe between February and June 2020. The cluster analysis showed only small clusters including < 80 Italian isolates, while most of the Italian strains were intermixed in the whole tree. Pure Italian clusters were observed mainly after the lockdown and distancing measures were adopted. Lineage B and B.1 spread between late January and early February 2020, from China to Veneto and Lombardy, respectively. Lineage B.1.1 (20B) most probably evolved within Italy and spread from central to south Italian regions, and to European countries. The lineage B.1.1.1 (20D) developed most probably in other European countries entering Italy only in the second half of March and remained localized in Piedmont until June 2020.

PURPOSE To assess the benefits and harms of VTC visits for disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment and to develop an evidence map describing gaps in the evidence. DATA SOURCES Systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from 1 January 2013 to 3 March 2021. STUDY SELECTION Two investigators independently screened the literature and identified 38 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) meeting inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION Data abstraction by a single investigator was confirmed by a second investigator; 2 investigators independently rated risk of bias. DATA SYNTHESIS Results from 20 RCTs rated low risk of bias or some concerns of bias show that the use of VTC for the treatment and management of specific diseases produces largely similar outcomes when used to replace or augment usual care. Nine of 12 studies where VTC was intended to replace usual care and 5 of 8 studies where VTC was intended to augment usual care found similar effects between the intervention and control groups. The remaining 6 included studies (3 intended to replace usual care and 3 intended to augment usual care) found 1 or more primary outcomes that favored the VTC group over the usual care group. Studies comparing VTC with usual care that did not involve in-person care were more likely to favor the VTC group. No studies evaluated the use of VTC for diagnosis or prevention of disease. Studies that reported harms found no differences between the intervention and control groups; however, many studies did not report harms. No studies evaluated the effect of VTC on health equity or disparities. LIMITATIONS Studies that focused on mental health, substance use disorders, maternal care, and weight management were excluded. Included studies were limited to RCTs with sample sizes of 50 patients or greater. Component analyses were not conducted in the studies. CONCLUSION Replacing or augmenting aspects of usual care with VTC generally results in similar clinical effectiveness, health care use, patient satisfaction, and quality of life as usual care for areas studied. However, included trials were limited to a handful of disease categories, with patients seeking care for a limited set of purposes.

However, little information is available defining which determinants of SARS-CoV-2 other than the spike glycoprotein are recognized by the host immune system. In this study, we focus on the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein as a suitable candidate target for vaccine formulations. Major B and T cell epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein are predicted and resulting sequences compared with the homolog immunological domains of other coronaviruses that infect human beings. The most dominant of B cell epitope is located between 176-206 amino acids in the SRGGSQASSRSSSRSRNSSRNSTPGSSRGTS sequence. Further, we identify sequences which are predicted to bind multiple common MHC I and MHC II alleles. Most notably there is a region of potential T cell cross-reactivity within the SARS-CoV-2 N protein position 102-110 amino acids that traverses multiple human alpha and betacoronaviruses. Vaccination strategies designed to target these conserved epitope regions could generate immune responses that are cross-reactive across human coronaviruses, with potential to protect or modulate disease.

To determine if social interactions and financial resources moderate the relationship between work loss and health. Methods Participants were Australians aged 18 + years that were employed in paid work prior to the COVID-19 pandemic who responded to an online or telephone survey from 27th March to 12th June 2020 as part of a prospective longitudinal cohort study. Outcome measures include Kessler-6 score > 18 indicating high psychological distress, and Short Form 12 (SF-12) mental health or physical health component score < = 45 indicating poor mental or physical health. Results The cohort consisted of 2,603 respondents, including groups who had lost their job (N = 541), were not working but remained employed (N = 613), were working less (N = 660), and whose work was unaffected (N = 789). Three groups experiencing work loss had greater odds of high psychological distress (AOR = 2.22-3.66), poor mental (AOR = 1.78-2.27) and physical health (AOR = 2.10-2.12) than the unaffected work group. Poor mental health was more common than poor physical health. The odds of high psychological distress (AOR = 5.43-8.36), poor mental (AOR = 1.92-4.53) and physical health (AOR = 1.93-3.90) were increased in those reporting fewer social interactions or less financial resources. Conclusion Losing work during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with mental and physical health problems, and this relationship is moderated by social interactions and financial resources.

Infectious Diseases OBJECTIVE: Rare coexistence of disease or pathology BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is associated with many hematological manifestations, including lymphopenia and thrombosis. There have been rare occasions in which thrombocytopenia has been reported as the sole clinical presentation of COVID-19. CASE REPORT: This is the case report of a 48-year-old Hispanic female patient with COVID-19 presenting as severe isolated thrombocytopenia. The patient presented to the Emergency Department with hemoptysis, spontaneous bruising, and excessive vaginal bleeding and also reported a recent flu-like illness. On examination, she was found to have bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhage, diffuse oral ulcers, epigastric abdominal tenderness, and ecchymosis on her chest, with scattered petechiae and palpable purpura on her lower limbs. Laboratory results were significant for a platelet count of 010(9) and an immature platelet fraction of 34.1%. Owing to clinical suspicion, the patient was tested for COVID-19, and her test result was positive. She was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, prednisone, rituximab, vitamin C, and zinc. Upon achieving hemodynamic stability, she was discharged to follow up with a hematologist in the outpatient setting. CONCLUSIONS: Hematological consequences of COVID-19 are becoming more prevalent. The mechanism behind this manifestation could be bone marrow failure, formation of platelet autoantibodies, or consumptive coagulopathy. These critical manifestations are necessary to manage, especially in severe forms like in our patient.

However, little information about feasibility and effectiveness is available yet about distance teaching in anatomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of a histology course previously taught in a classroom setting into an online-only format based on video conference software. METHODS: Our course design included theoretical introductions, an online-adaptation of virtual microscopy used previously in the classroom, and active learning elements such as collaborative learning in breakout rooms, annotation assignments and multiple-choice questions. Two preclinical semester cohorts of around 400 second and third semester students were taught in histology in parallel courses, using the Zoom software platform. We analyzed data about student attendance during the course, summative quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the students and results of a written test required to pass the course. RESULTS: We observed that student attendance was high and stable during the 19 course days for both second and third semester, and only few students reported technical problems. There were no significant differences in examination results of second semester compared to the third semester, an unexpected result as the third semester already participated in the dissection course before. Similarly, no significant gender-related effects on the examination performance could be noted in both semesters. However, the age of students was negatively correlated with test scores in the second and third semester. Importantly, the overall evaluation of the digital version of the histology course was at least as positive as the in-person version over the past years. CONCLUSION: Together, we experienced that the implementation of a curricular histology course in an online-format is technically realizable, effective and well accepted among students. We also observed that availability and prior experience with digitized specimen in virtual microscopy facilitates transition into an online-only setting. Thus, our study supports the positive potential of distance learning for teaching anatomy during and after COVID-19 pandemic but also emphasizes the need for a synchronous learning environment with partially personnel-intensive small group settings to overcome passivity and inequality aspects, and to foster active learning elements.","output":"Implementation of a fully digital histology course in the anatomical teaching curriculum during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Corona pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) calls on the Saudi government to take action to control the infection. The government closed borders, prohibited travel, limited outdoor movements, and told primary and secondary care facilities to reduce all regular non-urgent health services. It is not known whether these measures have impacted the prevalence of parasitic intestinal infections. This study has therefore been carried out to investigate this issue. Dataset of 217 stool samples submitted to the King Faisal Medical Complex (KFMC) Microbiology Laboratory in Taif, Saudi Arabia for parasitological examination during the pandemic (January-June 2020) and 649 samples submitted during the corresponding months of the previous year (January-June 2019) were extracted and analyzed. Overall, 24.1% (209/866) of samples were parasitespositives; 26.6% (173/649) before and 16.5% (36/217) during the pandemic, with 79% reduction. There was a significant difference in gender-parasitism between the two periods where the majority of parasitism were for males (p<0.001). Infections were frequent in patients aged 5- 14 years both before (84/649; 12.9%) and during (12/217; 5.5%) the pandemic, with significant difference observed between the two cohorts (p<0.002). Moreover, the majority of infected patients were non-Saudi (67.9%; 142/209), with a significant difference in nationality reported, (p=0.024).

manufacturing and higher safety, security, and efficiency for the whole society As an essential important link in these systems, sensors provide key value proposition and play a pivotal role Take wearable electronics as examples, the market value of wearable technology has doubled in the past five years Sensors have provided core functions for many different products during the development of wearable electronics, and they will continue to play a key role in future generation of products For example, smartwatches and skin patches are built based on the fitness tracking and daily activity data, and are used for medical measurement Virtual, augmented, and mixed reality devices rely on a set of sensors (e g inertial measurement unit, depth induction, force/pressure sensors) to enable users to interact with the content and environment Moreover, the transition from traditional human-computer interaction to a natural user interface will also depend on further advances in sensors Other products in different areas, such as autonomous vehicles, air detector, and smart clothing, are similar and depend on a set of core sensors that can interact with the body or the surrounding environment Some of these sensor systems have been gradually commercialized and expanded to more industrial, agricultural, military, environmental, and safety applications In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has also brought increased attention to sensors owing to their promising applications in tracking early onset and potential virus contacts, and remote patient monitoring of isolated patients In short, the sensor remains a fundamental component of the entire product line, which has been required to be thinner, lighter, smaller, more flexible, and sensitive in the new application systems Based on the important role of sensors, many preparation methods such as vapor deposition, lithography, nano-imprint lithography as well as printing have been developed Each technology has its unique advantages and adapts to different scenarios At the same time, their disadvantages that cannot be ignored also need to be addressed For instance, chemical and physical vapor deposition methods, including thermal evaporation, vacuum evaporation, magnetron sputtering, and molecular beam epitaxy, can produce high-quality materials and devices with good performance, but these technologies usually require expensive equipment and specific operating environment Moreover, it is difficult for these techniques to be compatible with flexible substrates and realize low-cost industrialized mass production In addition, photolithography and nano-imprint lithography are suitable for precision device fabrication However, they often face the challenges of low processing efficiency, low output, high cost due to the complex processing process, high design cost of mask, and long processing cycle In comparison, printing is a very attractive technology for low-cost large scale production But in most cases, the presence of mask limits the precision and resolution of the prepared micro/nano-sized devices Therefore, with the increasing demand for flexible, wearable, miniaturized, precise, integrated, and customized sensors, the new processing method with higher precision and more flexibility manners is needed to achieve controllable preparation To meet the developmental requirements of sensors, various processing techniques mentioned above are utilized to optimize and improve the sensor mainly from the aspects of the electrode, sensing material, and whole device In recent decade, laser micro-nano fabrication has been gradually developed and popular in the field of manufacturing The laser micro-nano fabrication changes the material state and property through the laser-material interaction and realizes the well-control of shape and property across scales With the advantages of large proc ssing speed, high precision, strong controllability, easy integration, and high compatibility with materials, the sensor fabricated by laser has ushered in a new development in structure regulation and performance optimization However, it still faces challenges and difficulties in mass production and efficiency promotion in practical applications Progress The laser processing technologies for the fabrication of sensors and sensing systems of different stimulus sources are summarized (Fig 2) Firstly, three laser processing modes widely used in sensor production including laser induced heating, reaction, and delamination are introduced The convenience and advantages of laser processing compared with those of the traditional processing technology can be clearly understood in the section of laser processing modes (Fig 3) Then, based on the existing research results, the sensor systems prepared by laser are classified into ultraviolet, gas, humidity, temperature, strain/stress, biology, and environmental monitoring sensors It is easily found that the advantages of laser micro-nano fabrication are mainly reflected in the following three aspects 1) Laser micro-nano fabrication has broadened the preparation approaches of electrodes and sensing materials It can realize in-situ or non-in-situ preparation of conductive electrodes and sensing materials by laser reduction, sintering, annealing, ablation, pulse deposition, laser induced carbonization, and hydrothermal reaction as well as other specific laser processing technologies, which provide alternative strategies for material preparation 2) Laser micro-nano fabrication simplifies the assembly process of the whole device The laser direct writing technology can realize in situ selective process in specific areas or specific materials, leading to great convenience for device construction Moreover, the whole sensor on flexible substrates can even be prepared by one-step laser fabrication through digital design 3) Laser micro-nano fabrication contributes to promote sensor performance Sensing material, as a key part of a single sensor, can be modified and regulated by laser processing, thus providing the possibility of performance optimization With these optimizations and improvements, the sensors become softer, smaller, and more customized and have higher integration Finally, we also analyze the problems existing in sensors fabricated by laser micro-nano fabrication, such as insufficient researches on laser-material interaction, limited processing accuracy and efficiency enhancement, and low level of device integration Conclusions and Prospect Laser micro-nano fabrication has gradually become a common and popular technology for sensing system preparation and integration To sum up, the sensor fabricated by laser still needs in-depth and detailed exploration

We find that during the first five weeks of the pandemic, higher occupational unemployment risk did not result in lower relative spending. However, in later weeks as the pandemic proceeded, higher occupational unemployment risk resulted in lower relative spending. We attribute this change to the evolution of perceptions regarding unemployment risk, and the expiration of stimulus payments and expanded unemployment insurance benefits provided under the CARES Act.

In addition, we aimed to describe the overall event rate of pre-existing cerebrovascular disease in COVID-19 patients. In our analysis, 5,614 cases have been studied, out of these patients 164 cases have developed cerebrovascular comorbities.

This sub-inquiry aimed to understand the experiences of persons with a history of substance use and incarceration in the Fraser East region of BC and how involvement with the criminal justice system affected their drug use and perceived risk of overdose. METHODS The Fraser East Overdose Response project utilized a community-based participatory action approach that included peer researchers with lived experience in all parts of the research process. This qualitative pilot study aimed to better understand individuals at risk of an unwitnessed overdose in order to prevent deaths and identify effective local responses. A snowball sampling technique was used to recruit persons aged 19 and over who used illicit drugs over the past 3 years in the Fraser East since 2016. In total, 22 participants were interviewed. Of these, 13 participants identified a history of incarceration. Interviews were analyzed using a framework analysis approach. RESULTS The perspectives that participants shared revealed that impacts from incarceration are influenced by policies but also highly individualized. Our inquiry found three broader themes, within which were situated differing and sometimes conflicting interpretations and experiences of systemic environments: (1) incarceration was associated with harms and was perceived to increase risk of overdose following release, (2) incarceration was perceived to have limited impact on substance use and overdose risk, and (3) incarceration was associated with a perceived reduction of substance use and overdose risk. CONCLUSIONS Understanding the complexities of the perceptions of those with lived experience of substance use and incarceration is of importance to better inform interventions in this population.

A procedure to remotely test multiple characteristics of playback devices does not currently exist. Thus, the main goals of this study were to (i) develop and (ii) evaluate a comprehensive, efficient, and easy-to-handle test procedure for the reliable control and identification of playback device characteristics in online experiments. Based on a counting task paradigm, the first part of the Headphone and Loudspeaker Test (HALTCPart I) was developed with which researchers can standardize sound level adjustments, detect stereo/mono playback, and assess lower frequency limits. In a laboratory study (N = 40), HALTCPart I was evaluated with four playback devices (circumaural and intra-aural headphones; external and laptop loudspeakers). Beforehand, the acoustical properties of all playback devices had been measured (e.g., sound pressure level, frequency response, total harmonic distortion). The analysis suggested that HALTCPart I has high testCretest reliability (r(tt) = .90 for level adjustment and r(tt) = .79 for stereo/mono detection) and is an efficient (3.5 minutes for completion) method to remotely test playback devices and listening conditions (sound level, stereo/mono playback).

Self-reporting is the main method used to diagnose depression and to determine the severity of depression. However, it is not easy to discover patients with depression owing to feelings of shame in disclosing or discussing their mental health conditions with others. Moreover, self-reporting is time-consuming, and usually leads to missing a certain number of cases. Therefore, automatic discovery of patients with depression from other sources such as social media has been attracting increasing attention. Social media, as one of the most important daily communication systems, connects large quantities of people, including individuals with depression, and provides a channel to discover patients with depression. In this study, we investigated deep-learning methods for depression risk prediction using data from Chinese microblogs, which have potential to discover more patients with depression and to trace their mental health conditions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the potential of state-of-the-art deep-learning methods on depression risk prediction from Chinese microblogs. METHODS: Deep-learning methods with pretrained language representation models, including bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), robustly optimized BERT pretraining approach (RoBERTa), and generalized autoregressive pretraining for language understanding (XLNET), were investigated for depression risk prediction, and were compared with previous methods on a manually annotated benchmark dataset. Depression risk was assessed at four levels from 0 to 3, where 0, 1, 2, and 3 denote no inclination, and mild, moderate, and severe depression risk, respectively. The dataset was collected from the Chinese microblog Weibo. We also compared different deep-learning methods with pretrained language representation models in two settings: (1) publicly released pretrained language representation models, and (2) language representation models further pretrained on a large-scale unlabeled dataset collected from Weibo. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were used as performance evaluation measures. RESULTS: Among the three deep-learning methods, BERT achieved the best performance with a microaveraged F1 score of 0.856. RoBERTa achieved the best performance with a macroaveraged F1 score of 0.424 on depression risk at levels 1, 2, and 3, which represents a new benchmark result on the dataset. The further pretrained language representation models demonstrated improvement over publicly released prediction models. CONCLUSIONS: We applied deep-learning methods with pretrained language representation models to automatically predict depression risk using data from Chinese microblogs. The experimental results showed that the deep-learning methods performed better than previous methods, and have greater potential to discover patients with depression and to trace their mental health conditions.","output":"Depression Risk Prediction for Chinese Microblogs via Deep-Learning Methods: Content Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Noise in computed tomography (CT) images may occur due to low radiation dose. Hence, the main aim of this paper is to reduce the noise from low dose CT images so that the risk of high radiation dose can be reduced. BACKGROUND: The novel corona virus outbreak has ushered in different new areas of research in medical instrumentation and technology. Medical diagnostics and imaging are one of the ways in which the area and level of infection can be detected. OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 attacks people who have less immunity, so infants, kids, and pregnant women are more vulnerable to the infection. So they need to undergo CT scanning to find the infection level. But the high radiation diagnostic is also fatal for them, so the intensity of radiation needs to be reduced significantly, which may generate the noise in the CT images. METHOD: In this paper, a new denoising technique for such low dose Covid-19 CT images has been introduced using a convolution neural network (CNN) and the method noise-based thresholding. The major concern of the methodology for reducing the risk associated with radiation while diagnosing. RESULTS: The results are evaluated visually and also by using standard performance metrics. From comparative analysis, it was observed that proposed works gives better outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed low-dose COVID-19 CT image denoising model is therefore concluded to have a better potential to be effective in various pragmatic medical image processing applications in terms of noise suppression and clinical edge preservation.","output":"Low-Dose COVID-19 CT Image Denoising Using CNN and its Method Noise Thresholding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The biological abilities of interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been under investigation for nearly 40 years. IL-6 works through an interaction with the complex peptide IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). IL-6 is built with four &#945;-chain nanostructures, while two different chains, IL-6R&#945; (gp80) and gp130/IL6? (gp130), are included in IL-6R. The three-dimensional shapes of the six chains composing the IL-6/IL-6R complex are the basis for the nanomolecular roles of IL-6 signalling. Genes, pseudogenes and competitive endogenous RNAs of IL-6 have been identified. In the present review, the roles played by miRNA in the post-transcriptional regulation of IL-6 expression are evaluated. mRNAs are absorbed via the 'sponge' effect to dynamically balance mRNA levels and this has been assessed with regard to IL-6 transcription efficiency. According to current knowledge on molecular and nanomolecular structures involved in active IL-6 signalling, two different IL-6 models have been proposed. IL-6 mainly has functions in inflammatory processes, as well as in cognitive activities. Furthermore, the abnormal production of IL-6 has been found in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; also known as COVID-19). In the present review, both inflammatory and cognitive IL-6 models were analysed by evaluating the cytological and histological locations of IL-6 signalling. The goal of this review was to illustrate the roles of the classic and trans-signalling IL-6 pathways in endocrine glands such as the thyroid and in the central nervous system. Specifically, autoimmune thyroid diseases, disorders of cognitive processes and SARS-CoV-2 virus infection have been examined to determine the contribution of IL-6 to these disease states.","output":"Interleukin-6 signalling as a valuable cornerstone for molecular medicine (Review)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the available evidence on the use of antiseptics and disinfectants in the face of VIDOC-19 infection METHOD: Bibliographic search in the main databases (WOS, CCC, DIIDW, KJD, MEDLINE, RSCI, SCIELO, PubMed, BMJ Best Practice, Cochrane Library, UptoDate) and on the web of official bodies in March 2020, using descriptors and truncations.

Their tropism is primarily determined by the ability of the spike (S) protein to bind to a host cell surface receptor. The rapid outbreak of emerging novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV 2 in China inculcates the need for the development of hasty and effective intervention strategies. Medicinal plants and natural compounds have been traditionally used to treat viral infections. Here, we generated VSV based pseudotyped viruses (pvs) of SARS-, MERS-, and SARS-2 CoVs to screen entry inhibitors from natural products. In the first series of experiments, we demonstrated that pseudotyped viruses specifically bind on their receptors and enter into the cells. SARS and MERS polyclonal antibodies neutralize SARSpv and SARS-2pv, and MERSpv respectively. Incubation of soluble ACE2 inhibited entry of SARS and SARS-2 pvs but not MERSpv. In addition, expression of ACE2 and DPP4 in non-permissive BHK21 cells enabled infection by SARSpv, SARS-2pv, and MERSpv respectively. Next, we showed the antiviral properties of known enveloped virus entry inhibitors, Spirulina and Green tea extracts against CoVpvs. SARSpv, MERSpv, and SARS-2pv entry were blocked with higher efficiency when preincubated with either green tea or spirulina extracts. Green tea provided a better inhibitory effect than the spirulina extracts by binding to the S1 domain of spike and blocking the interaction of spike with its receptor. Further studies are required to understand the exact mechanism of viral inhibition. In summary, we demonstrate that pseudotyped virus is an ideal tool for screening viral entry inhibitors. Moreover, spirulina and green tea could be promising antiviral agents against emerging viruses.","output":"Green tea and Spirulina extracts inhibit SARS, MERS, and SARS-2 spike pseudotyped virus entry in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona viruses were first identified in 1931 and SARS-CoV-2 is the most recent COVID-19 is a pandemic that put most of the world on lockdown and the search for therapeutic drugs is still on-going Therefore, this study uses in silico screening to identify natural bioactive compounds from fruits, herbaceous plants and marine invertebrates that are able to inhibit protease activity in SARS-CoV-2(PDB: 6LU7) We have used various screening strategies such as drug likeliness, antiviral activity value prediction, molecular docking, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion), molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and MM/GBSA (molecular mechanics/generalized born and surface area continuum solvation) 17 compounds were shortlisted using Lipinskis rule 5 compounds revealed significantly good predicted antiviral activity values and out of them only 2 compounds, Macrolactin A and Stachyflin, showed good binding energy values of -9 22 and -8 00 kcal/mol within the binding pocket, catalytic residues (HIS 41 and CYS 145) of Mpro These two compounds were further analyzed for their ADME properties The ADME evaluation of these 2 compounds suggested that they could be effective as therapeutic agents for developing drugs for clinical trials MD simulations showed that protein-ligand complexes of Macrolactin A and Stachyflin were stable for 100 nano seconds The MM/GBSA calculations of Mpro C Macrolactin A complex indicated higher binding free energy (-42 58  6 35 kcal/mol) with Mpro protein target receptor (6LU7) DCCM and PCA analysis on the residual movement in the","output":"Nature Potential for COVID-19: Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro Inhibitor with Bioactive Compound (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel COVID-19 disease has highlighted the vulnerability of small and developing economies in managing what is now a global health crisis This study presents the preliminary overview of the dynamics of the spread and expansion of COVID-19 as the disease takes its footprint in the Caribbean The study explored the spatial clusters of the disease and its variations in the Caribbean region Data was gathered from the World Health Organization reports and collated into a cross sectional data set Spatial mapping and spatial lag analysis were conducted to identify spread patterns and statistical relationships with several relevant socioeconomic variables Models showed the prominence of cases and deaths in countries highly related to the spatial connection of countries with mainland countries and the availability of medical services in the country Results also similar social distancing policies adopted in the region and the possible connection between prevalence of diabetes and hypertension regionally impacted the number of deaths It is hoped that the findings presented here will be useful in planning for an epidemiological response for the region based on the differences in the patterns for possible interventions and actions","output":"COVID-19 Modelling in the Caribbean: Spatial and Statistical Assessments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This column anticipates challenges likely to be faced by psychotherapists and their patients after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic subsides.

To address current limitations, we developed a quantitative full-length direct cDNA sequencing strategy to simultaneously profile viral and host cell transcripts. This nanopore-based approach couples processive reverse transcriptases with a novel one-step chemical ablation of 3 RNA ends (termed CASPR) which decreases ribosomal RNA reads and enriches for poly-adenylated coding sequences. We extensively validate our approach using synthetic reference transcripts and show CASPR doubles the breadth of coverage per transcript and increases detection of long transcripts (>4kb), while being functionally equivalent to PolyA+ selection for transcript quantification.

Our framework builds on the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to structure our approach and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to guide our choice of outcome variables and scalability. METHODS: Four hospital EDs will receive the SurgeCon quality improvement intervention. Using a stepped wedge cluster design, each ED will be randomized to one of four start dates. Data will be collected before, during, and after the implementation of the intervention. RE-AIM will be used to guide the assessment of SurgeCon, and guided by CFIR, we will measure ED key performance indicators (KPI), patient-reported outcomes, and implementation outcomes related to SurgeCons scalability, adaptability, sustainability, and overall costs. Participants in this study consist of patients who visit any of the four selected EDs during the study period, providers/staff, and health system managers. A mixed-methods approach will be utilized to evaluate implementation outcomes. DISCUSSION: This study will provide important insight into the implementation and evaluation techniques to enhance uptake and benefits associated with an ED surge-management platform.

Recognizable patterns of radiographic progression were determined by comparing the overall mean percentage of lung involvement for each patient on serial radiographs. RESULTS Initial chest radiographs were abnormal in 108 of 138 (78.3%) patients and showed air-space opacity. Lower lung zone (70 of 108, 64.8%) and right lung (82 of 108, 75.9%) were more commonly involved. In most patients, peripheral lung involvement was more common (81 of 108, 75.0%). Unifocal involvement (59 of 108, 54.6%) was more common than multifocal or bilateral involvement. No cavitation, lymphadenopathy, or pleural effusion was demonstrated. Four patterns of radiographic progression were recognized: type 1 (initial radiographic deterioration to peak level followed by radiographic improvement) in 97 of 138 patients (70.3%), type 2 (fluctuating radiographic changes) in 24 patients (17.4%), type 3 (static radiographic appearance) in 10 patients (7.3%), and type 4 (progressive radiographic deterioration) in seven patients (5.1%). Initial focal air-space opacity in 44 of 59 patients (74.6%) progressed to unilateral multifocal or bilateral involvement during treatment. CONCLUSION Predominant peripheral location; common progression pattern from unilateral focal air-space opacity to unilateral multifocal or bilateral involvement during treatment; and lack of cavitation, lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion are the more distinctive radiographic findings of SARS.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome: radiographic appearances and pattern of progression in 138 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread have created a global health emergency. The resemblance with SARS-CoV in spike protein suggests that SARS-CoV-2 employs spike-driven entry into angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-expressing cells. From a stem cell perspective, this review focuses on the possible involvement of ACE2+ stem/progenitor cells from both the upper and lower respiratory tracts in coronavirus infection. Viral infection-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury occur because of dysregulation of the immune response. Mesenchymal stem cells appear to be a promising cell therapy given that they favorably modulate the immune response to reduce lung injury. The use of exogenous stem cells may lead to lung repair. Therefore, intervention by transplantation of exogenous stem cells may be required to replace, repair, remodel, and regenerate lung tissue in survivors infected with coronavirus. Ultimately, vaccines, natural killer cells and induced-pluripotent stem cell-derived virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes may offer off-the-shelf therapeutics for preventing coronavirus reemergence.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection and stem cells: Interaction and intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chylothorax after esophagectomy is a serious complication that is associated with major morbidity due to dehydration and malnutrition.

Deployment of digital technologies in clinical research can enable collection of large volumes of clinically relevant data that may not be captured using conventional psychometric questionnaires and patient-reported outcomes. Rigorous methodology studies to develop novel digital endpoints in depression are warranted. Objective: We conducted an exploratory, cross-sectional study to evaluate several digital technologies in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and persistent depressive disorder (PDD), and healthy controls. The study aimed at assessing utility and accuracy of the digital technologies as potential diagnostic tools for unipolar depression, as well as correlating digital biomarkers to clinically validated psychometric questionnaires in depression. Methods: A cross-sectional, non-interventional study of 20 participants with unipolar depression (MDD and PDD/dysthymia) and 20 healthy controls was conducted at the Centre for Human Drug Research (CHDR), the Netherlands. Eligible participants attended three in-clinic visits (days 1, 7, and 14), at which they underwent a series of assessments, including conventional clinical psychometric questionnaires and digital technologies. Between the visits, there was at-home collection of data through mobile applications. In all, seven digital technologies were evaluated in this study. Three technologies were administered via mobile applications: an interactive tool for the self-assessment of mood, and a cognitive test; a passive behavioral monitor to assess social interactions and global mobility; and a platform to perform voice recordings and obtain vocal biomarkers. Four technologies were evaluated in the clinic: a neuropsychological test battery; an eye motor tracking system; a standard high-density electroencephalogram (EEG)-based technology to analyze the brain network activity during cognitive testing; and a task quantifying bias in emotion perception. Results: Our data analysis was organized by technology C to better understand individual features of various technologies. In many cases, we obtained simple, parsimonious models that have reasonably high diagnostic accuracy and potential to predict standard clinical outcome in depression.

This may be especially important to study among youth, who are less likely to experience severe symptoms but contribute to the spread of the virus. Objective: To examine psychological correlates of adolescents behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Self-report survey conducted between March 20th and March 22nd, 2020. Setting: This is an online survey study of youth from the United States.Participants: A population-based sample of adolescents were recruited via social media to complete an anonymous survey. Youth were eligible if they had internet access, lived in the United States, and were between the ages of 13 and 18. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes included COVID-19 news monitoring, social distancing, disinfecting, and hoarding behaviors over the 7 days after the US declared a national emergency. The correlates measured were attitudes about COVID-19 severity, values related to social responsibility, social trust, and self-interest. The a priori hypotheses were that attitudes about the severity of COVID-19, along with greater social responsibility and social trust, would be associated with greater news monitoring, social distancing, and disinfecting, whereas greater self-interest would be associated with more hoarding. Results: The final analytic sample included 770 adolescents (Mage = 16.34, 72% female). The majority of teens reported not engaging in pure social distancing (70%), but were monitoring the news (75%) and engaging in at least one disinfecting behavior multiple times per day (88%). Some teens reported engaging in hoarding behavior (19%). Greater attitudes about the severity of COVID-19 were associated with more social distancing, disinfecting, and news monitoring, but also more hoarding. Greater social responsibility was associated with more disinfecting and news monitoring, and less hoarding. Participants who reported valuing their own self-interest over others reported less social distancing and more hoarding. Greater social trust was associated with less hoarding.Conclusions and Relevance: Emphasizing the severity of COVID-19 and the social implications of pandemic-related behaviors may be important for teens, particularly for those who are not following recommended preventative health behaviors or who are engaging in hoarding.","output":"Psychological Correlates of News Monitoring, Social Distancing, Disinfecting, and Hoarding Behaviors among US Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Neurological manifestations are frequent during COVID-19 but have been poorly studied as prognostic markers of COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess whether neurological manifestations are associated with a poor prognosis of COVID-19, and which patient and COVID-19 characteristics were associated with encephalopathy. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study and included patients admitted with COVID-19 in four hospitals from Recife, Brazil. Data were collected by reviewing medical records. RESULTS: 613 were included; 54.6% were male, the median age was 54 (41C68) years, 26.4% required mechanical ventilation, and 24.1% died. The neurological symptoms presented were: myalgia (25.6%), headache (22%), fatigue (22%), drowsiness (16%), anosmia (14%), disorientation (8.8%), ageusia (7.3%), seizures (2.8%), and dizziness (1.5%). Twelve patients (2%) had strokes (ischemic strokes: 9) and 149 (24.3%), encephalopathy. Older age, a prolonged hospitalization, diabetes mellitus, a previous history of stroke and having epileptic seizures during hospitalization were significantly associated with the occurrence of encephalopathy. Older age, smoking and requiring mechanical ventilation were associated with prolonged hospitalization. Older patients, those requiring mechanical ventilation and those with encephalopathy presented a significantly higher risk, while those who had anosmia presented a significantly lower risk of dying.

Elderly Healthcare Voucher Scheme has been introduced by the Hong Kong Government since 2009 to provide subsidy to elderly aged 65 and above to visit ten different types of private primary care providers for curative, preventive and chronic disease management. Several enhancements have been made over the past few years. This paper (as part of an evaluation study of this unique healthcare voucher scheme) aims to assess the long term impact of the voucher scheme in encouraging the use of primary care services. METHODS Two rounds of cross-sectional survey among elderly in Hong Kong were conducted in 2010 and 2016. Propensity score matching and analysis were used to compare changes in perception and usage of vouchers over time. RESULTS 61.5% of respondents in 2016 agreed \\"the scheme encourages me to use more private primary care services\\", a significant increase from 36.2% in 2010. Among those who agreed in 2016, the majority thought the voucher scheme would encourage them to use acute services (90.3%) in the private sector, rather than preventive care (40.3%) and chronic disease management (12.2%). Respondents also reported that their current usual choice of care was visiting \\"both public and private doctors\\" (61.9%), representing a significant increase (up from 48.4%) prior to their use of voucher. CONCLUSIONS The voucher scheme has encouraged the use of more private care services, particularly acute services rather than disease prevention or management of chronic disease. However, there needs to be caution that the untargeted and open-ended nature of voucher scheme could result in supply-induced demand which would affect long term financial sustainability. The dual utilization of health services in both the public and private sector may also compromise continuity and quality of care. The design of the voucher needs to be more specific, targeting prevention and chronic disease management rather than unspecified care which is mainly acute and episodic in order to maximize service delivery capacity as a whole for equitable access in universal health coverage and to contribute to a sustainable financing system.","output":"What is the long term impact of voucher scheme on primary care?

Studying the social determinants of health (S DH) and its impact on the populations during the crisis will help governments deal better with health emergencies so that every person can have an equal opportunity to stay healthy. Objective: To determine what factors affect PTSS, we conducted a study to investigate the association between structural determinants of health and PTSS during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 370 people referred to a selected laboratory between June and July 2020 in Karaj province, Iran. Post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 8-item inventory was used to evaluate the PTSS and its subscales, including intrusion, avoidance, and hypervigilance in the participants. Results: Overall, 51.2% of participants were male, and 17.3% were positive for the IgM or IgG COVID-19 test. The most common symptoms in these patients were weakness, myalgia, cough, anosmia, and fever. The prevalence of total PTSS, intrusion, avoidance, and hypervigilance symptoms were 7.1%, 25.7%, 41.6%, and 16.2%, respectively. In univariable regression analysis, female gender (p-value=0.01, 95%CI (2.25-0.31)), un-employment (p-value=0.011, 95%CI (0.37-2.81)), having symptoms of COVID-19 disease (p-value=0.000, 95%CI (.82-2.75)), underlying chronic disease, were directly associated with PTSS.

While numerous randomized trials support the efficacy of telehealth to treat conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and insomnia, relatively little is known about patients' experiences and perceptions of telehealth in typical practice. Methods: We recruited a purposive sample of patients who had sleep provider encounters via one of three telehealth modalities: in-clinic video, home-based video, and telephone. We conducted semi-structured interviews to assess general telehealth experiences, elicit perceptions around most and least helpful aspects, and contrast their experiences with in-person care. Two analysts coded transcripts using content analysis. After review of coding and categorization, the analysts identified emergent themes that cut across participants and categories. Results: We conducted interviews with 35 patients (in-clinic video n=12, home-based video n=11, telephone n=12) at two VA medical centers from June 2019 to May 2020. Five themes emerged including access to care, security and privacy, personalization of care, patient empowerment, and unmet needs. 1) Access to care: Patients perceived that telehealth provided access to sleep care in a timely and convenient manner, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients also saw telehealth as a way to improve continuity of care with their preferred providers. 2) Security and Privacy: Patients described how home-based telehealth afforded them greater feelings of safety and security within appointments due to avoidance of anxiety provoking triggers (e.g. crowds). However, patients also noted a potential loss of privacy when telehealth was delivered at home. 3) Personalization of care: Patients outlined ways in which telehealth both improved and hindered their ability to communicate their individual needs to providers. In turn, this communication translated into the delivery of personalized care and positive health impacts. 4) Patient Empowerment: Patients described how telehealth empowered them to engage in self-management for their sleep disorders. 5) Unmet Needs: Patients recognized that there were specific areas where telehealth was not meeting their needs, including lack of follow-through with PAP therapy. Patients also expressed concerns around the lack of a physical examination. Conclusion: Patients described both positive and negative experiences with telehealth, highlighting areas where care can be further adapted to better suit their needs. As we continue to refine telehealth practices, we encourage providers and hospital systems to consider these aspects of the patient experience.","output":"Patient experiences with telehealth in sleep medicine: A qualitative evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Nipah Virus (NiV) was first isolated during a 1998C9 outbreak in Malaysia. The outbreak initially infected farm pigs and then moved to humans from pigs with a case-fatality rate (CFR) of about 40%. After 2001, regular outbreaks occurred with higher CFRs (~71%, 2001C5, ~93%, 2008C12). The spread arose from drinking virus-laden palm date sap and human-to-human transmission. Intrinsic disorder analysis revealed strong correlation between the percentage of disorder in the N protein and CFR (Regression: r(2) = 0.93, p < 0.01, ANOVA: p < 0.01). Distinct disorder and, therefore, genetic differences can be found in all three group of strains. The fact that the transmission modes of the Malaysia strain are different from those of the Bangladesh strains suggests that the correlations may also be linked to the modes of viral transmission. Analysis of the NiV and related viruses suggests links between modes of transmission and disorder of not just the N protein but, also, of M shell protein. The links among shell disorder, transmission modes, and virulence suggest mechanisms by which viruses are attenuated as they passed through different cell hosts from different animal species.

Although we saw the largest reduction in outpatient imaging (72.3%), there was also a significant decrease in inpatient (40.5%) and emergency department (48.9%) imaging volumes. DISCUSSION: The use of multiple communication channels was critical in relaying the information to all our stakeholders, patients, referring physicians, and the radiology workforce. Teamwork, quick adoption, and adaptation of changing strategies was important given the fluidity of the situation.","output":"Rescheduling Nonurgent Care in Radiology: Implementation During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess clinical characteristics and outcomes of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in western India. Out of 86 PLHIV with COVID-19 illness, 19.7% had severe/critical illness and 6 (6.9%) individuals died. Median (interquartile range) age was 51 (47-56) years and 77.6% were male. Eighty-five PLHIV were on antiretroviral treatment with 98% having a viral load <200 copies/mL. Hypertension (HTN) (38.3%) and diabetes mellitus (17.4%) were commonest comorbidities. Fifty-eight percent PLHIV were hospitalized while 6.9% individuals needed intensive care. Presence of medical comorbidity was significantly associated with severe/critical COVID-19, whereas HTN was significantly associated with mortality. Recovery from COVID-19 was documented in 93% PLHIV. In conclusion, PLHIV in western India have similar COVID-19 clinical outcomes as compared with those reported historically among general population.

EXPERT OPINION For infections caused by Aspergillus, Candida and Pneumocystis jirovecii, PCR testing is recommended, combination with serological testing will likely enhance the diagnosis of these diseases. For other IFD (e.g. Mucormycosis) molecular diagnostics, represent the only non-classical mycological approach towards diagnoses and continued performance validation and standardization has improved confidence in such testing. The emergence of antifungal resistance can be diagnosed, in part, through molecular testing. Next-generation sequencing has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of fungal phylogeny, epidemiology, pathogenesis, mycobiome/microbiome and interactions with the host, while identifying novel and existing mechanisms of antifungal resistance and novel diagnostic/therapeutic targets.","output":"An overview of using fungal DNA for the diagnosis of invasive mycoses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo Partindo de uma problematiza??o acerca da no??o de periculosidade e do dispositivo da medida de seguran?a, este relato tem como objetivo trazer ao debate experincias de um programa de extens?o pautado nas rela??es entre sade mental, direitos humanos e sistema penal.

However, best practices remain a challenge in healthcare delivery especially in resource limited situations. The primary objective of this study was to assess the infection prevention and control (IPC) preparedness levels of acute healthcare facilities in Ghana and to determine the factors associated with the overall IPC preparedness levels in acute healthcare facilities. Methods: A cross-sectional study adapting the IPC assessment framework (IPCAF) developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) was conducted. Five of the core components of the WHO IPCAF were used to assess the IPC level of 56 acute healthcare facilities in Ghana. Results: Of the 56 facilities surveyed, only 19 had an IPC program with clearly defined objectives. Overall, 8 (14.3%) facilities scored an IPC preparedness level of \\"Advance\\", 18 (32.1%) facilities received an \\"Intermediate\\" IPC preparedness score, 23 (41.1%) facilities received an IPC preparedness level of \\"basic\\" and 7 (12.5%) facilities scored an IPC preparedness level of \\"inadequate\\". IPC materials like detergents, running water and PPEs were not significantly supplied. Government owned facilities performed better in terms of IPC preparedness as compared to privately owned facilities. A PLUM-ordinal regression analysis revealed that an IPC program with clearly defined objectives (OR= 76; 95% CI; 7.23, 808.19), dedicated IPC budget (OR= 13; 95% CI; 3.8-44.3) and regular mandatory training (OR= 50.9; 95% CI; 6.1-425) were associated with increased IPC preparedness.

This observation supported the importance of non-coding RNAs and it was confirmed in several organisms. The most abundant non-translated transcripts are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). In contrast to protein-coding RNAs, they show a more cell-specific expression. To understand the function of lncRNAs, it is fundamental to investigate in which cells they are preferentially expressed and to detect their subcellular localization. Recent improvements of techniques that localize single RNA molecules in tissues like single-cell RNA sequencing and fluorescence amplification methods have given a considerable boost in the knowledge of the lncRNA functions. In recent years, single-cell transcription variability was associated with non-coding RNA expression, revealing this class of RNAs as important transcripts in the cell lineage specification. The purpose of this review is to collect updated information about lncRNA classification and new findings on their function derived from single-cell analysis. We also retained useful for all researchers to describe the methods available for single-cell analysis and the databases collecting single-cell and lncRNA data.

This requirement along with the asymptomatic nature of COVID-19 in a significant proportion of the population, has prompted the need for a risk assessment tool-kit that can provide a rational behind prioritization and allocation of limited available medical resources. The purpose of this study is to compose a scientific-rationale-based COVID-19-Self-Assessment-Test (C19SAT) framework, which helps develop a basis for measuring the risk of COVID-19 exposure with self-assessment. The study comprises of two major parts- (1) identification of key components of the C19SAT framework by studying various guidelines (WHO & CDC) and relevant literature, and (2) quantification of those components by assigning weight through the analysis of survey results and opinions from medical physicians and experts. A C19SAT framework is developed to measure the risk of covid-19 exposure, comprising a set of identified components (12 parameters and their corresponding attributes) and their corresponding weights. As the scientific rationale behind such assessment framework has not been reported to date in case of available mobile applications and web-based toolkit, the present study brings the novelty and reports the construction of such a framework.

To help inform WHO recommendations, we modelled various HPV vaccination strategies to examine the optimal use of limited vaccine supplies and best allocation of scarce resources in LMICs in the context of the WHO global call to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem. METHODS: In this mathematical modelling analysis, we developed HPV-ADVISE LMIC, a transmission-dynamic model of HPV infection and diseases calibrated to four LMICs: India, Vietnam, Uganda, and Nigeria. For different vaccination strategies that encompassed use of a nine-valent vaccine (or a two-valent or four-valent vaccine assuming high cross-protection), we estimated three outcomes: reduction in the age-standardised rate of cervical cancer, number of doses needed to prevent one case of cervical cancer (NNV; as a measure of efficiency), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; in 2017 international $ per disability-adjusted life-year [DALY] averted). We examined different vaccination strategies by varying the ages of routine HPV vaccination and number of age cohorts vaccinated, the population targeted, and the number of doses used. In our base case, we assumed 100% lifetime protection against HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-31, HPV-33, HPV-45, HPV-52, and HPV-58; vaccination coverage of 80%; and a time horizon of 100 years. For the cost-effectiveness analysis, we used a 3% discount rate. Elimination of cervical cancer was defined as an age-standardised incidence of less than four cases per 100 000 woman-years. FINDINGS: We predicted that HPV vaccination could lead to cervical cancer elimination in Vietnam, India, and Nigeria, but not in Uganda. Compared with no vaccination, strategies that involved vaccinating girls aged 9C14 years with two doses were predicted to be the most efficient and cost-effective in all four LMICs. NNV ranged from 78 to 381 and ICER ranged from $28 per DALY averted to $1406 per DALY averted depending on the country. The most efficient and cost-effective strategies were routine vaccination of girls aged 14 years, with or without a later switch to routine vaccination of girls aged 9 years, and routine vaccination of girls aged 9 years with a 5-year extended interval between doses and a catch-up programme at age 14 years. Vaccinating boys (aged 9C14 years) or women aged 18 years or older resulted in substantially higher NNVs and ICERs. INTERPRETATION: We identified two strategies that could maximise efforts to prevent cervical cancer in LMICs given constraints on vaccine supplies and costs and that would allow a maximum of LMICs to introduce HPV vaccination.

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, radiological imaging, management, and outcome of COVID-19 infection in patients of diabetes mellitus and its association with glycemic control. METHODS: The present study was designed to evaluate the difference between uncontrolled and controlled diabetes for COVID-19 manifestations by enrolling 80 admitted COVID-19 patients. Patients were categorized into two groups, where group 1 had patients with uncontrolled diabetes as indicated by HbA1c > 8 g% and group 2 had patients with controlled diabetes as indicated by HbA1c < 8 g%. Information concerning medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, radiological imaging, management, and outcome was extracted from medical records for evaluation, interpretation, and association among both the groups. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients with uncontrolled diabetes exhibited a severe symptomatic presentation, excessive uncontrolled inflammatory responses, and hypercoagulable state. Total leukocyte count, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, serum levels of IL-6, FDP, and D-dimer were significantly raised (p < 0.05) in case of uncontrolled diabetes as compared with controlled diabetes. Radiological findings detected by chest radiograph and computed tomography chest suggested severe lung involvement in uncontrolled diabetes. COVID-19 patients with uncontrolled diabetes required intensive treatment as compared with controlled diabetes group in terms of insulin therapy (p = 0.0226) and non-invasive ventilation (p = 0.0292). Patients with uncontrolled diabetes had higher mortality (p = 0.0375) and required prolonged hospitalization (p = 0.0479) as compared with controlled diabetes group. CONCLUSION: From the current study, it can be concluded that uncontrolled diabetic condition might be a risk factor for severity and morbidity of COVID-19 patients. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus might be responsible for an overall higher susceptibility for COVID-19 infection and severity in terms of symptomatic presentation, inflammatory storm, rapid pulmonary invasion, requirement of more intensive treatment, and a poor outcome.","output":"Impact of glycemic control in diabetes mellitus on management of COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In Belgium, the provision of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention is centralized in specialized HIV clinics. Engaging family physicians in PrEP care could help scale-up its delivery and reach underserved populations. The objective of this study was to gain insight into family physicians' self-perceived roles in providing PrEP. METHODS: We conducted 16 online group discussions with a total of 105 Flemish family physicians, between November 2020 and February 2021. A brief online questionnaire assessed their socio-demographics and experience with sexual health. We analyzed verbatim transcribed data using a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Despite limited awareness and experience, participants reported a high willingness to be more actively involved in PrEP care. Four potential roles for the family physician in PrEP care were identified: acting as low-threshold entry point for advice; opportunistic case finding of PrEP candidates; initiating appropriate care for PrEP-eligible clients; and ensuring high-quality follow-up care for PrEP users. Participants framed each of these roles within their current activities and responsibilities as primary care providers. Yet, participants differed in their views on the concrete operationalization of these roles, and in the extent of their involvement in PrEP. Particular challenges were a lack of experience with antiretrovirals, perceived limited exposure to clients at high HIV risk, and a lack of expertise and resources to conduct time-intensive risk assessments and counseling related to PrEP. CONCLUSION: Belgian family physicians demonstrated a keen willingness to be involved in PrEP care, but had differing views on the practical implementation into their practices. Providing tailored training on sexual health and PrEP, and investing in collaboration between primary and secondary care, could optimize the integration of PrEP in the primary care practice.","output":"How Do Family Physicians Perceive Their Role in Providing Pre-exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention?CAn Online Qualitative Study in Flanders, Belgium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus is a pandemic in the world.

Therefore, the nature of this study is primary epidemiological research that aims to overcome the limitations mentioned above by proposing a large-scale publicly available dataset of chest computed tomography scan (CT-scan) images consisting of more than 13k samples. Secondly, we propose a more sensitive deep neural networks model for CT-scan images of the lungs, providing a pixel-wise attention layer on top of the high-level features extracted from the network. Moreover, the proposed model is extended through a transfer learning approach for being applicable in the case of chest X-Ray (CXR) images. The proposed model and its extension have been trained and evaluated through several experiments. The inclusion criteria were patients with suspected PE and positive real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. The exclusion criteria were negative or inconclusive RT-PCR and other chest CT indications.

Symptom-based case definitions that guide public health surveillance and individual patient management in the community must be optimized for COVID-19 pandemic control. Methods: We collected daily symptom diaries and performed RT-PCR on respiratory specimens over a 14-day period in 185 community members exposed to a household contact with COVID-19 in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Salt Lake City, Utah metropolitan areas. We interpreted the discriminatory performance (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, F-1 score, Youden's index, and prevalence estimation) of individual symptoms and common case definitions according to two principal surveillance applications (i.e., individual screening and case counting). We also constructed novel case definitions using an exhaustive search with over 73 million symptom combinations and calculated bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals stratified by children versus adults. Findings: Common COVID-19 case definitions generally showed high sensitivity (86-96%) but low positive predictive value (PPV) (36-49%; F-1 score 52-63) in this community cohort. The top performing novel symptom combinations included taste or smell dysfunction. They also improved the balance of sensitivity and PPV (F-1 score 78-80) and reduced the number of false positive symptom screens. Performance indicators were generally lower for children (<18 years of age). Interpretation: Existing COVID-19 case definitions appropriately screened in community members with COVID-19.

In this article four neural network-based deep learning architectures namely MLP, CNN, RNN, RNN with LSTM, and two Supervised Machine Learning Techniques such as SVM and LR are implemented to investigate and compare their suitability to track the mental depression from EEG Data. Result Among Neural Network-Based Deep Learning techniques RNN model has achieved the highest accuracy with 97.50 % in Training Set and 96.50 % in the Testing set respectively. It has been followed with RNN with LSTM model when there were 40% data in the Testing Set. Whereas both the Supervised Machine Learning Models namely SVM and LR have outperformed with 100.00 % accuracies in Training Phase and approximately 97.25 % accuracies in Testing Phase respectively. Conclusion This investigation and comparison-oriented study establish the suitability of RNN, RNN with LSTM, SVM and LR model to track mental depression from EEG data. This type of comparative research using Machine Learning and Deep learning architectures must be framed out on this topic to finalize the design and development of an expert system for the automatic detection of depression from EEG data.","output":"A Deep Learning-Based Comparative Study to Track Mental Depression from EEG Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel SARS-CoV-2 has quickly become a global pandemic since the first reported case in December 2019, with the virus infecting millions of people to date The spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus plays a key role in binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 S proteins that are expressed on the cell membrane can initiate receptor-dependent syncytia formation that is associated with extensive tissue damage Formation of syncytia have been previously observed in cells infected with various other viruses (e g , HIV, Ebola, Influenza, and Herpesviruses) However, this phenomenon is not well documented and the mechanisms regulating the formation of these syncytia by SARS-CoV-2 are not fully understood In this study, we investigated the possibility that cell fusion events mediated by the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 interaction can occur in different human cell lines that mimic different tissue origins These cell lines were stably transduced with either wild-type (WT-S) S protein or a mutated variant where the ER-retention motif was removed (19-S), or human ACE2 vectors Different co-culture combinations of spike-expressing 293T, A549, K562, and SK-Hep1 cells with hACE2-expressing cells revealed cell hybrid fusion However, only certain cells expressing S protein can form syncytial structures as this phenomenon cannot be observed in all co-culture combinations Thus, SARS-CoV-2 mediated cell-cell fusion represents a cell type-dependent process which might rely on a different set of parameters Recently, the 19-S variant is being widely used to increase SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus production for in vitro assays Comparison of cell fusion occurring via 19-S expressing cells shows defective nuclear fusion and syncytia formation compared to WT-S This distinction between the 19-S variant and WT-S protein may have downstream implications for studies that utilize pseudovirus-based entry assays Additionally, this study suggest that spike protein expressed by vaccines may affect different ACE2-expressing host cells after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration The long-term effects of these vaccines should be monitored carefully","output":"Deletion of ER-retention Motif on SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Reduces Cell Hybrid During Cell-cell Fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its discovery by Holzworth in 1962, the study of the Feline Coronavirus (FCoV) has have a great interest because it can affect wildlife and domestic felines.

From a historical point of view, more than a century of immense corporate fecundity has formed the ecological conditions and shaped current understanding of the effect of public health on CSR. This study sought to examine the extent to which companies are able to balance their business interest with social interest through health-related CSR and how knowledge of them can help explain the potential impact of COVID-19. Method: This study employs a narrative review of current literature; however, the integrative strategy was combined with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist to rigorously select the necessary articles for proper integrative synthesis. Results: We note that in the pursuit of their social responsibility, corporate enterprises struggle to balance the interest of society and their own interest. Genuine CSR activities such as donations are often undermined by unbridled and excessive desire to draw society on themselves to reap economic benefits are largely dominated by the need to advance. There are signals that enterprises might see COVID-19-related CSR as an entry door to increase corporate influence thereby commercializing the pandemic. Conclusions: The impact of COVID-19 on CSR is epochal. There is a moral obligation for enterprises to reform current risk assessments and collaborate more deeply with state agencies to invest in the health and safety inspections at the world place. CSR strategies must be proactive to endure other unknown pandemics with equal capacity to disrupt business operations.

To assess the long-term impact of a SARS-CoV-2-infection on the immune system, we conducted a prospective study of 80 acute and former SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and 39 unexposed donors to evaluate autoantibody responses and immune composition. Autoantibody levels against cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), a specific predictor for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), were significantly (p = 0.035) elevated in convalescents only, whereas both acute COVID-19 patients and long-term convalescents showed critically increased levels of anti-tissue transglutaminase (TG), a specific predictor of celiac disease (CD) (p = 0.002). Both, anti-CCP and anti-TG antibody levels were still detectable after 4C8 months post infection. Anti-TG antibodies occurred predominantly in aged patients in a context of a post-SARS-CoV-2-specific immune composition (R(2) = 0.31; p = 0.044). This study shows that increased anti-CCP and anti-TG autoantibody levels can remain long-term after recovering even from mildly experienced COVID-19.

In this transition, a reduction in mortality is followed by a reduction in fertility, creating larger, older populations in which the main causes of illness and death are no longer acute infections of children but chronic diseases of adults. Since the year 2000, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have provided a framework for accelerating the decline of infectious diseases, backed by a massive injection of foreign investment to low-income countries. Despite the successes of the MDGs era, the inhabitants of low-income countries still suffer an enormous burden of disease owing to diarrhoea, pneumonia, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other pathogens. Adding to the predictable burden of endemic disease, the threat of pandemics is ever-present and global. With a view to the future, this review spotlights five aspects of the fight against infection beyond 2015, when the MDGs will be replaced by a new set of goals for poverty reduction and sustainable development. These aspects are: exploiting the biological links between infectious and non-infectious diseases; controlling infections among the new urban majority; enhancing the response to international health threats; expanding childhood immunization programmes to prevent acute and chronic diseases in adults; and working towards universal health coverage.

This situation prompted us to evaluate the bioactive compounds which are being used to prevent respiratory-related illness. Lut is one such compound which is used as an anti-inflammatory agent. Several studies have explained the protective nature of Lut by inhibiting virus entry and fusion with human receptors in old SARS-CoV that had emerged in 2003. Thus, regular consumption of foods having adequate amount of Lut in our diet may be helpful in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 infection as well and may prevent the consequent symptoms in COVID-19 patients. In present work, we have carried out the molecular docking studies of Lut with six different SARS-CoV-2 encoded key proteins. The FDA-approved drug remdesivir was also evaluated as control to compare the results. Lut showed excellent inhibitory action against papain-like proteinase, a main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Lut was also many times more active than remdesivir. Therefore, the foods which have Lut in adequate amount might be explored further for potential use against COVID-19","output":"Luteolin: A Dietary Molecule as Potential Anti-COVID-19 Agent"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease  19 telah ditetapkan oleh WHO (World Health Organization) atau Badan Kesehatan Dunia sebagai Kedaruratan Kesehatan Masyarakat yang Meresahkan Dunia (KMMD).

These restrictions are likely to have impacted upon the health and well-being of marginalised groups who rely on now closed social and community support services to stay healthy. An understanding of the experiences of marginalised people is important; therefore, this study aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on the health and well-being of marginalised groups in the UK. METHODS: In summer 2020, a rapid telephone survey was conducted by trained, trusted volunteers with 76 participants who were from marginalised groups. As part of this survey, 64 participants consented to describe their experience of lockdown. These case studies were thematically analysed to identify patterns of meaning. RESULTS: Findings indicate that lockdown led to the deterioration of health of participants, impacted adversely on their socio-economic positions and affected access to food and essential supplies. In addition, government public health messaging was considered confusing and inadequate. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the need for pathways into services which support marginalised groups to remain accessible during periods of restrictions and essential supplies and food to be mapped and protected for marginalised individuals within our local communities.","output":"An exploration of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) restrictions on marginalised groups in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multiplex imaging technologies are now routinely capable of measuring more than 40 antibody-labeled parameters in single cells.

How to systematically understand the complex interaction mechanism between human microbes and drugs remains a challenge nowadays. Identifying microbe-drug associations can not only provide great insights into understanding the mechanism, but also boost the development of drug discovery and repurposing. Considering the high cost and risk of biological experiments, the computational approach is an alternative choice. However, at present, few computational approaches have been developed to tackle this task. RESULTS: In this work, we leveraged rich biological information to construct a heterogeneous network for drugs and microbes, including a microbe similarity network, a drug similarity network and a microbe-drug interaction network. We then proposed a novel graph convolutional network (GCN)-based framework for predicting human Microbe-Drug Associations, named GCNMDA. In the hidden layer of GCN, we further exploited the Conditional Random Field (CRF), which can ensure that similar nodes (i.e. microbes or drugs) have similar representations. To more accurately aggregate representations of neighborhoods, an attention mechanism was designed in the CRF layer. Moreover, we performed a random walk with restart-based scheme on both drug and microbe similarity networks to learn valuable features for drugs and microbes, respectively. Experimental results on three different datasets showed that our GCNMDA model consistently achieved better performance than seven state-of-the-art methods. Case studies for three microbes including SARS-CoV-2 and two antimicrobial drugs (i.e. Ciprofloxacin and Moxifloxacin) further confirmed the effectiveness of GCNMDA in identifying potential microbe-drug associations.

Self-organizing neural networks possess the capability for clustering countries in the space domain based on their similar characteristics with respect to their coronavirus cases. In this form enabling finding the countries that are having similar behavior and thus can benefit from utilizing the same methods in fighting the virus propagation. To validate the approach, publicly available datasets of coronavirus cases worldwide have been used. In addition, a fuzzy fractal approach is utilized for the temporal analysis of time series of the countries.

Cooperation between these professionals ensures the integrated management of patients with infectious diseases and the appropriate use of antimicrobials in hospitals. The COVID-19 pandemic forced hospital pharmacists to abruptly suspend all their structured activities and concentrate on the health crisis. Realtime information sharing between different medicine specialties is an effective strategy to generate and maintain treatment protocols adapted to each center, with continuous evidence-based modifications as new publications appear. Hospital pharmacies had to reorganize their activities to respond to the pandemic. On the one side were patients with COVID-19, and on the other were routine hospital pharmacy tasks, with the added difficulty of adapting to individual protection measures. New communication and collaboration strategies were adopted. Protocols were established for the management of COVID-19 patients, with continuous changes; special medications had to be prepared and distributed; circuits were designed for the home- or institution-based care of patients; internal circuits were created to minimize the movements of hospital staff and professionals caring for COVID-19 patients. The most effective antiviral drug and anti inflammatory therapy remains elusive. In this scenario, hospital pharmacists emerge as a key player, as they have a deep understanding of the mechanisms of action of drugs and potential interactions.

This study established the dissolved ozone flotation (DOF) process as the advanced treatment process to replace the original electrocatalytic system (ECS) which exhibited low organic and suspended solids removal efficiency. Higher and more stable organic matter, suspended solids and turbidity removal efficiency were obtained for the DOF process. Consequently, the lower fouling potential and higher water production rate of treated water from DOF process was observed for the following reverse osmosis (RO) system. In addition, brine drilling fluids can be successfully prepared using DOF effluent directly, which exhibited promising practical implications in the advanced drilling wastewater treatment. Based on organic matter fractionation and redundancy analysis (RDA), the hydrophobic acid (HOA), hydrophobic neutral (HON) and hydrophilic fraction (HI) contents significantly impacted brine drilling fluid preparation. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, the aromatic carbon species in the HOA, HON and HI fractions were found to be the critical factors deteriorating the brine drilling fluid preparation. However, oxygen-containing groups played a positive role.

Physical health is not the only aspect of humans that is at risk. Globally, the rates and severity of mental illness are being significantly impacted by this pandemic. Two scales have been validated to measure the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the levels of anxiety and obsessional thinking in clinical and non-clinical populations. The present study was designed to investigate the levels of anxiety and obsessions related to COVID-19 in the general public of Lahore, Pakistan. Materials and Methods: Data were collected via snowball sampling from May 9 to May 19. An online survey consisting of a demographic profile and two scales, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) and Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (OCS), was sent through email, WhatsApp, and Facebook groups to adults (18 years and above) of Lahore, Pakistan. Results: A total of 240 individuals (20% men and 80% women) recorded their responses. The majority belonged to a nuclear family system (60%), and their education level ranged from high school to Ph.D. The cut-off score for probable dysfunctional coronavirus anxiety and obsession levels was not met within this sample (CAS, M = 3.24, SD = 4.21; OCS, M = 4.14, SD = 3.15), suggesting that the general population of Lahore, Pakistan is not suffering from dysfunctional anxiety or obsessions related to COVID-19.

Patients who survive the acute phase of sepsis display long-term impairments in immune function due to reductions in numbers and function of many immune cell populations. This state of chronic immunoparalysis renders sepsis survivors increasingly susceptible to infection with newly or previously encountered infections. CD4 T cells play important roles in the development of cellular and humoral immune responses following infection. Understanding how sepsis impacts the CD4 T cell compartment is critical for informing efforts to develop treatments intended to restore immune system homeostasis following sepsis. This review will focus on the current understanding of how sepsis impacts the CD4 T cell responses, including numerical representation, repertoire diversity, phenotype and effector functionality, subset representation (e.g., Th1 and Treg frequency), and therapeutic efforts to restore CD4 T cell numbers and function following sepsis. Additionally, we will discuss recent efforts to model the acute sepsis phase and resulting immune dysfunction using mice that have previously encountered infection, which more accurately reflects the immune system of humans with a history of repeated infection throughout life. A thorough understanding of how sepsis impacts CD4 T cells based on previous studies and new models that accurately reflect the human immune system may improve translational value of research aimed at restoring CD4 T cell-mediated immunity, and overall immune fitness following sepsis.","output":"CD4 T Cell Responses and the Sepsis-Induced Immunoparalysis State"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feline coronavirus is a highly contagious virus potentially resulting in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), while the pathogenesis of FIP remains not well understood, particularly in the events leading to the disease. A predominant theory is that the pathogenic FIPV arises from a mutation, so that it could replicate not only in enterocytes of the intestines but also in monocytes, subsequently systemically transporting the virus. The immune status and genetics of affected cats certainly play an important role in the pathogenesis. Considering the importance of genetics and host immune responses in viral infections, the goal of this study was to elucidate host gene expression in macrophages using RNA sequencing. Macrophages from healthy male cats infected with FIPV 79-1146 ex vivo displayed a differential host gene expression. Despite the virus uptake, aligned viral reads did not increase from 2 to 17 h. The overlap of host gene expression among macrophages from different cats was limited, even though viral transcripts were detected in the cells. Interestingly, some of the downregulated genes in all macrophages were involved in immune signaling, while some upregulated genes common for all cats were found to be inhibiting immune activation. Our results highlight individual host responses playing an important role, consistent with the fact that few cats develop feline infectious peritonitis despite a common presence of enteric FCoV.","output":"Host Gene Expression of Macrophages in Response to Feline Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information on medication utilization among pregnant and postpartum women during the pandemic is lacking.

Pregnant women or women who had delivered in the three preceding months, and 18 years old, could participate. The prevalence of overall medication use, self-medication, and changes in chronic medication use were determined. A total of 2158 women out of 5210 participants (41.4%) used at least one medication. Analgesics (paracetamol), systemic antihistamines (cetirizine), and drugs for gastric disorders (omeprazole) were the three most used classes. Anti-infectives were less prevalent than during pre-pandemic times. Antidepressants and anxiety related medication use remained similar, despite a higher prevalence of these symptoms. Self-medication was reported in 19.4% of women, and 4.1% of chronic medication users reported that they changed a chronic medication on personal initiative due to the pandemic.

We describe a pilot study of including a recommendation for palliative medicine consult in the ICU morning huddle. DESIGN: A prospective, observational, quality improvement study. PATIENTS AND SETTING: Adult patients (age above 18 yr) admitted with cardiac arrest, stage IV cancer, admission from a long-term acute care facility, and circulatory shock on mechanical ventilation to the medical ICU. INTERVENTIONS: We aim to assess the effect of an early palliative medicine consultation in selected high-risk patients on change in code status, referral to hospice, tracheostomy, and or percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 83 patients who triggered an early palliative medicine consult. Palliative medicine consultation occurred in 44 patients (53%); 23 patients (28%) had a palliative medicine consult within the first 48 hours, 21 (25%) had a palliative medicine consult afterwards. There was a significantly higher number of patients who de-escalated their code status in the palliative medicine consult group compared with the no palliative medicine consult group (63.6% vs 7.7%); however, the number was higher in the late palliative medicine consult group (71.4% vs 56.5%). There were more patients referred to hospice in the palliative medicine consult group. No difference in length of stay was observed.

A universally accepted classification system predicting surgical risk and outcome is still lacking. OBJECTIVES We report a modern surgical technique specific for planum sphenoidale and tuberculum sellae meningiomas with associated outcome. A new classification system that can guide the surgical approach and may predict surgical risk is proposed. METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of the patients who between 2005 and March 2015 underwent a craniotomy or endoscopic surgery for the resection of meningiomas involving the suprasellar region. Operative nuances of a modified frontotemporal craniotomy and orbital osteotomy technique for meningioma removal and reconstruction are described. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients were found to have tumors arising mainly from the planum sphenoidale or the tuberculum sellae; 25 underwent frontotemporal craniotomy and tumor removal with orbital osteotomy and bilateral optic canal decompression, and 2 patients underwent endonasal transphenoidal resection. The most common presenting symptom was visual disturbance (77%). Vision improved in 90% of those who presented with visual decline, and there was no permanent visual deterioration. Cerebrospinal fluid leak occurred in one of the 25 cranial cases (4%) and in 1 of 2 transphenoidal cases (50%), and in both cases it resolved with treatment. There was no surgical mortality. CONCLUSION An orbitotomy and early decompression of the involved optic canal are important for achieving gross total resection, maximizing visual improvement, and avoiding recurrence. The visual outcomes were excellent. A new classification system that can allow the comparison of different series and approaches and indicate cases that are more suitable for an endoscopic transsphenoidal approach is presented.","output":"Planum Sphenoidale and Tuberculum Sellae Meningiomas: Operative Nuances of a Modern Surgical Technique with Outcome and Proposal of a New Classification System."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microplastics are contaminants that are closely associated with human activity and are often abundant even in remote areas. As the largest natural freshwater lake in the western USA, Flathead Lake is a suitable site to study microplastics in lakes in less-populated areas of North America. Our assessment of microplastics in lake surface water samples showed that microplastic densities and concentrations in Flathead Lake were similar to those in other lakes located in less-populated areas around the world, with densities ranging from 8.00  104 to 4.22  105 particles/km2 with a mean concentration of 1.89  105 particles/km2. Dry deposition rates for microplastics ranged from 4 to 140 particles/m2/day with an average of 69 particles/m2/day and were significantly higher in the fall. Microplastic concentrations in wet deposition ranged from 0.006 particles/mL to 0.050 particles/mL with highest concentrations in winter and lowest in summer. Fibrous microplastics were predominant in both lake water and atmospheric deposition. The high densities of microplastics in the sample sites located near the Flathead River inlet suggests that the river is an important source of microplastics to Flathead Lake. The high densities of microplastics and high proportions of non-fibrous microplastics near populated areas of the lake imply that local human activities also affect microplastics in Flathead Lake. Although the annual flux of microplastics in dry deposition was higher than that in wet deposition, the relatively modest difference suggests that precipitation might enhance the deposition of microplastics. The results of this study indicate that instituting increased control measures that target both reducing the microfibers generated by laundry and improving the overall level of plastic waste management in the watershed may help in controlling microplastic levels in Flathead Lake.","output":"Microplastics in Flathead Lake, a large oligotrophic mountain lake in the USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The porcine ischemia-reperfusion model is one of the most commonly used for cardiology research and for testing interventionsfor myocardial regeneration.

Participants had been recruited through online advertising and voluntary sector community organisations. Interviews were conducted by telephone or video-conference by researchers with lived experience of mental health difficulties, and explored changes over time in peoples experience of the pandemic. ResultsWe interviewed 44 people, achieving diversity of demographic characteristics and a range of mental health conditions and service use among our sample. Three overarching themes were derived from interviews. The first theme \\"Spectrum of adaptation\\": to difficulties in access to, or the quality of, statutory mental health services, through developing new personal coping strategies or identifying alternative sources of support. The second theme is \\"Accumulating pressures\\": from pandemic-related anxieties and sustained disruption to social contact and support, and to mental health treatment. The third theme \\"Feeling overlooked\\": A sense of people with pre-existing mental health conditions being overlooked during the pandemic by policy-makers at all levels.

To date, however, such implants have mainly been developed as scaffolds to promote the regeneration of failing organs due to old age or congenital malformations. In the real world, however, infection or immunological issues often compromise patients. For example, bacterial and viral infections can result in uncontrolled immunopathological damage and lead to organ failure. Hence, there is a need for biomaterials and implants that not only promote regeneration but also address issues that are specific to compromised patients, such as infection and inflammation. Different strategies are needed to address the regeneration of organs that have been damaged by infection or inflammation for successful clinical translation. Therefore, the real quest is for multifunctional biomaterials with combined properties that can combat infections, modulate inflammation, and promote regeneration at the same time. These strategies will necessitate the inclusion of methodologies for management of the cellular and signaling components elicited within the local microenvironment. In the development of such biomaterials, strategies range from the inclusion of materials that have intrinsic anti-inflammatory properties, such as the synthetic lipid polymer, 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC), to silver nanoparticles that have antibacterial properties, to inclusion of nano- and micro-particles in biomaterials composites that deliver active drugs.

To date, there is limited evidence on the influence of social media use for COVID-19Crelated information on COVID-19 preventive practice. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the influence of social media use on the practice of COVID-19 preventive measures in Ethiopia. METHODS: This study used an anonymous Internet-based online cross-sectional survey using Google Forms to collect the data from the respondents from May 15 to June 17, 2020, in Ethiopia. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between social media use as a predictor and COVID-19 preventive practice, after adjusting for socio-demographic and risk perception of COVID-19 variables. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 21. RESULTS: A total of 372 respondents have participated in the study. From 372, a total of 208 (55.9%) respondents in this study were male. Study participants who had good use of social media to get COVID-19Crelated information were 9.5 times more engaged in COVID-19 preventive practices compared with study participants who had poor use of social media to get COVID-19Crelated information (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 9.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.70-16.13).

Based on our multicenter experiences, we categorized the risks of opportunistic fungal infections in COVID-19 patients in Iran. The COVID-19 patients at high risk included those with acute respiratory distress syndrome, in intensive care units, receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, immunosuppressants or corticosteroid, and supported by invasive or noninvasive ventilation. The patients were most likely to develop pulmonary aspergillosis, oral candidiasis, or pneumocystis pneumonia. Most diagnoses were probable as the accurate diagnosis of opportunistic fungal infections remains challenging in resource-poor settings.

Their effectiveness is however dependent on the uptake of such COVID-19 apps. OBJECTIVE: We examine the role of individuals' general health status in the willingness to participate in a COVID-19 tracing app, as well as the roles of socioeconomic characteristics and 'COVID-19 proximity.' METHODS: We draw on survey data from the WageIndicator Foundation: the Living and Working in Coronavirus Times. The survey collects data on labor market status, as well as potential confounders of the relationship between general health and COVID-19 app usage, such as sociodemographics and regular smartphone usage. The survey also contains information that allow us to examine the role of 'COVID-19 proximity,' such as having contracted the virus, having observed COVID-19 cases among family members or colleagues, displaying depressive symptoms, and anxiety. We select data collected in Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands between ages 18 and 70 (N = 4,504). Logistic regressions are utilized to measure willingness to use a COVID-19 app. RESULTS: We find that the influence of socioeconomic factors on COVID-19 app usage varies dramatically between the four countries, although forms of not being employed (i.e.. recent job loss and inactivity) are consistently associated with lower willingness to use a tracing app (24.6%) as compared to employees (33.4%, P<.001). Among selected COVID-19 proximity indicators, having a close family member being infected with COVID-19 is associated with higher contact tracing app usage (36.3% vs. 27.1%, P<.001). Accounting for these proximity factors, and the country-variation therein, we find that having a poorer general health status is significantly associated with of a much higher likelihood of contact tracing app usage. That is, compared to a self-reported 'very good' health status (estimated probability of 29.6), a 'good' (+4.6%-points [1.2-8.1]) and 'fair or bad' (+6.3%-points [2.3-10.3]) health statuses yield markedly higher willingness to use a COVID-19 app. CONCLUSIONS: In so far public health policy is aimed at using smartphone contact tracing during off-peak periods in the pandemic, campaigns appealing to health benefits for oneself and that of family members may be most successful for increasing the COVID-19 tracing app uptake. Public health campaigns that rely on digital platforms would also benefit from taking seriously the country-specific distribution of privacy concerns.","output":"The Roles of General Health and COVID-19 Proximity in App Contact-Tracing Usage: A Cross-Sectional Study of Attitudes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The optical spectra of 3,896 Seyfert~1 (Sy1) galaxies detected with WISE at z<0.4 were analyzed for evidence of outflows.

Having separated our sample in two spectroscopic subgroups, Sy1s with only broad Balmer lines (Sy1B) and with both narrow and broad (Sy1N) lines and distinguishing those that show as outflow (Sy1Bw and Sy1Nw), we report the following differences: 1) the BH mass is systematically higher and the power-law steeper in the Sy1B-Sy1Bw than in the Sy1N-Sy1Nw, 2) V_max is higher in the Sy1Bw than in the Sy1Nw, correlated in both groups with the BH mass and bolometric luminosity, 3) the Eddington ratio and SFR are higher in the Sy1 with outflows, and 4) the specific star formation rates (sSFRs) of the Sy1s are normal for their morphology and mass; typical of early-type spiral galaxies in the green valley, far from the quenched regime.

The plasticity of stem cells is one of the major criteria for generating organoids most similar to the tissue structures they intend to mimic. Stem cells are cells with unique properties of self-renewal and differentiation. Depending on their origin, a distinction is made between pluripotent (embryonic) stem cells (PSCs), adult (or tissue) stem cells (ASCs), and those obtained by somatic reprogramming, so-called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). While most data since the 1980s have been acquired in the mouse model, and then from the late 1990s in humans, the process of somatic reprogammation has revolutionized the field of stem cell research. For domestic animals, numerous attempts have been made to obtain PSCs and iPSCs, an approach that makes it possible to omit the use of embryos to derive the cells. Even if the plasticity of the cells obtained is not always optimal, the recent progress in obtaining reprogrammed cells is encouraging.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of prior receipt of antibiotics on the microorganism distribution. METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted in a 3200-bed tertiary, referral, teaching hospital in eastern China. During a 2-year period, all hospitalized patients treated with antimicrobial agents were enrolled in this study. Among 48,692 patients evaluated, the 27,792 (57.1%) who were sampled within 2 days before or after administration of the first dose of antimicrobial agents were included. Distribution of clinical specimens and the microorganism were compared between before and after antibiotic drug treatment groups. RESULTS: Compared to specimens taken after antibiotics exposure, specimens taken before antibiotics exposure had a higher proportion of blood and urine specimens and a higher culture positive rate (all P < 0.001). Higher percentages of Staphylococcus aureus (9.9% vs. 8.5%, P = 0.041), non-fermenting bacteria (27.7% vs. 19.9%, P < 0.001), and fungi (8.4% vs. 4.0%, P < 0.001) were isolated from the group after antibiotics exposure, while the percentages of Streptococcus spp. (4.8% vs. 2.7%, P < 0.001), Haemophilus influenzae (2.3% vs. 0.8%, P < 0.001), and Moraxella catarrhalis (0.7% vs. 0.1%, P < 0.001) were higher in the group before antibiotics exposure. Further analysis found significant differences of microbes derived from respiratory secretions, blood or urine samples. We found, after antibiotics exposure, the separation rate of non-fermenting bacteria was significantly increased (all P < 0.05), and the separation rate of Candida spp. was higher, with statistical significance in airway secretion and urine samples (both P < 0.05), but the separation rate of Staphylococcus aureus among the three groups was not affected by antibiotics. In addition, the isolation rate of Streptococcus spp. in blood and urine samples decreased significantly (both P < 0.05) after antibiotics exposure. Interestingly, no statistical difference was found for microbes isolated from body fluid specimens between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome revealed that antibiotic-insensitive organisms such as non-fermentative bacteria and fungi were more frequently isolated after antibiotics exposure.

While numerous studies have been published on immune responses triggered by vaccination, these often focused on the initial peak response generated in specific population subgroups (e.g. healthcare workers or immunocompromised individuals) and have often only examined the effects of one or two different immunisation schemes. Methods and FindingsWe analysed serum samples from participants of a large German seroprevalence study (MuSPAD) who had received all available vaccines and dose schedules (mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, AZD1222, Ad26.CoV2S.2 or a combination of AZD1222 plus either mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2). Antibody titers against various SARS-CoV-2 antigens and ACE2 binding inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants of concern were analysed using a previously published multiplex immunoassay MULTICOV-AB and an ACE2-RBD competition assay. Among the different vaccines and their dosing regimens, homologous mRNA-based or heterologous prime-boost vaccination produced significantly higher antibody responses than vector-based homologous vaccination. Ad26.CoV2S.2 performance was significantly reduced, even compared to AZD1222, with 91.67% of samples being considered non-responsive forACE2 binding inhibition. mRNA-based vaccination induced a higher ratio of RBD- and S1-targeting antibodies than vector-based vaccination, which resulted in an increased proportion of S2-targeting antibodies. Previously infected individuals had a robust immune response once vaccinated, regardless of which vaccine they received. When examining antibody kinetics post-vaccination after homologous immunisation regimens, both titers and ACE2 binding inhibition peaked approximately 28 days post-vaccination and then decreased as time increased. ConclusionsAs one of the first and largest population-based studies to examine vaccine responses for all currently available immunisation schemes in Germany, we found that homologous mRNA or heterologous vaccination elicited the highest immune responses. The high percentage of non-responders for Ad26.CoV2.S requires further investigation and suggests that a booster dose with an mRNA-based vaccine may be necessary. The high responses seen in recovered and vaccinated individuals could aid future dose allocation, should shortages arise for certain manufacturers. Given the role of RBD- and S1-specific antibodies in neutralising SARS-CoV-2, their relative over-representation after mRNA vaccination may explain why mRNA vaccines have an increased efficacy compared to vector-based formulations. Further investigation on these differences will be of particular interest for vaccine development and efficacy, especially for the next-generation of vector-based vaccines.","output":"Comparative magnitude and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination responses on a population level in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious public health problem worldwide. This study sought to examine the associations of daily average temperature (AT) and relative humidity (ARH) with the percent increase in COVID-19 cases. Methods: Daily confirmed cases and meteorological factors in 38 districts of India were collected between 1st April 2020 to 30th April 2020. Taking a 5-day time lag of average values of the variables and multiple days-samples, we ran multiple models and performed appropriate hypothesis tests to decide the single preferred model for each sample data. Suitable fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) models with cluster-robust standard errors were applied to quantify the district-specific associations of meteorological and other variables with COVID-19 cases. Results: All FE models revealed that every one-degree rise in AT led to a decrease in 3.909 points (on average) in percent increase in COVID-19 cases. All RE models showed that with one unit increase in the malaria annual parasite index, there was a significant increase in 10.835 points (on average) in percent increase in COVID-19 cases. In both FE and RE models, ARH was found to be negatively associated with a percent increase in COVID-19 cases, although in half of these models the association was statistically insignificant. Conclusion: Our results indicate that mean temperature, mean relative humidity, and malaria endemicity might have an essential role in the stability and transmissibility of the 2019 novel coronavirus.","output":"Impact of environmental temperature and relative humidity on spread of COVID-19 infection in India: a cross-sectional time-series analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020 the world is facing unprecedented challenges due to COVID-19. To address these challenges, many digital tools are being explored and developed to contain the spread of the disease. With the lack of availability of vaccines, there is an urgent need to avert resurgence of infections by putting some measures, such as contact tracing, in place. While digital tools, such as phone applications are advantageous, they also pose challenges and have limitations (eg, wireless coverage could be an issue in some cases). On the other hand, wearable devices, when coupled with the Internet of Things (IoT), are expected to influence lifestyle and healthcare directly, and they may be useful for health monitoring during the global pandemic and beyond.

To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel intelligent tool that will be useful for contact tracing and prediction of COVID-19 clusters. The solution comprises a phone application combined with a wearable device, infused with unique intelligent IoT features (complex data analysis and intelligent data visualization) embedded within the system to aid in COVID-19 analysis.

METHODS This project has a quasi-experimental research design, based on a pilot study of 14 subjects aged above 65 years. They received eight sessions of singing group therapy given by a social robot or an occupational therapist. Completed copies of a therapeutic-factor questionnaire were then collected. RESULTS At the 4th week, the scores for 8 therapeutic factors were higher in sessions with the occupational therapist than the robot-directed sessions, reaching a statistically significant level; at the 8th week, the scores for 3 therapeutic factors, including imparting of information, were higher in sessions with the occupational therapist than in sessions with the robot. The top scoring therapeutic factor in the robot sessions was group cohesiveness. CONCLUSIONS Social robots may be good companion tools for elderly care during this COVID-19 outbreak, but group therapy sessions supervised by real-person therapists still have higher therapeutic factor scores than those conducted by robots. The number of subjects needs to be increased to enhance the validity of future study results.","output":"Can occupational therapy manpower be replaced with social robots in a singing group during COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-associated liver disease is increasing in the United States. Efficacious AUD pharmacotherapies, while available, are, for protean reasons, underutilized. Hepatology providers may be in a position to bridge the pharmacotherapeutic gap between availability and utilization of AUD pharmacotherapies. Our aim was to ascertain the current practice, knowledge and attitudes of hepatology physicians in the United States, and identify opportunities on how to increase AUD medication prescribing. METHODS: A web-based survey, developed by an expert panel, was administered to hepatology physicians working at all transplant centers in the United States. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 131/658 (20%). There was significant support (two-thirds of respondents) for hepatology providers prescribing AUD medications; however, only 1 in 4 was comfortable prescribing these medications. The majority felt additional education is needed to prescribe AUD medications. The practice of hepatology providers prescribing AUD medications is common, with >50% of respondents having done so. Baclofen was the most popular medication prescribed. Hepatology providers perceived suboptimal ancillary addiction services. Although AUD prescribers had higher rates of AUD pharmacotherapy knowledge compared with nonprescribers, approximately 50% still had inadequate knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: AUD medication prescribing is a common practice among hepatology providers who appear eager to increase this practice through more education as they attempt to bridge the pharmacotherapeutic gap. This informative survey provides guidance for professional societies on how best to disseminate the requisite education required to optimize the care of patients with AUD.","output":"Practice Habits, Knowledge, and Attitudes of Hepatologists to Alcohol Use Disorder Medication: Sobering Gaps and Opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and importance The importance of health promotion and disease prevention among the general public has been reinforced following the COVID-19 pandemic Although national campaigns have been active for years, reports have highlighted the opportunities for the greater use of pharmacy teams for improving this, in light of their location, accessibility, convenience and relationship with the public Aim and objectives To assess the level of knowledge on important health topics of patients and learn their preferences for future learning in order to develop a targeted and effective health promotion programme Material and methods In July 2019, patients waiting for a prescription to be filled in a hospital outpatient pharmacy were approached for inclusion in the study Those who consented were interviewed via a confidential questionnaire (revised following a pilot on 5 patients) until 100 patients were recruited The results were submitted into Excel for analysis Results The participation rate was approximately 30% (47% men and 53% women, aged 18-70 years) Approximately 10% of patients were unaware of the risks of high blood pressure and 28% had never had their blood pressure monitored 28% did not know the maximum recommended units of alcohol permitted per week All smokers (28%) had been unsuccessful in previous attempts to stop smoking Although all patients were aware of the correct signs of breast cancer, 17% of patients were unsure of the signs of prostate cancer 40% of patients were unable to give two correct symptoms of depression and some patients mentioned inaccurate ones Although over 75% of patients preferred to receive health promotion information via a one-to-one consultation with pharmacy staff, 74% of patients thought watching health promotion videos while waiting for a prescription was a good idea All patients had access to a mobile phone or a computer and were happy to receive information via their electronic devices Conclusion and relevance The study highlighted gaps in knowledge, particularly in the areas of alcohol intake, depression and prostate cancer, giving ideas of where to target future health promotion campaigns Although patients prefer personal consultations with pharmacy staff, novel ways of delivering health promotion, including the use of phones and electronic devices, should be considered","output":"An evaluation of health promotion and disease prevention knowledge in patients attending a hospital outpatient pharmacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the risk of cross-contamination in dental tray adhesives with reusable brush systems. Methods: Four dental tray adhesives with different disinfectant components were examined for risk as a potential transmission medium for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus oralis, and Candida albicans. Bacterial and fungal strains were mixed with artificial saliva. The contaminated saliva was intentionally added to tray adhesive liquid samples. At baseline and up to 60 min, 100 microliters of each sample were collected and cultivated aerobically on Columbia and Sabouraud agar for 24 or 48 h, respectively. Results: At baseline, contamination with Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans could be identified in three out of four adhesives. In the subsequent samples, low counts of up to 20 colony-forming units per milliliter could be observed for Staphylococcus aureus. All other strains did not form colonies at baseline or subsequently. Adhesives with isopropanol or ethyl acetate as disinfectant additives were most effective in preventing contamination, while adhesives with hydrogen chloride or acetone as a disinfectant additive were the least effective.

It relies on the fusion of their envelope with the host cell membrane to deliver their nucleocapsid into the host cell. The spike glycoprotein (S) mediates virus entry into cells via the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) protein located on many cell types and tissues' outer surface. This study, therefore, aimed to design and synthesize novel pyrazolone-based compounds as potential inhibitors that would interrupt the interaction between the viral spike protein and the host cell receptor to prevent SARS-CoV 2 entrance into the cell. A series of pyrazolone compounds as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors were designed and synthesized. Employing computational techniques, the inhibitory potentials of the designed compounds against both spike protein and hACE2 were evaluated. Results of the binding free energy from the in-silico analysis, showed that three compounds (7i, 7k and 8f) and six compounds (7b, 7h, 7k, 8d, 8g, and 8h) showed higher and better binding high affinity to SARS-CoV-2 Sgp and hACE-2, respectively compared to the standard drugs cefoperazone (CFZ) and MLN-4760. Furthermore, the outcome of the structural analysis of the two proteins upon binding of the inhibitors showed that the two proteins (SARS-CoV-2 Sgp and hACE-2) were stable, and the structural integrity of the proteins was not compromised. This study suggests pyrazolone-based compounds might be potent blockers of the viral entry into the host cells.","output":"Design and Synthesis of Pyrazolone-based Compounds as Potent Blockers of SARS-CoV-2 Viral Entry into the Host Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated stressors have impacted the daily lives and sleeping patterns of many individuals, including university students Dreams may provide insight into how the mind processes changing realities;dreams not only allow consolidation of new information, but may give the opportunity to creatively \\"play out\\" low-risk, hypothetical threat simulations While there are studies that analyze dreams in high-stress situations, little is known of how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted dreams of university students The aim of this study was to explore how the dream content of students was affected during the university COVID-19 lockdown period (March-July, 2020) Using online survey methods, we analyzed dream recall content (n = 71) using the Hall-Van de Castle dream coding system and Fisher's exact tests for sex comparisons Preliminary results indicate that female students experienced more nightmares as compared to male students Dream analysis found that, relative to normative American College Student (ACS) samples generated pre-COVID-19, women were more likely to experience aggressive interactions in their dream content, including increased physical aggression Results indicate that university students did experience changes in dream content due to the pandemic lockdown period, with women disproportionally affected These findings can aid universities in developing support programs for students by bringing forth an understanding of students' concerns and anxieties as they process the \\"new normal\\" of social distancing","output":"Pandemic Nightmares: COVID-19 Lockdown Associated With Increased Aggression in Female University Students' Dreams"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics caused by novel emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases could lead to high mortality and morbidity world-wide when left uncontrolled.

METHOD: We completed 24 semi-structured in-depth interviews with adults with confirmed positive SARV-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test result, had recovered or were recovering from acute infection, and underwent serial evaluations. We purposefully sampled English- and Spanish-speaking adults with asymptomatic, mild, and severe symptomatic infection, including those who were hospitalized and those with HIV co-infection. We used a thematic analysis to analyze interviews and identify salient themes. RESULTS: After integrating the thematic analysis with clinical data, we identified key themes: (1) across symptom profiles and severity, experiencing COVID-19 was associated with psychological distress; (2) symptomatic infection carried uncertainty in symptom presentation and ongoing recovery (e.g., long COVID); and (3) health information-seeking behavior was facilitated by access to medical care and uncertainty with the recovery process.

The study's goals were to conduct a formative evaluation of barriers to and facilitators of implementing addiction treatment for PWH followed by an evaluation of the impact of Implementation Facilitation (IF) on promoting adoption of addiction treatments and clinical outcomes. Methods The study was conducted at four HIV clinics in the northeast United States, using a hybrid type 3 effectiveness-implementation stepped wedge design and guided by the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services Research (PARiHS) framework. A mixed-methods approach was used to identify evidence, context, and facilitation-related barriers to and facilitators of integration of addiction treatments into HIV clinics and to help tailor IF for each clinic. An evaluation was then conducted of the impact of IF on implementation outcomes, including provision of addiction treatment (primary outcome), organizational and clinician and staff readiness to adopt addiction treatment, and changes in organizational models of care used to deliver addiction treatment.

Considering this announcement, we conducted a comparative analysis to examine patient access to therapies for rare disease in Canada relative to Europe and the U.S. METHODS: Given its similarity to the Canadian health care system, we used Europe as the reference point to analyze all of the therapies with an orphan drug designation approved by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) from 1 January 2015 to 31 March 2020. We then contrasted access to these drugs in Canada (Health Canada) and the U.S. (Food and Drug Administration, FDA). We focused on: (1) the number of therapies for rare diseases entering the Canadian market; (2) the percentage of these therapies that are publicly available to Canadians; and (3) the timelines for patients to access these therapies in Canada. RESULTS: Sixty-three approved therapies with an orphan drug designation from the EMA were identified. Fifty-three (84%) of these drugs had also been submitted to the FDA for approval, and 41 (65%) were submitted to Health Canada for approval. In Europe, Germany, Denmark, and the U.K. had the highest percentage of publicly reimbursed orphan drugs (84%, 70%, 68%, respectively). In comparison, Ontario (32%), Quebec (25%), and Alberta (25%) had the highest percentage of drugs reimbursed among the Canadian provinces. The shortest median duration (in months) from EMA approval to jurisdictional decision on reimbursement was in Austria (3.2), followed by Germany (4.1), and Finland (6.0). In Canada, the shortest median duration (in months) from regulatory approval to reimbursement was in British Columbia (17.3), Quebec (19.6) and Manitoba (19.6), while the longest duration was in P.E.I (38.5), followed by Nova Scotia (25.9), and Newfoundland (25.1). CONCLUSIONS: Our comparative analysis found that relative to the EU Canadians had less frequent and timely access to therapies for rare diseases. This highlights the need for a rare disease strategy in Canada that allows for clear identification and transparent tracking of the pathway for rare disease drugs, and ultimately optimizes the number of patients with access to these therapies.

In the United States alone, there have been approximately 7 million cases and over 200,000 deaths. This outbreak has placed an enormous strain on healthcare systems and workers. Severe cases require hospital care, and 8.5% of patients require mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). One major challenge is the necessity for clinical care personnel to don and doff cumbersome personal protective equipment (PPE) in order to enter an ICU unit to make simple adjustments to ventilator settings. Although future ventilators and other ICU equipment may be controllable remotely through computer networks, the enormous installed base of existing ventilators do not have this capability. This paper reports the development of a simple, low cost telerobotic system that permits adjustment of ventilator settings from outside the ICU. The system consists of a small Cartesian robot capable of operating a ventilator touch screen with camera vision control via a wirelessly connected tablet master device located outside the room. Engineering system tests demonstrated that the open-loop mechanical repeatability of the device was 7.5 mm, and that the average positioning error of the robotic finger under visual servoing control was 5.94 mm. Successful usability tests in a simulated ICU environment were carried out and are reported. In addition to enabling a significant reduction in PPE consumption, the prototype system has been shown in a preliminary evaluation to significantly reduce the total time required for a respiratory therapist to perform typical setting adjustments on a commercial ventilator, including donning and doffing PPE, from 271 to 109 s.","output":"Telerobotic Operation of Intensive Care Unit Ventilators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective This survey-based cross-sectional descriptive study aimed to observe the prognosis of COVID-19 cases, focusing on the symptoms, treatment, and post-recovery health conditions.

Quality of life was assessed using SF-36 and the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life (IWQOL-Lite) questionnaires. RESULTS: The reoperation rate due to a serious adverse event in this population at five years after implantation with the REALIZE gastric band was 8.9%. The most common serious adverse event was band slippage which affected 6.9% of the study population. The mean %EWL was 35.6 + 26.84 and the decrease in mean BMI was -7.01 + 5.45 at 5 years. Subjects experienced improvement in mean hemoglobin A1c and serum lipid levels in addition to improvement in the quality of life measures. CONCLUSION: No new safety concerns were identified during the five years of follow up. Although the results of this study did not meet the predefined safety criteria of 8% or less, the safety profile and long-term effectiveness observed in this study is consistent with the current literature.","output":"Safety and Effectiveness of REALIZE?

In this study, lung ultrasound (LUS) findings and pulmonary function of children who recovered from an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated. We prospectively followed up for at least 30 days patients younger than 18 years who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection at the Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan (Italy). All enrolled patients underwent LUS. Airway resistance measured by the interrupter technique test was assessed in subjects aged 4-6 years, whereas forced spirometry and measurement of diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide were performed in subjects older than 6 years. To evaluate a possible correlation between pulmonary alterations and immune response to SARS-CoV-2, two semiquantitative enzyme immune assays were used. We enrolled 16 out of 23 eligible children. The median age of enrolled subjects was 7.5 (0.5-10.5) years, with a male to female ratio of 1.7. No subject presented any abnormality on LUS, airway resistance test, forced spirometry, and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide. On the other hand, all subjects presented Ig G against SARS-CoV-2. In contrast in adults, we did not detect any pulmonary complications in our cohort.

Accurate and reliable characterisation of these is vital for optimal patient care. Owing to the great improvements in medical imaging technology in recent years, particularly magnetic resonance imaging, it is now possible to characterise a significant proportion of these non-invasively. This is of paramount importance in improving patient safety and reducing costs by avoiding unnecessary biopsies. This article gives a synopsis of the different imaging modalities for liver. It depicts the salient imaging features of the common benign and malignant focal liver lesions on different imaging modalities, with emphasis on magnetic resonance imaging. It demonstrates the pseudolesions, variants, mimics and pitfalls that occur in liver imaging.

In this study, the relationship between BCG vaccination status and severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and the factors affecting disease severity were investigated. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted between March and June 2020 in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia, confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 polymerase chain reaction positivity in a nasopharyngeal sample and pulmonary infiltrates in computed chest tomography, in a state hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. Socio-demographic features, body mass index, smoking status, concomitant diseases, income rates and BCG vaccination status of subjects were analyzed. RESULT: The study population comprised 123 adults with COVID-19 pneumonia [mean age = 497 years, standard deviation = 133 years; 82 (667%) male]. While the rate of cases vaccinated with BCG is lower (685 versus 882%, P = 0026), mean age (540  115 years versus 383  107 years; P < 0001), diabetes (326 versus 59%, P = 0002) and low income (843 versus 529%, P < 0001) are higher in patients with severe disease compared to those with mild disease. According to multivariate analysis increasing age [odds ratio (OR) = 1119; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1062-1178, P < 0001] and low income (OR = 3209; 95% CI = 1008-10222, P = 0049) are associated with severe disease in COVID-19 pneumonia.

This function is regulated by sequence specific binding of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to target DNA/RNA, with an additional requirement of a flanking DNA motif called the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) in certain CRISPR systems. In this review, we discuss how the same fundamental mechanism of RNA-DNA and/or RNA-RNA complementarity is utilized by bacteria to regulate two distinct functions: to ward off intruding genetic materials and to modulate diverse physiological functions. The best documented examples of alternate functions are bacterial virulence, biofilm formation, adherence, programmed cell death, and quorum sensing. While extensive complementarity between the crRNA and the targeted DNA and/or RNA seems to constitute an efficient phage protection system, partial complementarity seems to be the key for several of the characterized alternate functions. Cas proteins are also involved in sequence-specific and non-specific RNA cleavage and control of transcriptional regulator expression, the mechanisms of which are still elusive. Over the past decade, the mechanisms of RNA-guided targeting and auxiliary functions of several Cas proteins have been transformed into powerful gene editing and biotechnological tools. We provide a synopsis of CRISPR technologies in this review. Even with the abundant mechanistic insights and biotechnology tools that are currently available, the discovery of new and diverse CRISPR types holds promise for future technological innovations, which will pave the way for precision genome medicine.","output":"The CRISPR-Cas Mechanism for Adaptive Immunity and Alternate Bacterial Functions Fuels Diverse Biotechnologies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a pandemic viral infection caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, which is a global concern of the twenty-first century for its rapid spreading in a short period. Apart from its known acute respiratory involvements, the CNS manifestations of COVID-19 are common. These neurological symptoms are diverse and could range from mild nonspecific or specific symptoms such as the loss of various sensory perceptions, the worrying autoimmune GuillainCBarr syndrome, to the life-threatening acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and the CNS-mediated respiratory distress. An autopsy report documented the presence of SARS-CoV2 in brain tissues of a COVID-19 patient. However, there is no definite conclusion on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV2 neuroinvasion. These proposed mechanisms include the direct viral invasion, the systemic blood circulation, or the distribution of infected immune cells. Concerning these different neuropathophysiologies, COVID-19 patients who are presenting with either the early-onset, multiple, and severe CNS symptoms or rapid respiratory deterioration should be suspected for the direct viral neuroinvasion, and appropriate management options should be considered.

However, information about the effect of cryopreservation on outcomes for patients receiving allogeneic donor grafts is limited. We evaluated outcomes of HCT recipients who received either fresh or cryopreserved allogeneic bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. A total of 7397 patients were included in the analysis. Recipients of cryopreserved graft were divided into 3 cohorts based on graft source: HLA-matched related PBSC donors (n = 1051), matched unrelated PBSC donors (n = 678), and matched related or unrelated BM donors (n = 154). These patients were propensity score matched with 5514 patients who received fresh allografts. The primary endpoint was engraftment. Multivariate analyses showed no significant increased risk of delayed engraftment, relapse, nonrelapse mortality (NRM), or survival with cryopreservation of BM grafts. In contrast, cryopreservation of related donor PBSC grafts was associated with decreased platelet recovery (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 0.78; P < .001) and an increased risk of grade II-IV (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.48; P = .002) and grade III-IV (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.84; P < .001) acute graft-versus-host disease. Cryopreservation of unrelated PBSC grafts was associated with delayed engraftment of neutrophils (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.84; P < .001) and platelets (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.66; P < .001) as well as an increased risk of NRM (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.66; P < .001) and relapse (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.58; P = .002) and decreased progression-free survival (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.55; P < .001) and overall survival (OS) (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.58; P < .001). Reasons for cryopreservation were not routinely collected; however, in a subset of unrelated donor HCT recipients, the reason was typically a change in patient condition. Products cryopreserved for patient reasons were significantly associated with inferior OS in multivariate analysis (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.96; P = .029). We conclude that cryopreservation is associated with slower engraftment of PBSC grafts, which may be associated with inferior transplantation outcomes in some patient populations. However, the small numbers in the cryopreserved BM cohort and the lack of information on the reason for cryopreservation in all patients suggests that these data should be interpreted with caution, particularly in the context of the risks associated with unexpected loss of a graft during the pandemic. Future analyses addressing outcomes when cryopreservation is universally applied are urgently required.","output":"The Effect of Donor Graft Cryopreservation on Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Outcomes: A Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research Analysis.

Volatile molecules are characterized by a high vapor pressure and are consequently easily exhaled by the lungs after ingestion. This feature could be exploited from a pharmacological point of view, reaching the site of action in an uncommon way but allowing for drug delivery.

This review aims to summarize the incidence, risk factors, possible pathophysiology, and proposed management of neurological manifestations of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or neuro-PASC based on the published literature. RECENT FINDINGS: The National Institutes of Health has noted that PASC is a multi-organ disorder ranging from mild symptoms to an incapacitating state that can last for weeks or longer following recovery from initial infection with SARS-CoV-2. Various pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed as the culprit for the development of PASC. These include, but are not limited to, direct or indirect invasion of the virus into the brain, immune dysregulation, hormonal disturbances, elevated cytokine levels due to immune reaction leading to chronic inflammation, direct tissue damage to other organs, and persistent low-grade infection. A multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of neuro-PASC will be required to diagnose and address these symptoms. Tailored rehabilitation and novel cognitive therapy protocols are as important as pharmacological treatments to treat neuro-PASC effectively. With recognizing the growing numbers of COVID-19 patients suffering from neuro-PASC, there is an urgent need to identify affected individuals early to provide the most appropriate and efficient treatments. Awareness among the general population and health care professionals about PASC is rising, and more efforts are needed to understand and treat this new emerging challenge.

The current study was conducted to explore drugs against Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 using in silico pharmacophore modelling and virtual screening approach to combat COVID-19. METHODS: All the available sequences of RBD in NCBI were retrieved and multiple aligned to get insight into its diversity. The 3D structure of RBD was modelled and the conserved region was used as a template to design pharmacophore using LigandScout. Lead compounds were screened using Cambridge, Drugbank, ZINC and TIMBLE databases and these identified lead compounds were screened for their toxicity and Lipinski's rule of five. Molecular docking of shortlisted lead compounds was performed using AutoDock Vina and interacting residues were visualized. RESULTS: Active residues of Receptor Binding Motif (RBM) in S, involved in interaction with receptor, were found to be conserved in all 483 sequences. Using this RBM motif as a pharmacophore a total of 1327 lead compounds were predicted initially from all databases, however, only eight molecules fit the criteria for safe oral drugs. Conclusion: The RBM region of S interacts with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78) to mediate viral entry. Based on in silico analysis, the lead compounds scrutinized herewith interact with S, hence, can prevent its internalization in cell using ACE2 and GRP78 receptor.

There is a huge pressure on the hospital services and in particular, on the Intensive Care Units (ICU). Describing the need for critical care as well as the chance of being discharged from hospital according to patient characteristics, is essential for a more efficient hospital management. The objective of this study is to describe the probabilities of admission to the ICU and the probabilities of hospital discharge among positive COVID-19 patients according to demographics and comorbidities recorded at hospital admission. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of all patients with COVID-19 found in the Electronic Medical Records of Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital in Kuwait was conducted. The study included 3995 individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic) of all ages who tested positive from February 24th to May 27th, 2020, out of which 315 were treated in the ICU and 3619 were discharged including those who were transferred to a different healthcare unit without having previously entered the ICU. A competing risk analysis considering two events, namely, ICU admission and hospital discharge using flexible hazard models was performed to describe the association between event-specific probabilities and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Results showed that being male, increasing age and comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and weakened immune system increased the risk of ICU admission within 10 days of entering the hospital. CKD and weakened immune system decreased the probabilities of discharge in both females and males however, the age-related pattern differed by gender. Diabetes, which was the most prevalent comorbid condition, had only a moderate impact on both probabilities (18% overall) in contrast to CKD which had the largest effect, but presented only in 7% of those admitted to ICU and in 1% of those who got discharged. For instance, within 5 days a 50-year-old male had 19% (95% C.I.: [15,23]) probability of entering the ICU if he had none of these comorbidities, yet this risk jumped to 31% (95% C.I.: [20,46]) if he had also CKD, and to 27% in the presence of asthma/COPD (95% C.I.: [19,36]) or of weakened immune system (95% C.I.: [16,42]). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides useful insight in describing the probabilities of ICU admission and hospital discharge according to age, gender, and comorbidities among confirmed COVID-19 cases in Kuwait. A web-tool is also provided to allow the user to estimate these probabilities for any combination of these covariates. These probabilities enable deeper understanding of the hospital demand according to patient characteristics which is essential to hospital management and useful for developing a vaccination strategy.","output":"Probabilities of ICU admission and hospital discharge according to patient characteristics in the designated COVID-19 hospital of Kuwait"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background One-lung ventilation (OLV) is becoming an essential component of thoracic anesthesia. The two principal devices used for OLV are a double-lumen tube (DLT) and a bronchial blocker (BB). We hypothesized that the use of a BB with the disconnection technique would improve the quality of lung collapse in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Methods Seventy-five patients undergoing scheduled VATS were enrolled in this study and were randomly divided into two groups: a left-sided DLT group (Group D) and a BB with the disconnection technique group (Group B). OLV was initiated when the surgeon performed the skin incision. In Group D, the left channel of the DLT was opened to the air. In Group B, the lung was deflated via the disconnection technique, thus opening the breathing circuit to the air fifteen seconds after opening the pleura. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) during induction; the quality of lung collapse 1 and 10 minutes after pleural opening; the time required for complete lung collapse; the correct placement of the device; and the number of patients suffering from a sore throat after surgery were recorded. Results Compared with the use of the DLT, the use of the BB with the disconnection technique was associated with a similar quality of lung collapse, a comparable required time for total lung collapse (P>0.05, respectively), a lower incidence of sore throat both when leaving the PACU and 24 hours after surgery (34.2% vs. 13.5%, 15.8% vs. 5.4%, P<0.05, respectively) and fewer hemodynamic fluctuations after intubation both one and ten minutes after pleural opening.

Pulmonary complications occurred in 3.9 per cent, whereas SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 2.6 per cent. After risk adjustment, having at least one negative preoperative nasopharyngeal swab test (adjusted odds ratio 0.68, 95 per cent confidence interval 0.68 to 0.98; P = 0.040) was associated with a lower rate of pulmonary complications. Swab testing was beneficial before major surgery and in areas with a high 14-day SARS-CoV-2 case notification rate, but not before minor surgery or in low-risk areas. To prevent one pulmonary complication, the number needed to swab test before major or minor surgery was 18 and 48 respectively in high-risk areas, and 73 and 387 in low-risk areas. CONCLUSION: Preoperative nasopharyngeal swab testing was beneficial before major surgery and in high SARS-CoV-2 risk areas. There was no proven benefit of swab testing before minor surgery in low-risk areas.","output":"Preoperative nasopharyngeal swab testing and postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing elective surgery during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As an essential enzyme to SARS-CoV-2, main protease (MPro) is a viable target to develop antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19. By varying chemical compositions at both P2 and P3 sites and the N-terminal protection group, we synthesized a series of MPro inhibitors that contain -(S-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)-alaninal at the P1 site. These inhibitors have a large variation of determined IC50 values that range from 4.8 to 650 nM. The determined IC50 values reveal that relatively small side chains at both P2 and P3 sites are favorable for achieving high in vitro MPro inhibition potency, the P3 site is tolerable toward unnatural amino acids with two alkyl substituents on the -carbon, and the inhibition potency is sensitive toward the N-terminal protection group. X-ray crystal structures of MPro bound with 16 inhibitors were determined. All structures show similar binding patterns of inhibitors at the MPro active site. A covalent interaction between the active site cysteine and a bound inhibitor was observed in all structures. In MPro, large structural variations were observed on residues N142 and Q189. All inhibitors were also characterized on their inhibition of MPro in 293T cells, which revealed their in cellulo potency that is drastically different from their in vitro enzyme inhibition potency. Inhibitors that showed high in cellulo potency all contain O-tert-butyl-threonine at the P3 site. Based on the current and a previous study, we conclude that O-tert-butyl-threonine at the P3 site is a key component to achieve high cellular and antiviral potency for peptidyl aldehyde inhibitors of MPro. This finding will be critical to the development of novel antivirals to address the current global emergency of concerning the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The P3 O-Tert-Butyl-Threonine is Key to High Cellular and Antiviral Potency for Aldehyde-Based SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the superimposed impacts of new industrial revolution, the changing trade policy and the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has seen setbacks in globalization, contractions in the global value chain (GVC), and the risk of a fragmented global system.

As such, there is clinical overlap with many infectious diseases especially those that cause pneumonia. Due to of the prevalence of COVID-19 illness amidst the pandemic, concerns about testing sensitivity and the attendant risk to health care personnel (HCP) delivering care, patients are frequently tested multiple times to ascertain that they are SARS-CoV-2 free. Often, alternative diagnoses are not considered because some diagnostic modalitiessuch as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)pose an unacceptable risk to the patient and/or HCP. METHODS: We interrogated plasma for microbial cell-free DNA from 58 patients who were known to be SARS-CoV-2 negative. Clinical information is taken from information submitted with the test requisition or obtained at the time of result reporting from clinical consultations with the ordering provider. In each case, a plasma sample was analyzed with the Karius Test (KT) which is a CLIA certified/CAP-accredited next-generation sequencing (NGS) plasma test designed to detect and quantify circulating microbial cell-free DNA (mcfDNA), which can assist with the diagnosis of deep-seated infections. After mcfDNA is extracted and NGS performed, human reads are removed and remaining sequences are aligned to a curated database of >1400 organisms. Organisms present above a statistical threshold are reported. The time to result is on average 24 hours from sample receipt. RESULTS: In a subset of 20 samples, we found a broad range of pathogens. Pneumocystis jirovecii was the most common. These detections were unexpected in the majority of these patients. (see Table) Broad range of Karius detected pathogens (including fastidious bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi and viruses) [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Open-ended, plasma-based NGS for mcfDNA with the KT provides a rapid, non-invasive method to diagnose deep-seated infection like pneumonia. This broad-based test detected a wide range of pathogens C many unsuspected C in patients with severe pneumonia and other invasive infections during the COVID-19 pandemic. These detections highlight the utility of the tool; which allowed better management including de-escalation of SARS-CoV-2 testing and selection of appropriate antibiotic therapy for the unexpected diagnoses.

METHODS A systematic review of recent literature on epidemiologic characteristics of traumatic fractures during the outbreak of COVID-19 was conducted. Multiple databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and Web of Science were searched, and articles comparing incidence for traumatic fractures before and after of COVID-19 outbreak were Results: From 8 published studies which had been reported from July 2020 to September 2020, a total of 9305 patients were identified. The study period of each study included varied from January 24 to May 22 in 2020. There was a significant decrease in the total number of trauma cases during lockdown by 3229 cases (pre-lockdown n = 6267 and lockdown n = 3038), amounting to a decrease by a pooled percentage of 51.6% (P = 0.012). The incidence of hand and tibia fractures decreased while the incidence of femoral fracture significantly increased during COVID-19 outbreak (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the fracture frequency for all other skeletal areas (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Evidence suggests that there was a significant decrease in the overall number of traumatic fractures during the COVID-19-related period of societal restrictions and lockdown. Proportions of most fractured areas were not significantly influenced by the state of emergency, except for femoral fractures, which had occurred more often during this state. Care must be taken, while developing contingency plans for reallocating resources during the COVID-19 pandemic, not to assume that all trauma presentations will decrease.

In order to eradicate an infectious disease, a method of prevention with low social cost is the most effective way. While we wait for new therapies and a vaccine, we are proposing a solution based on the existing knowledge in biomedical sciences. Here we propose to use low doses of hydroxychloroquine (50-100 mg daily orally) and intranasal interferon alpha-2b (IFN -2b) spray (0.5 X 10(6) IU twice daily) for the prophylaxis of COVID-19. Although there are ongoing clinical trials to test the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis, there has not been any proposal to test the efficacy of IFN -2b together with hydroxychloroquine to increase protection against COVID-19. Since the two act on two different mechanisms, we strongly believe that the two could have additive effects in prophylaxis against COVID-19. We recommend using a randomized control study to prove efficacy and safety.","output":"Use of Hydroxychloroquine and Interferon alpha-2b for the Prophylaxis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global and Indian data indicate that children from all the segments of population face dual nutrition burden and related health consequences. Long-term cohort studies have shown that both the under- and overnutrition are risk factors for overnutrition and non-communicable diseases in adult life. Halting the rise in overnutrition is one of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets to be achieved by 2030. With the development and inclusion of body mass index (BMI)-for-age in the WHO child growth standards, it has become possible to assess over- and undernutrition in short-statured children. In India, the Annual Health Survey (AHS) (2014) and the District Level Household Survey 4 (DLHS4) (2013) undertook measurement of height/length and weight (AHS 557016 and DLHS4 295663) in the 0C18-year of school-age children from selected households. Prevalence of overnutrition in 0C18-year children was calculated from these two surveys by using the WHO standards for BMI-for-age (BMI-for-age z scores (BAZ) > +2 in 0C5 and BAZ > +1 in 5C18-year children) as well as uniform norms of either > +1 or > +2 BAZ across 0C18-year children. An attempt was made to explore the policy and program implications of using different norms for assessing overnutrition in preschool and school age children in the Indian context. Body mass index-for-age curve for the 0C18-year Indian children was calculated and compared with the WHO BMI-for-age curve. Across 0C18-year children, the mean BMI-for-age of Indian boys and girls was lower than the mean of the WHO standards, but the trajectory followed was similar. Therefore, Indian high-risk under- and overnourished children can be monitored by using the WHO BMI-for-age curve. Irrespective of the cutoff used for BMI-for-age, prevalence of overnutrition was higher in preschool as compared to school-age children. Overnourished school-age children outnumbered preschool children, especially if the WHO cutoffs were used. The school health system may find it difficult to implement programs that aimed at detection and management of large number of overnourished children. If uniform norm of BAZ > +1 was used, prevalence of overnutrition in preschool children was high and almost similar to undernutrition. Currently, nutrition programs for preschool children are focused on undernutrition and they may find it difficult to manage program focused on overnutrition in large number of children. If the uniform norm of BAZ > +2 was used, both the prevalence of overnutrition and number of children requiring intervention were relatively low in all the age groups. The existing preschool and school nutrition programs can take up an integrated program aimed at early detection and effective management of both the under- (BAZ < ?2) and overnutrition (BAZ > +2) in 0C18-year children and strive to achieve the SDG targets.","output":"Overnutrition in Indian Children: Challenges and Opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A double-inactivated, candidate whole virus vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was developed and manufactured at large scale using fermenter cultures of serum protein free Vero cells.

The use of the adjuvant Al(OH)(3) had only a minor effect on the immunogenicity of the vaccine. In addition, cell mediated immunity as measured by interferon- and interleukin-4 stimulation, was elicited by vaccination. Moreover, the vaccine confers protective immunity as demonstrated by prevention of SARS-CoV replication in the respiratory tract of mice after intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV.

This rapid evolution creates a constant pressure for new knowledge and skills for the BMEs and therefore for continuous curriculum updates of education in BME, to meet current trends and market demands. Biomedical Engineering is relatively new when compared with other engineering disciplines. The earliest programs during the 1970s, most of which were at Doctoral and M.Sc. levels. B.Sc. programs were developed in most European Universities from the 1990s. Today there is an impressive trend to create new programs and the number of higher education institutions offering a BME degree is almost two hundred, just in Europe. Although biomedical engineering is playing a vital role in innovation, development, maintenance, and safe use of medical technology, BMEs are not yet recognized as a distinct professional entity and do not appear in the International Labour Organisation (ILO) lists. This is partly because biomedical engineering covers a very broad domain and includes professionals with very heterogeneous areas of specialization. Unlike in other engineering fields, where certification is a prerequisite for being a licensed professional, even for the clinical engineering, certification is not widely applied. This is mainly due to the lack of motivation since certification is not mandatory. In contrast with other health care professionals, that cannot practice their profession if they are not officially registered, such requirement does not exist for clinical engineers.

Over six large-scale and hundred small-scale farmers are currently producing various quail breeds for commercial purposes in South Africa. However, these farmers face challenges of high feed costs, diseases, poor health care, low demand (for quail meat and eggs) and limited access to the markets. In addition, the lack of a pre-existing local market for quail meat and eggs has seen most farmers exporting these products to other countries, but with low profit margins owing to the slow growth experienced by world economies. Furthermore, the socio-economic crisis brought by the global Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exacerbated these challenges as most of the countries enforced nationwide lockdown to mitigate the spread of the virus. Although this initiative was taken to save lives, it left quail farmers not knowing where to trade their stock due to large uncertainties in the social and economic domain, compounded by the fact that many South African citizens are traditionally accustomed to chicken products. Moreover, the size of the quail in relation to its market price when compared to that of chickens continues to lower its demand causing a lot of quail businesses to collapse. Thus, it is imperative to explore strategies that can reduce the cost of producing quail, while increasing their demand and popularity. Non-conventional feed ingredients and phytogenic feed additives that are inexpensive, locally available, and readily accessible should be identified and evaluated in quail diets to deliver sustainable production systems that will ensure that these birds continue to play a significant role in food and nutrition security of humans. In addition, extension service workers and quail farmers need to form a collaborative team to increase awareness about the benefits of quail products and build a long-lasting and profitable quail business. In this work, we present potential rearing methods for commercial quail production, nutritional benefits of quail products, as well as nutritional solutions for a sustainable and profitable quail business. Lastly, we review prospective awareness programs and marketing strategies that are aimed at successful commercialisation of quail using various networks.","output":"A way forward for the South African quail sector as a potential contributor to food and nutrition security following the aftermath of COVID-19: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The current outbreak of COVID-19 is an unprecedented event impacting people all around the world and leading to increased mental health concerns Although research regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is limited, research indicates that it has led to increased levels of stress and anxiety The lives of emerging adults in the United States were particularly disrupted due to unexpected changes, such as displacement and an abrupt switch to remote learning Consequently, it is imperative to assess how COVID-19 has impacted this population and how it may relate to anxiety severity Methods: The current study used self-report online measures to explore the relationship between COVID-19 life disruptions and anxiety severity in a sample of individuals aged 18 to 25 years (n = 353;Mage = 21 years;79% female;95% college student) A logistic regression analysis was conducted in order to examine the likelihood of an individual having moderate-to-severe anxiety based on the number of life disruptions (eg, loss of employment, contracting COVID-19, difficulties accessing basic needs) they have experienced Results: The logistic regression yielded significant results (2 [1] = 13 479;p &lt; 0 001;R2 = 0 046] The overall model yielded 59% correct classification, with 84% correct classification for none-to-minimal anxiety Examination of the ORs (OR = 1 316;p &lt; 0 001;95% CI, 1 132-1 530) indicated that life disruptions in a higher (vs lower) number of domains increased the likelihood of experiencing clinical levels of anxiety Further examination of specific life disruptions revealed that 3 of the 13 life disruptions listed were significant predictors for moderate-to-severe anxiety: 1) difficulties accessing basic needs(2 [1] = 10 757;p &lt; 0 01;R2 = 0 037;OR = 2 377;95% CI, 1 406-4 019);2) difficulties working from home (2 [1] = 8 335;p &lt; 0 01;R2 = 0 029;OR = 2 043;95% CI, 1 253-3 330);and 3) difficulties transitioning to remote learning (2 [1] = 6 002;p &lt; 0 05;R2 = 0 021;OR = 1 950;95% CI, 1 131-3 364) Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the impact of COVID-19 life disruptions on anxiety severity Given that the 3 life disruptions have been found to be significant predictors of anxiety, educational institutions should consider methods to ensure that students have access to basic needs and utilize strategies to enhance remote learning endeavors throughout the COVID-19 pandemic AD, RF, STRESS","output":"51.21 the Relationship between Covid-19 Life Disruptions and Anxiety Severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 epidemic is largely controlled by the use of face masks.

The very logic of political, economic and cultural processes is changing under the influence of digital technologies. The main categories of culture are undergoing transformation as a result of the rapid rearrangement of the entire way of life. In some societies, the technological component has already begun modifying the civilizational values. Various digital products acquire subjective characteristics and, among other things, influence certain cultural categories overcoming their own \\"natural\\" boundaries (in the sense of being within the framework of traditional concepts of human nature), and embrace the entire space of the technosphere. The challenges in communication and cooperation, rivalry and competition between humans and artificial subjects of various kind, be they androids or operating systems, proceed from the field of sci-fi predictions to the social and cultural spheres, turning them into the subject of legal regulation. Thus, human nature is changing: humans integrate technologies into the methods of communication, living their own corporeity and turning themselves from Homo sapiens into \\"inforgs\\" and cyborgs. At the same time, the sociocultural space is rapidly expanding primarily in two directions: firstly, spreading into a virtual, digital area and, secondly, integrating artificial subjects into human culture. Such convergence causes tectonic changes in society, even without so much as prospects for a literal, physical expansion of horizons, which should soon be disclosed to humanity in connection with a new round of global plans for outer space exploration. However, so far, the multilevel deployment of the Ecumene does not effectively contribute to solution of global problems. Instead, these problems multiply, acquire an even larger scale and superimpose on one another, posing challenges to humanity, the price of which is the survival of civilization and human beings themselves.

Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the knowledge level, causes, prevalence, and determinants of self-medication practices for the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between June and July 2020 among the Nigerian population, using a self-reported questionnaire. Statistical analysis of descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses was done using STATA 15. Results: A total of 461 respondents participated in the survey. Almost all the respondents had sufficient knowledge about self-medication (96.7%). The overall prevalence of self-medication for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 was 41%. The contributing factors were fear of stigmatization or discrimination (79.5%), fear of being quarantine (77.3%), and fear of infection or contact with a suspected person (76.3%). The proximal reasons for self-medication were emergency illness (49.1%), delays in receiving hospital services (28.1%), distance to the health facility (23%), and proximity of the pharmacy (21%). The most commonly used drugs for self-medication were vitamin C and multivitamin (51.8%) and antimalarials (24.9%). These drugs were bought mainly from pharmacies (73.9%). From the multivariable logistic regression model, males (OR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.07C0.54), and sufficient knowledge on SM (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.19C0.77) were significantly associated with self-medication. Conclusion: The key finding of this study was the use of different over-the-counter medications for the prevention (mainly vitamin C and multivitamins) and treatment (antibiotics/antimicrobial) of perceived COVID-19 infection by Nigerians with mainly tertiary education. This is despite their high knowledge and risk associated with self-medication.

Here, we assessed the antiviral capacity of a minimal RIG-I agonist, stem-loop RNA 14 (SLR14), in viral control, disease prevention, post-infection therapy, and cross-variant protection in mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A single dose of SLR14 prevented viral replication in the lower respiratory tract and development of severe disease in a type I interferon (IFN-I) dependent manner. SLR14 demonstrated remarkable protective capacity against lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection when used prophylactically and retained considerable efficacy as a therapeutic agent. In immunodeficient mice carrying chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection, SLR14 elicited near-sterilizing innate immunity by inducing IFN-I responses in the absence of the adaptive immune system. In the context of infection with variants of concern (VOC), SLR14 conferred broad protection and uncovered an IFN-I resistance gradient across emerging VOC. These findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of SLR14 as a host-directed, broad-spectrum antiviral for early post-exposure treatment and for treatment of chronically infected immunosuppressed patients.","output":"A stem-loop RNA RIG-I agonist confers prophylactic and therapeutic protection against acute and chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enhancing vaccine uptake is a critical public health challenge.

The first reminder had a greater effect when it was designed to make participants feel ownership of the vaccine dose. However, we found no evidence that combining the first reminder with a video-based information intervention designed to address vaccine hesitancy heightened its effect. We performed online studies (n = 3,181 participants) to examine vaccination intentions, which revealed patterns that diverged from those of the first randomized controlled trial;this underscores the importance of pilot-testing interventions in the field.

This study examined social determinants of parental COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and uptake for children and adolescents. Methods We used cross-sectional data from an ongoing COVID-19 cohort study in Montreal, Canada and included all parents of 2 to 18-year-olds who completed an online questionnaire between May 18 and June 26, 2021 (n = 809). We calculated child age-adjusted prevalence estimates of vaccine acceptance by parental education, race/ethnicity, birthplace, household income, and neighbourhood, and used multinomial logistic regression to estimate adjusted prevalence differences (aPD) and ratios (aPR). Social determinants of vaccine uptake were examined for the vaccine-eligible sample of 12 to 18 year-olds (n = 306). Results Intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19 was high, with only 12.4% of parents unlikely to have their child vaccinated. Parents with younger children were less likely to accept vaccination, as were those from lower-income households, racialized groups, and those born outside Canada. Children from households with annual incomes <$100,000 had 18.4 percent lower prevalence of being vaccinated/very likely vaccinated compared to household incomes $150,000 (95% CI: 10.1 to 26.7). Racialized parents reported greater unwillingness to vaccinate vs. White parents (aPD = 10.3;95% CI: 1.5, 19.1). Vaccine-eligible adolescents from the most deprived neighbourhood were half as likely to be vaccinated compared to those from the least deprived neighbourhood (aPR = 0.48;95% CI: 0.18 to 0.77).

We associate these breaking points with a timeline of key containment measures taken by national and regional governments, applying time lags for the time from contagion to case detection, with their associated errors. Results show an early decrease of Rt that preceded the nationwide lockdown; a generalized, sharp decrease in Rt associated with such lockdown; a low impact of the strengthened lockdown, with a flattening of Rt evolution in high-incidence regions regions - but increases in Rt at low-incidence regions; and an increase in Rt, associated to the relaxation of the lockdown measures, in ten regions. These results evidence the importance of generalized lockdown measures to contain COVID-19 spread; and the limited effect of the subsequent application of a stricter lockdown (restrictions to all non-essential economic activities).

We used the previously validated trauma-non-technical skills (T-NOTECHS) tool to identify communication gaps during patient management in the trauma bay and to inform development strategies to improve team performance. METHODS: Two reviewers independently assessed non-technical skills of team members through video footage at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. Team performance was measured using T-NOTECHS across five domains using a five-point Likert scale (lower score indicating worse performance): (1) leadership; (2) cooperation and resource management; (3) communication and interaction; (4) assessment and decision making; (5) situation awareness/coping with stress. Secondary outcomes assessed the number of callouts, closed loop communications and parallel conversations. RESULTS: The study included 55 trauma activations. Injury severity score (ISS) was used as a measure of trauma severity. A case with an ISS score  16 was considered severe. ISS was  16 in 37% of cases. Communication and interaction scored significantly lower compared to all other domains (p < 0.0001). There were significantly more callouts and completed closed loop communications in more severe cases compared to less severe cases (p = 0.017 for both).

METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, between January 2020 and February 2021, for studies reporting serum cystatin C concentrations, measures of clinical severity and survival outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021245295). RESULTS: Thirteen studies in 2510 COVID-19 patients, 1972 with low severity or survivor status and 538 with high severity or non-survivor status during follow up, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that serum cystatin C concentrations were higher in patients with high disease severity or non-survivor status (standard mean deviation, SMD, 1.71, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.46, p < 0.001). Extreme between-study heterogeneity was observed (I(2) = 97.5%, p < 0.001). Sensitivity analysis, performed by sequentially removing each study and re-assessing the pooled estimates, showed that the magnitude and direction of the effect size was not substantially modified.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) expresses eight such accessory genes (ORF3a, -3b, -6, -7a, -7b, -8a, -8b, and -9b), the most of any known coronavirus. This chapter will review our current knowledge of expression, structure, and function of each of the SARS-CoV accessory genes.","output":"SARS Coronavirus Accessory Gene Expression and Function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: We aimed to explore the predictive effectiveness of blood biochemical indexes for COVID-19 severity. Method: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of COVID-19 patients who were cured and discharged from the Public Health Treatment Center of Changsha from January 30, 2020, to February 19, 2020. According to the clinical classification of the disease, the patients were divided into severe and nonsevere groups. General clinical data and underlying medical conditions were recorded through the electronic medical record (EMR) system. Laboratory examination results of the patients during their hospitalization were collected, including the first results for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), peripheral blood lymphocyte ratio and count, and peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) count. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze the predictive effectiveness of blood biochemical indexes and other related factors for COVID-19 severity. Result: In all, 108 COVID-19 patients (median age: 43.9 years (range: 1-75); male patients: 56 (51.85%)) were enrolled, of whom 24 (22.22%) showed severe disease and 84 (77.78%) showed nonsevere disease, and two in 24 patients with severe disease developed into a critically severe type and died. Fever was the most common onset symptom (67.59%), followed by cough (48.15%) and fatigue (37.04%). Comorbidities were important factors affecting the severity of COVID-19, and among the patients with severe disease, the proportion with comorbidities was 70.83%, and the proportion without comorbidities was 29.17%. The intergroup difference was significant (P < 0.05). In patients with CRP levels (mg/L) of &#8804;8, >8-&#8804;20, >20-&#8804;40, and >40, the proportions of those with severe and nonsevere disease were 0 to 32, 7 to 19, 6 to 23, and 11 to 10, respectively; the intergroup difference was significant (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The presence or absence of comorbidities and CRP elevation were independent significant predictors of COVID-19 severity, and hypertension was found as the most common comorbidity in patients with severe disease.","output":"The Predictive Effectiveness of Blood Biochemical Indexes for the Severity of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Communicable diseases such as measles, influenza, and tuberculosis are a fact of life.

We conducted a sub-study to identify the communication channels by which HCPs preferred receiving public health alerts and advisories. METHODS Enrolled HCPs were blindly randomized into four message delivery groups to receive time-sensitive public health messages by e-mail, fax, or short message service (SMS) or to a no-message control group. Follow-up interviews were conducted 5-10 days after the message. In the final interview, additional questions were asked regarding HCP preferences for receiving public health alerts and advisories. We examined the relationship between key covariates and preferred method of receiving public health alert and advisory messages. RESULTS Gender, age, provider type, and study site showed statistically significant associations with delivery method preference. Older providers were more likely than younger providers to prefer e-mail or fax, while younger providers were more likely than older providers to prefer receiving messages via SMS. CONCLUSIONS There is currently no evidence-based research to guide or improve communication between public health agencies and HCPs.

In this study, we compared characteristics of hospitalised HCWs with non-HCWs with COVID-19 and assessed factors associated with COVID-19 mortality among HCWs. Methods: : Data from 5 March 2020 to 30 April 2021 was obtained from DATCOV, the national surveillance programme monitoring COVID-19 admissions in private and public hospitals across South Africa. A logistic regression model was used to determine factors associated with COVID-19 HCW admissions and mortality. Results: There were a total 169,678 confirmed COVID-19 admissions reported on DATCOV, of which 6,364 (3.8%) were HCWs. Compared to non-HCWs, HCWs were less likely to be male [aOR 0.3, 95%CI (0.3-0.4)], and more likely to be younger, white or other race, have pre-existing obesity and asthma, and be admitted in the private sector, in Eastern Cape, Gauteng, Kwa-Zulu Natal, Limpopo, Northern Cape and North West provinces. Pre-wave 1 [aOR 3.0;95%CI 2.4-3.7)], wave 1 [aOR 2.1;95%CI (1.8-2.5)] and post-wave 1 [aOR 1.3;95%CI (1.0-1.7)] were associated with increase in HCW admissions compared to wave 2. There was an increased risk for in-hospital mortality among HCWs in the older age group (40-49 [aOR 3.8;95%CI (1.6-8.80)];50-59 [aOR 4.7;95%CI (2.0-10.9)] and 60-65 years [aOR 9.8;95%CI (4.2-23.0)] compared to HCWs less than 40 years, with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney diseases, malignancy and TB. Mortality was decreased for HCWs who were coloured [aOR 0.5;95%CI (0.3-0.8)], admitted in the public sector [aOR 0.7;95%CI (0.5-0.9)] in pre-wave 1 [aOR 0.6;95%CI (0.3-0.9)] compared to wave one period. Conclusion: In-hospital mortality in HCWs was associated with age, race, wave period, presence of comorbidites and sector. Policies should be put in place to remove older HCWs with comorbidities from direct patient care.

Specifically, deciding the response over months or several months requires accurate long-term forecasts which is particularly challenging as the model errors accumulate with time. A critical factor that can hinder accurate long-term forecasts, is the number of unreported/asymptomatic cases. While there have been early serology tests to estimate this number, more tests need to be conducted for more reliable results. To identify the number of unreported/asymptomatic cases, we take an epidemiology data-driven approach. We show that we can identify lower bounds on this ratio or upper bound on actual cases as a factor of reported cases. To do so, we propose an extension of our prior heterogeneous infection rate model, incorporating unreported/asymptomatic cases. We prove that the number of unreported cases can be reliably estimated only from a certain time period of the epidemic data. In doing so, we construct an algorithm called Fixed Infection Rate method, which identifies a reliable bound on the learned ratio. We also propose two heuristics to learn this ratio and show their effectiveness on simulated data. We use our approaches to identify the upper bounds on the ratio of actual to reported cases for New York City and several US states.

HCoV strain OC43 (HCoV-OC43) can infect and persist in human neural cells and activate neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms, suggesting that it could be involved in neurological disease of unknown etiology in humans. Moreover, we have shown that HCoV-OC43 is neurovirulent in susceptible mice, causing encephalitis, and that a viral mutant with a single point mutation in the viral surface spike (S) protein induces a paralytic disease that involves glutamate excitotoxicity in susceptible mice. Herein, we show that glutamate recycling via the glial transporter 1 protein transporter and glutamine synthetase are central to the dysregulation of glutamate homeostasis and development of motor dysfunctions and paralytic disease in HCoV-OC43-infected mice. Moreover, memantine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist widely used in the treatment of neurological diseases in humans, improved clinical scores related to paralytic disease and motor disabilities by partially restoring the physiological neurofilament phosphorylation state in virus-infected mice. Interestingly, memantine attenuated mortality rates and body weight loss and reduced HCoV-OC43 replication in the central nervous system in a dose-dependent manner. This novel action of memantine on viral replication strongly suggests that it could be used as an antiviral agent to directly limit viral replication while improving neurological symptoms in various neurological diseases with a viral involvement. Mutations in the surface spike (S) protein of human respiratory coronavirus OC43 appear after persistent infection of human cells of the central nervous system, a possible viral adaptation to this environment. Furthermore, a single amino acid change in the viral S protein modulated virus-induced neuropathology in mice from an encephalitis to a neuropathology characterized by flaccid paralysis, which involves glutamate excitotoxicity. We now show that memantine, a drug that is used for alleviating symptoms associated with neuropathology, such as Alzheimer's disease, can partially restore the physiological state of infected mice by limiting both neurodegeneration and viral replication.

METHODS: We examined bone marrows from 20 autopsies and 2 living patients with COVID-19 using H&E-stained slides and immunohistochemical stains. Clinical history and laboratory values were reviewed. HScore was calculated to estimate risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (HLH). RESULTS: The deceased patients included 12 men and 8 women (aged 32 to >89 years; median, 63 years). Hematologic abnormalities included frequent neutrophilic leukocytosis, lymphopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia; one patient showed striking erythrocytosis. The bone marrows were all normocellular to hypercellular, most showing maturing trilineage hematopoiesis with myeloid left shift.

We present measurements of the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol droplets ([~]5-10{micro}m equilibrated radius) over timescales spanning from 5 seconds to 20 minutes using a novel instrument to probe survival in a small population of droplets (typically 5-10) containing [~]1 virus/droplet. Measurements of airborne infectivity change are coupled with a detailed physicochemical analysis of the airborne droplets containing the virus. A decrease in infectivity to [~]10 % of the starting value was observable for SARS-CoV-2 over 20 minutes, with a large proportion of the loss occurring within the first 5 minutes after aerosolisation. The initial rate of infectivity loss was found to correlate with physical transformation of the equilibrating droplet; salts within the droplets crystallise at RHs below 50% leading to a near instant loss of infectivity in 50-60% of the virus. However, at 90% RH the droplet remains homogenous and aqueous, and the viral stability is sustained for the first 2 minutes, beyond which it decays to only 10% remaining infectious after 10 minutes. The loss of infectivity at high RH is consistent with an elevation in the pH of the droplets, caused by volatilisation of CO2 from bicarbonate buffer within the droplet. Three different variants of SARS-CoV-2 were compared and found to have a similar degree of airborne stability at both high and low RH. SignificanceThe aerosol microenvironment is highly dynamic exposing pathogens, such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus when exhaled in respiratory aerosol, to extreme conditions of solute concentration, pH and evaporative cooling. Yet surviving this environment is a key step in the transmission of such pathogens. Understanding the impact that airborne transport has on pathogens and the influence of environmental conditions on pathogen survival can inform the implementation of strategies to mitigate the spread of diseases such as COVID-19.

The genetically distinct Caenorhabditis elegans strains, Bristol N2 and Hawaiian CB4856, are differentially susceptible to the Orsay virus (OrV). Here, we report the dissection of the genetic architecture of susceptibility to OrV infection. We compare OrV infection in the relatively resistant wild-type CB4856 strain to the more susceptible canonical N2 strain. To gain insight into the genetic architecture of viral susceptibility, 52 fully sequenced recombinant inbred lines (CB4856  N2 RILs) were exposed to OrV. This led to the identification of two loci on chromosome IV associated with OrV resistance. To verify the two loci and gain additional insight into the genetic architecture controlling virus infection, introgression lines (ILs) that together cover chromosome IV, were exposed to OrV. Of the 27 ILs used, 17 had an CB4856 introgression in an N2 background, and 10 had an N2 introgression in a CB4856 background. Infection of the ILs confirmed and fine-mapped the locus underlying variation in OrV susceptibility, and we found that a single nucleotide polymorphism in cul-6 may contribute to the difference in OrV susceptibility between N2 and CB4856. An allele swap experiment showed the strain CB4856 became as susceptible as the N2 strain by having an N2 cul-6 allele, although having the CB4856 cul-6 allele did not increase resistance in N2. In addition, we found that multiple strains with nonoverlapping introgressions showed a distinct infection phenotype from the parental strain, indicating that there are punctuated locations on chromosome IV determining OrV susceptibility. Thus, our findings reveal the genetic complexity of OrV susceptibility in C. elegans and suggest that viral susceptibility is governed by multiple genes.

METHODS: A new qPCR detection reagent contained two differentially methylated regions in SDC2 CpG islands for the detection of CRC was used in this study. Performance of the SDC2 methylation detection reagent was evaluated by analyzing limit of detection, precision, and specificity. The effect of interfering substances on assay performance was also tested. 339 subjects (102 CRC patients, 50 patients with advanced adenomas, 39 patients with non-advanced adenomas, 18 colitis patients and 130 normal individuals) from the China-Japan Friendship Hospital were evaluated. Approximately 2.5 g of stool sample was collected from each participant. Stool DNA was extracted and bisulfite-converted, followed by qPCR assay, which contained two pairs of primers for the methylation detection of two fragments of the SDC2 gene (named SDC2-A and SDC2-B). The diagnostic value of this test in CRC was evaluated by calculating receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and value of the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: The test kit was able to detect methylated SDC2 in stool DNA samples with concentrations as low as 90 copies/L in 100% of replicates. The sensitivity for detecting CRC by methylated SDC2-A alone was 85.29% (95% CI 77.03C91.00%) with a specificity of 96.15% (95% CI 91.08C98.58%). The sensitivity by methylated SDC2-B alone was 83.33% (95% CI 74.82C89.42%) with a specificity of 97.69% (95% CI 93.14C99.51%). However, when methylated SDC2-A and methylated SDC2-B were combined, the sensitivity for CRC detection improved to 87.25% (95% CI 79.27C92.53%) with a specificity of 94.62% (95% CI 89.11C97.56%). Further, the detection reagent achieved ROC-AUC 0.874 (95% CI 0.822C0.927) for SDC2-A, 0.906 (95% CI 0.859C0.952) for SDC2-B, and 0.939 (95% CI 0.902C0.977) for SDC2-Combine A&B.

In this study we aim to investigate and evaluate the impact of the pandemic on residents as well as residency training programs. Methods: A survey of 43 questions was prepared on Google forms and distributed among residents at a tertiary center in North Jordan in the period between October 30th and November 8th of 2020. The survey included questions that addressed the impact of the pandemic on residents health as well as training programs. Our cohort was stratified according to the type of residency program (surgical residents (SRs) and non-surgical residents (NSRs)). Statistical methods included descriptive analysis, Chi-square or Fishers exact test, and Mann Whitney U test. A two-sided p-value of  0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Out of 430 residents in the institute, 255 (59%) residents responded to the survey. Participation rate among SRs was 74% (121/164) compared with 50% among NSRs (134/266). A total of 17 (7%) of residents reported being infected with COVID-19 and a significant difference was reported between SRs and NSRs (10% vs 4%, P = 0.048). Approximately, 106 (42%) reported a decrease in the number of staff working at the clinic and 164 (64%) reported limited access to personal protective equipment during the pandemic. NSRs were more likely to be trained to protect themselves and others against COVID-19 spread compared to SRs (57% vs 37% P= 0.002, 55% vs 41% p=0.026 respectively) Conclusion: The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the workflow of residency training programs is very significant, thus institutes should modify their programs to fit residents needs to maintain education without any compromise in their health status. Training healthcare workers should be given a priority in any healthcare-related crisis as they are the first line in combating such circumstances.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic and the Residents Side of the Story: A Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stress necessitates rapid reprogramming of translation in order to facilitate an adaptive response and promote survival. Cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs) are dynamic structures that form in response to stress-induced translational arrest. PBs are linked to mRNA silencing and decay, while SGs are more closely linked to translation and the sorting of specific mRNAs for different fates. While they share some components and can interact physically, SGs and PBs are regulated independently, house separate functions, and contain unique markers. SG formation is associated with numerous disease states, and the expanding list of SG-associated proteins integrates SG formation with other processes such as transcription, splicing, and survival. Growing evidence suggests that SG assembly is initiated by translational arrest, and mediates cross talk with many other signaling pathways.","output":"Chapter 4 Regulation of Translation by Stress Granules and Processing Bodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The wide spectrum of unique needs and strengths of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a challenge for the worldwide healthcare system. With the plethora of information from research, a common thread is required to conceptualize an exhaustive pathogenetic paradigm. The epidemiological and clinical findings in ASD cannot be explained by the traditional linear genetic model, hence the need to move towards a more fluid conception, integrating genetics, environment, and epigenetics as a whole. The embryo-fetal period and the first two years of life (the so-called First 1000 Days) are the crucial time window for neurodevelopment. In particular, the interplay and the vicious loop between immune activation, gut dysbiosis, and mitochondrial impairment/oxidative stress significantly affects neurodevelopment during pregnancy and undermines the health of ASD people throughout life. Consequently, the most effective intervention in ASD is expected by primary prevention aimed at pregnancy and at early control of the main effector molecular pathways. We will reason here on a comprehensive and exhaustive pathogenetic paradigm in ASD, viewed not just as a theoretical issue, but as a tool to provide suggestions for effective preventive strategies and personalized, dynamic (from womb to adulthood), systemic, and interdisciplinary healthcare approach.","output":"Autism Spectrum Disorder from the Womb to Adulthood: Suggestions for a Paradigm Shift"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious micro-organisms may be transmitted by a variety of routes, and some may be spread by more than one route.

Yet, health care networks across the country have unequal infrastructure, human resources, equipment, and supplies resulting in uneven program performance and large disparities in cervical cancer incidence and mortality. An effective screening program needs multiple strategies feasible for each community's reality, facilitating coverage and follow-up adherence. Prioritizing those at highest risk with tests that better stratify risk will limit inefficiencies, improving program impact across different resource settings. Highly sensitive human papillomavirus (HPV)-DNA testing performs better than cytology and, with self-collection closer to homes and workplaces, improves access, even in remote regions. Molecular triage strategies like HPV genotyping can identify from the same self-collected sample, those at highest risk requiring follow-up. If proven acceptable, affordable, cost-effective, and efficient in the Brazilian context, these strategies would increase coverage while removing the need for speculum exams for routine screening and reducing follow-up visits.

The models are denoted SIR-$\\\\omega$ and SEIR-$\\\\omega$, and we focus attention on the early stages of an outbreak, where we derive expression for the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and the expected degree of the infectious nodes $E(D_I)$ using two different approximation approaches. The first approach approximates the early spread of an epidemic by a branching process, whereas the second one uses pair approximation. The expressions are compared with the corresponding empirical means obtained from stochastic simulations of SIR-$\\\\omega$ and SEIR-$\\\\omega$ epidemics on Poisson and scale-free networks. Without rewiring of exposed nodes, the two approaches predict the same epidemic threshold and the same $E(D_I)$ for both types of epidemics, the latter being very close to the mean degree obtained from simulated epidemics over Poisson networks. Above the epidemic threshold, pairwise models overestimate the value of $R_0$ computed from simulations, which turns out to be very close to the one predicted by the branching process approximation. When exposed individuals also rewire with $\\\\alpha>0$ (perhaps unaware of being infected), the two approaches give different epidemic thresholds, with the branching process approximation being more in agreement with simulations.","output":"A network epidemic model with preventive rewiring: comparative analysis of the initial phase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The aim of the study was to identify, interpret, and compare the current perspectives of regulatory agencies in six member countries of BRICS-TM (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Turkey, and Mexico) on the different criteria used for biosimilar development and marketing authorisation process. Methods: A semi-quantitative questionnaire was developed covering the organisation of agency, biosimilar development criteria and marketing authorisation process and sent to seven regulatory agencies covering the BRICS-TM countries. All data was kept anonymous and confidential. Data processing and analysis was carried out; descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data and content analysis was employed to generate themes for qualitative data. Results: Out of the seven regulatory agencies included in the study, six representatives provided the responses. The perspectives of these six regulatory agencies varied on a number of aspects relating to the review criteria for biosimilar development and licencing process. The most prevalent model for data assessment is the full review of a marketing authorisation application. There is lack of a standard approach across the agencies on sourcing of the reference biological product, in vivo toxicity studies and confirmatory clinical studies. Most agencies restrict interaction with biosimilar developers and any scientific advice is non-binding. The marketing authorisation approval depends on scientific assessment of the dossier, sample analysis and GMP certification. The agencies do not issue any public assessment report specifying the summary basis of biosimilar approval. Conclusion: Regulatory agencies across the six emerging economies are steadily improving the regulatory mechanism in the area of biosimilars. However, there remains scope for increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the processes by encouraging open and transparent interaction with developers, adopting a flexible approach toward accepting advanced analytical data in lieu of clinical studies and enhancing regulatory reliance amongst agencies.

Routinely collected clinical data were extracted and analysed for 645 patients who met the study inclusion criteria. Within this hospitalised cohort, the BAME population were younger relative to the white population (61.70 years, 95% CI 59.70-63.73 versus 69.3 years, 95% CI 67.17-71.43, p<0.001). When adjusted for age, sex and comorbidity, ethnicity was not a predictor for ICU admission.

MSCs have been widely used in clinical trials to treat multiple conditions associated with inflammation and tissue damage. Recent evidence suggests that most of the MSC therapeutic effects are derived from their secretome, including the extracellular vesicles, representing a promising approach in regenerative medicine application to treat organ failure as a result of inflammation/fibrosis. The recent outbreak of respiratory syndrome coronavirus, caused by the newly identified agent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has forced scientists worldwide to use all available instruments to fight the infection, including the inflammatory cascade caused by this pandemic disease. The use of MSCs is a valid approach to combat organ inflammation in different compartments. In addition to the lungs, which are considered the main inflammatory target for this virus, other organs are compromised by the infection. In particular, the liver is involved in the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes organ failure, leading to death in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We herein summarize the current implications derived from the use of MSCs and their soluble derivatives in COVID-19 treatment, and emphasize the potential of MSC-based therapy in this clinical setting.","output":"Mesenchymal stromal cell secretome in liver failure: Perspectives on COVID-19 infection treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After fusion with the cellular plasma membrane or endosomal membranes, viral particles are generally too large to diffuse freely within the crowded cytoplasm environment. Thus, they will never reach the cell nucleus or the perinuclear areas where replication or reverse transcription usually takes place. It has been proposed that many unrelated viruses are transported along microtubules in a retrograde manner using the cellular dynein machinery or, at least, some dynein components. A putative employment of the dynein motor in a dynein\\\\mediated transport has been suggested from experiments in which viral capsid proteins were used as bait in yeast two\\\\hybrid screens using libraries composed of cellular proteins and dynein\\\\associated chains were retrieved as virus\\\\interacting proteins. In most cases DYNLL1, DYNLT1 or DYNLRB1 were identified as the dynein chains that interact with viral proteins. The importance of these dyneinCvirus interactions has been supported, in principle, by the observation that in some cases the dynein\\\\interacting motifs of viral proteins altered by site\\\\directed mutagenesis result in non\\\\infective virions. Furthermore, overexpression of p50 dynamitin, which blocks the dyneinCdynactin interaction, or incubation of infected cells with peptides that compete with viral polypeptides for dynein binding have been shown to alter the viral retrograde transport. Still, it remains to be proved that dynein light chains can bind simultaneously to incoming virions and to the dynein motor for retrograde transport to take place.

METHODS: All healthcare providers in the South West of England (population 4 million) participated in this evaluation. 3890 patients aged &#8805;50 years presenting in primary care with low-risk symptoms of colorectal cancer had a FIT from 01/06/2018 to 31/12/2018. A threshold of 10 g Hb/g faeces defined a positive test. RESULTS: Six hundred and eighteen (15.9%) patients tested positive; 458 (74.1%) had an urgent referral to specialist lower gastrointestinal (GI) services within three months. Forty-three were diagnosed with colorectal cancer within 12 months. 3272 tested negative; 324 (9.9%) had an urgent referral within three months. Eight were diagnosed with colorectal cancer within 12 months. Positive predictive value was 7.0% (95% CI 5.1-9.3%). Negative predictive value was 99.8% (CI 99.5-99.9%). Sensitivity was 84.3% (CI 71.4-93.0%), specificity 85.0% (CI 83.8-86.1%). The area under the ROC curve was 0.92 (CI 0.86-0.96). A threshold of 37 g Hb/g faeces would identify patients with an individual 3% risk of cancer.

The study aimed to analyze maternal and neonatal complications associated with GDM. The risk factors of GDM and of the maternal and neonatal complications were studied in order to prevent their occurrence. Materials and Methods: The study included 97 women in the study, who underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) between weeks 24C28 of pregnancy, consequently being divided into two groups: pregnant women with and without GDM. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 26.0 software and MATLAB fitglm, the results being considered statistically significant if p < 0.05. Results: We observed statistically significant differences between the group of women with and without GDM, regarding gestational hypertension (17.6% vs. 0%), preeclampsia (13.72% vs. 0%), and cesarean delivery (96.1% vs. 78,3%). Data on the newborn and neonatal complications: statistically significant differences were recorded between the two groups (GDM vs. no GDM) regarding the average weight at birth (3339.41  658.12 g vs. 3122.83  173.67 g), presence of large for gestational age (21.6% vs. 0%), macrosomia (13.7% vs. 0%), excessive fetal growth (35.3% vs. 0%), respiratory distress (31.4% vs. 0%), hospitalization for at least 24 h in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (9.80% vs. 0%), and APGAR score <7 both 1 and 5 min following birth (7.8% vs. 0%). Additionally, the frequency of neonatal hypoglycemia and hyperbilirubinemia was higher among newborns from mothers with GDM. Conclusions: The screening and diagnosis of GDM is vital, and appropriate management is required for the prevention of maternal and neonatal complications associated with GDM. It is also important to know the risk factors for GDM and attempt to prevent their appearance.","output":"Analysis of Maternal and Neonatal Complications in a Group of Patients with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El impacto del Covid-19 en la economa europea ha sido similar al producido en la crisis de 2008, incluso con peores resultados a largo plazo.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the PED for treatment of wide necked small and medium intracranial aneurysms. METHODS PREMIER is a prospective, multicenter, single arm trial. Patients were treated with the PED for unruptured wide necked aneurysms, measuring 12 mm along the internal carotid artery or vertebral artery, between July 2014 and November 2015. At 1 year post-procedure, the primary effectiveness endpoint was complete occlusion (Raymond grade 1) without major parent vessel stenosis (50%) or retreatment, and the primary safety endpoint was major stroke in the territory supplied by the treated artery or neurologic death. RESULTS A total of 141 patients were treated with PEDs (mean age 54.611.3 years, 87.9% (124/141) women). Mean aneurysm size was 5.01.92 mm, and 84.4% (119/141) measured <7 mm. PED placement was successful in 99.3% (140/141) of patients. Mean number of PEDs implanted per patient was 1.10.26; a single PED was used in 92.9% (131/141) of patients. At 1 year, 97.9% (138/141) of patients underwent follow-up angiography with 76.8% (106/138) of patients having met the study's primary effectiveness endpoint. The combined major morbidity and mortality rate was 2.1% (3/140).

This could support the early detection of infectious cases and reduce further community transmission. However, the diagnostic accuracy of (unsupervised) self-testing with rapid antigen diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) is mostly unknown. We therefore conducted a large-scale head-to-head comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of a self-performed SARS-CoV-2 saliva and nasal Ag-RDT, each compared to a molecular reference test, in the general population in the Netherlands. Methods In this cross-sectional study we consecutively included individuals aged 16 years and older presenting for SARS-CoV-2 testing at three Dutch public health service test sites irrespective of their indication for testing, vaccination status, and symptomatology. Participants were sampled for molecular testing at the test site and received two self-tests (the Hangzhou AllTest saliva self-test and the SD Biosensor nasal self-test by Roche Diagnostics) to perform at home within a few hours without knowledge of their molecular test result. Information on presence and type of symptoms, user experiences, and results of both self-tests were collected via an online questionnaire. For each self-test, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were determined with molecular testing as reference standard. Findings The SARS-CoV-2 molecular reference test positivity rate was 6.5% in the 2,819 participants. Overall sensitivities with 95% confidence intervals were 46.7% (85/182; 39.3%-54.2%) for the saliva Ag-RDT, and 68.9% (124/180; 61.6%-75.6%) for the nasal Ag-RDT. With a viral load cut-off ([]5.2 log10 SARS-CoV-2 E-gene copies/mL) as a proxy of infectiousness, sensitivities increased to 54.9% (78/142; 46.4%-63.3%) for the saliva Ag-RDT and 83.9% (120/143; 76.9%-89.5%) for the nasal Ag-RDT. For the nasal Ag-RDT, sensitivities were 78.5% [71.1%-84.8%] and 22.6% [9.6%-41.1%] in those with and without symptoms at the time of sampling, which increased to 90.4% (113/125; 83.8%-94.9%) and 38.9% (7/18; 17.3%-64.3%) after applying the viral load cut-off. In those with and without prior confirmed SARS-CoV-2, sensitivities were 36.8% [19/372; 16.3%-61.6%] and 72.7% [161/2437; 65.1%-79.4%] for the nasal Ag-RDT, which increased to 100% (7/7; 59.0%-100%) and 83.1% (113/126; 75.7%-89.0%) after applying the viral load cut-off. The diagnostic accuracy of the nasal Ag-RDT did not differ by COVID-19 vaccination status, sex, and age. Specificities were >99%, positive predictive values >70% and negative predictive values >95%, for the saliva Ag-RDT, and >99%, >90%, and >95% for the nasal Ag-RDT, respectively, in most analyses. Interpreting the results was considered (very) easy for both self-tests. Interpretation The Hangzhou AllTest self-performed saliva Ag-RDT is not reliable for SARS-CoV-2 infection detection, overall nor in the studied subgroups. The SD Biosensor self-performed nasal Ag-RDT had high sensitivity in individuals with symptoms and in those without a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall accuracy in individuals with symptoms was comparable to that found in previous studies with professional-performed sampling for this Ag-RDT. The extremely low sensitivity of the nasal Ag-RDT in asymptomatic individuals and in individuals who had had a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is an important finding and warrants further investigation.","output":"Accuracy and usability of saliva and nasal rapid antigen self-testing for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population: a head-to-head comparison"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected most of the world's population to unprecedented situations, like national lockdowns, health hazards, social isolation and economic harm Such a scenario calls for urgent measures not only to palliate it but also, to better cope with it According to existential positive psychology, well-being does not simply represent a lack of stress and negative emotions but highlights their importance by incorporating an adaptive relationship with them Thus, suffering can be mitigated (and transformed into growth) by, among other factors, adopting an attitude of positive reframing, maintaining hope, existential courage, life appreciation, engagement in meaningful activities, and prosociality The conglomerate of these elements has been recently denominated as meaning-centered coping In this study, we evaluated the protective role of this type of coping on mental health A sample of 12,243 participants from 30 countries across all continents completed measures of Meaning-Centered Coping Scale (MCCS), depression, stress, anxiety and stressful COVID-19 related conditions they experienced Results indicated that meaning-centered coping was strongly associated with diminished symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression Moreover, it moderated various relationships between vulnerability factors and markers of psychological distress, especially in the case of depression These findings call for attention to meaning-centered coping approaches in the context of hardship, such as the current COVID-19 health crisis In these difficult times, decision-makers and health organizations may integrate these approaches into their guidelines","output":"Meaning-Centered Coping in the Era of COVID-19: Direct and Moderating Effects on Depression, Anxiety, and Stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: While COVID-19 pandemic associated with quarantine, social distancing and isolation influenced many aspects of people's lives including stress and mood regulation only little is known about the psychological impact on patients waiting for liver or kidney transplantation Thus this study was designed to fill this scientific gap Methods: Twenty-seven wait list patients and 43 healthy controls underwent the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-2), 12-item Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnosis Structure Questionnaire (OPD-SQS), Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI18), Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire (PSQI), Alcohol Use Identification Test (AUDIT), and a questionnaire to determine cognition, attitude and fear related to COVID-19 Results: Levels of the BSI subscale somatization were increased in wait list patients (F=4 41, p=0 04) There was no difference between patients and healthy controls in the depression scores (BDI) (BDI: F(1,66), p=0 998;3 333 92 vs 3 63) and PSQI sleep components (F(7 54)=1 23, p=0 3, Eta=0 137);however, COVID-specific fears (F(3 65)=3 84, p=0 014, Eta=0 151) was different between groups indicating more fear of infecting others with the Coronavirus in controls (F=5 8, p=0 019, Eta=0 08;3 33 44 vs 5 122 5) In addition, partial correlation analyses between the emotional distress due to social distancing and the symptom load scales indicated a relationship between somatization and anxiety (r=0 53, p&lt;0 001) in wait list patients Further depression correlated positively with the items loneliness, boredom, and frustration in patients Conclusion: Results of our study clearly demonstrates that COVID-19 pandemic significantly increases somatization in wait list patients most likely due to stress while healthy controls experience more COVID-19 associated fears Thus effective strategies for stress reduction, more information on their illness, medication, skills for emotional regulation and healthy lifestyle are needed","output":"Covid-19 pandemic induces stress-induced somatization in wait list patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective It is considered that laparoscopic single-site surgery should be performed by specially trained surgeons because of the technical difficulty in using special instruments through limited access.

In patients undergoing right nephrectomy, a 2-mm port was added for liver retraction. We retrospectively re-evaluated all of the recorded surgical videos and preoperative computed tomography images. The pneumoperitoneum time (PT) was used as an objective index of surgical difficulty. Results The PT was significantly shorter for right nephrectomy than left nephrectomy (94 vs. 123 min, P = 0.004). With left nephrectomy, dissection of the spleno-renal ligament to mobilize the spleen medially required additional time. Also, the left renal vein could only be divided after securing the adrenal, gonadal and lumbar veins. In patients whose renal artery was located cranial to the renal vein, PT tended to be longer than in the other patients (131 vs. 108 min, P = 0.070). In patients with a superior renal artery, the inferior renal vein invariably covered the artery and made it difficult to ligate the renal artery via the umbilical approach at the first procedure.

We undertook this study to validate our institutional protocols which were formulated to cater to the change in volume and pattern of neurosurgical cases during the raging pandemic. Methods All admitted patients scheduled to undergo major neurosurgical intervention during the lockdown period (15 March 2020 to 15 September 2020) were included in the study. The data involving surgery outcomes, disease pattern, anaesthesia techniques, patient demographics as well as COVID-19 status was analysed and compared with similar retrospective data of neurosurgical patients operated during the same time period in the previous year (15 March 2019 to 15 September 2019). Results Barring significant increase in surgery for stroke (P = 0.008) and hydrocephalus (P <0.001), the overall case load of neurosurgery during the study period in 2020 was 42.75% of that in 2019 (P <0.001); and the same was attributable to a significant reduction in elective spine surgeries (P < 0.001). However no significant difference was observed in the overall incidence of emergency and essential surgeries undertaken during the two time periods (P = 0.482). There was an increased incidence in the use of monitored anaesthesia care (MAC) techniques during emergency and essential neurosurgical procedures by the anaesthesia team in 2020 (P < 0.001). COVID-19 patients had overall poor outcomes (P = 0.003), with significant increase in mortality amongst those subjected to general anaesthesia vis-a-vis MAC (p = 0.014). Conclusions Despite a significant decrease in neurosurgical workload during the COVID-19 lockdown period in 2020, the volume of emergency and essential surgeries did not change much compared to the previous year.

AS-30D cell or hepatocyte suspensions were subjected to a treatment with omeprazole and exposure to light (that is required to activate omeprazole in the active site of ALDH) and then exposed to H2 O2 . Cells showed viability similar to control cells, total activity of ALDH was preserved, while cell levels of lipid aldehydes and oxidative stress markers were maintained low. Cell protection by omeprazole was avoided by inhibition of ALDHs with disulfiram, revealing the key role of these enzymes in the protection. Additionally, omeprazole also preserved ALDH2 (mitochondrial isoform) activity, diminishing lipid aldehyde levels and oxidative stress in this organelle, protecting mitochondrial respiration and transmembrane potential formation capacity, from the stress generated by H2 O2 . These results highlight the important role of ALDHs as part of the antioxidant system of the cell, since if the activity of these enzymes decreases under stress conditions, the viability of the cell is compromised.","output":"Activation of ALDH1A1 by omeprazole reduces cell oxidative stress damage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Soft tissue defects created by excision of dermatologic malignancies may present a significant challenge to the reconstructive surgeon, particularly when tendon, bone, cartilage, or other vital structures are exposed. Although there are several reliable options for regional or free tissue transfer, many patients with skin cancers are poor surgical candidates. Recent literature has described the use of an acellular dermal regeneration template (ADRT) (Integra LifeSciences Corp, Plainsboro, NJ) with split-thickness skin grafting (STSG) as an alternative to the previously mentioned surgical options. OBJECTIVE To use ADRT with negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) and STSG to reconstruct complex Mohs defects of the scalp and feet. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two patients underwent wide local excision of squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. ADRT and a NPWT device were applied. The patients were then skin grafted 7 to 10 days later. RESULTS Both patients had take of their skin grafts and completely healed their wounds without local recurrence. Results were both functionally and aesthetically satisfactory. CONCLUSION The use of ADRT with vacuum-assisted closure followed by split-thickness skin grafting is an acceptable alternative to regional or free tissue transfer for reconstruction of complex Mohs defects.","output":"Vacuum-assisted closure device and skin substitutes for complex Mohs defects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of new antibiotics to treat multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria or possess broad-spectrum activity is one of the challenging tasks.

As of 21 March 2020, this epidemic has spread to 179 countries with more than 200 000 confirmed cases and 8578 deaths. The outbreak has put enormous pressure on the medical establishment and even led to exhaustion of medical resources in the most affected areas. Other medical work has been significantly affected in the context of COVID-19 epidemic. In order to reduce or avoid cross-infection with COVID-19, many hospitals have taken measures to limit the number of outpatient visits and inpatients. For example, emergency surgery can only be guaranteed, and most other surgeries can be postponed. Patients with cancer are one of the groups most affected by the epidemic because of their systematic immunosuppressive state and requirement of frequent admission to hospital. Consequently, specific adjustments for their treatment need to be made to cope with this situation. Therefore, it is of significance to summarize the relevant experience of China in the prevention and control of COVID-19 infection and treatment of patients with cancer during the epidemic.","output":"When cancer encounters COVID-19 in China: what have we suffered, experienced and learned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computational thinking is widely recognized as important, not only to those interested in computer science and mathematics but also to every student in the twenty-first century.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between starting smoking with e-cigarettes or conventional cigarettes and suicidal behaviors among Korean adolescents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data on adolescents in grades 7 through 12 who participated in the nationwide Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Survey between 2015 and 2018. EXPOSURES: Type of cigarette initially smoked: electronic or conventional. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association between initial cigarette type and suicidal behaviors, including suicidal ideation and suicide planning and attempts. All participants completed questionnaires about their history of suicidal behavior and were categorized into groups according to the type of cigarette used at initiation of smoking and any subsequent change (or lack of change) in the type of cigarette used. RESULTS: A total of 255 887 Korean adolescents (51.2% male; mean (SD) age, 15.0 [1.8] years) were included in the primary analysis. Among 131 094 male adolescents, 3310 boys (2.5%) initially used e-cigarettes and 27 368 boys (20.9%) initially used conventional cigarettes. Among 124 793 female adolescents, 952 girls (0.8%) initially used e-cigarettes and 9296 girls (7.4%) initially used conventional cigarettes. Of those who initially used e-cigarettes, 178 of 3310 boys (5.4%) and 134 of 952 girls (14.1%) attempted suicide. Of those who initially used conventional cigarettes, 946 of 27 368 boys (3.5%) and 911 of 9296 girls (9.8%) attempted suicide. Adolescents who initially used e-cigarettes had a higher risk of suicidal behaviors, including suicide planning (boys: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.63 [95% CI, 1.40-1.89]; P < .001; girls: AOR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.23-1.95]; P < .001) and suicide attempts (boys: AOR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.28-1.87]; P < .001; girls, AOR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.29-2.10]; P < .001) compared with those who initially used conventional cigarettes. Changing from e-cigarettes to conventional cigarettes was associated with a higher risk of suicide attempts among both boys (AOR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.39-2.57; P < .001) and girls (AOR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.53-3.64; P < .001) compared with changing from conventional cigarettes to e-cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the initial use of e-cigarettes vs conventional cigarettes was associated with suicidal behaviors among adolescents. In future research on the association of e-cigarette use with adolescent mental health and interventions for suicide prevention, the type of cigarette initially used and changing the cigarette type should be considered.","output":"Association of Cigarette Type Initially Smoked With Suicidal Behaviors Among Adolescents in Korea From 2015 to 2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Major interventions have been introduced worldwide to slow down the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Large-scale lockdowns of human movements are effective in reducing the spread, but they come at a cost of significantly limited societal functions. We show that natural human movements are statistically diverse, and the spread of the disease is significantly influenced by a small group of active individuals and gathering venues. We find that interventions focused on these most mobile individuals and popular venues reduce both the peak infection rate and the total infected population while retaining high social activity levels. These trends are seen consistently in simulations with real human mobility data of different scales, resolutions, and modalities from multiple cities across the world. The observation implies that compared to broad sweeping interventions, more heterogeneous strategies that are targeted based on the network effects in human mobility provide a better balance between pandemic control and regular social activities.","output":"Heterogeneous Interventions Reduce the Spread of COVID-19 in Simulations on Real Mobility Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: People living in group situations or with dementia are more vulnerable to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Older people and those with multimorbidity have higher mortality if they become infected than the general population. However, no systematic study exists of COVID-19-related outcomes in older inpatients in psychiatric units, who comprise people from these high-risk groups. We aimed to describe the period prevalence, demographics, symptoms (and asymptomatic cases), management, and survival outcomes of COVID-19 in the older inpatient psychiatric population and people with young-onset dementia in five National Health Service Trusts in London, UK, from March 1 to April 30, 2020. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we collected demographic data, mental health diagnoses, clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, symptoms, management, and COVID-19-related outcome data of inpatients aged 65 years or older or with dementia who were already inpatients or admitted as inpatients to five London mental health Trusts between March 1 and April 30, 2020, and information about available COVID-19-related resources (ie, testing and personal protective equipment). Patients were determined to have COVID-19 if they had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, or had relevant symptoms indicative of COVID-19, as determined by their treating physician. We calculated period prevalence of COVID-19 and analysed patients' characteristics, treatments, and outcomes. FINDINGS: Of 344 inpatients, 131 (38%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period (period prevalence 38% [95% CI 33-43]). The mean age of patients who had COVID-19 was 753 years (SD 82); 68 (52%) were women and 47 (36%) from ethnic minority groups. 16 (12%) of 131 patients were asymptomatic and 121 (92%) had one or more disease-related comorbidity. 108 (82%) patients were compulsorily detained. 74 (56%) patients had dementia, of whom 13 (18%) had young-onset dementia. On average, sites received COVID-19 testing kits 45 days after the first clinical COVID-19 presentation. 19 (15%) patients diagnosed with COVID-19 died during the study period, and their deaths were determined to be COVID-19 related. INTERPRETATION: Patients in psychiatric inpatient settings who were admitted without known SARS-CoV-2 infection had a high risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 compared with those in the community and had a higher proportion of deaths from COVID-19 than in the community. Implementation of the long-standing policy of parity of esteem for mental health and planning for future COVID-19 waves in psychiatric hospitals is urgent.

Pregnancy is also a physiologic state characterized by higher levels of multiple hormones that may impact the effector functions of immune cells, such as progesterone, estrogen, human chorionic gonadotropin, prolactin, and relaxin. Each of these hormones acts to support a tolerogenic immune state of pregnancy, which helps prevent fetal rejection, but may also contribute to an impaired antiviral response.
