There is a current need to follow the maintenance of special antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we reported changes of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent patients over 8 months. Antibodies of all 20 participants targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding-domain (RBD) had decreased from a mean OD450 value 1.78 to 0.38 over 8 months. The neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers decreased from the mean ID50 value 836 to 170. The NAb titers were significantly correlated with IgG level during 8 months (P<0.001). Furthermore, while RBD-specific IgG existence of 25% (5/20) convalescent plasma was undetectable, the NAb titers of 15% (3/20) convalescent plasma decreased below the threshold. In addition, compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (S-D614), lower titers of neutralizing antibodies against its G614 variant were shown at 8 months after symptom onset.

Objective The objective of the study to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 patients diagnosed in a tertiary-care center in Mexico City and to assess differences according to the treatment setting (ambulatory vs. hospital) and to the need of intensive care (IC). Methods We conducted a prospective cohort, including consecutive patients with COVID-19 from February 26, 2020 to April 11, 2020. Results We identified 309 patients (140 inpatients and 169 outpatients). The median age was 43 years (interquartile range, 33-54), 59.2% men, and 18.6% healthcare workers (12.3% from our center). The median body mass index (BMI) was 29.00 kg/m2 and 39.6% had obesity. Compared to outpatients, inpatients were older, had comorbidities, cough, and dyspnea more frequently. Twenty-nine (20.7%) inpatients required treatment in the IC unit (ICU). History of diabetes (type 1 or 2) and abdominal pain were more common in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients. ICU patients had higher BMIs, higher respiratory rates, and lower room-air capillary oxygen saturations. ICU patients showed a more severe inflammatory response as assessed by white blood cell count, neutrophil and platelet count, C-reactive protein, ferritin, procalcitonin, and albumin levels. By the end of the study period, 65 inpatients had been discharged because of improvement, 70 continued hospitalized, and five had died. Conclusions Patients with comorbidities, either middle-age obese or elderly complaining of fever, cough, or dyspnea, were more likely to be admitted. At admission, patients with diabetes, high BMI, and clinical or laboratory findings consistent with a severe inflammatory state were more likely to require IC.","output":"CLINICAL AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH COVID-19 IN A TERTIARY CARE CENTER IN MEXICO CITY: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic.

Unprecedented rapid investments in vaccine development have been made to counter the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. While vaccines are a key pillar of modern medicine, SARS-CoV-2 has mutated as it spread among humans. Vaccines previously developed and approved by regulators are becoming less effective against new variants. One variant of SARS-CoV-2 known as B.1.351 that was first reported to be present in South Africa significantly reduces the efficacy of vaccines developed to date.

The aim of this study was to compare the hemodynamics and inflammatory response of a novel transumbilical technique with that of a conventional transthoracic technique in thoracic exploration and lung resection in a canine model. METHODS Sixteen dogs were randomly assigned to undergo transumbilical thoracoscopy (n = 8) or standard thoracoscopy (n = 8). Animals in the umbilical group received lung resection via a 3-cm transumbilical incision in combination with a 2.5-cm transdiaphragmatic incision. Animals in the standard thoracoscopy group underwent lung resection via a 3-cm thoracic incision. Hemodynamic parameters (e.g., mean arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, and global end-diastolic volume index) and inflammatory parameters (e.g., neutrophil count, neutrophil 2',7' -dichlorohydrofluorescein [DCFH] expression, monocyte count, monocyte inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, total lymphocyte count, CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte counts, the CD4+/CD8+ratio, plasma Creactive protein level, interleukin-6 level) were evaluated before surgery, during the operation, and on postoperative days 1, 3, 7, and 14. RESULTS Lung resections were successfully performed in all 16 animals. There were 2 surgery-related mortality complications (1 animal in each group). In the transumbilical group, 1 death was caused by early extubation before the animal fully recovered from the anesthesia. In the thoracoscopic group, 1 death was caused by respiratory distress and the complication of sepsis at 5 days after surgery. There was no significant difference between the two techniques with regard to the hemodynamic and immunologic impact of the surgeries. CONCLUSION This study suggests that the hemodynamic and inflammatory changes with endoscopic lung resection performed by the transumbilical approach are comparable to those after using the conventional transthoracic approach. This information is novel and relevant for surgeons interested in developing new surgical techniques in minimally invasive surgery.","output":"Hemodynamic and inflammatory responses following transumbilical and transthoracic lung wedge resection in a live canine model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examined the pathogens, morphologic patterns, and risk factors associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in 136 recently weaned cattle (\\"weanlings\\"), 6-12 mo of age, that were submitted for postmortem examination to regional veterinary laboratories in Ireland.

Lungs with histologic lesions were categorized into 1 of 5 morphologic patterns of pneumonia. Fibrinosuppurative bronchopneumonia (49%) and interstitial pneumonia (48%) were the morphologic patterns recorded most frequently. The various morphologic patterns of pulmonary lesions suggest the involvement of variable combinations of initiating and compounding infectious agents that hindered any simple classification of the etiopathogenesis of the pneumonias. Dual infections were detected in 58% of lungs, with Mannheimia haemolytica and Histophilus somni most frequently recorded in concert. M. haemolytica (43%) was the most frequently detected respiratory pathogen; H. somni was also shown to be frequently implicated in pneumonia in this age group of cattle. Bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3) and Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (16% each) were the viral agents detected most frequently. Potential respiratory pathogens (particularly Pasteurella multocida, BPIV-3, and H. somni) were frequently detected (64%) in lungs that had neither gross nor histologic pulmonary lesions, raising questions regarding their role in the pathogenesis of BRD.

Relevant research is also insufficient, which has led to a lack of clarity in current understanding of the microscopic mechanism of variations in the deviation factor of high-CO2 natural gas under high-temperature and ultrahigh-pressure conditions. This has greatly limited the development of natural gas reservoirs containing CO2. To reveal the microscopic mechanism of variations in the deviation factor of natural gas containing CO2 as a function of pressure under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions, by physical simulation experiments, the deviation factors of samples of sour natural gas with known CO2 contents from the Ledong gas reservoir were determined. Then, according to the idealized parameters of the physical experiment, a molecular model of natural gas containing CO2 was established using molecular simulation methods. Changes in molecular density, molecular volume, nonbonding interaction energy, potential energy, and kinetic energy during variations in the deviation factor of a CO2-containing natural gas system as a function of pressure under high-temperature and ultrahigh-pressure conditions were quantitatively studied. Using molecular simulation techniques, it was found that the changes in total energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy between molecules are the internal factors that cause variations in the deviation factor of natural gas systems containing CO2 under ultrahigh-temperature and high-pressure conditions. The results show that the increase of carbon dioxide content in natural gas will cause the total energy of natural gas molecules to decrease when the pressure is constant. This means that the higher the CO2 content in natural gas, the easier it will be compressed.

This fatal zoonotic pathogen was first described in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012. Epidemiological and molecular evidence revealed zoonotic transmission from camels to humans and between humans. Currently, MERS-CoV is classified by the WHO as having high pandemic potential requiring greater surveillance. Previous studies of MERS-CoV in Kenya mainly focused on site-specific and archived camel and human serum samples for antibodies. We conducted active nationwide cross-sectional surveillance of camels and humans in Kenya, targeting both nasal swabs and plasma samples from 1,163 camels and 486 humans collected from January 2016 to June 2018. A total of 792 camel plasma samples were positive by ELISA. Seroprevalence increased with age, and the highest prevalence was observed in adult camels (82.37%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 79.50C84.91). More female camels were significantly seropositive (74.28%, 95% CI 71.14C77.19) than male camels (P < 0.001) (53.74%, 95% CI 48.48C58.90). Only 11 camel nasal swabs were positive for MERS-CoV by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequences showed that Kenyan MERS-CoV clustered within sub-clade C2, which is associated with the African clade, but did not contain signature deletions of orf4b in African viruses.

These measures tend to have been derived from communally orientated East Asian cultures. The way that culturally relevant concepts of rights and freedoms underpin COVID restrictions in democratic and individually orientated countries remains unknown. This data memo addresses this issue through analysis of pro- and anti-restriction discourse on social media in the US. It finds that anti-social and economic restriction discourse more frequently articulates rights and freedoms, based on ideas of inviolable rights to freedom of movement or freedom of economic activity or a cost-benefit analysis that places economic activity over public health. Pro-social and economic restriction discourse less frequently mentions rights and freedoms, instead supporting restrictions as following state and medical advice and out of deference and respect to medical professionals. Discourse is highly polarised and divisive and articulated largely through established political identity positions. It is suggested that more attention is paid to discussions of balancing rights and freedoms in COVID control restrictions. To convince opposers of restrictions, supporters of restrictions should base arguments around communal rights and positive freedoms. It is also important to critically evaluate whether and how these perspectives need to be adapted to be appropriate and resonant in democratic and individualistic countries.","output":"Balancing freedoms, rights and responsibilities during COVID in US: a study of anti- and pro-restriction discourse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Crop breeding has mainly been focused on increasing productivity, either directly or by decreasing the losses caused by biotic and abiotic stresses (that is, incorporating resistance to diseases and enhancing tolerance to adverse conditions, respectively).

It has not been until recently that crop biofortification has become an objective within breeding programs, through either conventional methods or genetic engineering. There are many steps along this long path, from the initial evaluation of germplasm for the content of nutrients and health-promoting compounds to the development of biofortified varieties, with the available and future genomic tools assisting scientists and breeders in reaching their objectives as well as speeding up the process. This review offers a compendium of the genomic technologies used to explore and create biodiversity, to associate the traits of interest to the genome, and to transfer the genomic regions responsible for the desirable characteristics into potential new varieties.

Increased recognition of the need for improved protections has led to policy initiatives at the state and federal levels, including national Joint Commission requirements that went into effect January 2022. California's WV prevention legislation was phased in during 2017-2018 and requires hospitals to use a new incident reporting system, the Workplace Violent Incident Reporting System (WVIRS) for Hospitals. We analyzed WVIRS data collected during the first three years of its implementation, July 1, 2017 - June 30, 2020. In addition, we collected qualitative data from six California hospitals/hospital systems during 2019-2020 to better understand reporting practices. Over the three-year period, the 413 hospitals using the WVIRS reported between zero and six incidents per staffed bed. Sixteen hospitals (3.9%) reported two or more incidents per staffed bed while the rest reported fewer than two incidents. Qualitative analysis identified that reporting procedures vary considerably among hospitals. Several organizations rely on workers to complete incident reports electronically while others assign managers or security personnel to data collection. Some hospitals appear to report only those incidents involving physical harm to the worker. Regulatory guidance for reporting practices and hospitals' commitment to thorough data collection may improve consistency. As hospitals throughout the U.S. consider practice changes to comply with new WV standards, those engaged in implementation efforts should look closely at reporting practices. Greater consistency in reporting across facilities can help to build evidence for best practices and lead to safety improvements.","output":"Differences in Hospitals' Workplace Violence Incident Reporting Practices: A Mixed Methods Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we investigate the relationships between proper efficiency and the solutions of a general scalarization problem in multi-objective optimization.

In order to re-invigorate immunization service delivery, sufficient financing must be made available from all sources, and particularly from government resources. This study utilizes the most recent data available to provide an updated comparison of available data sources on government spending on immunization. METHODS: We examined data from WHO/UNICEF's Joint Reporting Form (JRF), country Comprehensive Multi-Year Plan (cMYP), country co-financing data for Gavi, and WHO National Health Accounts (NHA) on government spending on immunization for consistency by comparing routine and vaccine spending where both values were reported. We also examined spending trends across time, quantified underreporting and utilized concordance analyses to assess the magnitude of difference between the data sources. RESULTS: Routine immunization spending reported through the cMYP was nearly double that reported through the JRF (rho = 0.64, 95% 0.53 to 0.77) and almost four times higher than that reported through the NHA on average (rho = 3.71, 95% 1.00 to 13.87). Routine immunization spending from the JRF was comparable to spending reported in the NHA (rho = 1.30, 95% 0.97 to 1.75) and vaccine spending from the JRF was comparable to that from the cMYP data (rho = 0.97, 95% 0.84 to 1.12). Vaccine spending from both the JRF and cMYP was higher than Gavi co-financing by a at least two (rho = 2.66, 95% 2.45 to 2.89) and (rho = 2.66, 95% 2.15 to 3.30), respectively. IMPLICATIONS: Overall, our comparative analysis provides a degree of confidence in the validity of existing reporting mechanisms for immunization spending while highlighting areas for potential improvements. Users of these data sources should factor these into consideration when utilizing the data. Additionally, partners should work with governments to encourage more reliable, comprehensive, and accurate reporting of vaccine and immunization spending.","output":"Tracking government spending on immunization: The joint reporting forms, national health accounts, comprehensive multi-year plans and co-financing data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, South Africa implemented strict nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain the spread of COVID-19. Over the subsequent 5 months, NPI policies were eased in stages according to a national strategy. COVID-19 spread throughout the country heterogeneously; the disease reached rural areas by July and case numbers peaked from July to August. A second COVID-19 wave began in late 2020. Data on the impact of NPI policies on social and economic well-being and access to health care are limited. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine how rural residents in three South African provinces changed their behaviors during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave. METHODS: The South African Population Research Infrastructure Network nodes in the Mpumalanga (Agincourt), KwaZulu-Natal, (Africa Health Research Institute) and Limpopo (Dikgale-Mamabolo-Mothiba) provinces conducted up to 14 rounds of longitudinal telephone surveys among randomly sampled households from rural and periurban surveillance populations every 2-3 weeks. Interviews included questions on the following topics: COVID-19-related knowledge and behaviors, the health and economic impacts of NPIs, and mental health. We analyzed how responses varied based on NPI stringency and household sociodemographics. RESULTS: In total, 5120 households completed 23,095 interviews between April and December 2020. Respondents' self-reported satisfaction with their COVID-19-related knowledge and face mask use rapidly rose to 85% and 95%, respectively, by August. As selected NPIs were eased, the amount of travel increased, economic losses were reduced, and the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms fell. When the number of COVID-19 cases spiked at one node in July, the amount of travel dropped rapidly and the rate of missed daily medications doubled. Households where more adults received government-funded old-age pensions reported concerns about economic matters and medication access less often. CONCLUSIONS: South Africans complied with stringent, COVID-19-related NPIs despite the threat of substantial social, economic, and health repercussions. Government-supported social welfare programs appeared to buffer interruptions in income and health care access during local outbreaks. Epidemic control policies must be balanced against the broader well-being of people in resource-limited settings and designed with parallel support systems when such policies threaten peoples' income and access to basic services.","output":"Protective Behaviors and Secondary Harms Resulting From Nonpharmaceutical Interventions During the COVID-19 Epidemic in South Africa: Multisite, Prospective Longitudinal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Trs strict, le premier confinement a eu des consquences psychologiques sur tous.

A key to restricting the pandemic is the ability to minimize humanChuman transmission and to predict the infection status of the population in the face of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Success in this area is dependent on the rapid detection of COVID-19 positive individuals with current/previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status. In this regard, the ability to detect antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-Spike protein in patient sera represents a powerful biomarker for confirmation of infection. Here, we report the design of a proof-of-concept cellCbased fluorescent serology assay (termed C19-S-I-IFA) to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Yunnan, a province of China that shares borders with dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue from 6840 cases in 2019 to 260 cases in 2020. Methods: By using a unique epidemiological and genomic dataset from 2013 to 2020 collected in Yunnan, we reconstruct the dynamics of DENV transboundary transmission and investigate the impact of border restriction on dengue expansion. Findings: Dengue transmission in Yunnan was strongly correlated with historical cases in border countries with a 2-3 months lag ( r = 0.58, P <0.01 with Laos;r = 0.55, P <0.01 with Thailand;r = 0.34, P <0.01 with Viet Nam), while the pattern vanished since the beginning of border restriction in 2020. Our analyses revealed multiple independent DENV transboundary introductions from endemic countries to Yunnan all year round, that likely triggered seasonal outbreaks of dengue in the summer when environmental conditions were suitable for mosquito vectors. This work suggests that Yunnan is a sink of DENV transmission and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting hundreds or thousands of cases.

The cellular mechanisms responsible for the generation of DCs that will prime a proinflammatory or tolerogenic response are poorly understood. Here we describe a novel mechanism by which tolerogenic DCs are formed from monocytes. When human monocytes were cultured with CD4+FoxP3+ natural regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper cells (Th) from healthy donor blood, they differentiated into regulatory DCs (DC Reg ), capable of generating induced Tregs from na?ve T cells. DC Reg exhibited morphology, surface phenotype, cytokine secretion, and transcriptome that were distinct from other moDCs including those derived from monocytes cultured with Th or with GM-CSF/IL-4, as well as macrophages (M). Direct cell contact between monocytes, Tregs and Th, along with Treg-derived CTLA-4, IL-10 and TGF-, was required for the phenotypic differentiation of DC Reg , although only IL-10 was required for imprinting the Treg-inducing capacity of DC Reg . High ratios of Treg:Th, along with monocytes and DC Reg similar in function and phenotype to those induced in vitro, were present in situ in human colorectal cancer specimens. Thus, through the combined actions of Tregs and Th, monocytes differentiate into DCs with regulatory properties, forming a positive feedback loop to reinforce Treg initiated immune regulation. This mechanism may contribute to immune tolerance in tissues such as tumors, which contain an abundance of Tregs, Th and monocytes.","output":"Human Regulatory Dendritic Cells Develop From Monocytes in Response to Signals From Regulatory and Helper T Cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Shoulder pain is common in primary care but achieving definitive diagnosis is contentious leading to uncertainty in management.

RESULTS: The most common underlying disease was hypertension (90.3%), followed by systemic lupus erythematosus (32.3%), preeclampsia (25.8%), chronic renal failure (22.6%), and rheumatoid arthritis (22.6%). Interestingly, we also reported heroin abuse as a possible risk factor for PRES (9.7%). The most frequent clinical signs were headaches (54.8%), seizure (54.8%), and blurred vision (35.5%). The most frequent lesions on cranial MRI were in the parieto-occipital area (87.1%), followed by the cerebellum (19.4%) and the frontal lobe (12.9%). Other abnormalities on MRI were less common. In addition, 16.1% of the study population had vasospasm on magnetic resonance arteriography (MRA). Clinical recovery was followed by radiological resolution in all the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical presentation is nonspecific, most patients present with a combination of symptoms, particularly headaches and seizure. MRI is crucial for the diagnosis of PRES, and MRA is useful in that it can identify associated vasospasm. Timely diagnosis and treatment are required to avoid a devastating outcome.","output":"Prevalence and Risk Factors of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome in Isfahan, Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is a common complication of intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase. Cardiac troponin has been found to be associated with poor prognosis and cognitive impairment in acute ischemic stroke. But studies on the relationship between troponin and HT after thrombolysis are scarce. Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed thrombolytic patients from June 2015 to June 2021 in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. Cardiac troponin I were measured on admission and on following days to determine the presence of elevation and dynamic changes. HT within 24-36 h after treatment was identified by cranial computed tomography (CT). Besides, a score on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) > 2 at discharge was defined as unfavorable outcome. Univariate analysis was used to explore the factors related to the troponin elevation on admission and troponin dynamic changes. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to investigated the association between troponin elevation on admission, troponin dynamic changes and HT after thrombolysis, respectively. Results: Troponin levels on admission were measured in 377 patients, and follow-up assay was performed in 292 patients (77.5%). 39 patients (10.3%) had troponin elevation on admission, and 66 patients (22.6%) had troponin dynamic changes comprising rising and falling pattern. The pre-existing heart disease, renal insufficiency and higher stroke severity are related to both troponin elevation on admission and the subsequent troponin dynamic changes. After adjusting the potential confounding factors, logistic regression model showed that patients with troponin elevation on admission had insignificant trend to develop HT (OR 2.23, 95%CI 0.96-5.21, p = 0.063), while patients with troponin dynamic changes had significantly higher risk of HT (OR 2.27, 95%CI 1.06-4.85, p = 0.034). Compared to the troponin elevation, a statistically stronger association was present between rising troponin dynamic changes and unfavorable outcome (OR 2.20, 95%CI 1.05-4.60, p = 0.037). Conclusion: Troponin dynamic changes are associated with HT after thrombolysis. Serial measurements are quite necessary in thrombolytic patients with risk factors associated with troponin dynamic changes (e.g., advanced age, pre-existing heart disease, higher NIHSS score, and troponin elevation on admission).","output":"Troponin Elevation on Admission Along With Dynamic Changes and Their Association With Hemorrhagic Transformation After Thrombolysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new era of stroke treatment may have begun with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) by fully deployed closed-cell self-expanding stents (stent-triever).

DESIGN AND SETTING: This is a cross sectional, retrospective study of adult patients with COVID-19 who were discharged from two different types of hospitals (academic medical center and a community hospital) within one healthcare system between January 1 and April 30, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Patients were identified from the Cedars-Sinai COVID-19 data registry who had a new onset positive test for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 273 cases were identified, which included 230 cases that were discharged alive and 43 patients who expired and were excluded from the study sample. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Functional limitations in COVID-19 patients in acute care hospitals and the predictors for discharge disposition. RESULTS: A total of 230 records were analyzed including demographic, encounter, medical, and functional variables. In a propensity-score matched cohort based on age and comorbidity, 88.2% had functional physical health deficits, 72.5% had functional mental health deficits, and 17.6% experienced sensory deficits. In the matched cohort, individuals discharged to an institution experienced greater physical (62.7% vs. 25.5%, p<.001) and mental health (49.0% vs. 23.5%, p=.006) deficits than patients discharged home. Marital status (OR 3.17, p=.011) and physical function deficits (OR 3.63, p=0.025) were associated with an increase odds ratio of discharge to an institution. CONCLUSIONS: This research highlights that functional status is a strong predictor for discharge destination to an institution for COVID-19 patients. Patients who were older, in the acute care hospital longer, and with comorbidities were more likely to be discharged to an institution. Rehabilitation is a significant aspect of the healthcare system for these vulnerable patients. The challenges of adjusting the role of rehabilitation providers and systems during the pandemic needs further exploration. Moreover, additional research is needed to look more closely at the many facets and timing of functional status needs, to shed light in utilization of interdisciplinary rehabilitation services, and to guide providers and healthcare systems in facilitating optimal recovery and patient outcomes.","output":"Identification of Functional Limitations and Discharge Destination in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disease is one of the main threats to the remaining great ape populations of the world.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate how COVID-19 has affected AAHKS industry partners and the surgeon-industry relationship, emphasizing education, resource allocation, and strategic direction for the 2nd half of 2020. METHODS: AAHKS industry partners were contacted to participate in a blinded survey and optional interview with the AAHKS Industry Relations Committee. Based on the results, a group of AAHKS member surgeons with disparate practice types were asked to postulate on how the COVID-19 pandemic has and will affect their practice and relationship with Industry. RESULTS: AAHKS industry partner responses indicated decreased resource allocation for regional, other national, and AAHKS annual meetings (67%, 55%, and 30%, respectively). Web-based educational content was expected to increase in 2020 and will likely remain a point of emphasis in 2021 (100% and 70% of responders). For Q3/Q4 2020, a significant emphasis was placed on site of service/outpatient TJA and COVID-19-related safety measures (70% and 90% of responders), as well as increased availability of instrumentation and implants (40% and 60%, respectively). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the orthopedic landscape for the foreseeable future. Survey responses by AAHKS industry partners demonstrate a continued commitment to surgeon education with and increasing shift to a web-based platform.

The objective of this study was to investigate the performance of multi-trait models in genomic prediction in a limited number of environments with G  E interactions. RESULTS: In total, 2,688 and 1,384 individuals with growth and reproduction phenotypes, respectively, from two Yorkshire pig populations with similar genetic backgrounds were genotyped with the PorcineSNP80 panel. Single- and multi-trait models with genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) and BayesC  were implemented to investigate their genomic prediction abilities with 20 replicates of five-fold cross-validation. Our results regarding between-environment genetic correlations of growth and reproductive traits (ranging from 0.618 to 0.723) indicated the existence of G  E interactions between these two Yorkshire pig populations. For single-trait models, genomic prediction with GBLUP was only 1.1% more accurate on average in the combined population than in single populations, and no significant improvements were obtained by BayesC  for most traits. In addition, single-trait models with either GBLUP or BayesC  produced greater bias for the combined population than for single populations. However, multi-trait models with GBLUP and BayesC  better accommodated G  E interactions, yielding 2.2% C 3.8% and 1.0% C 2.5% higher prediction accuracies for growth and reproductive traits, respectively, compared to those for single-trait models of single populations and the combined population. The multi-trait models also yielded lower bias and larger gains in the case of a small reference population. The smaller improvement in prediction accuracy and larger bias obtained by the single-trait models in the combined population was mainly due to the low consistency of linkage disequilibrium between the two populations, which also caused the BayesC  method to always produce the largest standard error in marker effect estimation for the combined population. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our findings confirmed that directly combining populations to enlarge the reference population is not efficient in improving the accuracy of genomic prediction in the presence of G  E interactions, while multi-trait models perform better in a limited number of environments with G  E interactions.","output":"The superiority of multi-trait models with genotype-by-environment interactions in a limited number of environments for genomic prediction in pigs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses are linked to a multitude of human illnesses and can disseminate widely in urbanized environments causing global adverse impacts on communities and healthcare infrastructures. Wastewater-based epidemiology was employed using metagenomics and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays to identify enteric and non-enteric viruses collected from a large urban area for potential public health monitoring and outbreak analysis. Untreated wastewater samples were collected from November 2017 to February 2018 (n = 54) to evaluate the diversity of human viral pathogens in collected samples. Viruses were classified into virus types based on primary transmission routes and reviewed against viral associated diseases reported in the catchment area. Metagenomics detected the presence of viral pathogens that cause clinically significant diseases reported within the study area during the sampling year. Detected viruses belong to the Adenoviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Hepeviridae, Herpesviridae, Matonaviridae, Papillomaviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, Poxviridae, Retroviridae, and Togaviridae families. Furthermore, concentrations of adenovirus, norovirus GII, sapovirus, hepatitis A virus, human herpesvirus 6, and human herpesvirus 8 were measured in wastewater samples and compared to metagenomic findings to confirm detected viral genus. Hepatitis A virus obtained the greatest average viral load (1.86  107 genome copies/L) in wastewater samples compared to other viruses quantified using qPCR with a 100% detection rate in metagenomic samples. Average concentration of sapovirus (1.36  106 genome copies/L) was significantly greater than norovirus GII (2.94  104 genome copies/L) indicating a higher burden within the study area.

Objective. To study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on preliminary mortality rates in the constituent regions of the Russian Federation. Material and methods. The data of Rosstat were used available on 02.02.21. Unstandardized all-cause mortality rates were compared with the averages for similar periods for 20172019. for the constituent entities of the Russian Federation. The difference is defined as a percentage of the previous period. The comparison of mortality rates was carried out for the year, as well as from April to December, since it was from April 2020 that Rosstat began to publish data for the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, taking into account the indication in the MSS of the presence of COVID-19 in four groups. Results. The absolute value of excess deaths was 306,862 cases (or +17% in relation to the average value for 20172019). The Republic of Dagestan (+29.7%) and the Chechen Republic (+42.3%) significantly differed from other regions in terms of excess mortality.

METHODS Data were collected from patients with self-reported PsA diagnoses using an online survey. Results from questions on perceptions of overall health, disease severity, PsA symptoms, PsA impacts, and treatment satisfaction/preferences were reported using descriptive statistics and Chi-square tests. RESULTS A total of 456 patients from North America (Canada, n = 155; US, n = 301) and 417 patients from Europe (France, n = 123; Spain, n = 135; UK, n = 159) were included in this analysis. Patients in North America were more likely to rate their overall health as excellent/good compared with those in Europe (49 vs. 14%), but also rate their disease as severe (27 vs. 15%). Despite treatment, patients in North America and Europe still experienced musculoskeletal (92 vs. 91%) and skin/nail (62 vs. 58%) symptoms. Similar proportions of patients in North America vs. Europe experienced a social impact (81 vs. 85%); more patients in Europe vs. North America experienced PsA-related work impacts (83 vs. 74%). Satisfaction with PsA medication was more common in North America (89%) vs. Europe (79%), and more common in Spain (91%) vs. the UK (82%) or France (66%). Across all regions and countries,  75% of patients agreed that symptoms were controlled. However,  66% wished they had more medication choices, and  84% wanted to change something about their medication. CONCLUSIONS Although perception of overall health and disease severity varied, many patients from both regions still experienced symptoms despite receiving medications for PsA, wished they had greater choice of medications, and/or would like to change an aspect of their medications. While these survey findings are subject to selection bias, they do indicate there is scope to improve the treatment of PsA.","output":"Patient Perception of Medical Care for Psoriatic Arthritis in North America and Europe: Results from a Global Patient Survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Few studies have reported on the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) during the Covid-19 pandemic.

We estimate the associated change in the aerosol radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere and the surface. To that end, we perform new simulations with the CMIP6 global climate model EC-Earth3. The simulations use the here newly created data for the anthropogenic aerosol optical properties and an associated effect on clouds from the simple plumes parameterization (MACv2-SP), based on revised SO(2) and NH(3) emission scenarios. Our results highlight the small impact of the pandemic on the global aerosol radiative forcing in 2020 compared to the CMIP6 scenario SSP2-4.5 of the order of +0.04 Wm(?2), which is small compared to the natural year-to-year variability in the radiation budget. Natural variability also limits the ability to detect a meaningful regional difference in the anthropogenic aerosol radiative effects. We identify the best chances to find a significant change in radiation at the surface during cloud-free conditions for regions that were strongly polluted in the past years. The post-pandemic recovery scenarios indicate a spread in the aerosol forcing of ?0.68 to ?0.38 Wm(?2) for 2050 relative to the pre-industrial, which translates to a difference of +0.05 to ?0.25 Wm(?2) compared to the 2050 baseline from SSP2-4.5. This spread falls within the present-day uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing and the CMIP6 spread in aerosol forcing at the end of the 21st century. We release the new MACv2-SP data for studies on the climate response to the pandemic and the recovery scenarios. Our 2050 forcing estimates suggest that sustained aerosol emission reductions during the post-pandemic recovery cause a stronger climate response than in 2020, i.e., there is a delayed influence of the pandemic on climate.","output":"Radiative effects of reduced aerosol emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic and the future recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic situation, measures to mitigate the risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in an indoor setting are urgently needed.

Unlike previous studies, which have relied primarily on qualitative analyses, the aim of this investigation is to quantitatively explore if that prevailing international research agenda influences research in semi-peripheral countries and to which extent. Methods We used the Web of Science database and the CorText platform to proxy the HBMS research agenda of a prestigious research institution from Latin America: Argentina's National Research Council (CONICET). We conducted a bibliometric and lexical analysis of 16,309 HBMS scientific articles whereby CONICET was among the author's affiliations. The content of CONICET's agenda was depicted through co-occurrence network maps of the most prevalent multi-terms found in titles, keywords and abstracts. We compared our findings with previous reports on the international HBMS research agenda. Results In line with the results previously reported for the prevailing international agenda, we found that multi-terms linked to molecular biology and cancer research hegemonize CONICET's HBMS research agenda, whereas multi-terms connecting HBMS research with socio-environmental cues are marginal. However, we also found differences with the international agenda: CONICET's HBMS agenda shows a marginal presence of multi-terms linked to translational medicine, while multi-terms associated with categories such as pathogens, plant research, agrobiotechnology, and food industry are more represented than in the prevailing agenda. Conclusions In line with the academic dependency theory, CONICETs HBMS research agenda shares topics, priorities, and methodologies with the prevailing HBMS international research agenda. However, CONICET's HBMS research agenda is internally heterogeneous, appearing to be mostly driven by a combination of elements that not only reflect academic dependency but also economic dependency.","output":"Academic dependency: the influence of the prevailing international biomedical research agenda on Argentinas CONICET"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper is an investigation of nostalgia in its diverse manifestations in social media, mainly Facebook, during COVID-19 crisis in Bulgaria and is based on pre-observation which shows that communication through social media at that period was largely nostalgic. The study considers nostalgia as a strategy for dealing with the 2020 state of emergency during which the lack of physical contact and social experiences can create preconditions for anxiety, depression and fear leading to traumatic consequences. The research is based on empirical material actively collected using the method of the included observation in the period from the 15th of March 2020, when the state of emergency in connection with COVID-19 was declared in Bulgaria, until the 30th of June 2020.

Applying interdisciplinary and multimodal approach the study describes the nostalgic manifestations by classifying thematically the initiatives, communication strategies and topics, oriented towards the past, as well as revealing their meaning for the society. The results show that the main role of nostalgic Facebook modes is to unite people in times of isolation, to raise their spirit and thus save them from the traumas that the COVID-19 crisis can cause. The multimodal analysis of the Facebook images from the empirical data confirms that social media and modern technologies make it possible to create \`new products\` based on old stories or memories that acquire a new meaning in the specific COVID-19 situation, modelled by the culture and mentality of Bulgarians in isolation. ?

Results Molecular modeling and simulations reveal that N501Y, shared by both variants, increases ACE2 binding affinity, and may impact the collective dynamics of the ACE2-RBD complex, occupying a central hinge site that modulates the overall dynamics of the complex. In contrast, the substitutions K417N and E484K in the South African variant 501.V2 would reduce the ACE2-binding affinity by abolishing two interfacial salt bridges that facilitate RBD binding to ACE2, K417(S)-D30(ACE2) and E484 (S)-K31(ACE2). These two mutations may thus be more than compensating the attractive effect induced by N501Y, overall resulting in an ACE2-binding affinity comparable to that of the wildtype RBD. Further analysis of the impact of these mutations on the interactions with mAbs targeting the spike indicate that the substitutions K417N and E484K may also abolish the salt bridges between the spike and selected mAbs, such as REGN10933, BD23, H11_H4, and C105, thus reducing the binding affinity and effectiveness of these mAbs.

Here, we evaluated the role of climate (temperature and precipitation), region-specific COVID-19 susceptibility (BCG vaccination factors, malaria incidence, and percentage of the population aged over 65 years), and human mobility (relative amounts of international visitors) in shaping the geographical patterns of COVID-19 case numbers across 1,020 countries/regions, and examined the sequential shift that occurred from December 2019 to June 30, 2020 in multiple drivers of the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases. Our regression model adequately explains the cumulative COVID-19 case numbers (per 1 million population). As the COVID-19 spread progressed, the explanatory power (R2) of the model increased, reaching > 70% in April 2020. Climate, host mobility, and host susceptibility to COVID-19 largely explained the variance among COVID-19 case numbers across locations; the relative importance of host mobility and that of host susceptibility to COVID-19 were both greater than that of climate. Notably, the relative importance of these factors changed over time; the number of days from outbreak onset drove COVID-19 spread in the early stage, then human mobility accelerated the pandemic, and lastly climate (temperature) propelled the phase following disease expansion. Our findings demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic is deterministically driven by climate suitability, cross-border human mobility, and region-specific COVID-19 susceptibility. The identification of these multiple drivers of the COVID-19 outbreak trajectory, based on mapping the spread of COVID-19, will contribute to a better understanding of the COVID-19 disease transmission risk and inform long-term preventative measures against this disease.","output":"Multiple drivers of the COVID-19 spread: The roles of climate, international mobility, and region-specific conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As school districts across the United States consider how to safely operate during the 2020-21 academic year, CDC recommends mitigation strategies that schools can adopt to reduce the risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1).

Doing so has reduced the effectiveness of traditional facial recognition technologies, especially in processing human facial emotions. This has rendered the usage of such technology obsolete in managing facial databases, relying on it for security purposes, and so on. It is then necessary to enhance the current generation of facial recognition to adapt to the protective masks. Speaking of the current facial recognition generation, most of its complex iterations heavily rely on deep learning, which is flawed since the existing facial databases are insufficient, making it even more inadequate to bypass facial masks. This is why the present research paper suggests implementing the Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) algorithm using the Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE) to simulate a masked face emotion recognition. This facial database is available free for academic research, was utilized to label the available images displaying various facial emotions under the umbrella of one of the seven basic human facial emotions, allowing for a more advanced facial technology.

The COVID\\\\19 pandemic is threatening the gains made in the fight against both diseases. DISCUSSION: Although crucial guidance has been released on how to maintain TB and HIV services during the pandemic, it is acknowledged that what was considered normal service pre\\\\pandemic needs to improve to ensure that we rebuild person\\\\centred, inclusive and quality healthcare services. The threat that the pandemic may reverse gains in the response to TB and HIV may be turned into an opportunity by pivoting to using proven differentiated service delivery approaches and innovative technologies that can be used to maintain care during the pandemic and accelerate improved service delivery in the long term. Models of care should be convenient, supportive and sufficiently differentiated to avoid burdensome clinic visits for medication pick\\\\ups or directly observed treatments. Additionally, the pandemic has highlighted the chronic and short\\\\sighted lack of investment in health systems and the need to prioritize research and development to close the gaps in TB diagnosis, treatment and prevention, especially for children and people with HIV. Most importantly, TB\\\\affected communities and civil society must be supported to lead the planning, implementation and monitoring of TB and HIV services, especially in the time of COVID\\\\19 where services have been disrupted, and to report on legal, policy and gender\\\\related barriers to access experienced by affected people. This will help to ensure that TB services are held accountable by affected communities for delivering equitable access to quality, affordable and non\\\\discriminatory services during and beyond the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Successfully reaching the related targets of ending TB and AIDS as public health threats by 2030 requires rebuilding of stronger, more inclusive health systems by advancing equitable access to quality TB services, including for people with HIV, both during and after the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the buffering role of personal resilience in two aspects of psychological functioning, mental health and stress, among Slovene adults at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Within five days after Slovenia declared epidemics, 2722 participants (75% female) completed an on-line survey measuring mental health and perceived stress as outcome variables and demographics, health-related variables, and personal resilience as predictor variables. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses demonstrated that women, younger, and less educated participants had higher odds for less favourable psychological functioning during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, poorer health indicators and COVID-19 infection concerns predicted diminished psychological functioning. The crucial factor promoting good psychological functioning during the COVID-19 pandemics was resilience, additionally buffering against detrimental effects of demographic and health-related variables on mental health and perceived stress. While previous research suggests that mental health problems increase during pandemics, one way to prevent these problems and bolster psychological functioning is to build individuals resilience.

The binding kinetics measured using electrophysiology (EP) for M2 S31N channel are very dependent on the length between the adamantane moiety and the first ring of the aryl headgroup realized in 2 and 3 and the girth and length of the adamantane adduct realized in 4 and 5. Study of 1-6 shows that, according to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) calculations, all bind in the M2 S31N channel with the adamantyl group positioned between V27 and G34 and the aryl group projecting out of the channel with the phenyl (or isoxazole in 6) embedded in the V27 cluster. In this outward binding configuration, an elongation of the ligand by only one methylene in rimantadine 2 or using diamantane or triamantane instead of adamantane in 4 and 5, respectively, causes incomplete entry and facilitates exit, abolishing effective block compared to the amantadine derivatives 1 and 6.

SIGNIFICANCE/IMPLICATION: The early adaptations made by anatomy educators to their lab assessments during Covid-19 provide insight into how assessment may be offered in dire circumstances when the physical lab is unavailable, when accommodating students with extenuating circumstances preventing them from attending in-person lab assessments, and for remediation assessments.","output":"Changes in Gross Anatomy Laboratory Assessment During Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To systematically assess Germany's nutrition policies, to benchmark them against international best practices, and to identify priority policy actions to improve population-level nutrition in Germany. DESIGN We applied the Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI), a methodological framework developed by the INFORMAS network. Qualitative content analysis of laws, directives and other documents formed the basis of a multi-staged, structured consultation process. SETTING Germany. PARTICIPANTS The expert consultation process included 55 experts from academia, public administration, and civil society. RESULTS Germany lags behind international best practices in several key policy areas. For 18 policy indicators, the degree of implementation compared to international best practices was rated as very low, for 21 as low, for 8 as intermediate, and for none as high. In particular, indicators on food taxation, regulation of food marketing, and retail and food service sector policies were rated as very low to low. Identified priority actions included the binding implementation of nutrition standards for schools and kindergartens, a reform of the value added tax on foods and beverages, a sugar-sweetened beverage tax and stricter regulation of food marketing directed at children. CONCLUSIONS The results show that Germany makes insufficient use of the potential of evidence-informed health-promoting nutrition policies. Adopting international best practices in key policy areas could help to reduce the burden of nutrition-related chronic disease and related inequalities in nutrition and health in Germany. Implementation of relevant policies requires political leadership, a broad societal dialogue, and evidence-informed advocacy by civil society, including the scientific community.","output":"Nutrition Policies in Germany: A Systematic Assessment with the Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current RNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are limited by instability of both the RNA and the lipid nanoparticle delivery system, requiring storage at -20C or -70C and compromising universally accessible vaccine distribution.

Liquid NLC alone is stable at refrigerated temperatures for  1 year, enabling stockpiling and rapid deployment by point-of-care mixing with any vaccine RNA. Alternatively, NLC complexed with RNA may be readily lyophilized and stored at room temperature for  8 months or refrigerated temperature for  21 months while still retaining the ability to express protein in vivo.

All outcomes were measured at baseline (T = 0) and after intervention (T = 1). Fourteen of the 20 patients (70%) either did not start the program or did not complete the program. Of these patients, seven did not complete or even start the exercise program because of a combination of lack of time and motivational problems. Six patients were not able to continue the program or were unable to do the follow-up measurements because of medical problems. Exercise capacity and muscle strength was higher after the exercise program in the children who completed the training.

We examine how legalisation impacted on demand for online telemedicine outside the jurisdiction. METHODS We analysed anonymised data from 534 people from Ireland seeking online telemedicine abortion prior to legalisation (January-March and October-December 2018) and in the first 3 months following legalisation (January-March 2019). Numbers, characteristics and reasons for seeking the service before and after legalisation were compared. Content analysis of emails from people seeking the service following legalisation explored reasons for seeking care. RESULTS Half as many people contacted Women on Web in the 3 months immediately after legalisation as compared with contacts 12 months prior (103 vs 221). Of these, the proportion receiving the service reduced, from 72% prior to legalisation to 26% after legalisation (p0.001). After legalisation, access related reasons for seeking online telemedicine featured less while reasons relating to privacy, stigma and avoiding protestors featured more. CONCLUSIONS People continued to seek abortion through online telemedicine after legalisation, though the number of contacts reduced by half and the proportion receiving the service decreased considerably. To address access issues, policy measures should promote normalisation of abortion, legislate for safe zones around providers, and consider access in situations of coercive control or abuse including the role of telemedicine in the local model of care.

Even with advances in the management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) such as reperfusion therapies, complication rates are still high. During quarantine, patients presenting mechanical complications after AMI have increased in our institution. METHODS From a retrospective database analysis in our institution between the years 2004 and 2020, we identified 37 cases of VSR after AMI. Four chronic cases were excluded from our analysis. The primary endpoint was to identify baseline characteristics that increased 30-day mortality. RESULTS Among 33 acute cases of VSR, 24 cases were submitted to surgery. The 30-day mortality of the operated patients was 45.8%. From 2004 to 2019 our average number of operations of VSR was 1.9 cases/year with an increase to 4 cases/year in 2020. Diabetes mellitus, age, cardiogenic shock, and use of intra-aortic balloon pump were associated with significantly increased mortality using logistic regression. CONCLUSION We reported an increased number of mechanical complication cases from April to September 2020, compared to our historical records. Despite therapeutic advances, mortality rates remain high. Although the number of cases is small to conclude that the pandemic was responsible for this augmentation, we believe that it is related to the decreased number of patients seeking medical assistance.","output":"Increased number of ventricular septal rupture cases after acute myocardial infarction in 2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract At the beginning of 2020 Covid-19 - a disease caused by a new type of coronavirus - was classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization and affected countries on all continents, leading to the death of hundreds of thousands of people In Brazil, the disease has also spread quickly, requiring measures of social isolation Marked by overcrowding and precarious infrastructure, brazilian prisons have become an issue of concern for national and international organizations that have demanded releasing measures In this context, this article analyzes the National Penitentiary Department's proposal to use containers to shelter prisoners, which is against Resolution 62/2020 of the National Council of Justice, that pointed to the reduction of the population deprived of liberty It is discussed how the disregard for releasing measures and the demand for even more rights-violating propositions lead to the ratification of a death policy for prisoners pases afectados de todos los continentes clasificaron la Covid-19 - una enfermedad causada por un nuevo tipo de Coronavirus - como una pandemia, lo que provoc la muerte de cientos de miles de personas En Brasil, la enfermedad tambin se ha propagado rpidamente, lo que requiere medidas de aislamiento social Marcadas por el hacinamiento y la precariedad de la infraestructura, las crceles brasile?as se han convertido en un objetivo de preocupacin para los organismos nacionales e internacionales que han exigido medidas de liberacin En este contexto, este artculo analiza la propuesta del Departamento Nacional Penitenciario de utilizar contenedores para albergar a los presos, en contra de la resolucin 62/2020 del Consejo Nacional de Justicia de Brasil, que se gui por la necesidad de reducir la poblacin privada de libertad Se discute cmo el desprecio por las medidas de liberacin y la demanda de propuestas an ms violadoras de derechos apuntan a la ratificacin de una poltica de muerte para los presos tipo de coronavrus - foi classificada como pandemia pela Organizao Mundial de Sade e acometeu pases de todos os continentes, levando a morte de centenas de milhares de pessoas No Brasil, a doen?a tambm se espalhou rapidamente, exigindo medidas de isolamento social Marcadas pela superlotao e infraestrutura precria, as pris?es brasileiras tornaram-se alvo de preocupao de rg?os nacionais e internacionais que demandaram medidas de desencarceramento Nesse contexto, o presente artigo analisa a proposio do Departamento Penitencirio Nacional de utilizao de contineres para abrigamento de pessoas presas, na contram?o da resoluo 62/2020 do Conselho Nacional de Justi?a, que pautou pela necessidade de reduo da populao privada de liberdade Discute-se como a desconsiderao por medidas de desencarceramento e a demanda por proposies ainda mais violadoras de direitos apontam para a ratificao de uma poltica de morte para as pessoas presas","output":"Covid-19 No Sistema Prisional Brasileiro: Da Indiferen?a Como Poltica  Poltica De Morte"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIMS Inflammation is well known to play a pivotal role in renal injury.

METHODS 5/6 nephrectomization (5/6 Nx) was operated on Sprague-Dawley rats. Human kidney tubular epithelial (HK-2) cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The level of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr) was examined. Kidney tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to check the morphology. The cell viability was examined. The levels of cytokines and chemokines were measured by ELISA kit. The protein expression was determined by western blot. RESULTS Rhein significantly decreased SCr and BUN levels in 5/6 Nx rat. The morphologic findings indicated noteworthy amelioration of the damaged renal tissue in Rhein-treated rats. Rhein significantly protects HK-2 cells from LPS-mediated apoptosis. The productions of inflammatory signaling molecules (TNF-, IL-6 and MCP-1) were inhibited by Rhein. LPS-induced NF-B activation was also attenuated by Rhein via blocking its nuclear translocation by inhibiting phosphorylation of IB.

To underpin these assumptions and further improve predictions made by onchocerciasis transmission models, demographic patterns in antibody responses to salivary antigens of Simulium damnosum s.l. are evaluated as a measure of blackfly exposure. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Recently developed IgG and IgM anti-saliva immunoassays for S. damnosum s.l. were applied to blood samples collected from residents in four onchocerciasis endemic villages in Ghana. Demographic patterns in antibody levels according to village, sex and age were explored by fitting generalized linear models. Antibody levels varied between villages but showed consistent patterns with age and sex. Both IgG and IgM responses declined with increasing age. IgG responses were generally lower in males than in females and exhibited a steeper decline in adult males than in adult females. No sex-specific difference was observed in IgM responses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The decline in age-specific antibody patterns suggested development of immunotolerance or desensitization to blackfly saliva antigen in response to persistent exposure. The variation between sexes, and between adults and youngsters may reflect differences in behaviour influencing cumulative exposure. These measures of antibody acquisition and decay could be incorporated into onchocerciasis transmission models towards informing onchocerciasis control, elimination, and surveillance.","output":"Demographic patterns of human antibody levels to Simulium damnosum s.l. saliva in onchocerciasis-endemic areas: An indicator of exposure to vector bites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytokine storm (CS), an excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines upon overactivation of the innate immune system, came recently to the focus of interest because of its role in the life-threatening consequences of certain immune therapies and viral diseases, including CAR-T cell therapy and Covid-19. Because complement activation with subsequent anaphylatoxin release is in the core of innate immune stimulation, studying the relationship between complement activation and cytokine release in an in vitro CS model holds promise to better understand CS and identify new therapies against it. We used peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) cultured in the presence of autologous serum to test the impact of complement activation and inhibition on cytokine release, testing the effects of liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome), zymosan and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as immune activators and heat inactivation of serum, EDTA and mini-factor H (mfH) as complement inhibitors. These activators induced significant rises of complement activation markers C3a, C4a, C5a, Ba, Bb, and sC5b-9 at 45 min of incubation, with or without ~5- to ~2,000-fold rises of IL-1&#945;, IL-1?, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13 and TNF&#945; at 6 and 18 h later. Inhibition of complement activation by the mentioned three methods had differential inhibition, or even stimulation of certain cytokines, among which effects a limited suppressive effect of mfH on IL-6 secretion and significant stimulation of IL-10 implies anti-CS and anti-inflammatory impacts.

Additionally, any natural or man-made disaster further disrupts the chain and leads to high food loss, high supply chain costs, reduced food availability and poor food quality.

The main contribution is discovering the influence zone of COVID-19 treatment hospitals and the main spatial factors around them that increase the prevalence of COVID-19. The innovation of this paper is to find the most relevant spatial factors regarding the distance from central hospitals modeling the risk level of the study area. Therefore, eight hospitals with two service areas for each of them are computed with [0C500] and [500C1000] meters distance. Besides, five spatial factors have been considered, consist of the location of patients financial transactions, the distance of streets from hospitals, the distance of highways from hospitals, the distance of the non-residential land use from the hospitals, and the hospital patient number. The implementation results revealed a meaningful relation between the distance from the hospitals and patient density.

OBJECTIVES We estimate the effect of the pandemic on utilization of outpatient services. RESEARCH DESIGN Using 2010-2020 data from a national dataset, the Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network, we estimate the difference in outpatient care utilization during the time period of the COVID-19 pandemic versus the same weeks in prior years. RESULTS Our findings indicate that the pandemic started to reduce visits during the week of March 15-21. The effect on visits grew until reaching a peak during the week of April 5-11, 2020, when the pandemic reduced the total number of outpatient visits per provider by 70% relative to the same week in prior years. We find negative effects of the pandemic on visits for non-flu symptoms as well as on visits for flu symptoms, but the magnitudes of these latter effects tended to be larger in magnitude. The pandemic's impact declined over time, and by the week of June 28 to July 4, 2020, there was no longer any difference in total visits per provider relative to the same week in prior years.

METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study among 22 women infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy, from a tertiary hospital during the first wave of the pandemic in Brazil (MayCAugust 2020). We applied semi-directed interviews, sociodemographic and health data sheets, and field diaries. We built the sample purposefully. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.

They described a fear of serious symptoms or death, concerns about the fetus, sorrow from being isolated, and worries about stigma. Family relationships were ambiguous, generating either support or tension. The attachment to the health team through telemedicine or support during hospitalization produced a feeling of security.

Communities harder hit by the virus, or at risk of being so, stand to benefit from greater resource allocation than their population size alone would suggest. This study reports a simple but efficacious method of ranking small areas of England by relative characteristics that are linked with COVID-19 vulnerability and vaccine hesitancy. METHODS: Publicly available data on a range of characteristics previously linked with either poor COVID-19 outcomes or vaccine hesitancy were collated for all Middle Super Output Areas of England (MSOA, n=6790, excluding Isles of Scilly), scaled and combined into two numeric indices. Multivariable linear regression was used to build a parsimonious model of vulnerability (static socio-ecological vulnerability index, SEVI) in 60% of MSOAs, and retained variables were used to construct two simple indices. Assuming a monotonic relationship between indices and outcomes, Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between the SEVI and cumulative COVID-19 case rates at MSOA level in the remaining 40% of MSOAs over periods both during and out with national lockdowns. Similarly, a novel vaccine hesitancy index (VHI) was constructed using population characteristics aligned with factors identified by an Office for National Statistics (ONS) survey analysis. The relationship between the VHI and vaccine coverage in people aged 12+years (as of 2021-06-24) was determined using Spearman correlation. The indices were split into quintiles, and MSOAs within the highest vulnerability and vaccine hesitancy quintiles were mapped. FINDINGS: The SEVI showed a moderate to strong relationship with case rates in the validation dataset across the whole study period, and for every intervening period studied except early in the pandemic when testing was highly selective. The SEVI was more strongly correlated with case rates than any of its domains (r(s) 059 95% CI 0.57-0.62) and outperformed an existing MSOA-level vulnerability index. The VHI was significantly negatively correlated with COVID-19 vaccine coverage in the validation data at the time of writing (r(s) -043 95% CI -046 to -041).

We identified the need to seek feedback from patients relating to their perceptions on care received at a virtual clinic compared to a face-to-face clinics. METHOD: Patients who attended a virtual clinic in General Surgery were selected at random from a database of 627 patients. They were called and asked to complete a google survey which was sent via email. A shorter survey was also conducted over the phone for patients who did not have an email address. RESULTS: 79.6% (n = 43) of patients felt their care did not suffer because of non-face-to-face contact. 63% (n = 34) reported that their symptoms were fully assessed during the virtual clinic. 77.8% (n = 42) did not feel rushed by the virtual clinic, 92.6% (n = 50) answered that they had the opportunity to ask questions. 68.5% (n = 35) answered their care did not suffer by not being examined. 72.2% (n = 39) felt that the outcome of the clinic was not changed because of non face-to-face contact.

Search history related to COVID-19, coronavirus and the most common symptoms of disease was retrieved from Google Trends during the same period. Statistical analysis was performed to analyze the correlation between the two data sets. Search terms were adjusted for time-lag over weeks, to find the highest cross-correlation for each of the search terms. RESULTS: Search terms of 'fever' and 'cough' were the most commonly searched online, followed by coronavirus and COVID. The highest peak correlations with the weekly case series, with a 1-week backlog, was noted for loss of smell and loss of taste. The combined model yielded a modest performance for forecasting positive cases. The linear regression model revealed loss of smell (adjusted R(2) of 0.7) with significant 1-week, 2-week and 3-week lagged time series, as the best predictor of weekly positive case counts.

In the pandemic situation of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-COV-2 virus, an in silico effort to evaluate the potentiality of the seselin was made to test its efficacy against multiple targets of SARS-COV-2 such as spike protein S2, COVID-19 main protease and free enzyme of the SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) main protease. The ligand seselin showed the best interaction with receptors, spike protein S2, COVID-19 main protease and free enzyme of the SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) main protease with a binding energy of -6.3 kcal/mol, -6.9 kcal/mol and -6.7 kcal/mol, respectively. Docking analysis with three different receptors identified that all the computationally predicted lowest energy complexes were stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions. The amino acid residues involved in interactions were ASP1184, GLU1182, ARG1185 and SER943 for spike protein, SER1003, ALA958 and THR961 for COVID-19 main protease, and for SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) main protease, it was THR111, GLN110 and THR292. The MD simulation and MM/PBSA analysis showed that the compound seselin could effectively bind with the target receptors.

We sought to investigate whether carotid stiffness, carotid intima-media thickness and the aortic augmentation index are altered in young adults 3-4 weeks after contraction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) compared with young healthy adults. What is the main finding and its importance? We found that carotid stiffness, Young's modulus and the aortic augmentation index were greater in young adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with healthy young adults. These findings provide additional evidence for detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 on young adult vasculature, which might have implications for cardiovascular health. ABSTRACT: Contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been observed to cause decrements in vascular function of young adults. However, less is known about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on arterial stiffness and structure, which might have additional implications for cardiovascular health. The purpose of this study was to assess the carotid artery stiffness and structure using ultrasound and the aortic augmentation index (AIx) using applanation tonometry in young adults after they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that carotid artery stiffness, carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and aortic AIx would be elevated in young adults with SARS-CoV-2 compared with healthy young adults. We evaluated 15 young adults (six male and nine female; 20  1 years of age; body mass index, 24  3 kg m-2 ) 3-4 weeks after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result compared with young healthy adults (five male and 10 female; 23  1 years of age; body mass index, 22  2 kg m-2 ) who were evaluated before the coronavirus 2019 pandemic. Carotid stiffness, Young's modulus and cIMT were assessed using ultrasound, whereas aortic AIx and aortic AIx standardized to 75 beats min-1 (AIx@HR75) were assessed from carotid pulse wave analysis using SphygmoCor. Group differences were observed for carotid stiffness (control, 5  1 m s-1 ; SARS-CoV-2, 6  1 m s-1 ), Young's modulus (control, 396  120 kPa; SARS-CoV-2, 576  224 kPa), aortic AIx (control, 3  13%; SARS-CoV-2, 13  9%) and aortic AIx@HR75 (control, -3  16%; SARS-CoV-2, 10  7%; P < 0.05). However, cIMT was similar between groups (control, 0.42  0.06 mm; SARS-CoV-2, 0.44  0.08 mm; P > 0.05). This cross-sectional analysis revealed higher carotid artery stiffness and aortic stiffness among young adults with SARS-CoV-2. These results provide further evidence of cardiovascular impairments among young adults recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, which should be considered for cardiovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Carotid stiffness, intima-media thickness and aortic augmentation index among adults with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the upsurge of drug-resistant tuberculosis worldwide, there is much focus on developing novel drug combinations allowing shorter treatment duration and a lower toxicity profile. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis targeting is acknowledged as a promising strategy to combat drug-susceptible, drug-resistant, and latent tuberculosis (TB) infections. In this review, we describe the potential synergy of NAD biosynthesis inhibitors with several TB-drugs in prospective novel combination therapy. Despite not directly targeting the essential NAD cofactors biosynthesis, several TB prodrugs either require a NAD biosynthesis enzyme to be activated or form a toxic chemical adduct with NAD(H) itself. For example, pyrazinamide requires the action of nicotinamidase (PncA), often referred to as pyrazinamidase, to be converted into its active form. PncA is an essential player in NAD salvage and recycling. Since most pyrazinamide-resistant strains are PncA-defective, a combination with downstream NAD-blocking molecules may enhance pyrazinamide activity and possibly overcome the resistance mechanism. Isoniazid, ethionamide, and delamanid form NAD adducts in their active form, partly perturbing the redox cofactor metabolism. Indeed, NAD depletion has been observed in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) during isoniazid treatment, and activation of the intracellular NAD phosphorylase MbcT toxin potentiates its effect. Due to the NAD cofactors crucial role in cellular energy production, additional synergistic correlations of NAD biosynthesis blockade can be envisioned with bedaquiline and other drugs targeting energy-metabolism in mycobacteria. In conclusion, future strategies targeting NAD metabolism in Mtb should consider its potential synergy with current and other forthcoming TB-drugs.","output":"The Prospective Synergy of Antitubercular Drugs With NAD Biosynthesis Inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic changed the life of many.

The computer results obtained by programming voltage pulses were compared with current pulses. RESULTS The differences between voltage and current pulses were noticeable: using current instead of voltage allows larger coagulation zones to be created, due to the higher energy applied by current pulses. If voltage pulses are employed the model can accurately predict the number of roll-offs, although the waveform of the applied power is clearly not realistic. If current voltages are employed, the applied power waveform matches well with those reported experimentally, but there are significantly fewer roll-offs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this case-control study, 195 COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups, with the mediastinal lymphadenopathy and without it. In these groups, demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, laboratory results, and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: The median age in the LAP group was higher than the opposite group (62 vs. 58.5; p= 0.037).

The results showed that workers had very high levels of satisfaction. Social pressure from work, contact with death and suffering, and emotional exhaustion were negatively associated with satisfaction. Moreover, under conditions of extensive contact with suffering people and great fear of contagion, social support at work was shown to promote professional satisfaction. In conclusion, nursing home workers in Spain experienced high rates of satisfaction during the COVID\\\\19 crisis despite the high job demands, lack of job resources, fear of contagion and exhaustion. The main practical implication of this study is the importance of ensuring optimal working conditions in the nursing home sector in order to guarantee professional satisfaction, prevent burnout, reduce turnover and promote post\\\\crisis resilience.","output":"Satisfied as professionals, but also exhausted and worried!!: The role of job demands, resources and emotional experiences of Spanish nursing home workers during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms on the diagnosis of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). First, data visualization is provided on increases in confirmed deaths and recovered cases of COVID-19 using currently available data from Johns Hopkins University. Next, the machine learning algorithms are used for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. Data-driven diagnosis is performed using a dataset of 5644 samples with 111 attributes provided by Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Brazil. As a preprocessing step, null values and categorical data are processed and standardization is performed. Next, feature selection is performed to find attributes that are most important for a COVID-19 diagnosis. A number of algorithms including random forest logistic regression, XGBoost, and decision tree are considered and their kernel parameters are optimized. The performance of classification algorithms is evaluated in terms of a number of factors including the testing accuracy, precision, recall, miss rate, receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Experimental results show that serum glucose is the most influential attribute in predicting COVID-19. Our results also show that for the case of cross-validation, XGBoost has the highest accuracy value of 92.67% and logistic regressions have the second highest accuracy of 92.58%, whereas both XGBoost and LR have a 93% value for precision, recall, and F1 score. Moreover, for the case of the holdout method with 20% testing data, logistic regression with an accuracy of 94.06% outperforms other classifiers in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.","output":"Application of machine learning for the diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the first part of this article, we present an analysis of the concept of violent behaviour in various social contexts and in the international sociological literature.

The assessment was also forward-looking, asking what aspects of rights-based family planning still need attention moving from 2020 to 2030. METHODS: This paper draws on interviews with 23 key informants from governments, civil society, and youth focused organizations, implementing partners, and bi-lateral and multilateral organizations from Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Europe and North America, all working on family planning and engaged in various roles with the FP2020 partnership at global and national levels, along with documentation of FP2030 partnership plans. The interviews were conducted as part of the assessment and included questions to respondents for their recommendations on rights-based family planning moving towards 2030. RESULTS: Respondents agreed that rights should be at the center of the vision for family planning, with attention to rights literacy, accountability and equity, including adolescent and youth leadership. They noted the need for consistent political and financial support, and incorporating rights into result-based financing programming. While respondents noted the need for development and dissemination of practical tools and training materials, along with rights metrics and implementation research, they stressed the importance of focusing work on rights at the country level. Respondents also acknowledged that institutionalizing rights-based family planning will require enhanced commitment and funding from both donors and countries to ensure programming C and success C over the long term. Amplifying civil society and particularly adolescent and youth voices will be key to engaging governments to support both rights-based programming and provide funding. Review of initial planning under FP2030 related to each of the recommendations suggests that the new partnership is seeking to addressing each of them. DISCUSSION: As the family planning field looks beyond 2020 to 2030, this paper provides a roadmap for building on the gains made over the past decade to effectively tackle the challenges remaining to ensure that programming to achieve the vision of the FP2030 Partnership is rights-based.","output":"Advancing Rights-Based Family Planning from 2020 to 2030"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, is spreading rapidly across the globe, with little proven effective therapy. Fever is seen in most cases of COVID-19, at least at the initial stages of illness. Although fever is typically treated (with antipyretics or directly with ice or other mechanical means), increasing data suggest that fever is a protective adaptive response that facilitates recovery from infectious illness. OBJECTIVE: To describe a randomized controlled pilot study of core warming patients with COVID-19 undergoing mechanical ventilation. METHODS: This prospective single-site randomized controlled pilot study will enroll 20 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to standard-of-care or to receive core warming via an esophageal heat exchanger commonly utilized in critical care and surgical patients. The primary outcome is patient viral load measured by lower respiratory tract sample. Secondary outcomes include severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (as measured by PaO2/FiO2 ratio) 24, 48, and 72 hours after initiation of treatment, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Resulting data will provide effect size estimates to guide a definitive multi-center randomized clinical trial. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT04426344. CONCLUSIONS: With growing data to support clinical benefits of elevated temperature in infectious illness, this study will provide data to guide further understanding of the role of active temperature management in COVID-19 treatment and provide effect size estimates to power larger studies.","output":"Core warming of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients undergoing mechanical ventilation-A protocol for a randomized controlled pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) E406W mutation abrogates neutralization mediated by the REGEN-CoV therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) COVID-19 cocktail and the cilgavimab (AZD1061) mAb.

It is difficult to measure how the pandemic has affected the sentiment of the people, not to mention how people responded to the dramatic events that took place during the pandemic. This study contributes to this discussion by showing that the negative perception of the people of the COVID-19 pandemic is dropping. By negative perception, we mean the number of negative words the users of Twitter, a social media platform, employ in their online posts. Seen as aggregate, Twitter users are using less and less negative words as the pandemic evolves. The conclusion that the negative perception is dropping comes from a careful analysis we made in the contents of the COVID-19 Twitter chatter dataset, a comprehensive database accounting for more than 1 billion posts generated during the pandemic. We explore why the negativity of the people decreases, making connections with psychological traits such as psychophysical numbing, reappraisal, suppression, and resilience. In particular, we show that the negative perception decreased intensively when the vaccination campaign started in the USA, Canada, and the UK and has remained to decrease steadily since then. This finding led us to conclude that vaccination plays a key role in dropping the negativity of the people, thus promoting their psychological wellbeing.","output":"Negative Perception of the COVID-19 Pandemic Is Dropping: Evidence From Twitter Posts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?2-microglobulin (?2-m), a 11.8 kDa protein, pairs non-covalently with the &#945;3 domain of the major histocompatibility class (MHC) I &#945;-chain and is essential for the conformation of the MHC class I protein complex.

Serum ?2-m levels were measured in a cohort of 34 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 on admission to a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as well as in an approximately age-sex matched group of 34 uninfected controls. Mean ?2-m level was 3.251.68 mg/l (reference range 0.8-2.2 mg/l) in patients (mean age 48.221.6) and 1.980.61 mg/l in controls (mean age 48.221.6). 17 patients (mean age 36.9 18.0) with mean ?2-m levels of 2.270.64 mg/l had mild disease by WHO severity categorization, 12 patients (mean age 53.318.1) with mean ?2-m levels of 3.571.39 mg/l had moderate disease, and five patients (of whom 2 died; mean age 74.413.8) with mean ?2-m levels of 5.851.85 mg/l had severe disease (P < = 0.001, by ANOVA test for linear trend).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to use an internet-based mental health measurement platform to compare the mental health profile of community members during COVID-19 with community members assessed before the pandemic. METHODS: This study uses an internet-based self-assessment tool to collect data on psychological distress, mental well-being, and resilience in community cohorts during (n=673) and prior to the pandemic (two cohorts, n=1264 and n=340). RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate significantly worse outcomes on all mental health measures for participants measured during COVID-19 compared to those measured before (P<.001 for all outcomes, effect sizes ranging between Cohen d=0.32 to Cohen d=0.81.

These include their utility for the diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, past infection or exposure, correlation with immunity and the effective duration of immunity. This study examined the performance of three laboratory based serological assays, EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA/IgG, MAGLUMI 2000 Plus 2019-nCov IgM/IgG and EDI Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG immunoassays. We evaluated 138 samples from a reference non-infected population and 71 samples from a cohort of 37 patients with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed positive by RT-PCR. The samples were collected at various intervals of 0C45 days posts symptoms onset (PSO). Specificity and sensitivity of these assays was 60.9%/71.4% (IgA) and 94.2%/63.3% (IgG) for EUROIMMUN; 98.5%/18.4% (IgM) and 97.8%/53.1% (IgG) for MAGLUMI; and 94.9%/22.5% (IgM) and 93.5%/57.1% (IgG) for EDI, respectively. When samples collected 14 days PSO were considered, the sensitivities were 100.0 and 100.0%; 31.0 and 82.8%; 34.5 and 57.1%, respectively. Using estimated population prevalence of 0.1, 1, and 10%, the positive predictive value of all assays remained low. The EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA lacked specificity for acute diagnosis and all IgM assays offered poor diagnostic utility. Seroconversion can be delayed although all patients had seroconverted at 28 days in our cohort with the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG.

Design: Logistic regression model development and validation study using a cohort of unplanned emergency medical admissions to hospital. Setting: York Hospital (YH) as model development dataset and Scarborough Hospital (SH) as model validation dataset. Participants: Unplanned adult medical admissions discharged over three months (11 March 2020 to 13 June 2020) from two hospitals (YH for model development; SH for external model validation) based on admission NEWS2 electronically recorded within 24 hours and or blood test results within 96 hours of admission. We used logistic regression modelling to predict the risk of in-hospital mortality using two models: 1) CARMc19_N: age + sex + NEWS2 including subcomponents + COVID19; 2) CARMc19_NB: CARMc19_N in conjunction with seven blood test results and acute kidney injury score. Model performance was evaluated according to discrimination (c-statistic), calibration (graphically), and clinical usefulness at NEWS2 thresholds of 4+, 5+, 6+. Results: The risk of in-hospital mortality following emergency medical admission was similar in development and validation datasets (8.4% vs 8.2%). The c-statistics for predicting mortality for Model CARMc19_NB is better than CARMc19_N in the validation dataset (CARMc19_NB = 0.88 (95%CI 0.86 to 0.90) vs CARMc19_N = 0.86 (95%CI 0.83 to 0.88)).

At all NEWS2 thresholds (4+, 5+, 6+) model CARMc19_NB had better sensitivity and similar specificity. Conclusions: We have developed a validated CARMc19 score with good performance characteristics for predicting the risk of in-hospital mortality following an emergency medical admission using the patients first, electronically recorded vital signs and blood tests results. Since the CARMc19 scores place no additional data collection burden on clinicians and is readily automated, it may now be carefully introduced and evaluated in hospitals with sufficient informatics infrastructure.","output":"Development and validation of automated computer aided-risk score for predicting the risk of in-hospital mortality using first electronically recorded blood test results and vital signs for COVID-19 hospital admissions: a retrospective development and validation study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To overcome oxidative, inflammatory, and metabolic stress, cells have evolved networks of cytoprotective proteins controlled by nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its main negative regulator the Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1).

METHODS Retrospective data analysis of adult patients who were treated surgically for a pituitary adenoma between August 2005 and May 2015 by a single neurosurgeon, who was originally trained and practiced in the microscopic transsphenoidal approach. Patient demographics, perioperative conditions, tumor characteristics, operative times, volumetric EOR, postoperative outcome, and the endoscopic learning curve were evaluated. RESULTS One hundred and nine patients underwent microscopic transsphenoidal surgery and 275 patients underwent a fully endoscopic approach. The patient characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. Operative room time was significantly shorter in the endoscopic group than in the microscopic group (180.2 vs. 215.6 minutes; P < 0.001).

For the time being, numerous mutations have been reported that led to the generation of numerous variants spread more rapidly. This study aims to establish an efficient multi-epitope subunit vaccine that could elicit both T-cell and B-cell responses sufficient to recognize three confirmed surface proteins of the virus. The sequences of the viral surface proteins, e.g., an envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), and S1 and S2 domain of spike surface glycoprotein (S), were analyzed by an immunoinformatic approach. Top immunogenic epitopes have been selected based on the assessment of the affinity with MHC class-I and MHC class-II, population coverage, along with conservancy among wild type and new variants of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation suggest that the proposed top peptides have the potential to interact with the highest number of both the MHC class I and MHC class II. The epitopes were assembled by the appropriate linkers to form a multi-epitope vaccine. Epitopes used in the vaccine construct are conserved in all the variants evolved till now. This in silico-designed multi-epitope vaccine is highly immunogenic and induces levels of SARS-CoV2-neutralizing antibodies in mice, which is detected by inhibition of cytopathic effect in Vero cell monolayer.

In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Our model incorporates awareness programs and different hospitalization strategies for mild and severe cases, to assess the effect of public awareness on the dynamics of COVID-19 infection. We fit the model to the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria from 29 March to 12 June 2020. We find that the epidemic could increase if awareness programs are not properly adopted. We presumed that the effect of awareness programs could be estimated. Further, our results suggest that the awareness programs and timely hospitalization of active cases are essential tools for effective control and mitigation of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria and beyond.

Herein, we report a case with an acute encephalopathic crisis at the course of COVID-19 disease as the first sign of glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA-1). CASE PRESENTATION: A 9-month-old patient was admitted with encephalopathy and acute loss of acquired motor skills during the course of COVID-19 disease. She had lethargy, hypotonia, and choreoathetoid movements. In terms of COVID-19 encephalopathy, the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay test for COVID-19 was negative in cerebral spinal fluid. Brain imaging showed frontotemporal atrophy, bilateral subcortical and periventricular white matter, basal ganglia, and thalamic involvement. Elevated glutarylcarnitine in plasma and urinary excretion of glutaric and 3-OH-glutaric acids was noted. A homozygote mutation in the glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase gene led to the diagnosis of GA-1.

We also analyzed trends overtime and the influence of patient factors in the in-hospital mortality (IHM) after receiving NIV, IMV or NIV+IMV. METHODS: Observational retrospective epidemiological study. Our data source was the Spanish National Hospital Discharge Database. RESULTS: Over a total of 1,486,240 hospitalized patients with CAP, we identified 56,158 who had received ventilator support in Spain over the study period. Of them, 54.82% received NIV, 37.04% IMV and 8.14% both procedures. The use of NIV and NIV+IMV increased significantly (p<0.001) over time (from 0.91 to 12.84 per 100.000 inhabitant and from 0.23 to 1.19 per 100.000 inhabitants, respectively), while the IMV utilization decreased (from 3.55 to 2.79 per 100,000 inhabitants; p<0.001). Patients receiving NIV were the oldest and had the highest mean value in the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score and readmission rate. Patients who received only IMV had the highest IHM. Factors associated with IHM for all groups analyzed included age, comorbidities and readmission. IHM decreased significantly over time in patients with CAP who received NIV, IMV and NIV+IMV. CONCLUSIONS: We found an increase in NIV use and a decline in IMV utilization in patients hospitalized for CAP over the study period. Patients receiving NIV were the oldest and had the highest CCI score and readmission rate.

SPP is conserved among all kingdoms and is essential for maintaining cell homeostasis. Inhibition of SPP with selective inhibitors and the structurally similar HIV protease inhibitors results in signal peptide accumulation and subsequent cell death. Identification of SPP homologues in major human parasitic infections has opened a new therapeutic opportunity. Moreover, the essentiality of mammalian SPP-mediated viral protein processing during infection is emerging. AREAS COVERED This review introduces the discovery and biological function of human SPP enzymes and identify parasitic homologues as pharmacological targets of both SPP and HIV protease inhibitors. Later, the role of mammalian SPP during viral infection and how disruption of host SPP can be employed as a novel antiviral therapy are examined and discussed. EXPERT OPINION Parasitic and viral infections cause severe health and economic burden, exacerbated by the lack of new therapeutics in the pipeline. SPP has been shown to be essential for malaria parasite growth and encouraging evidence in other parasites demonstrates broad essentiality of these proteases as therapeutic targets. As drug resistant parasite and viruses emerge, SPP inhibition will provide a new generation of compounds to counter the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance.","output":"Signal peptide peptidase: A potential therapeutic target for parasitic and viral infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presented major challenges to the health sector in 2020. The burden of disease arising from COVID-19 can be expressed as the number of years of life lost to disease or death. For example, death at age 40 involves a loss of far more years of life than death at age 80. METHODS The disability-adjusted life years (DALY) lost to COVID-19 were calculated as the sum of the years of life lost through death (YLL) and the number of years lived with disability (YLD), on the basis of laboratory-confirmed notifiable cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Germany in 2020 (documented as of 18 January 2021). The methodology was based on that used in the Global Burden of Disease Study. Pre-existing diseases do not enter into the determination of YLL; rather, the residual life expectancy that is applied in this calculation corresponds to a mean age-specific level of morbidity. RESULTS 305 641 years of life were lost to COVID-19 in Germany in 2020. The percentage of DALY lost by persons under 70 was 34.8% in men and 21.0% in women. 99.3% of the COVID-19 disease burden was accounted for by death (YLL). The daily average years of life lost due to death was lower for COVID-19 than for the major non-communicable diseases. Persons who died of COVID-19 lost a mean of 9.6 years of life; those who were under 70 when they died lost a mean of 25.2 years of life. Men lost more years of life than women (11.0 vs. 8.1 years). CONCLUSION The effects of COVID-19 on public health can be expressed through the burden of disease indicators. This method yields additional information that should be put to use early in the course of future outbreaks.","output":"The COVID-19 Disease Burden in Germany in 2020-Years of Life Lost to Death and Disease Over the Course of the Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW To provide a summary of the neuro-ophthalmic manifestations of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), documented in the literature thus far. RECENT FINDINGS A small but growing literature documents cases of new onset neuro-ophthalmic disease, in the setting of COVID-19 infection. Patients with COVID-19 have experienced acute onset vision loss, optic neuritis, cranial neuropathies, and Miller Fisher syndrome. In addition, COVID-19 increases the risk of cerebrovascular diseases that can impact the visual system. SUMMARY The literature on COVID-19 continues to evolve. Although COVID-19 primarily impacts the respiratory system, there are several reports of new onset neuro-ophthalmic conditions in COVID-infected patients. When patients present with new onset neuro-ophthalmic issues, COVID-19 should be kept on the differential. Testing for COVID-19 should be considered, especially when fever or respiratory symptoms are also present. When screening general patients for COVID-19-associated symptoms, frontline physicians can consider including questions about diplopia, eye pain, pain with extraocular movements, decreased vision, gait issues, and other neurologic symptoms. The presence of these symptoms may increase the overall probability of viral infection, especially when fever or respiratory symptoms are present. More research is needed to establish a causal relationship between COVID-19 and neuro-ophthalmic disease, and better understand pathogenesis.","output":"Neuro-ophthalmic manifestations of coronavirus disease 19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona virus is highly uncertain and complex in space and time.

Older residents with confirmed COVID-19 between March and June 2020 were enrolled. The clinical and biological characteristics, the treatment measures, and the outcomes in residents living in these nursing homes were collected from the medical records. RESULTS: A total of 321 residents were diagnosed with COVID-19 including 12 centenarians. The median age was 101 years in centenarians and 89 years in other residents. The most common symptoms were asthenia and fever. Three centenarians (25%) experienced a worsening of pre-existing depression (vs. 5.5% of younger residents; p = 0.032). Mortality was significantly higher in centenarians than in younger residents (50% vs. 21.3%, respectively; p = 0.031). A quarter of the younger residents and only one centenarian were hospitalized. However, 33.3% of the centenarians received treatment within the context of home hospitalization.

It would be desirable to identify a medication that is already in use for another condition and whose side effect profile and safety data are already known and approved. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different medications on typical COVID-19 symptoms by using data from an online surveillance survey. METHODS: Between early April and late-July 2020, a total of 3654 individuals in Lower Saxony, Germany, participated in an online symptom-tracking survey conducted through the app covid-nein-danke.de. The questionnaire comprised items on typical COVID-19 symptoms, age range, gender, employment in patient-facing healthcare, housing status, postal code, previous illnesses, permanent medication, vaccination status, results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and antibody tests for COVID-19 diagnosis, and consequent COVID-19 treatment if applicable. Odds ratio estimates with corresponding 95% CIs were computed for each medication and symptom by using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Data analysis suggested a statistically significant inverse relationship between typical COVID-19 symptoms self-reported by the participants and self-reported statin therapy and, to a lesser extent, antihypertensive therapy. When COVID-19 diagnosis was based on restrictive symptom criteria (ie, presence of 4 out of 7 symptoms) or a positive RT-PCR test, a statistically significant association was found solely for statins (odds ratio 0.28, 95% CI 0.1-0.78). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals taking statin medication are more likely to have asymptomatic COVID-19, in which case they may be at an increased risk of transmitting the disease unknowingly. We suggest that the results of this study be incorporated into symptoms-based surveillance and decision-making protocols in regard to COVID-19 management.

Theoretically, research participants and study personnel could get infected in the closed environment of the exercise laboratory by contact with respiratory droplets from an infected person, by breathing virus-laden aerosols, or by touching fomites. Older adults are at increased risk of developing more severe disease and of dying from SARS-CoV-2 infection. This special article offers guidance - informed by a synthesis of scientific data and recommendations of the CDC and WHO, - on procedures that can be implemented in exercise laboratories to minimize risk of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections. Most tests of physical function (e.g., gait speed, Short Physical Performance Battery) are not aerosol-generating and are associated with only a small increase in minute ventilation; in contrast, CPXT markedly increases minute ventilation and is potentially aerosol-generating. Researchers should evaluate the benefit-to-risk ratio of information gained from the laboratory assessment versus the risk of SARS-CoV2 infection. Risk mitigation strategies described here fall into four categories: personal hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment; standardized screening; reconfiguration of laboratory space; and optimization of laboratory ventilation. The proposed safety measures are not intended to replace institutional policy, state or federal guidelines; they may not apply to all settings and are expected to evolve as more definitive information becomes available.

Previous studies have reported high frequency of muscular eosinophilic infiltration in achalasia. Esophageal mucosal changes in achalasia have only been studied in esophagectomy specimens. Cardia mucosal changes in achalasia have not been reported previously. We aimed to further characterize the esophageal, gastric cardia, and muscularis propria changes in achalasia. METHODS: This was a pilot study. Patients with clinically and radiographically confirmed achalasia who underwent POEM were enrolled in the study. Mucosal biopsies were taken 1 cm proximal and 1 cm distal to the gastroesophageal junction, and muscularis propria biopsies were taken from the mid esophagus. Tissues were submitted for histological evaluation. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (10 male and eight female, mean age: 60.7 (standard deviation (SD): 13) years) were enrolled in this pilot study. Nine patients had type II achalasia, two type III, one type I, five esophageal gastric outlet obstruction, and one unspecific type achalasia. The mean duration of symptoms prior to POEM was 79 (range 1 - 480) months. All patients had a dilated esophagus on examination, but no endoscopic evidence of Barretts esophagus. Esophageal, gastric cardia, and muscular biopsies were performed in 17, 13, and 17 patients, respectively. Basal hyperplasia, spongiosis, ballooning, and parakeratosis were seen in 92.3%, 100%, 100%, and 76.5% of cases, respectively. Intraepithelial lymphocytosis was seen in 70.5% of cases, and active esophagitis was seen in 23.5% of case. Six (35.3%) cases had few intraepithelial eosinophils, but none of them had > 15 eosinophils per high power field. Histologic findings in gastric cardia mucosa included carditis (69.2%), H. pylori gastritis (7.6%), and reactive gastropathy (15.4%). One case (7.6%) showed low-grade dysplasia arising from intestinal metaplasia in the cardia. Absence of ganglion cells in the muscular biopsies was noted in 88.2% of cases, and the remaining two showed rare residual ganglion cells with ganglionitis in one case (5.8%). Muscular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis were observed in 52.9% and 82.3% of the cases, respectively. Two cases (11.7%) had eosinophilic inflammation in the muscularis propria and one of them was accompanied by lymphocytic inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Muscular biopsies in our study revealed loss of ganglion cells, supporting the view that achalasia is a primary esophageal disease with ganglion cell depletion. Squamous mucosa in achalasia showed changes mimicking reflux and lymphocytic esophagitis.

In this report, we designed Er3+-doped Ce2O3 (Er/Ce2O3) NPs with a size of 7.9 nm, which were used to treat acute liver injury. Er/Ce2O3 NPs realized high-efficiency catalysis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at room temperature. An acute liver damage model was established through intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in C57 mice. By analyzing histopathological and biochemical indexes, Er/Ce2O3 NPs showed a significant improvement in LPS-induced acute liver injury. Acute liver oxidative damage can be treated within 24 hours, which proved the high catalytic efficiency of Er/Ce2O3 NPs in vivo. The activities of SOD, GPx and CTA increased and production of ROS decreased with Er/Ce2O3 NP treatment in comparison with LPS-induced injury, indicating that the mechanism of Er/Ce2O3 NPs in the treatment of acute oxidative damage of liver was mainly via catalysis of ROS products. Moreover, the protein expression levels of TNF-&#945;, CD45 and IL-1? in liver decreased in the Er/Ce2O3 NPs-treated group, which indicated that Er/Ce2O3 NPs have the function of anti-inflammation property. Therefore, Er/Ce2O3 NPs can be applied to treat and prevent diseases caused by acute oxidative damage.","output":"High catalytic efficiency from Er3+-doped CeO2-x nanoprobes for in vivo acute oxidative damage and inflammation therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nucleoprotein (N) from SARS-CoV-2 is an essential cofactor of the viral replication transcription complex and as such represents an important target for viral inhibition.

These implications have been particularly underexamined in the United States, whose regional differences may influence how frontline nurses perceive the access and utility of organizational resources. This study investigates if anxiety and stress while working during the current COVID-19 pandemic contribute to frontline nurses desire to leave their current position in Alabama hospital settings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was developed and distributed as a Qualtrics survey to frontline nurses using social media and professional contacts. A total of 111 frontline nurse respondents within May 19CJune 12, 2020 were included in this study. RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between gender (p= 0.002), marital status (p= 0.000) and seniority (p= 0.049) on turnover intention. A nurses perceived anxiety and stress related to their patients acuity (r= 0.257, p= 0.004), their personal health as a risk factor (r= 0.507, p= 0.000), their patient assignments (r= 0.239, p= 0.01), their personal protective equipment (r= 0.412, p= 0.000), and their psychological support (r= 0.316, p= 0.001) correspond to higher turnover intention among nurses working with patients infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Perceived resource loss in task autonomy, PPE, and psychosocial support increased turnover intention among frontline nurses in Alabama. Research is needed to understand how intrinsic motivations and social support influence individual nurse staffs perceptions of resource loss and job demands. Further, more research is necessary to examine the implications of rurality and place in discussing turnover intention and organizational resources across multiple health systems.","output":"Identifying Patterns of Turnover Intention Among Alabama Frontline Nurses in Hospital Settings During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted widespread primary and secondary school closures. Routine testing of asymptomatic students and staff, as part of a comprehensive program, can help schools open safely. \\"Pooling-in-a-pod\\" is a public health surveillance strategy whereby testing cohorts are composed based on social relationships and physical proximity. Pooling-in-a-pod allowed for weekly on-site point-of-care testing of all staff and students at an independent preschool to grade 12 school in Washington, D.C. Staff and older students self-collected anterior nares samples, and trained staff collected samples from younger students. Overall, 6,746 samples were tested for 815 students and 276 staff between November 30, 2020, and March 3, 2021. The average pool size was 7.3 people. Sample collection to pool result time averaged 40 minutes. The direct testing cost per person per week was $24.77, including swabs. One surveillance test pool was positive. During the study period, daily new cases in Washington, D.C., ranged from 24 - 46 per 100,000 population. A post-launch survey found most parents (90.3%), students (93.4%), and staff (98.8%) were willing to participate in pooled testing with confirmatory tests for positive pool members.

Identifying peoples preferences is key to building public confidence and planning for successful national health intervention strategies. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the sources of information for COVID-19 used by the Malaysian public and identifies those that are associated with building public confidence and positive perceptions toward the Malaysian government. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of 4850 Malaysian residents was conducted. Participant demographics, media use, information sources, and attitudes surrounding COVID-19 were assessed. Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to gauge the relationship between demographics, information sources, and attitudes toward COVID-19. RESULTS: Malaysians primarily used television and internet news portals to access information on COVID-19. The Malaysian Ministry of Health was the most preferred source of COVID-19 information. Respondents who referred to the Ministry of Health, television, and the Malaysian National Security Council for information were more likely to believe that the country could win the battle against COVID-19 and that the government was handling the health crisis well compared to those who referred to other information sources. Those who used the World Health Organization, friends, YouTube, family, and radio as sources of information were less likely to harbor confidence and positive belief toward combating COVID-19.

To examine how different inhibitory receptors are regulated, we carried out dual-color direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) of GlyRs and GABAA Rs at mixed inhibitory synapses in spinal cord neurons. We show that endogenous GlyRs and GABAA Rs as well as their common scaffold protein gephyrin form SSDs that align with pre-synaptic RIM1/2, thus creating trans-synaptic nanocolumns. Strikingly, GlyRs and GABAA Rs occupy different sub-synaptic spaces, exhibiting only a partial overlap at mixed inhibitory synapses. When network activity is increased by 4-aminopyridine treatment, the GABAA R copy numbers and the number of GABAA R SSDs are reduced, while GlyRs remain largely unchanged. This differential regulation is likely the result of changes in gephyrin phosphorylation that preferentially occurs outside of SSDs. The activity-dependent regulation of GABAA Rs versus GlyRs suggests that different signaling pathways control the receptors' sub-synaptic clustering. Taken together, our data reinforce the notion that the precise sub-synaptic organization of GlyRs, GABAA Rs, and gephyrin has functional consequences for the plasticity of mixed inhibitory synapses.","output":"Differential regulation of glycinergic and GABAergic nanocolumns at mixed inhibitory synapses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mental health problems are increasingly recognized as a significant and concerning secondary effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Research on previous epidemics/pandemics suggest that families, particularly mothers, may be at increased risk, but this population has yet to be examined. The current study (1) described prevalence rates of maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms from an online convenience sample during the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) identified risk and protective factors for elevated symptoms, and (3) described current mental health service use and barriers. METHODS: Participants (N = 641) were mothers of children age 0-8 years, including expectant mothers. Mothers completed an online survey assessing mental health, sociodemographic information, and COVID-19-related variables. RESULTS: Clinically-relevant depression was indicated in 33.16%, 42.55%, and 43.37% of mothers of children age 0-18 months, 18 months to 4 years, and 5 to 8 years, respectively. Prevalence of anxiety was 36.27%, 32.62%, and 29.59% for mothers across age groups, respectively. Binary logistic regressions indicated significant associations between risk factors and depression/anxiety across child age groups. LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional data was used to describe maternal mental health problems during COVID-19 limiting the ability to make inferences about the long-term impact of maternal depression and anxiety on family well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal depression and anxiety appear to be elevated in the context of COVID-19 compared to previously reported population norms.

However, the communication of scientific uncertainty is challenging because of its potential to promote ambiguity aversion-a well-described syndrome of negative psychological responses consisting of heightened risk perceptions, emotional distress, and decision avoidance. Communication strategies that can inform the public about scientific uncertainty while mitigating ambiguity aversion are a critical unmet need. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether an \\"uncertainty-normalizing\\" communication strategy-aimed at reinforcing the expected nature of scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic-can reduce ambiguity aversion, and to compare its effectiveness to conventional public communication strategies aimed at promoting hope and prosocial values. METHODS: In an online factorial experiment conducted from May to June 2020, a national sample of 1497 US adults read one of five versions of an informational message describing the nature, transmission, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19; the versions varied in level of expressed scientific uncertainty and supplemental focus (ie, uncertainty-normalizing, hope-promoting, and prosocial). Participants then completed measures of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral manifestations of ambiguity aversion (ie, perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19, COVID-19 worry, and intentions for COVID-19 risk-reducing behaviors and vaccination). Analyses assessed (1) the extent to which communicating uncertainty produced ambiguity-averse psychological responses; (2) the comparative effectiveness of uncertainty-normalizing, hope-promoting, and prosocial communication strategies in reducing ambiguity-averse responses; and (3) potential moderators of the effects of alternative uncertainty communication strategies. RESULTS: The communication of scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic increased perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 and worry about COVID-19, consistent with ambiguity aversion. However, it did not affect intentions for risk-reducing behaviors or vaccination. The uncertainty-normalizing strategy reduced these aversive effects of communicating scientific uncertainty, resulting in levels of both perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 and worry about COVID-19 that did not differ from the control message that did not communicate uncertainty. In contrast, the hope-promoting and prosocial strategies did not decrease ambiguity-averse responses to scientific uncertainty. Age and political affiliation, respectively, moderated the effects of uncertainty communication strategies on intentions for COVID-19 risk-reducing behaviors and worry about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Communicating scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic produces ambiguity-averse cognitive and emotional, but not behavioral, responses among the general public, and an uncertainty-normalizing communication strategy reduces these responses. Normalizing uncertainty may be an effective strategy for mitigating ambiguity aversion in crisis communication efforts. More research is needed to test uncertainty-normalizing communication strategies and to elucidate the factors that moderate their effectiveness.","output":"Communicating Scientific Uncertainty About the COVID-19 Pandemic: Online Experimental Study of an Uncertainty-Normalizing Strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION COVID-19 disproportionately impacts patients aged >= 80 years, yet few studies have focused on this population. We aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of very elderly patients with COVID-19 across three consecutive waves in Spain. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated very elderly patients admitted with COVID-19 to a university hospital in Barcelona, Spain, across the three first waves. Main outcomes were ICU admission and 30-day mortality. RESULTS From March 2020 to February 2021, 3105 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were admitted. Of these, 655 (21%) were very elderly patients, 50% were female and median age was 86 (83;89) years. ICU admission and ICU-mortality rates were 11% and 42%, respectively;male sex, respiratory rate >= 25 breaths/min, LDH >= 337.5 U/L and C-reactive protein >= 11.5 mg/dL were significantly associated with ICU admission in the multivariable analysis. Overall, 30-day mortality was 34%. The ICU admission rate was significantly higher during the first wave compared to the third wave (16% vs 8%;p=0.009), whereas no significant differences in 30-day mortality were found between waves (p=0.107). CONCLUSIONS We observed an increase in the percentage of very elderly patients admitted to the ICU during the three first pandemic peaks. ICU admission more likely occurs in very elderly male patients with higher respiratory rate, with elevate LDH and C-reactive protein.

The original EQ-5D-3L and more recent EQ-5D-5L include three and five response categories respectively. Evidence from healthy and sick populations shows that the additional two response categories improve measurement properties but there has not been a concurrent comparison of the two versions in patients with low back pain (LBP). METHODS: LBP patients taking part in a multicenter randomized controlled trial of lumbar total disc replacement and conservative treatment completed the EQ-5D-3L and 5L in an eight-year follow-up questionnaire. The 3L and 5L were assessed for aspects of data quality including missing data, floor and ceiling effects, response consistency, and based on a priori hypotheses, associations with the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Pain-Visual Analogue Scales and Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25). RESULTS: At the eight-year follow-up, 151 (87%) patients were available and 146 completed both the 3L and 5L. Levels of missing data were the same for the two versions. Compared to the EQ-5D-5L, the 3L had significantly higher floor (pain discomfort) and ceiling effects (mobility, self-care, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). For these patients the EQ-5D-5L described 73 health states compared to 28 for the 3L. Shannons indices showed the 5L outperformed the 3L in tests of classification efficiency. Correlations with the ODI, Pain-VAS and HSCL-25 were largely as hypothesized, the 5L having slightly higher correlations than the 3L. CONCLUSION: The EQ-5D assesses important aspect of health in LBP patients and the 5L improves upon the 3L in this respect. The EQ-5D-5L is recommended in preference to the 3L version, however, further testing in other back pain populations together with additional measurement properties, including responsiveness to change, is recommended.

On the other hand, computational methods can save time and money while enhancing drug discovery efficiency. Most of the computational methods frame DTI prediction as a binary classification task. One important challenge is that the number of negative interactions in all DTI-related datasets is far greater than the number of positive interactions, leading to the class imbalance problem. As a result, a classifier is trained biased towards the majority class (negative class), whereas the minority class (interacting pairs) is of interest. This class imbalance problem is not widely taken into account in DTI prediction studies, and the few previous studies considering balancing in DTI do not focus on the imbalance issue itself. Additionally, they do not benefit from deep learning models and experimental validation. In this study, we propose a computational framework along with experimental validations to predict drug-target interaction using an ensemble of deep learning models to address the class imbalance problem in the DTI domain. The objective of this paper is to mitigate the bias in the prediction of DTI by focusing on the impact of balancing and maintaining other involved parameters at a constant value. Our analysis shows that the proposed model outperforms unbalanced models with the same architecture trained on the BindingDB both computationally and experimentally. These findings demonstrate the significance of balancing, which reduces the bias towards the negative class and leads to better performance. It is important to note that leaning on computational results without experimentally validating them and by relying solely on AUROC and AUPRC metrics is not credible, particularly when the testing set remains unbalanced.","output":"UnbiasedDTI: Mitigating Real-World Bias of Drug-Target Interaction Prediction by Using Deep Ensemble-Balanced Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Can disruption happen when no one notices?

The extent to which C1r(2)s(2) contributes to C1qCIgG stability strongly differs between human IgG subclasses. Using antibody engineering of monoclonal IgG, we reveal that hexamer-enhancing mutations improve C1qCIgG stability, both in the absence and presence of C1r(2)s(2). In addition, hexamer-enhanced IgGs targeting S. aureus mediate improved complement-dependent phagocytosis by human neutrophils.

During the epidemic peak, in March 2020, patients needing intensive care unit treatments were approximately 10% of those infected. This fraction decreased to approximately 2% in the second part of April, and to 0.4% at the beginning of July. COVID-19 is characterized by several biochemical abnormalities whose discrepancy from normal values was associated to the severity of the disease. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the biochemical patterns of patients during and after the pandemic peak in order to verify whether later patients were experiencing a milder COVID-19 course, as anecdotally observed by several clinicians of the same Hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The laboratory findings of two equivalent groups of 84 patients each, admitted at the emergency department of the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy), during March and April respectively, were analyzed and compared. Results. White blood cell, platelets, lymphocytes and lactate dehydrogenase showed a statistically significant improvement (i.e. closer or within the normal clinical range) in the April group compared to March. Creatinine, C-reactive protein, Calcium and liver enzymes, were also pointing in that direction, although the differences were not significant. DISCUSSION: The laboratory findings analyzed in this study were consistent with a milder COVID-19 course in the April group. After excluding several hypotheses, we concluded that our observation was likely the consequence of the lockdown strategy enforcement, which, by imposing social distancing and the use of respiratory protective devices, reduced viral loads upon infection.","output":"Evidence of significant difference in key COVID-19 biomarkers during the Italian lockdown strategy.

Several studies are going on to assess the role of immunomodulation. IL-6 antibodies such as tocilizumab have been found to have efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. We aim to assess the role of sarilumab in the treatment of COVID-19 through this review. Main Body. Functional outcomes were assessed on the basis of PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, mortality, and ventilation. Adverse events of studies were also noted. Five studies were included in the study. There was improvement in PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, reduction in the mortality of the patients, and less number of patients were on ventilation, but there were no significant differences among the comparison and sarilumab group. Sarilumab did not have notable adverse events and can be considered a safe drug. CONCLUSION: Sarilumab is a safe drug with good clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and, hence, could be used as an alternative regimen for the treatment. Further prospective studies exploring the relations with baseline biomarkers of inflammation commonly measured such as C-reactive protein and IL-6 would be necessary for a correlation with the treatment.","output":"Efficacy and Safety of Sarilumab in COVID-19: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"If you're like me, in recent days you've experienced moments of fear.

The results show that gold and oil markets are the net recipients of return transmissions from the system, whereas the majority of equity sectors are the net transmitters of return spillovers in the system. Furthermore, negative spillovers are stronger than positive spillovers, suggesting asymmetry in return spillovers. Gold is the smallest recipient/transmitter of return spillovers from/to the system. The time-varying symmetric and asymmetric return spillover rises during the 2011C12 European debt crisis, 2014C15 oil crisis, 2016 Brexit referendum, and the COVID-19 crisis episodes, providing evidence of contagion. More interestingly, the COVID-19 crisis has had the biggest impact on positive and negative return transmission among the markets under study. The pairwise network connectedness analysis reveals the energy (basic resources) sector as the biggest transmitter of positive and negative return spillovers to the crude oil (gold) market. Finally, portfolio risk and downside-risk reduction analyses suggest an optimal weights-based strategy to minimize the risk for gold-stock and oil-stock-based portfolios during down markets.

Thus, various studies are underway to assay the long-term effects of COVID-19. Some patients, especially those with severe symptoms, experience susceptibility to a range of diseases and substantial organ dysfunction after recovery. Although COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, multiple reports exist on the effect of this infection on the kidneys, cardiovascular system, and gastrointestinal tract. Studies have also indicated the increased risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. On the other hand, COVID-19 may predispose patients to diabetes, as the most common metabolic disease. Recent studies have shown that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, which are expressed in the tissues and organs involved in regulating the metabolic status including pancreas, adipose tissue, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 may result in metabolic disturbance. However, there are still many unknowns about SARS-CoV-2, which are required to be explored in basic studies. In this context, special attention to molecular pathways is warranted for understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and achieving therapeutic opportunities. Hence, the present review aims to focus on the molecular mechanisms associated with the susceptibility to metabolic diseases amongst patients recovered from COVID-19.","output":"Susceptibility to Metabolic Diseases in COVID-19: To be or Not to be an Issue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Distal nasolacrimal duct stenosis is usually treated by head and neck surgeons with transnasal endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR).

Safety measures recommended by governments and health organizations include monitoring ones body and interpersonal and social distance from others. We contend that the diffuse safety anxiety stemming from sexual and self-objectification encourages targets to broadly adopt behaviors that protect against body-based dangers, including COVID-19. Accordingly, safety anxiety should predict greater compliance with COVID-19 safety measures. U.S. residents (N = 501) were recruited online and completed measures of sexual objectification, self-objectification, safety anxiety, appearance anxiety, and COVID-19 safety compliance. Two-step mediation analyses revealed a positive indirect effect of sexual objectification on safety anxiety through internalization of observers perspectives (self-objectification Factor 1); in turn, there was a positive indirect effect of internalized others on COVID-19 body-based safety compliance through safety anxiety. Moreover, women (vs. men) reported higher levels of sexual objectification, internalization of observers perspectives, safety anxiety, appearance anxiety, and COVID-19 safety measure compliance. Not only is safety anxiety relevant to cautionary behaviors protective against sexual objectification threat, but it also predicts compliance with measures that reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19.

An InSpectra Model 650 StO(2) monitor (Hutchinson Technology, Hutchinson, MN, USA) was used to measure at the thenar eminence throughout surgery and for two postoperative hours. Our primary outcome was a composite of 30 day mortality and serious in-hospital complications. The secondary outcome was an a priori subset of the primary composite outcome representing infectious and wound-healing complications. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations between our primary and secondary outcomes and time-weighted average (TWA) and minimum . RESULTS Patients were 61 (12), mean (SD) yr old. The minimum was inversely associated with our primary composite outcome (P=0.02). The estimated odds ratio (97.5% CI) of having any major postoperative morbidity was 0.82 (0.67, 1.00) for a 5% increase in the minimum . In contrast, TWA was not significantly associated with major postoperative morbidity (P=0.35).

OBJECTIVE To summarize and critically analyze the available evidence on the current status and future perspectives of LESS and NOTES in urology. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION A comprehensive electronic literature search was conducted in June 2010 using the Medline database to identify all publications relating to NOTES and LESS in urology. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS In urology, NOTES has been completed experimentally via transgastric, transvaginal, transcolonic, and transvesical routes. Initial clinical experience has shown that NOTES urologic surgery using currently available instruments is indeed possible. Nevertheless, because of the immaturity of the instrumentation, early cases have demanded high technical virtuosity. LESS can safely and effectively be performed in a variety of urologic settings. As clinical experience increases, expanding indications are expected to be documented and the efficacy of the procedure to improve. So far, the quality of evidence of all available studies remains low, mostly being small case series or case-control studies from selected centers. Thus, the only objective benefit of LESS remains the improved cosmetic outcome. Prospective, randomized studies are largely awaited to determine which LESS procedures will be established and which are unlikely to stand the test of time. Technology advances hold promise to minimize the challenging technical nature of scarless surgery. In this respect, robotics is likely to drive a major paradigm shift in the development of LESS and NOTES. CONCLUSIONS NOTES is still an investigational approach in urology. LESS has proven to be immediately applicable in the clinical field, being safe and feasible in the hands of experienced laparoscopic surgeons. Development of instrumentation and application of robotic technology are expected to define the actual role of these techniques in minimally invasive urologic surgery.","output":"Laparoendoscopic single-site and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery in urology: a critical analysis of the literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For over 50 years, the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has been based upon an oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks' gestation. This is the time during pregnancy when insulin resistance is increasing and hyperglycemia develops among those with insufficient insulin secretory capacity to maintain euglycemia. The Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) study and the two major randomized controlled trials of treating GDM are based upon recruitment of women at this time during pregnancy. Meanwhile, the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in pregnancy, with its significant risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, has led to a need to identify undiagnosed diabetes as near to conception as possible. Screening for undiagnosed diabetes early in pregnancy also identifies women with hyperglycemia less than overt diabetes, yet at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Such women are more insulin resistant-with higher blood pressure, triglycerides, perinatal mortality, and neonatal hypoglycemia with a greater need for insulin treatment-than those with GDM diagnosed at 24-28 weeks' gestation. Currently, there is uncertainty over how to diagnose GDM early in pregnancy and the benefits and harms from using the current management regimen. Randomized controlled trials testing the criteria for, and treatment of, GDM early in pregnancy are urgently needed to address this existing equipoise.

The interpersonal distance of at least 1 m recommended as a relevant measure for COVID-19 contagion containment requires a significant change in everyday behavior. In a web-based experimental study conducted during the first pandemic wave (mid-April 2020), we asked 242 participants to regulate their preferred distance towards confederates who did or did not wear protective masks and gloves and whose COVID-19 test results were positive, negative, or unknown. Information concerning dispositional factors (perceived vulnerability to disease, moral attitudes, and prosocial tendencies) and situational factors (perceived severity of the situation in the country, frequency of physical and virtual social contacts, and attitudes toward quarantine) that may modulate compliance with safety prescriptions was also acquired. A Bayesian analysis approach was adopted. Individual differences did not modulate interpersonal distance. We found strong evidence in favor of a reduction of interpersonal distance towards individuals wearing protective equipment and who tested negative to COVID-19. Importantly, shorter interpersonal distances were maintained towards confederates wearing protective gear, even when their COVID-19 test result was unknown or positive. This protective equipment-related regulation of interpersonal distance may reflect an underestimation of perceived vulnerability to infection; this perception must be discouraged when pursuing individual and collective health-safety measures.","output":"A Bayesian approach to reveal the key role of mask wearing in modulating projected interpersonal distance during the first COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists coordinated a complex immunization effort that developed and distributed vaccines by December 2020.

The alarming speed at which SARS-CoV-2 has spread, and the high mortality rate of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has required both basic science and clinical research to move at an unprecedented pace. Models previously developed to study the immune response against SARS-CoV have been rapidly deployed to now study SARS-CoV-2. To date, both small and large animal models are remarkably consistent when infected with SARS-CoV-2; however, certain models have proven more useful when answering specific immunological questions than others. Small animal models, such as Syrian hamsters, ferrets, and mice carrying the hACE2 transgene, appear to reliably recapitulate the initial cytokine surge seen in COVID-19 as well as show significant innate and adaptive cell infiltration in to the lung early in infection. Additionally, these models develop strong antibody responses to the virus, are protected from reinfection, and genetically modified versions exist that can be used to ask specific immunological questions. Large animal models such as rhesus and cynomologus macaques and African green monkeys are critical to understanding how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection because they are considered to be the most similar to humans. These models are considered the gold standard for assessing vaccine efficacy and protection, and recapitulate the initial cytokine surge, immune cell infiltration into the lung, certain aspects of thrombosis, and the antibody and T-cell response to the virus.

According to the fact that nanomaterial-based drug delivery systems as risk-free approaches for successful therapeutic strategies may led to immunization against COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of Carmofur as a potential drug for the SARS-CoV-2 treatment via graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) was investigated in silico using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. MD simulation showed that ШC stacking together with hydrogen bonding played vital roles in the stability of the CarmofurCGOQD complex. Spontaneous attraction of GOQDs loaded with Carmofur toward the binding pocket of the main protease (M(pro)) resulted in the penetration of Carmofur into the active catalytic region. It was found that the presence of GOQD as an effective carrier in the loading and delivery of Carmofur inhibitor affected the structural conformation of M(pro). Higher RMSF values of the key residues of the active site indicated their greater displacement to adopt Carmofur. These results suggested that the binding pocket of M(pro) is not stable during the interaction with the CarmofurCGOQD complex.

This has paralyzed economic and social activities and may continue to do so until the large-scale availability of a vaccine. We propose an alternative exit strategy to develop herd immunity in a predictable and controllable way: a phased lift of control. This means that successive parts of the country (e.g. provinces) stop stringent control, and COVID-19-related IC admissions are distributed over the country as a whole. Importantly, vulnerable individuals need to be shielded until herd immunity has developed in their area. We explore the characteristics and duration of this strategy using a novel individual-based model for geographically stratified transmission of COVID-19 in a country. The model predicts that individuals will have to experience stringent control for about 14 months on average, but this duration may be almost halved by further developments (more IC beds, better treatments). Clearly, implementation of this strategy would have a profound impact on individuals and society, and should therefore be considered carefully by various other disciplines (e.g. health systems, ethics, economics) before actual implementation.","output":"Achieving herd immunity against COVID-19 at the country level by the exit strategy of a phased lift of control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: This study aimed to describe the change in surgical practice and the impact of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 on mortality after surgical resection of colorectal cancer during the initial phases of the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 pandemic.

Although the problem of burnout, which overlaps with the symptoms of depression, remains urgent, few studies have addressed it comprehensively. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and the factors associated with burnout among HCW. METHODES: We conducted a cross-sectional study on March-April 2021 using a self-administered questionnaire distributed to HCW who were involved in COVID-19 management patients. The 22-item Maslach burnout inventory was performed to measure the prevalence of burnout defined as follows: high score of emotional exhaustion (27) plus high score of depersonalization (13) or low score of personal accomplishment (31). RESULTS: Overall, 250 HCW were included in this study. The sex ratio was 0.17. Their median age was 34 years (interqurtile range (IQR) = [30-40 years]). The average number of work experience was 11.13.4 years. There were 46 cases (18.4%) with a chronic disease. Among the study population, 131 HCW (51.4%) were infected with covid-19. The overall burnout prevalence was 45.6%. Female gender (Odds ratio (OR)=4.3; p < 0.001) and unmarried status (OR = 3.3; p < 0.001) were statistically associated with burnout. Participants in the burnout group had statistically higher number of working hours per day (6 hours) (OR = 3.2; p = 0.003), of night shifts per week (41 vs 31; p = 0.04), but lower number of working experience years (70.6 vs 121; p = 0.017).

However, the use of both types of treatment in upper rectal cancer is controversial. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this work was to assess oncological results after radical resection of upper rectal cancers compared with sigmoid, middle, and lower rectal cancers and to determine risk factors for local recurrence in upper rectal cancer. DESIGN This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. SETTINGS This study was conducted in a tertiary care referral hospital in Valencia, Spain. PATIENTS Analysis included 1145 patients who underwent colorectal resection with primary curative intent for primary sigmoid (n = 450), rectosigmoid (n = 70), upper rectal (n = 178), middle rectal (n = 186), or lower rectal (n = 261) cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Oncological results, including local recurrence, disease-free survival, and cancer-specific survival, were compared between the different tumor locations. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for local recurrence in upper rectal cancer. RESULTS A total of 147 patients (82.6%) with upper rectal tumors underwent partial mesorectal excision, and only 10 patients (5.6%) of that group received preoperative chemoradiation. The 5-year actuarial local recurrence, disease-free survival, and cancer-specific survival rates for upper rectal tumors were 4.9%, 82.0%, and 91.6%. Local recurrence rates showed no differences when compared among all of the locations (p = 0.20), whereas disease-free survival and cancer-specific survival were shorter for lower rectal tumors (p = 0.006; p = 0.003). The only independent risk factor for local recurrence in upper rectal cancer was an involved circumferential resection margin at pathologic analysis (HR, 14.23 (95% CI, 2.75-73.71); p = 0.002). LIMITATIONS This was a single-institution, retrospective study.

We explore the social-political determinants of climate attitudes and how they are positioned in relation to voting behaviour, in the context of the 2019 election. We use a large nationally representative survey of Australian voters (n = 2,033), and employ univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression models to uncover correlates. We find that a large majority of voters think it is important for Australia to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the importance given to emissions reductions is sharply divided along lines of political party preference. Holding pro-climate action attitudes consistently correlates with voting for progressive political parties and having higher levels of education. We also find a strong age cohort divide, with younger people holding stronger pro-climate attitudes than older people, raising the question whether we are seeing the emergence of a new generation expressing strong pro-climate action and progressive political attitudes that will persist over time. We conduct population ageing scenarios to project changes to public opinion, by age group, into the future. These indicate that strong support for climate action would increase by about four percentage points over the coming decade as younger voters replace the old, if attitudes within cohorts remained fixed.

Primary research papers, published from January 1st to June 30th, 2020, reporting patients' data, with no limits of study design were included. Studies were categorized for study design, research question, COVID-19 phase, limitations of functioning (disability) of rehabilitation interest and type of rehabilitation service involved. Methodological quality assessment was based on the Cochrane Risk of Bias tools, and the level of evidence table (OCEBM 2011) for all the other studies.

Unfortunately, public health messages can be undermined by competing misinformation and conspiracy theories, spread virally through communities that are already distrustful of expert opinion. In this article, we propose and analyse a simple model of the interaction between disease spread and awareness dynamics in a heterogeneous population composed of both trusting individuals who seek better quality information and will take precautionary measures, and distrusting individuals who reject better quality information and have overall riskier behaviour. We show that, as the density of the distrusting population increases, the model passes through a phase transition to a state in which major outbreaks cannot be suppressed. Our work highlights the urgent need for effective interventions to increase trust and inform the public.","output":"Misinformation can prevent the suppression of epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How do you preserve the history of a neighbourhood undergoing change?

Unlike the previous two coronavirus outbreaks, COVID-19 has caused several thousand deaths for respiratory and multiple organ failure. As specifically concerns this latest infectious pathology, laboratory medicine can provide a substantial contribution to diagnosing an acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection through molecular testing, establishing the presence and extent of an immune response against the virus, mostly through serological testing. However, it can also help to predict the risk of unfavorable disease progression by measuring some conventional laboratory tests and, last but not least, can provide reliable therapeutic guidance.

The Indonesian government implemented \\"large-scale social restrictions,\\" which have impacted farming and farmers' food security. Farmers are both producers and consumers of food and, therefore, have been facing new challenges due to transport restrictions, price spikes for inputs, price drops for their produce, or conditions which aggravated cooperation, such as social distancing. This study aims at analysing the challenges of the containments from a smallholder farmer perspective and examining farmers' coping potential. A digital survey with 323 farmers has been designed as comparative observational research in Toraja, South Sulawesi, and selected regions of Java. The Bonferroni Multiple Comparison Test was used to test for significance regarding socioeconomic factors and space. A logistic regression model extracted determinants for crisis coping. Results reveal, that female farmers worry more about COVID-19 outbreak compared to men at a significant level. In contrast, male farmers, particularly in Java, are more concerned about social restrictions due to limited mobility. Food price spikes were reported in both regions, with sharp increases for fish, fruits, and vegetables in Java, for staples in Toraja, and for meat and sugar in both regions. Food groups, that trade through agents and brokers or are transported longer distances were affected most due to their complex and long supply chains that were disrupted during the restrictions. In Java, farmers face multiple shocks, of which climate change was reported even more often than the pandemic related shocks. Not being able to help each other on the farm due to social distancing is a significant concern of farmers in Toraja. As a result of food market disturbances, farmers began to grow and eat more vegetables and fruits. In conclusion, food security for farmers slightly decreased due to affordability, and market disruptions already point to long-term income losses.

Disinfection guidelines specify that drinking water with turbidity 1 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) is not suitable for disinfection and therefore not fit for purpose. Treated wastewater typically has higher concentrations of particles (1C10 NTU for secondary treated effluent). Two processes widely used for disinfecting wastewater are chlorination and ultraviolet radiation. In both cases, particles in wastewater can interfere with disinfection and can significantly increase treatment costs by increasing operational expenditure (chemical demand, power consumption) or infrastructure costs by requiring additional treatment processes to achieve the required levels of pathogen inactivation. Many microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, protozoans) associate with particles, which can allow them to survive disinfection processes and cause a health hazard. Improved understanding of this association will enable development of cost-effective treatment, which will become increasingly important as indirect and direct potable reuse of wastewater becomes more widespread in both developed and developing countries. This review provides an overview of wastewater and associated treatment processes, the pathogens in wastewater, the nature of particles in wastewater and how they interact with pathogens, and how particles can impact disinfection processes.","output":"Pathogen and Particle Associations in Wastewater: Significance and Implications for Treatment and Disinfection Processes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Jessica Wu is Research and Development Program Director at the Language Training and Testing Center (LTTC) in Taipei, Taiwan Jessica has been deeply involved in the development and validation of the General English Proficiency Test (GEPT) in addition to a number of other foreign language testing programs Her research focuses on speaking assessment and the impact of standardized language testing Jessica is a founding member of the Asian Association for Language Assessment (AALA), for which she has served as both co-president (2016 to 2017) and president (2018 to 2019) She currently serves as an advisor for the development and administration of L1 tests (i e , Hakka, Southern Min, and Indigenous language proficiency certifications) in Taiwan Jessica has authored a number of publications, including articles and book chapters in the field of language testing, and has presented her work at conferences around the world Most recently, she co-edited English Language Proficiency Testing in Asia: A New Paradigm Bridging Global and Local Contexts with Cyril Weir and I-Wen Su Her contributions to language testing are significant and immeasurable, particularly with regard to Asia The following interview with Jessica, which was conducted via an online meeting platform due to the COVID-19 pandemic, took place in January 2021 (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Abstract (Chinese)","output":"Advancing the international recognition of the locally-produced gept: An interview with jessica wu"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The importance of the risk to tourism and hospitality operations from pandemic-related crises has increased.

Most of the nations adopted partial or complete 'lockdown' and imposed 'social distancing' to control the rapid transmission of COVID-19 and its consequence. Though global economic growth declined due to nationwide lockdown, there are certain positive impacts on environment. This review article has discussed the effects of nationwide lockdown aiming to community transmission COVID-19 on animal life behaviour and atmospheric environment in different aspects. In the lockdown period, the levels of NO2 and carbon emission remarkably decrease in atmosphere due to restricted consumption of fossil fuel by industries, thermal power stations and air transportations. The concentration of NO2 dropped by 45-54% in the atmosphere of most populated cities in Europe. The intensities of particulate matters PM2.5 and PM10 decreased by 43% and 31% respectively, at lower atmosphere indicating improvement in air qualities in different parts of world caused by less traffic and construction activities. SPM reduced up to 15.9%, showing improvement in surface water quality. New deserted bank has developed due to less river activities in this period. Noise pollution remarkably dropped below 60 db even in crowded cities. Thus, the atmospheric environment has resumed some extent in all respect by means of such global-wide lockdown aiming to control COVID-19 pandemic. The behavioural changes of wild animals, birds, butterfly, pets and street animals that reflected on ecosystem of their relative region indicate the non-interference of human activities on lives of natural creatures during lockdown period. There is certain correlation between atmospheric change with the behavioural changes of natural creature during lockdown period.

This increase in O3 concentrations is mainly explained by an unprecedented reduction in NOx emissions leading to a lower O3 titration by NO. Strong reductions in NO2 mean concentrations were observed in all European cities, ~53% at urban stations, comparable to Wuhan (57%), and ~65% at traffic stations. NO declined even further, ~63% at urban stations and ~78% at traffic stations in Europe. Reductions in PM2.5 and PM10 at urban stations were overall much smaller both in magnitude and relative change in Europe (~8%) than in Wuhan (~42%). The PM reductions due to limiting transportation and fuel combustion in institutional and commercial buildings were partly offset by increases of PM emissions from the activities at home in some of the cities. The NOx concentrations during the lockdown were on average 49% lower than those at weekends of the previous years in all cities. The lockdown effect on O3 production was ~10% higher than the weekend effect in Southern Europe and 38% higher in Wuhan, while for PM the lockdown had the same effect as weekends in Southern Europe (~6% of difference).

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccines. DESIGN: Target trial emulation study comparing newly vaccinated persons with matched unvaccinated controls. SETTING: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs health care system. PARTICIPANTS: Among persons receiving care in the Veterans Affairs health care system (n = 5 766 638), those who received at least 1 dose of the Moderna or PfizerCBioNTech COVID-19 vaccine from 11 December 2020 to 25 March 2021 (n = 2 099 871) were matched to unvaccinated controls in a 1:1 ratio according to demographic, clinical, and geographic characteristics. INTERVENTION: Follow-up for SARS-CoV-2 infection or SARS-CoV-2Crelated death, defined as death within 30 days of infection, began after the vaccination date or an identical index date for the matched unvaccinated controls and continued until up to 30 June 2021. MEASUREMENTS: Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection or SARS-CoV-2Crelated death. RESULTS: Vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were well matched; both were predominantly male (92.9% vs. 93.4%), had advanced age (mean, 68.7 years in both groups), had diverse racial and ethnic distribution (for example, Black: 17.3% vs. 17.0%, Hispanic: 6.5% vs. 6.1%), and had substantial comorbidity burden. Vaccine effectiveness 7 or more days after the second vaccine dose was 69% (95% CI, 67% to 70%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection and 86% (CI, 82% to 89%) against SARS-CoV-2Crelated death and was similar when follow-up was extended to 31 March versus 30 June.

METHODS: Patients were risk-stratified using a general medical health composite score (HCS) and a cancer-specific risk (CSR) stratification based on disease and treatment characteristics. The correlation between HCS and CSR was measured using Spearman's correlation. A multi-disciplinary team developed a focused needs assessment script with recommended interventions for patients categorized as high-risk by either method. The number of patient needs identified and referrals for services made in the first month of outreach are reported.

In the IPTW analysis, treatment with tocilizumab was associated with a reduced need for overall ventilatory support (49 vs. 89%, wHR: 0.39 [0.25C0.56]; p < 0.001). Albeit lacking statistical significance, there was a substantial trend towards a reduction of mechanical ventilation (31% vs. 45%; wHR: 0.58 [0.36C0.94]; p = 0.026). However, tocilizumab did not improve overall survival (wHR = 0.68 [0.31C1.748], p = 0.338). Among the 85 (89%) patients still alive at D28, patients treated with tocilizumab had a higher rate of oxygen withdrawal (82% vs. 73.5%, wHR = 1.66 [1.17C2.37], p = 0.005), with a shorter delay before being weaned of oxygen therapy (mean 11 vs. 16 days; p < 0.001). At D28, the rate of patients discharged from hospital was higher in the tocilizumab group (70% vs. 40%, wHR = 1.82 [1.22C2.75]; p = 0.003). The levels of CRP and fibrinogen post therapy (p < 0.001 for both variables) were significantly lower in the tocilizumab group (interaction test, mixed model). Rates of neutropenia (35% vs. 0%; p < 0.001) were higher in the tocilizumab group, yet rates of infections (22% vs. 38%, p = 0.089) including ventilator-acquired pneumonia (8% vs. 26%, p = 0.022) were higher in the control group. CONCLUSION: These data could be helpful for the design of future trials aiming to counter COVID-19-induced inflammation, especially before patients require admission to the intensive care unit.

As mental health professionals;we need to consider the psychological impact of the pandemic. There are certain groups of people that are largely more vulnerable to pernicious effects on mental health including frontline healthcare workers. Hence, the current study was undertaken look into the minds of our covid warriors. Aims and Objectives: This study aims to assess psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic among health care professionals, with the primary objectives being to study: 1. Perceived stress regarding COVID-19 pandemic among health care professionals. 2. Stigma associated with the pandemic, faced by health care professionals in their surroundings as well as in the society. 3. Obsessive-Compulsive symptoms among the health care professionals. The secondary objective of the study is to compare between High and Low exposure groups on the basis of different variables. Materials and Methods: This study is an observational, cross-sectional study wherein the sample size is 410, taken by consequent sampling. Data was collected from health care professionals all over India, by manual or digital interview. Health care professionals of a tertiary care hospital were taken up for the study including doctors, nurses and other hospital staff. Results: On K10 scale, 369 (90%) of the subjects had scores below 25, meaning they reported to have no or mild perceived stress, whereas 41 of them (10%) had scores 25 or above, meaning to have moderate or severe perceived stress. Forty (9.8%) subjects reported to be experiencing panic symptoms at the time of the interview. One hundred twenty-eight (31.2%) admitted to have faced stigma from the society in at least one of the facets of the questionnaire based on SARI stigma scale. 39 people (9.5%) reported to be experiencing OC symptoms at the time of interview. Conclusion: With this research we conclude that owing to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the health care professionals are under a lot of stress, many of them have also experienced panic like symptoms. Large scale screenings should be carried out at regular intervals at hospitals to keep a check on the mental health of health care workers. Mental health should be given a priority by the government officials and sufficient awareness campaigns should be rolled out.

Pseudo-PEA may constitute up to 40% of reported cases of cardiac arrest. Resuscitation from pseudo-PEA is often associated with hypotension refractory to catecholamine pressors. We hypothesized that this post-resuscitation state may be associated with hypocalcemic hypotension responsive to intravenous calcium. METHODS: Using pre-existing data from our hypoxic swine pseudo-PEA model, we measured blood pressure, hemodynamics, and electrolytes. Physiological data were analyzed on a heartbeat by heartbeat basis. The midpoint of the calcium response was defined using change of curvature feature detection. Hemodynamic parameters were shifted such that the value at the midpoint was equal to zero. RESULTS: In 9 animals with refractory hypotension, we administered 37 boluses of intravenous calcium in the dosage range of 5-20 mg. Comparisons were made between the average values in the time period 40-37 s before the midpoint and 35-40 s after the midpoint. Of the 37 administered boluses, 34 manifested a change in the blood pressure, with mean aortic pressure, systolic and diastolic pressures all increasing post bolus administration. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of intravenous calcium may be associated with a pressor-like response in refractory hypotension after resuscitation from pseudo-PEA. Relative ionized hypocalcemia may cause hypotension after resuscitation from pseudo-PEA. Therapy with intravenous calcium should be further investigated in this setting.","output":"Intravenous calcium as a pressor in a swine model of hypoxic pseudo-pulseless electrical mechanical activitya preliminary report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects host cells through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors, leading to coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related pneumonia, and also causing acute cardiac injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system.

The plasma of recovered patients might serve as treatment, which we aim to assess in the form of a prospective meta-analysis focusing on mortality, multi-organ failure, duration of intensive care unit stay, and adverse events. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to find relevant registered randomized controlled trials in five trial registries. A comprehensive search will be done continuously on a monthly basis in MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science to find the results of previously registered randomized controlled trials. The selection will be done by two independent authors. Data extraction will be carried out by two other independent reviewers. Disagreements will be resolved by a third investigator. An update of the search of the registries and the first search of the databases will be done on the 21st of July. Data synthesis will be performed following the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration. In the case of dichotomous outcomes (mortality and organ failure), we will calculate pooled risk ratios with a 95% confidence interval (CI) from two-by-two tables (treatment Y/N, outcome Y/N). Data from models with multivariate adjustment (hazard ratios, odds ratio, risk ratio) will be preferred for the analysis. P less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. In the case of ICU stay, weighted mean difference with a 95% confidence interval will be calculated. Heterogeneity will be tested with I2, and &#967;2 tests. Meta-analysis will be performed if at least 3 studies report on the same outcome and population.

However according to the latest NICE guidance those with diverticulitis who are not systemically unwell may not require either admission or antibiotics. In the financially austere environment facing the NHS within the COVID 19 pandemic, prudence in such resource allocation is of vital importance. We aim to review management of patients with acute diverticulitis over a 6-month period in a district general hospital against the 2019 NICE guidelines. METHODS: 29 patients presenting with acute diverticulitis, M:F ratio 12:17, median age 55 (range 24-82), median ASA 2 (range 0-3) were retrospectively reviewed. Biochemical markers, lactate and vital signs were used to assess if attending patients were systemically unwell. RESULTS: 23 patients were admitted and 6 managed as outpatients via the surgical ambulatory unit. Of the 29 patient cohort, 9 (31%) were systemically unwell. All 9 unwell patients received antibiotics. Of the 20 patients not considered systemically unwell, 11 (55%) received antibiotics. 16 (80%) that were admitted did not require admission on retrospective review. CONCLUSION: Prompt administration of intravenous antibiotics for septic patients with diverticulitis reduces associated morbidity and mortality and the observed adherence to this principle is encouraging. For systemically well patients, increased clinical discernment is required to consider managing patients in the surgical ambulatory setting, avoiding unnecessary admissions. Similar caution must be used in appropriate use of antimicrobials to avoid unnecessary adverse consequences.","output":"EP.WE.802 Are we over-zealous in our management of acute diverticulitis?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present and evaluate new methods for incremental entity resolution as needed for the completion of knowledge graphs integrating data from multiple sources.

Moving beyond militaristic imagery, the analysis shows a form of violence that emerges as a response to the endless search for a life of convenience inside the walls of the GC. To this end, the article advances the concept of the dialect of disarrangement, the enforced but uneasy encounter between two subjectivities that inhabit the GC: the patrons (the homeowners who consume the easy life) and servants (the racialised service staff).

Relatively little is known about the impact these shocks have on households subjective sense of financial well-being, and how access to different types of liquidity (e.g., liquid assets, credit cards, social resources, and income flows) can mitigate the impact of these shocks on subjective financial well-being. To address these gaps in the literature, this paper uses data from a two-wave survey administered to 3,911 low- and moderate-income tax filers in 2018. Applying a difference-in-difference analysis, we find that the experience of an income shock between survey waves was associated with a large decline in subjective financial well-being, while the experience of an expense shock was associated with a more modest decline. Relatively liquidity-constrained households tended to be more negatively impacted by shocks than their counterparts, though not all sources of liquidity were equally as effective in buffering households against shocks.

There are numerous ways in which this will impact existing public health issues. Here we reflect on the interactions between COVID-19 and tuberculosis (TB), which still ranks as the leading cause of death from a single infectious disease globally. There may be grave consequences for existing and undiagnosed TB patients globally, particularly in low and middle income countries (LMICs) where TB is endemic and health services poorly equipped. TB control programmes will be strained due to diversion of resources, and an inevitable loss of health system focus, such that some activities cannot or will not be prioritised. This is likely to lead to a reduction in quality of TB care and worse outcomes. Further, TB patients often have underlying co-morbidities and lung damage that may make them prone to more severe COVID-19. The symptoms of TB and COVID-19 can be similar, with for example cough and fever. Not only can this create diagnostic confusion, but it could worsen the stigmatization of TB patients especially in LMICs, given the fear of COVID-19. Children with TB are a vulnerable group especially likely to suffer as part of the collateral damage. There will be a confounding of symptoms and epidemiological data through co-infection, as happens already with TBCHIV, and this will require unpicking. Lessons for COVID-19 could be learned from the vast experience of running global TB control programmes, while the astonishingly rapid and relatively well co-ordinated response to COVID-19 demonstrates how existing programmes could be significantly improved.","output":"Anticipating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on TB patients and TB control programmes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MicroRNAs have been projected as promising tools for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in cancer. More recently, they have been highlighted as RNA therapeutic targets for cancer therapy.

Release of extracellular miRs is broadly categorized into two different compositions, namely exosomal (extracellular vesicles) and non-exosomal. This nature of miRs not only affects the uptake into target cells but also poses a challenge and opportunity for RNA therapeutics in cancer. By virtue of their ability to act as mediators of intercellular communication in the tumor microenvironment, extracellular miRs perform both, depending upon the target cell and target landscape, pro- and anti-tumor functions. Tumor-derived miRs mostly perform pro-tumor functions, whereas host cell- or stroma-derived miRs are involved in anti-tumor activities.

We compared morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 before and after the spread of the alpha variant of the virus and the same among transplant (KTRs) and haemodialysis patients in Slovakia. METHODS: 305 KTRs (68.8 % males) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positivity were included in the multicentric retrospective analysis. The patients were split into subgroups based on the time of falling ill and their clinical course. RESULTS: The procurement program and kidney transplants in Slovakia dropped in the observed period by 28.6 % (p<0.0001) and by 33.5 % (p<0.0001) respectively. Age over 59 years (p=0.0088) and diabetes mellitus (p=0.0106) were identified as independent risk factors for severe course of the disease. Risk factors for death were the age over 59 years (p=0.0003) and graft dysfunction with CKD-EPI<0.5 mL/s (p=0.0029). The prevalence of the alpha variant in Slovakia was associated with a severe course in KTRs treated with corticoids (p=0.0273) and in graft dysfunction with CKD-EPI<0.5 mL/s (p=0.0076); the risk of death was higher in KTRs over 59 years (p=0.0173) and again with CKD-EPI<0.5 mL/s (p=0.0393). KTRs had a 3.7 times lower risk of infection compared to the haemodialysis patients (p<0.0001), with mortality of 9.8 % vs 30a? % (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: The procurement and transplant program is sustainable even during a pandemic, provided that measures are set up quickly.

According to the current case reports and cohort studies, the symptoms of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to normal adults and may cause a series of adverse consequences of pregnancy (placental abruption, fetal distress, epilepsy during pregnancy, etc.). However, whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to the fetus through the placental barrier is still a focus of debate. METHODS: In this study, in order to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 can infect fetus through the placental barrier, we performed qualitative detection of virus structural protein (spike protein and nucleoprotein) and targeted receptor protein Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), Basigin (CD147) and molecular chaperone GRP78 expression on the placental tissue of seven pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 through immunohistochemistry. Amniotic fluid, neonatal throat, anal swab and breastmilk samples were collected immediately in the operating room or delivery room for verification after delivery, which were all tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS/DISCUSSION: The result showed that CD147 was expressed on the basal side of the chorionic trophoblast cell membrane and ACE2 was expressed on the maternal side, while GRP78 was strongly expressed in the cell membrane and cytoplasm. The RT-PCR results of Amniotic fluid, neonatal throat, anal swab and breastmilk samples were all negative. On the basis of these findings, we speculated that it may be due to the placental barrier between mother and baby, for example, villous matrix and interstitial blood vessels have low expression of virus-related receptors (ACE2, CD147, GRP78), the probability of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the placenta is low.","output":"Evaluation of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in utero: Nine pregnant women and their newborns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A potentially fatal complication of influenza infection is the development of pneumonia, caused either directly by the influenza virus, or by secondary bacterial infection.

Although the virus is a ubiquitous problem, world leaders have varied appreciably in their responses resulting in substantially different outcomes in terms of virus mitigation, population health, and economic stability. One explanation for this inconsistency is that leaders have taken differential approaches to making sense of the crisis that, in turn, have driven their approaches to decision making and communication. The present article elaborates on the role of leaders as sensemakers and explains how a leader's sensemaking approach is a critical element in successful crisis management efforts. Through the charismatic, ideological, pragmatic (CIP) leadership model, a sensemaking-focused theory of leadership, it is explained how specific, relatively stable sensemaking approaches manifest and what actions leaders engaged in those styles are likely to take in times of crisis. These connections are then reinforced through case examples of 3 world leaders, framed through CIP, and demonstrate how their sensemaking approach has influenced their response to COVID-19. The article concludes with a discussion of the impacts that these differential approaches to COVID-19 may have on the global community, and recommendations for more explicit incorporation of sensemaking into our understanding of leadership.

The area under Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.777 to 0.823 from 1- to 7- year survival rate. The model and its individual lncRNAs differentiated survival probability between the higher scores (expression) and the lower scores (expression).

To date, only a few studies have drawn attention to the psychological impact of lockdown on Italian children's mental health. The present study aimed to investigate the psychological distress (anxiety and mood symptoms) and perceived changes in routine among Italian primary and middle school students during the COVID-19 quarantine. METHODS: This interview study was performed between the 18th of May and 7th of June 2020: it involved a sample of 82 children and adolescents living in Milan (Italy), attending primary and middle school (aged 6 to 14 years), and their parents. RESULTS: Almost 30 % of the subjects reported having struggled to adjust to home learning. 36 responders completely changed their dietary habits during the lockdown: they were not eating the same amount of food and were consuming more junk food. Sleep habits were also affected by the lockdown measures: 28 % of the sample had difficulties sleeping and wished to sleep in their parents' bed. Concerning psychological distress, 64 (78 %) children and adolescents had anxiety symptoms; 43.9 % of the students reported significant mood symptoms.

About 85% of patients respond to immunotherapy (and removal of an associated tumour if it applies), but it often takes several months or more than 1 year for patients to recover. There are no complementary treatments, beyond immunotherapy, to accelerate this recovery. Previous studies showed that SGE-301, a synthetic analogue of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, which is a potent and selective positive allosteric modulator of NMDAR, reverted the memory deficit caused by phencyclidine (a non-competitive antagonist of NMDAR), and prevented the NMDAR dysfunction caused by patients' NMDAR antibodies in cultured neurons. An advantage of SGE-301 is that it is optimized for systemic delivery such that plasma and brain exposures are sufficient to modulate NMDAR activity. Here, we used SGE-301 to confirm that in cultured neurons it prevented the antibody-mediated reduction of receptors, and then we applied it to a previously reported mouse model of passive cerebroventricular transfer of patient's CSF antibodies. Four groups were established: mice receiving continuous (14-day) infusion of patients' or controls' CSF, treated with daily subcutaneous administration of SGE-301 or vehicle (no drug). The effects on memory were examined with the novel object location test at different time points, and the effects on synaptic levels of NMDAR (assessed with confocal microscopy) and plasticity (long-term potentiation) were examined in the hippocampus on Day 18, which in this model corresponds to the last day of maximal clinical and synaptic alterations. As expected, mice infused with patient's CSF antibodies, but not those infused with controls' CSF, and treated with vehicle developed severe memory deficit without locomotor alteration, accompanied by a decrease of NMDAR clusters and impairment of long-term potentiation. All antibody-mediated pathogenic effects (memory, synaptic NMDAR, long-term potentiation) were prevented in the animals treated with SGE-301, despite this compound not antagonizing antibody binding. Additional investigations on the potential mechanisms related to these SGE-301 effects showed that (i) in cultured neurons SGE-301 prolonged the decay time of NMDAR-dependent spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents suggesting a prolonged open time of the channel; and (ii) it significantly decreased, without fully preventing, the internalization of antibody-bound receptors suggesting that additional, yet unclear mechanisms, contribute in keeping unchanged the surface NMDAR density. Overall, these findings suggest that SGE-301, or similar NMDAR modulators, could potentially serve as complementary treatment for anti-NMDAR encephalitis and deserve future investigations.","output":"Allosteric modulation of NMDA receptors prevents the antibody effects of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CO2 emissions are one of the main causes of the global problem of climate change, the solution to which requires the efforts of every country.

There are growing reports of extrapulmonary clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in addition to the respiratory symptoms. COVID-19 has been associated with the thyroid function through Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the central mechanism through Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and direct replication of the virus. CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old woman presented with complaints of palpitation and abdominal pain for three days. Because the symptoms were worsening, she was brought to the emergency room. Her temperature was 37.9 C without any symptoms of cough, coryza, sneezing, nor headache. Physical examination revealed tremor, tachycardia with 162 beats per minute (bpm), excessive sweating, hyperreflexia of patellar reflex, and no prominent lump in the neck. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed supraventricular tachycardic rhythm (SVT) and 150 J cardioversions were performed. The ECG converted to sinus rhythm, regular, with 120 bpm. Thyroid function tests showed an elevated fT4 level (>7.77 ng/dL) and low TSH level (<0.005 IU/mL). Chest X-ray showed slight cardiomegaly without prominent abnormality in the lungs that was confirmed with thoracic computerized tomography. The result of the rapid antigen test for COVID-19 was positive and confirmed with polymerase chain reaction testing. She was then treated in the intensive isolation room with remdesivir, anti-hyperthyroid, and supportive therapy. As her condition improved, she was shifted to a non-intensive isolation room and was discharged from the hospital at day 7.

To overcome this shortage, we here present a case study of the first wave of the outbreak in the city of Buenos Aires, which had a slow evolution of the caseload extending along most of 2020. We found that humidity plays a prominent role in modulating the variation of COVID-19 positive cases through a negative-slope linear relationship, with an optimal lag of 9 days between the meteorological observation and the positive case report. This relationship is specific to winter months, when relative humidity predicts up to half of the variance in positive case count.

Literature has focused mainly on the effect of the pandemic on the supply chain or in its value chain but little has been said on the competitive strategies adopted to overcome the challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted on Italian companies operating in the agri-food industry from May to September 2020, following a mixed method approach. First, a focus group with experts in competitive strategy and agri-food industry has been organized to identify the most important challenges that companies are facing. Second, through a structured questionnaire, data from 123 companies operating in the agri-food industry were gathered and analyzed with K-means clustering method. Findings: Four clusters of companies were identified, each implementing different strategies to face the COVID-19 pandemic: the cost fanatics, the brand focused, the sales centered and the strategists. Furthermore, it was possible to identify new trends in competitive strategies to increase the added value that the Italian agri-food industry can provide to the customer. Originality/value: The paper answers to the need for an investigation of the competitive strategies that agri-food companies have put in place to face the COVID-19 pandemic;moreover, it provides insights on how companies are adapting themselves to this rapidly changing environment.

However, less is known about the impacts of giving and receiving acts of kindness with strangers on wellbeing and loneliness. Therefore, the study objectives were to evaluate a participatory public mental health project involving sending and receiving a card with goodwill messages, to understand how such acts of kindness influence wellbeing and loneliness, and to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the impacts of the project. Materials and methods: This study was a secondary analysis of anonymised service evaluation data collected in the Kindness by Post (KBP) project in 2020. It used a mixed-methods single-group design and data from 289 participants. Changes in wellbeing, loneliness, sense of belonging and hope from baseline to follow-up were analysed using linear or multinomial logistic regression. Regression models also examined the associations between changes in wellbeing and baseline loneliness or participation level. Free text responses about experiences and suggestions for the project were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants had a small, but statistically significant improvement, in wellbeing equating to 0.21 standard deviations (SD) (95% CI: 0.12 to 0.30) after taking part in the project, as well as improvements in loneliness, sense of belonging and hope. How lonely a participant was at baseline and whether participants both sent and received a kindness card were not associated with improvements in wellbeing. In the qualitative analysis, a desire to help others emerged as the main motivator to take part in the card exchange. Participants reported enhanced personal fulfilment, leading to improvements in wellbeing. Receiving a card could make people feel special and cherished, which was reported to establish a sense of connection with others, with potential benefits for reducing loneliness. Conclusions: This study provided preliminary evidence that the KBP project might improve wellbeing, loneliness, sense of belonging and hope. Sending a kindness card in this project played a predominant role in wellbeing enhancement, and receiving a kindness card could reduce loneliness. This study suggests that the KBP project can be replicated in more contexts in the future, and might improve wellbeing and loneliness in large communities.","output":"Kindness By Post: A Mixed-Methods Evaluation of A Participatory Public Mental Health Project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The potential virucidal effects of UV-C irradiation on SARS-CoV-2 were experimentally evaluated for different illumination doses and virus concentrations (1000, 5, 0.05 MOI).

OBJECTIVE: To determine if ARI symptoms are associated with more prolonged RTP, and if days to RTP and symptoms (number, type, duration and severity) differ in athletes with COVID-19 versus athletes with other ARI. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. SETTING: Online survey. PARTICIPANTS: Athletes with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 (ARI(COV)) (n=45) and athletes with other ARI (ARI(OTH)) (n=39). METHODS: Participants recorded days to RTP and completed an online survey detailing ARI symptoms (number, type, severity and duration) in three categories: nose and throat, chest and neck and whole body. We report the association between symptoms and RTP (% chance over 40 days) and compare the days to RTP and symptoms (number, type, duration and severity) in ARI(COV) versus ARI(OTH) subgroups. RESULTS: The symptom cluster associated with more prolonged RTP (lower chance over 40 days; %) (univariate analysis) was excessive fatigue (75%; p<0.0001), chills (65%; p=0.004), fever (64%; p=0.004), headache (56%; p=0.006), altered/loss sense of smell (51%; p=0.009), Chest pain/pressure (48%; p=0.033), difficulty in breathing (48%; p=0.022) and loss of appetite (47%; p=0.022).

We found that social media groups alleviate the atomization effect, as workers use these groups to obtain experiential knowledge from their peers, build connections, and organize collective action. However, we noted a reluctance among workers to share strategic information where there was a perceived risk of being competitively disadvantaged. In addition, we found that the diversity among gig workers has also led to limited empathy for one another, which further impedes the provision of emotional support.

The United Nations finds itself at the juncture of two concepts of justice: natural (heavenly/divine) and that created in cyberspace, recently through artificial intelligence. The right to justice sets the foundations for the entire system of human rights in the world. These rights have been and are being developed by the United Nations, most recently via the implementation of the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda. Justice fulfils and will increasingly play the role of a regulator of social development as the best fit for this function among the fundamental values of the human civilizationthe love, the good, the beauty, the truth and the justice. Owing to the United Nations position on the crossroads, the Organization may be ecumenical in its own terms. Yet sooner or later it will have to measure up to effects of human development geared towards artificial intelligence and cyberspaces (as there are more than one), which may result in the emergence of Homo deus. The eventual effect of such an approach may be the building of a global civilization with succeeding generations of hereditary intelligence driven by artificial intelligence. Understanding the importance of the creation (or sub-creation) of artificial intelligence and cyberspaces by humanity gives it legitimacy to shape these based on commensurate values (criteria): love, good, beauty, truth, and justice, as if they were divine.

Second, as there is science related to law, it may be opportune to pursue research and develop separate science related to this form of delivering justice, which I would call justology.

Context Chemotherapy induced neutropenia (CIN) poses serious harm to patients due to the heightened risk of severe infection. Accordingly, chemotherapy dose is assessed at the beginning of each cycle. The therapeutic window of chemotherapy is determined from population studies, with an individual's dose often scaled by their body surface area. This leads to a large number of patients being over- or under- dosed. We previously developed an application [1] which uses weekly neutrophil counts from the first cycle of docetaxel treatment to predict the level of neutropoenia in subsequent cycles for a given dose of docetaxel. However, in the original app the administration of G-CSF, used as a prophylactic treatment for neutropenia, was not considered. G-CSF administration lacks standardisation and the COVID-19 pandemic has created a highly risk averse environment to infections, raising the prospects that a clinician will administer G-CSF. MethodsAiming to predict the level of neutropenia after the first cycle we draw from models in the literature of CIN for G-CSF treated patients [2,3,4]. We adapt the G-CSF induced feedback effect on neutrophil development in these models to account for features specific to docetaxel patients;notably the rebound in neutrophils above baseline seen after nadir [5], and the apparent short maturation time of neutrophils [4]. Using data in the public domain from the comparator arm of a phase III clinical trial for metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer (clinical trial number NCT00617669), we identify 27 patients treated with docetaxel and G-CSF with weekly blood tests in the first and second cycle. We calibrate our model by minimising a Bayesian objective function to establish a model that predicts the neutrophil count in the second docetaxel cycle from the first. We then simulate the effect of different combinations of docetaxel, G-CSF, and the timing of G-CSF administration. Conclusions Current progress includes a model which captures the rebound above baseline in neutrophil count seen in docetaxel patients. We will show that our model captures the effect of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim on neutrophil counts, and can determine how a docetaxel patient may best benefit from G-CSF treatment and/or a change in dose of docetaxel.","output":"A precision dosing application for patients treated with docetaxel and G-CSF"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This short presentation will consider how rights and equity challenges may be addressed in responding to epidemic diseases","output":"Early evidence of the impact of legal responses to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The ATLAS program promotes and implements HIVST in C?te d'Ivoire, Mali, and Senegal.

HIVST distribution activities, which began in mid-2019, were impacted in early 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This article, focusing only on outreach activities among key populations, analyzes quantitative, and qualitative program data collected during implementation to examine temporal trends in HIVST distribution and their evolution in the context of the COVID-19 health crisis. Specifically, we investigated the impact on, the adaptation of and the disruption of field activities. Results: In all three countries, the pre-COVID-19 period was marked by a gradual increase in HIVST distribution. The period corresponding to the initial emergency response (March-May 2020) witnessed an important disruption of activities: a total suspension in Senegal, a significant decline in C?te d'Ivoire, and a less pronounced decrease in Mali. Secondary distribution was also negatively impacted. Peer educators showed resilience and adapted by relocating from public to private areas, reducing group sizes, moving night activities to the daytime, increasing the use of social networks, integrating hygiene measures, and promoting assisted HIVST as an alternative to conventional rapid testing. From June 2020 onward, with the routine management of the COVID-19 pandemic, a catch-up phenomenon was observed with the resumption of activities in Senegal, the opening of new distribution sites, a rebound in the number of distributed HIVST kits, a resurgence in larger group activities, and a rebound in the average number of distributed HIVST kits per primary contact. Conclusions: Although imperfect, the program data provide useful information to describe changes in the implementation of HIVST outreach activities over time. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIVST distribution among key populations was visible in the monthly activity reports.

Moreover, LPS increased both calpain and caspase-3 activity, and only the expression of iNOS in PMECs was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of p38 and JNK. Inhibiting calpain activity or p38 phosphorylation alleviated the increased iNOS expression, NO/ROS production, and cellular apoptosis induced by LPS.

Since the nodes in UWSNs are restricted to inbuilt batteries, the effective utilization of available energy becomes essential. Clustering and routing approaches can be employed as energy-efficient solutions for UWSNs. However, the cluster-based routing techniques developed for conventional wireless networks cannot be employed for a UWSN because of the low bandwidth, spread stay, underwater current, and error probability. To resolve these issues, this article introduces a novel chaotic search-and-rescue-optimization-based multi-hop data transmission (CSRO-MHDT) protocol for UWSNs. When using the CSRO-MHDT technique, cluster headers (CHs) are selected and clusters are prearranged, rendering a range of features, including remaining energy, intracluster distance, and intercluster detachment. Additionally, the chaotic search and rescue optimization (CSRO) algorithm is discussed, which is created by incorporating chaotic notions into the classic search and rescue optimization (SRO) algorithm. In addition, the CSRO-MHDT approach calculates a fitness function that takes residual energy, distance, and node degree into account, among other factors. A distinctive aspect of the paper is demonstrated by the development of the CSRO algorithm for route optimization, which was developed in-house. To validate the success of the CSRO-MHDT method, a sequence of tests were carried out, and the results showed the CSRO-MHDT method to have a packet delivery ratio (PDR) of 88%, whereas the energy-efficient clustering routing protocol (EECRP), the fuzzy C-means and mothCflame optimization (FCMMFO), the fuzzy scheme and particle swarm optimization (FBCPSO), the energy-efficient grid routing based on 3D cubes (EGRC), and the low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy based on expected residual energy (LEACH-ERE) methods have reached lesser PDRs of 83%, 81%, 78%, 77%, and 75%, respectively, for 1000 rounds. The CSRO-MHDT technique resulted in higher values of number of packets received (NPR) under all rounds. For instance, with 50 rounds, the CSRO-MHDT technique attained a higher NPR of 3792%.","output":"Chaotic Search-and-Rescue-Optimization-Based Multi-Hop Data Transmission Protocol for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A simple and well known epidemiological deterministic model was selected to estimate the main results for the basic dynamics of the Covid-19 epidemic breakout in the city of S.

This study analyses the changes in FA and related behaviour in India in the wake of lockdown which started on 25th March 2020 as a response to the COVID-19 outbreak. This paper provides insight into the food consumption behavior of various segments of the population during this lockdown. It offers some new insights in this regard by establishing the relationship between a temporary pause in the consumption of palatable food and FA. This study was conducted between March and May 2020 in two stages. First, a quantitative study used the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) to identify food addicts from a sample of 150 respondents. In the second stage, in-depth telephone interviews were conducted with the food addicts;the responses were recorded, transcribed, and analysed to ascertain the changes in their overall consumption and addiction behavior towards palatable foods. This was done by conducting a thematic analysis with the help of the NVivo software where various tools like word cloud and cluster analysis were used. This study found that COVID-19 restrictions had significantly brought down the addiction to palatable food in India as the regular consumption chain had got broken during the lockdown. The consumption of palatable food is expected to remain low for a brief period after the lockdown due to hygiene issues like improper or lack of sanitization and cleanliness. However, in the long-run, the consumption of palatable food is expected to rise in India owing to its growing population, modernisation, increasing disposable income and changes in customer preferences. These findings have significant implications for the food, packaging and health industries as the changes in customer behavior will certainly impact them, and they need to duly change their strategy to adapt to the changes promptly.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on food addiction in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: While discussions on the effectiveness of COVID\\\\19 vaccines continue, healthcare professionals' attitudes and their growing fear and anxiety during the pandemic process are not yet fully known. In this study, we aimed to investigate the COVID\\\\19 vaccine acceptance and affecting factors in healthcare professionals. METHODS: This was a cross\\\\sectional online survey conducted in 1574 healthcare professionals consisting of physicians, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, and healthcare personnel in Turkey in December 2020. Demographic, attitudinal, and Fear of COVID\\\\19 Scale scores of healthcare professionals were investigated in this survey. RESULTS: About 84.6% of healthcare professionals declared willingness to accept the COVID\\\\19 vaccine whenever possible. Most physicians (90.4%) stated to receive the COVID\\\\19 vaccine, while 66.5% of nurses, 73.9% of healthcare personnel, also preferred to have it as soon as the vaccine was available. Factors affecting the willingness to accept the COVID\\\\19 vaccine were found to be advanced age, male gender, working in a primary health care center, living with family, having a child, having a chronic disease, having high Fear of COVID\\\\19 Scale (FC\\\\19S) scores. While the group with the highest vaccine rejection rate was nurses with 33.5%, FC\\\\19S scores were significantly higher in nurses who wanted to be vaccinated. In multivariate regression analyses, factors related to the acceptance of the COVID\\\\19 vaccine were identified as advanced age, routine adult vaccination, no history of COVID\\\\19, and recommendation of the COVID\\\\19 vaccine. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of healthcare professionals declared their willingness to accept the COVID\\\\19 vaccine, and hence, this will play a leading role in optimizing the vaccination rate of the entire population while combating the pandemic.","output":"The willingness to accept the COVID\\\\19 vaccine and affecting factors among healthcare professionals: A cross\\\\sectional study in Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionSince the declaration of the national lockdown in Spain on March 14th until the publication of the SEPB recommendations on May 11th, most of the ECT-U closed or drastically reduced their activity.ObjectivesTo present our non-stop management of an ECT-U during the first two months of COVID-19 lockdown in Spain.MethodsWe retrospectively analysed the time between sessions, the clinical, pharmacological and electrical data records of maintenance patients (m-ECT) and compared them with their own records in the two-month period prior to COVID-19.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: It was developed and used the authors' questionnaire \\"Socio-psychological support during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine\\". Data processing used Nonparametric Mann-Whitney analysis of variance and one-way Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (SPSS 26.0). RESULTS Results: The study was conducted from October 2020 to May 2021 and sampled 100 individuals. Significant differences in the studied features are revealed. Gender: women have a more prosperous and broader range of contacts to discuss fears and anxieties during quarantine; suffer more from emotional loss; have more need to be heard and to be taken care of, with no criticism; are more experienced in professional psychological help obtaining; communicate with internal migrants more often. Age: young respondents (19-24 y.o.) suffer more from pandemic losses in the areas of spirituality and friendship; however, more often and more effectively use the means of online psychological support; older respondents are more likely to receive support from an important community and through meditation. Living conditions: living alone, citizens experience more pandemic stress, suffer from losses in personal life and friendship, and consider participation in challenge activities as the most convenient form of support. Place of residence: living in the rural areas is associated with a narrow circle of citizens' contacts to discuss their plans for leisure; more significant damage from pandemic losses in health; lack of support in the form of understanding themselves and their conditions. Education: higher education affects a broader circle of communication; more minor financial losses; willingness to share traumatic stories for art therapy. Financial satisfaction promotes the exchange of ideas between users of online psychological support. CONCLUSION Conclusions: The identified conditionality of psychosocial support obtaining by socio-demographic indicators can be used in the development of psychosocial support interventions during a pandemic for Ukrainian citizens by the public and private sectors, particularly in creating specialized smartphone applications, adapting playback theatre in the online space, creating gender-sensitive online programs to integrate IDPs into local communities.","output":"CITIZENS OBTAINING PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN UKRAINE: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last decade, banking sector stability has received much attention as Basel III implementations take shape in response to the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. Since said crisis, regulators have increased banking sector regulation and supervision in an effort to increase banking sector resilience and avert potential future crises. Notwithstanding the importance of these regulatory and supervisory enhancements, we consider the potential threat of a banking crisis and investigate the ability of important banking stability parameters to provide economic growth resilience. We perform a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation methodology on a global panel dataset of 140 countries, across the period 1995C2017, to determine the effect of banking sector stability, banking sector regulatory capital, and banking sector liquidity, on the relationship between banking crises and GDP growth. Our results indicate that a more stable banking sector reduces the negative effect of a banking crisis on GDP growth, hence providing economic resilience during said crisis periods. This effect is experienced by developed and developing economies. However, asymmetries are observed for banking sector liquidity and banking sector regulatory capital across high-income and middle-income economies. Liquidity provides resilience for economic growth, but the effect is only apparent for high-income countries. Regulatory capital provides growth resilience, but this effect is not apparent for high-income economies. We argue that while overall banking stability is critical, regulators and other policymakers must account for the differences in the relevant characteristics of their market structures when designing effective strategies in order to maximize the effectiveness of said policies.","output":"Banking sector distress and economic growth resilience: Asymmetric effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The immune system of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 is severely impaired.

Cerebrospinal fluid was evaluated for concentrations of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and total protein. Anti-coronavirus IgG was measured in CSF and serum by indirect immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS CSF IgG (range of titers, 1:32 to 1:4,096) was detected in 12 cats, including 6 cats with neurologic manifestation of FIP, 4 cats with FIP not involving the CNS, and 2 cats with brain tumors.

There have since been two more. Lockdown control measures meant both racehorse trainers and veterinary surgeons (vets) had to make changes to the way they worked. Beneficial practices which aided veterinary care have been reported anecdotally, as has an increase in the use of electronic communication and information technologies. The aim of this study was to investigate if these claims could be supported by exploring any changes to racehorse veterinary care that occurred due to the implementation of the first COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. Data collection involved carrying out ten semistructured interviews with racehorse trainers and ten equine vets from November 2020 to January 2021. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to try and make sense of how vets and trainers interacted with each other before and during a period of rapid change and how both groups found alternative ways to ensure beneficial veterinary care was not compromised. Data Analysis revealed four themes threading through the data. These were, firstly, the trainerCvet relationship is built upon a good working relationship, secondly, there had been little or no change in the vetCtrainer relationship during the first lockdown period. Thirdly, when COVID-19 restrictions were in force, more remote consultations took place using images or videos as well as telephone consults, and the fourth and final theme identified the way connectivity and poor-quality images and videos limited their effectiveness. ABSTRACT: In March 2020, the World Health Organisation called for countries to take urgent and aggressive action against a global pandemic caused by COVID-19. Restrictions were introduced in many countries to reduce transmission of COVID-19 and ultimately deaths. Such restrictions have been colloquially referred to as lockdown. Anecdotal evidence of the beneficial practices that facilitated safe veterinary treatment and equine care had been reported together with an increase in the use of electronic communication and information technologies during the first lockdown. Thus, the aim of this qualitative study was to capture any beneficial changes to racehorse veterinary care that were implemented during the first lockdown period in the UK that lasted from 23 March to 12 May 2020. Ten equine veterinary surgeons who primarily treat racehorses and 10 racehorse trainers were interviewed either by telephone or by videoconferencing. After using thematic analysis from a critical realist social constructionist perspective, four themes were identified. These were, firstly, according to our participants, the trainerCvet relationship is predicated upon a good working relationship, secondly, there had been little or no change in the vetCtrainer relationship during the first lockdown period. Thirdly, when COVID-19 restrictions were in force, more remote consultations took place using images or videos as well as telephone consults, viewed favourably by both trainers and vets, and finally, intermittent connectivity and poor-quality images and videos limited their effectiveness. In order to fully benefit from the positive changes employed by some vets and trainers in their working relationships, we recommend that rural connectivity is prioritised.","output":"Capturing Beneficial Changes to Racehorse Veterinary Care Implemented during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lemierre's syndrome is a rare disease that generally occurs in young, healthy individuals, where an index of suspicion for something so serious is often low.

(5) How do falls in older patients affect subsequent cancer treatment? and a new research question, (6) Which fall reduction interventions are efficacious in this population? METHODS MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase were searched (September 2015-January 25, 2019). Eligible studies included clinical trials and cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies published in English in which the sample (or subgroup) included adults aged  60, with cancer, in whom falls were examined as an outcome. RESULTS A total of 2521 titles were reviewed, 67 full-text articles were screened for eligibility, and 30 new studies were identified. The majority involved the outpatient setting (n = 19) utilizing cross-sectional method (n = 18). Sample size ranged from 21 to 17,958. Fall rates ranged from 1.52 to 3.41% per 1000 patient days (inpatient setting) and from 39%/24 months to 64%/12 months (outpatient setting).

This infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily via respiratory droplets during close person-to-person contact in a closed space, especially a building. This article summarizes the environmental factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including a strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a building environment. SARS-CoV-2 can persist on surfaces of fomites for at least 3 days depending on the conditions. If SARS-CoV-2 is aerosolized intentionally, it is stable for at least several hours. SARS-CoV-2 is inactivated rapidly on surfaces with sunlight. Close-contact aerosol transmission through smaller aerosolized particles is likely to be combined with respiratory droplets and contact transmission in a confined, crowded, and poorly ventilated indoor environment, as suggested by some cluster cases. Although evidence of the effect of aerosol transmission is limited and uncertainty remains, adequate preventive measures to control indoor environmental quality are required, based on a precautionary approach, because COVID-19 has caused serious global damages to public health, community, and the social economy.

To quantitatively evaluate its performance, this paper explores air curtains equipped on normal consulting desk to avoid doctors direct exposure to the patient exhaled pollutants. A numerical investigation is conducted to evaluate the effects of supply air velocity and angle on cutting off performance. Simulation results show that the average mass fraction of exhaled pollutants decreases significantly (70%C90%) in the consulting ward, indicating satisfying performance of air curtains. Increasing supply air velocity is demonstrated to be conducive in forming full air curtains, whereas an excessively high supply air velocity may be of adverse effects by entraining exhaled flow. Besides, the supply air angle is also critical due to its coupling with supply air velocity. It is found that larger angle (0C40) is better where velocity is less than 3 m/s, otherwise a small angle (20) is preferable where velocity is larger than 3 m/s. Exhaled flow could be well suppressed at the supply air angle 20 but moves over air curtains at 40. This study can provide effective and intuitive guidance in applying air curtains in consulting wards.

This behavioral response has increased loneliness. Loneliness not only increases the risk of psychiatric disorders, but also affects occupational mental health. To avoid the negative effects of isolation, it is important to have social contact with other people, especially family members. Employment and economic instability caused by COVID-19 may have also affected family relationships. It is important to understand the association between family relationships and loneliness in workers under the pandemic. Methods: We collected usable data from 27,036 Japanese workers who completed an online survey during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were asked how long they spend with members of their family during mealtimes or at home, and if they experienced loneliness; the latter was assessed by a single question. Other questions included whether participants lived with their spouse, or with someone in need of care. To estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of time with family associated with loneliness we used a multilevel logistic model nested in the prefecture of residence, with adjustments for age, sex, marital status, presence of a cohabitant requiring care, equivalent income, educational level, frequency of remote work, availability of someone for casual chat, smoking, drinking, time for leisure interests, and cumulative rates of COVID-19 in the prefecture. Results: Ten percent (2,750) of the 27,036 participants reported loneliness. The survey showed a significant negative correlation between time spent with family and loneliness (p<0.001): participants who spent more time with family were less likely to feel loneliness. In addition, not living with a spouse and living with someone in need of care were associated with loneliness (not living with a spouse: p<0.001; living with someone in need of care: p<0.001). Conclusion: Loneliness under COVID-19 pandemic conditions was negatively associated with time spent with family members, with the converse result found for participants cohabiting with someone in need of care. These associations suggest the potential value of changes to working practices and interventions to combat loneliness.","output":"Association between time spent with family and loneliness among Japanese workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The tragedy of COVID in 2020 has highlighted excess death rates, but standard rates for different age groups must be understood before reliable excess rates can be calculated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS In this retrospective study, 56 hepatic tumours in 48 patients (23 men, 25 women; mean age: 59.6 years) were treated using a new high-frequency MWA-system with ECSEC. Parameters evaluated were technical success, technical efficacy, tumour diameter, tumour and ablation volume, complication rate, 90-day mortality, local tumour progression (LTP) at the 12-month follow-up, ablative margin and ablation zone sphericity. These parameters were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test with the same parameters collected retrospectively from cohorts of patients treated with conventional high-frequency (HF) MWA (n = 20) or low-frequency (LF) MWA (n = 20). RESULTS Technical success was achieved in all interventions. The technical efficacy was 100% (ECSEC) vs. 100% (LF-MWA) vs. 95% (HF-MWA). There were no intra-procedural deaths or major complications. Minor complications occurred in 3.57% (2/56), 0% (0/20) and 0% (0/20) of the patients, respectively. The one-year mortality rate was 16.1% (9/56), 15% (3/20) and 10% (2/20), respectively. The LTP was 3.57% (2/56), 5% (1/20) and 5% (1/20), respectively. The median deviation from ideal sphericity (1.0) was 0.135 (ECSEC) vs. 0.344 (LF-MWA) vs. 0.314 (HF-MWA) (p < 0.001). The absolute minimal ablative margin was 8.1 vs. 2.3 vs. 3.1 mm (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Microwave ablation of liver malignancies is a safe and efficient treatment independent of the system used.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of publicly available data among a Mexican population, totaling 2,314,022 adults  18 years who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing between March 1 and December 20, 2020. We used 1:1 nearest neighborhood propensity score matching by diabetes status to account for confounding among those with and without diabetes. RESULTS: In the overall study population, 1,057,779 (45.7%) individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 270,486 (11.7%) self-reported diabetes. After propensity score matching, patient characteristics were well-balanced, with 150,487 patients in the diabetes group (mean [SD] age 55.9 [12.7] years; 51.3% women) and 150,487 patients in the no diabetes group (55.5 [13.3] years; 50.3% women).

Achieving more sustainable agricultural production systems will require significant additional capital, however this cannot be covered by the current financial market setup, which dissociates public and private funders. Blended finance, where concessionary development-oriented funding is used to mobilize additional private capital, is essential. To ensure that the limited pool of concessionary funding is used efficiently and effectively, a shared understanding of the roles and limitations of public and private funders is necessary. In this paper, we describe the high-level funding gap for sustainable agriculture, the general landscape of agricultural finance, and the concept and potential roles of blended finance in this context.

It highlights that multiple funding modalities must be utilized in order to achieve agricultural investment at a meaningful level and encourages greater exploration of the range of blended financing structures to increase SDG-related agriculture investments.","output":"Blended finance for agriculture: exploring the constraints and possibilities of combining financial instruments for sustainable transitions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of many. Particularly, nursing students experience greater stress as their normal curriculum is interrupted and some of them face the risk of being infected as frontline workers. Nursing faculty members may face similar struggles, in addition to developing teaching materials for online learning. Thus, it is important to examine the faculty members' and students' views on their ability to adapt during the pandemic to obtain a holistic view of how learning and training has been affected. Design The descriptive cross-sectional quantitative design was used. Settings Data were collected from Southeast and East Asian Nursing Education and Research Network (SEANERN) affiliated nursing institutions from January 2021 to August 2021. Participants A total of 1897 nursing students and 395 faculty members from SEANERN-affiliated nursing institutions in Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam were recruited for this study. Methods Quantitative surveys were used to explore the satisfaction levels in education modalities, confidence levels, psychosocial well-being, sense of coherence and stress levels of nursing students and faculty members during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Participants were mostly satisfied with the new education modalities, although most students felt that their education was compromised. Both groups showed positive levels of psychosocial well-being, despite scoring low to medium on the sense of coherence scale and experiencing great stress. The participants' sense of coherence was positively correlated with their psychosocial well-being and negatively correlated with stress levels. Conclusions While the COVID-19 pandemic had negatively impacted the lives of nursing students and faculty members, most of them had a healthy level of psychosocial well-being. Having a strong sense of coherence was associated with better psychosocial health and lower stress levels. As such, it may be helpful to develop interventions aimed at improving the sense of coherence of nursing students and staff to help them manage stressors better.","output":"Salutogenesis and COVID-19 pandemic impacting nursing education across SEANERN affiliated universities: A multi-national study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The potential of computational models to identify new therapeutics and repurpose existing drugs has gained significance in recent times.

This review focuses on in-silico modeling of the potential therapeutic candidates against SARS CoVs, in addition to strategies for vaccine design. Here, we particularly focus on the recently published SARS CoV main protease (Mpro) active site, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS CoV2, and the spike S-protein as potential targets for vaccine development.

Disparities in social and structural determinants of health disproportionately affect those experiencing incarceration, making them more vulnerable to COVID-19. Additionally, prisons are sites of congregate living, making it impossible to practice social distancing, and most prisons have relied only on incremental measures to reduce risk and spread of COVID-19. To more fully understand the impact that COVID-19 is having on incarcerated populations, it is critical to have systematic data on testing, test positivity, cases, and case fatality. Using data from the COVID Prison Project, we present data on 53 prison systems COVID-19 testing, test positivity, case, and case fatality by state and compare these data with each state's general population. We do this for the early stages of the pandemic, utilizing data through July 15, 2020. RESULTS: Many states are not reporting full information on COVID testing with some also not reporting on case fatality. Among those reporting data, there is a wide variation between testing, test positivity, and case rates within prison systems and as compared to the general population. However, when more tests are deployed more cases are identified with the majority of state prisons having higher case rates than their general population. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the need for the implementation and study of COVID-19 mitigation and surveillance strategies to flatten the COVID-19 curve in prisons across the country.

Since the German healthcare system almost exclusively relies on this profession when it comes to the implementation of CBT and 80% of those therapists active in 2010 will have retired at the end of 2030, it is critical to assess whether online CBT training is as satisfactory as classroom on-site CBT training. An asynchronous, blended, inverted-classroom online learning environment for CBT training (CBT for psychosis) was developed as an emergency solution. It consisted of pre-recorded CBT video lectures, exercises to train interventions in online role-plays, and regular web conferences. Training was provided at five different training institutes in Germany (duration 8C16 h). Postgraduate health care professionals (psychiatrists and psychologists) (n = 43) who received the online CBT training filled out standard self-report evaluations that assessed satisfaction and didactic quality. These evaluations were compared to those evaluations of students (n = 142) who had received in-person CBT training with identical content offered by the same CBT trainer at the same training institutes before the COVID-19 crisis. Both groups were comparable with respect to interest in the subject and prior knowledge. We tested non-inferiority hypotheses using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney ROC-curve analyses with an equivalence margin corresponding to a small-to-medium effect size (d = 0.35). The online training evaluations were non-inferior concerning information content, conception of content, didactic presentation, assessment of the trainer as a suitable role-model, working atmosphere, own commitment, and practical relevance. In contrast, we could not exclude a small effect in favor of in-person training in professional benefit and room for active participation. Our results suggest that delivering substantial CBT knowledge online to postgraduate health-professionals is sufficient, and at most incurs minimal loss to the learning experience. These encouraging findings indicate that integrating online elements in CBT teaching is an acceptable option even beyond social distancing requirements.","output":"Teaching Cognitive Behavior Therapy to Postgraduate Health Care Professionals in Times of COVID 19 C An Asynchronous Blended Learning Environment Proved to Be Non-inferior to In-Person Training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An immunoinformatics technique was used to predict a monovalent amide immunogen candidate capable of producing therapeutic antibodies as well as a potent immunogen candidate capable of acting as a universal vaccination against all dengue fever virus serotypes.

A more severe course is seen in the elderly, those with various chronic diseases, and the immunosuppressed, where the case fatality rate is higher in these risk groups. The disease progresses with various symptoms, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, malaise, myalgia, taste and smell disorders, diarrhea, sore throat, headache, and conjunctivitis. The disease begins with shortness of breath, indicative of lung damage, after an average of 7 to 10 days, and progresses in ARDS, sepsis, and septic shock. Some patients quickly enter shortness of breath, while others gradually develop shortness of breath and chest tightness and burning. The risk factors for a poor prognosis are age, comorbidities, and changes in laboratory tests. Secondary bacterial and fungal infections frequently develop with steroids and immunosuppressants, especially in the intensive care unit.

Recent reports have shown a decline in hospitalization for emergency cardiac conditions. The impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on hospitalization and particularly mortality due to acute heart failure has not been thoroughly described. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this single\\\\centre observational study, we examined referrals to the acute heart failure team over a period of 16 weeks (7 January to 27 April 2020) spanning the ongoing COVID\\\\19 pandemic; 283 patients referred to our acute heart failure services over the study period were included on the basis of typical symptoms, raised BNP, and echocardiogram. There was a substantial but statistically non\\\\significant drop in referrals with 164 referred in the 8 weeks before the first UK death due to COVID\\\\19 on 2 March 2020 (BC), compared with 119 referred after (AC) in the subsequent 8 weeks, representing a 27% reduction overall (P = 0.06). The 30 day case fatality rate was increased from 11% in the BC group compared with 21% in the AC group (risk ratio = 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.09C3.3). Age, gender, length of stay, left ventricular ejection fraction, and N\\\\terminal pro\\\\brain natriuretic peptide were similar between the groups. Admission creatinine, age, and AC cohort status were found to be univariable predictors of mortality. On multivariate Cox regression analysis, only age (hazard ratio 1.04, P = 0.03) and AC cohort status (hazard ratio 2.1, P = 0.017) remained significant predictors of mortality.

In broader terms, it is a serious humanitarian crisis that has cost millions of human lives, truncated by contagion of the virus, as well as losses of production and employment that have also resulted in deterioration of the conditions of material well-being of vast segments of the world population (especially in terms of health, education and nutrition) and, therefore, in strong setbacks in poverty and income distribution. In this gloomy world scene, Latin America has turned out to be one of the regions most affected by the pandemic, a situation that is not accidental within the framework of the internal and external asymmetries that configure its dysfunctional style of development, a pattern that the structuralist and neo-structuralist literatures have been described in numerous writings in which the socioeconomic and environmental dynamics of the region are analyzed in different historical stages.","output":"Presentacin.

Here, we report long-term demographic data from two East African chimpanzee groups. During a combined 40-year observation period we recorded 191 births of which 68 died in infancy, mostly within the first year. We documented the post-mortem behaviour of the mothers and found that Budongo chimpanzee mothers carried infants after their death on nine occasions, usually until the body started to decompose after a few days. However, we also observed three cases of extended carrying lasting for more than two weeks, one of which was followed by the unusual extended carrying of an object and another which lasted three months. In each case, the corpses mummified. In addition, we report four instances of recurring dead infant carrying by mothers, three of whom carried the corpse for longer during the second instance. We discuss these observations in view of functional hypotheses of dead infant carrying in primates and the potential proximate mechanisms involved in this behaviour.","output":"Dead infant carrying by chimpanzee mothers in the Budongo Forest"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidermal adult stem cells (EpiASCs) have the potential for unlimited proliferation and differentiation, however, the ability of these stem cells to activate corneal genetic programs in response to corneal stroma stimulation needs to be further validated. Herein, a feasible strategy was developed to reconstruct the damaged corneal surface in a goat model with total limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) by transplanting EpiASCs, which had been explanted and cultured from the skin of an adult ram goat and were then purified by selecting single cell-derived clones and cultivating them on a denuded human amniotic membrane (HAM). These artificial tissues were then successfully transplanted into ewe goats with total LSCD. Binding of EpiASCs to the base membrane of an EpiASCs-HAM-Sheet (EHS) indicated their proliferating status. After transplantation, the EpiASCs could survive in the host tissue and they reconstructed the damaged ocular surface of total LSCD. The crystal reconstructed corneal epithelium expressed CK3 and Pax-6 similar to normal corneal epithelium and expressed the Sry gene after transplantation. These results demonstrated that EpiASCs could be induced to differentiate into corneal epithelial cell types in a corneal microenvironment and had the ability to activate corneal genetic programs.

Yet, a formal analysis of how the medical literature has changed during the pandemic is lacking. In this analysis, we aimed to quantify how scientific publications changed at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional bibliometric study of published studies in four high-impact medical journals to identify differences in the characteristics of COVID-19 related publications compared to non-pandemic studies. Original investigations related to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 published in March and April 2020 were identified and compared to non-COVID-19 research publications over the same two-month period in 2019 and 2020. Extracted data included publication characteristics, study characteristics, author characteristics, and impact metrics. Our primary measure was principal component analysis (PCA) of publication characteristics and impact metrics across groups. RESULTS: We identified 402 publications that met inclusion criteria: 76 were related to COVID-19; 154 and 172 were non-COVID publications over the same period in 2020 and 2019, respectively. PCA utilizing the collected bibliometric data revealed segregation of the COVID-19 literature subset from both groups of non-COVID literature (2019 and 2020). COVID-19 publications were more likely to describe prospective observational (31.6%) or case series (41.8%) studies without industry funding as compared with non-COVID articles, which were represented primarily by randomized controlled trials (32.5% and 36.6% in the non-COVID literature from 2020 and 2019, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study of publications in four general medical journals, COVID-related articles were significantly different from non-COVID articles based on article characteristics and impact metrics. COVID-related studies were generally shorter articles reporting observational studies with less literature cited and fewer study sites, suggestive of more limited scientific support.

However, current COVID-19 vaccination trials are not adequately representing a diverse participant population in terms of age, ethnicity and comorbidities. Achieving the representative recruitment targets that are adequately powered to the study remains one of the greatest challenges in clinical trial management. To ensure accuracy and generalizability of the safety and efficacy conclusions generated by clinical trials, it is crucial to recruit patient cohorts as representative as possible of the future target population. Missing these targets can lead to reduced validity of the study results, and can often slow down drug development leading to costly delays. This study explores the key factors related to perceptions and participation in vaccination trials. Methods: This study involved an anonymous cross-sectional online survey circulated across the UK. Statistical analysis was done in six phases. Multi-nominal logistic models examined demographic and geographic factors that may impact vaccine uptake. Results: The survey had 4884 participants of which 944% were BAME (Black Asian Minority Ethnic). Overall 2020 (41.4%) respondents were interested in participating in vaccine trials;27.6% of the respondents were not interested and 31.1.% were unsure. The most interested groups were male (OR=1.290), graduates (OR=1.277), the 40-49 and 50-59 age group (OR=1.880 and OR=1.460 respectively) and those with no health issues (OR=1.064). The least interested groups were BAME (OR=0.427), those from villages and small towns (OR=0.66 and 0.54 respectively), and those aged 70 and above (OR=1.11). Conclusions: : In order to have a vaccination that is generalizable to the entire population, greater work needs to be done in engaging a diverse cohort of participants. Public health campaigns need to be targeted in improving trial recruitment rates for the elderly, BAME community and the less educated rural population.","output":"The UPTAKE study: Implications for the future of COVID-19 vaccination trial recruitment in UK and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present data about the experiences of adults with learning disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic across the UK.

The data were collected between December 2020 and February 2021 and concerned both worries/negatives and anything positive that had happened because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings Social isolation was the most commonly reported worry/negative for adults with learning disabilities, with other frequently reported worries/negatives including: changes to/loss of routine;loss of support/services;and decreased health/well-being/fitness. A large proportion of participants indicated that nothing positive had happened because of COVID-19, but some positives were reported, including: digital inclusion;more time spent with important people;improved health/well-being/fitness;and, a slower pace of life.

The rapid outbreak of this disease has overwhelmed health care infrastructures and arises the need to allocate medical equipment and resources more efficiently. The early diagnosis of this disease will lead to the rapid separation of COVID-19 and non-COVID cases, which will be helpful for health care authorities to optimize resource allocation plans and early prevention of the disease. In this regard, a growing number of studies are investigating the capability of deep learning for early diagnosis of COVID-19. Computed tomography (CT) scans have shown distinctive features and higher sensitivity compared to other diagnostic tests, in particular the current gold standard, i.e., the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Current deep learning-based algorithms are mainly developed based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify COVID-19 pneumonia cases. CNNs, however, require extensive data augmentation and large datasets to identify detailed spatial relations between image instances. Furthermore, existing algorithms utilizing CT scans, either extend slice-level predictions to patient-level ones using a simple thresholding mechanism or rely on a sophisticated infection segmentation to identify the disease. In this paper, we propose a two-stage fully automated CT-based framework for identification of COVID-19 positive cases referred to as the \\"COVID-FACT\\". COVID-FACT utilizes Capsule Networks, as its main building blocks and is, therefore, capable of capturing spatial information. In particular, to make the proposed COVID-FACT independent from sophisticated segmentations of the area of infection, slices demonstrating infection are detected at the first stage and the second stage is responsible for classifying patients into COVID and non-COVID cases. COVID-FACT detects slices with infection, and identifies positive COVID-19 cases using an in-house CT scan dataset, containing COVID-19, community acquired pneumonia, and normal cases. Based on our experiments, COVID-FACT achieves an accuracy of 90.82 % , a sensitivity of 94.55 % , a specificity of 86.04 % , and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, while depending on far less supervision and annotation, in comparison to its counterparts.","output":"COVID-FACT: A Fully-Automated Capsule Network-Based Framework for Identification of COVID-19 Cases from Chest CT Scans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY OBJECTIVES The 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has become a global health and economic crisis.

Methods We screened the electronic health record for adverse events, classified by the Brighton Collaboration, occurring within 15 days of residents first COVID-19 vaccine dose. All events were confirmed by physician chart review. To obtain risk ratios, multilevel logistic regression model that accounted for clustering (variability) across nursing homes was implemented. To balance the probability of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (previous positive test or ICD-10-CM diagnosis) more than 20 days prior to vaccination, we used inverse probability weighting. To adjust for multiplicity of adverse events tested, we used a false discovery rate procedure. Results Statistically significant differences existed between those without (n=13,163) and with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (symptomatic (n=5,617) and asymptomatic (n=2,138)) for all baseline characteristics assessed. Only one adverse event was reported among those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (asymptomatic), venous thromboembolism (46.8 per 100,000 residents 95%CI 8.3, 264.5) which was not significantly different from the rate reported for those without previous infection (30.4 per 100,000 95%CI: 11.8, 78.1).

DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study using a purposive sampling approach, at a private tertiary care teaching hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. Study data were analysed manually using the conventional content analysis technique. PARTICIPANTS: Key-informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted with senior management and hospital leadership and in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with front-line healthcare providers. RESULTS: A total of 31 interviews (KIIs=19; IDIs=12) were conducted, between April and May 2020. Three overarching themes emerged. The first was challenges faced by front-line healthcare providers working in COVID-19 wards. Healthcare workers experienced increased anxiety due to the fear of acquiring infection and transmitting it to their family members. They felt overwhelmed due to the exhaustive donning and doffing process, intense work and stigmatisation. The second theme was enablers supporting healthcare providers to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Front liners pointed out several enabling factors that supported hospital staff including a safe hospital environment, adequate training, a strong system of information sharing and supportive management. The third theme was recommendations to support the healthcare workforce during the COVID-19 crisis. Healthcare workers recommended measures to mitigate current challenges including providing risk allowance to front-line healthcare providers, preparing a backup health workforce, and establishing a platform to address the mental health needs of the healthcare providers.

Traditional surgery for the treatment of cervical radiculopathy includes anterior cervical decompression surgery, anterior cervical decompression plus fusion surgery, and posterior limited fenestration surgery. This article mainly studies the treatment of cervical spondylosis caused by radiculopathy caused by the nucleus resection of the posterior cervical spine percutaneous spinal endoscopy based on deep learning. In the PPECD group, the height of the intervertebral cavity was measured before the operation and during the final follow-up, and the height change of the intervertebral cavity was evaluated. The relative angle and relative displacement of the sagittal plane of the operation segment in the PPECD group were measured, and the stability was evaluated. Using the cervical spine X-ray Kelvin degeneration evaluation criteria, before and during the final follow-up operation, the degeneration of the adjacent segments of the two groups was evaluated. A retrospective analysis of 26 cases of cervical radiculopathy that met the criteria for diagnosis, inclusion, and exclusion was reviewed. Among them, 11 cases were treated with PPECD surgery; 15 cases were treated with ACDF surgery. According to the evaluation method of Odom, the excellent rate and the good rate of the two groups were compared. According to the location of the lesion, the nerve detection or dull tip device is exposed under the armpit or shoulder of the nerve root, and the protruding nucleus pulposus tissue is explored and removed, and annulus fibrosus is performed as needed. After hemostasis was detected, the surgical instruments were removed and the surgical incision was completely sutured. Before the operation and 3 months after the operation, the final follow-up made no significant difference in the overall average height of the intervertebral cavity (F = 2.586, P > 0.05). The results show that posterior foramen expansion is an effective surgical method for the treatment of cervical spondylotic radiculopathy, but surgical adaptation requires strict management. In order to achieve satisfactory results, appropriate cases must be selected.","output":"Deep Learning-Based Cervical Spine Posterior Percutaneous Endoscopic Disc Nucleus Resection for the Treatment of Cervical Spondylotic Radiculopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Les mesures sanitaires mises en place pendant la pandmie, telles que la distanciation sociale et les confinements, ont profondment modifi les pratiques de recherche clinique en restreignant l'accs aux participants en raison des risques de contamination, et en limitant la disponibilit du personnel des sites en raison de la surcharge de travail.

The United Nations Development Programme ranks countries according to their level of human development based on life expectancy, education and national income. Although Costa Rica is ranked at 63 and classified as High, in terms of health it belongs in the Very High group. In 2018 mean life expectancy for the Very High countries was 79.5, while in Costa Rica it was 80. In 2018, under five mortality was 8.8/1000 live births, lower than countries ranked in the Very High human development group. Expected years of schooling in Costa Rica is 15.4, closer to the average, 16.4 years, of the Very High human development group than the average of the High group. The country is much healthier than would be predicted by its national income; rather, other features of societys development are likely to have played a key role in the development of good health. These include (i) the decision to cease investment in national defence, which freed up money to invest in health, education and the welfare of the population; (ii) the decision to create a universal health system financed by the State, employers and workers in the 1940s; and (iii) the educational system, that generated opportunities to lift important sectors of the population out of poverty, allowing them to have basic sanitary conditions that increase their possibilities to live longer and in better conditions. Despite these advances, inequalities in terms of income and social conditions persist, presenting challenges in the field of health, particularly for lower-income populations and those of African and indigenous descent. These inequalities must be addressed using decisions based on scientific evidence, a greater use of disaggregated data to reveal progress in addressing these inequalities, and with a broader articulation of the health sector with policies that act on the social determinants of health.","output":"Liderazgo, determinantes sociales de la salud y equidad en la salud: el caso de Costa Rica(*)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background New York City (NYC) has endured the greatest burden of COVID-19 infections in the US.

Methods Cross sectional study including serum samples for qualitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 PCR and completion of an online survey capturing demographics, COVID-19 symptoms during the preceding months on duty, details of healthcare and community exposure, and travel history were collected from consenting participants in May 2020. Participants risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection in hospital and in the community was defined based on CDC guidelines. Travel history to high-risk areas was also considered an additional risk.

Recent studies confirm that natural selection is the dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, which favors mutations that strengthen viral infectivity. We demonstrate that vaccine-breakthrough or antibody-resistant mutations provide a new mechanism of viral evolution. Specifically, vaccine-resistant mutation Y449S in the spike (S) protein receptor-bonding domain (RBD), which occurred in co-mutation [Y449S, N501Y], has reduced infectivity compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 but can disrupt existing antibodies that neutralize the virus. By tracing the evolutionary trajectories of vaccine-resistant mutations in over 1.9 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reveal that the occurrence and frequency of vaccine-resistant mutations correlate strongly with the vaccination rates in Europe and America. We anticipate that as a complementary transmission pathway, vaccine-resistant mutations will become a dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution when most of the world's population is vaccinated.

Dyspnoea is challenging to assess remotely, and the accuracy of subjective dyspnoea measures in capturing hypoxaemia have not been formally evaluated for COVID-19. We explored the accuracy of subjective dyspnoea in diagnosing hypoxaemia in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of consecutive outpatients with COVID-19 who met criteria for home oxygen saturation monitoring at a university-affiliated acute care hospital in Toronto, Canada from 3 April 2020 to 13 September 2020. Dyspnoea measures were treated as diagnostic tests, and we determined their sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), negative/positive predictive value (NPV/PPV) and positive/negative likelihood ratios (+LR/-LR) for detecting hypoxaemia. In the primary analysis, hypoxaemia was defined by oxygen saturation <95%; the diagnostic accuracy of subjective dyspnoea was also assessed across a range of oxygen saturation cutoffs from 92% to 97%. RESULTS: During the study period, 89/501 (17.8%) of patients met criteria for home oxygen saturation monitoring, and of these 17/89 (19.1%) were diagnosed with hypoxaemia. The presence/absence of dyspnoea had limited accuracy for diagnosing hypoxaemia, with SN 47% (95% CI 24% to 72%), SP 80% (95% CI 68% to 88%), NPV 86% (95% CI 75% to 93%), PPV 36% (95% CI 18% to 59%), +LR 2.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 4.7) and -LR 0.7 (95% CI 0.4 to 1.1). The SN of dyspnoea was 50% (95% CI 19% to 81%) when a cut-off of <92% was used to define hypoxaemia. A modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea score >1 (SP 98%, 95% CI 88% to 100%), Roth maximal count <12 (SP 100%, 95% CI 75% to 100%) and Roth counting time <8 s (SP 93%, 95% CI 66% to 100%) had high SP that could be used to rule in hypoxaemia, but displayed low SN (&#8804;50%). CONCLUSIONS: Subjective dyspnoea measures have inadequate accuracy for ruling out hypoxaemia in high-risk patients with COVID-19.

METHODS Files of patients with acute ischemic symptoms due to ICA occlusions managed from August 2010 to August 2016 by urgent endovascular revascularization were retrospectively reviewed with a waiver of informed consent. Cases where there was escalation to stiff tipped cardiovascular microguidewires after at least two failed attempts to cross the carotid occlusion with standard neuro-microguidewires were included. Radiological and interventional data were recorded. RESULTS 63 patients with acute carotid occlusions underwent emergent endovascular revascularization in the study period; 5/63 patients met the inclusion criteria. In 4/5 patients, there was no angiographic evidence of the remnant origin of the ICA; in 1/5 there was a wide round shaped proximal calcified cap that precluded soft guidewire entry. In all cases, antegrade wiring was achieved only after switching to stiffer guidewires designed for the management of chronic cardiac occlusions. The use of these stiffer tip wires was considered of critical importance in achieving the successful performance of the ICA revascularization procedure. In all patients, revascularization was achieved, and 90 day modified Rankin Scale score ranged from 0 to 2. CONCLUSIONS When regular neuro-guidewires do not allow antegrade wiring in cases of ICA occlusion, wire escalation to high tip stiffness guidewires may improve success. These wires, designed to deal with chronic total coronary occlusions, can serve as a platform for new neuro-guidewires to be used in the challenging field of resistant supra-aortic occlusions.","output":"Wire escalation in emergent revascularization procedures of internal carotid artery occlusions: the use of high tip stiffness microguidewires."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence of food allergies is on the rise; nearly 8% of children worldwide are affected.

STUDY DESIGN A retrospective review of prospectively maintained databases for patients undergoing planned esophagectomy were reviewed from 2007 to 2015. Esophagogastric anastomoses were performed via a 6-cm linear stapled side-to-side method. Demographics, comorbidities, surgical approach, pathology data, and postoperative morbidities were recorded and reviewed. RESULTS A MIE was attempted in 303 of 315 (96 %) patients, and a total minimally invasive approach was completed in 293 of 315 (93 %) patients. Location of anastomosis was predominantly in the neck, with 244 patients (77.5 %) undergoing a total minimally invasive McKeown approach (n = 231). A total, minimally invasive Ivor-Lewis was completed in 60 patients (19.1 %). Anastomotic leak was identified in 24 patients (7.6 %).

In this paper, we present a set of novel and efficient computational techniques based on elementary geometry and graph theory that can be employed to obtain the essential structure of a road network, while also retaining the crucial geometry of roads, such as shape and length. This is done by dissecting the network into clusters of nodes of degree other than 2 and curves, which contain consecutive nodes of degree 2, connecting these clusters. These clusters of nodes and curves will be collapsed into cleaned nodes and paths, respectively in a simplified mathematical graph. We apply this method to obtain the simplification of road network in Punggol new town in the northeast region of Singapore, and show that application of network analyses such as centrality measures could be performed in a more meaningful and concise manner than on the original road network.","output":"Extracting Backbone Structure of a Road Network from Raw Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As I begin my 4th year of medical school amidst the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, telehealth has allowed me to connect with many patients who previously struggled to access consistent primary care.

Design/methodology/approach: An online survey on wild meat awareness with (potential) game consumers across the country as target groups was conducted. Findings: Results from this study showed that consumers in the southern region have a preference for wildlife. This preference was determined by factors such as natural environment, history and culture and the level of economic development. However, there was no significant difference in the frequency of game consumption between the north and south since game meat is not a major component of the daily diet. Practical implications: The government should consider banning this trade permanently to prevent future disease outbreaks caused by wildlife-to-human transmissions. Originality/value: The consumption of game meat is regional, but the animals in game trades live across a wider area, and thus, game trades have a global influence on ecological systems and human health.

One area which seems to receive less attention is that of inducing a class taxonomy from such graphs. Ontologies, which provide the axiomatic foundation on which knowledge graphs are built, are often governed by a set of class subsumption axioms. These class subsumptions form a class taxonomy which hierarchically organizes the type classes present in the knowledge graph. Manually creating and curating these class taxonomies oftentimes requires expert knowledge and is time costly, especially in large-scale knowledge graphs. Thus, methods capable of inducing the class taxonomy from the knowledge graph data automatically are an appealing solution to the problem. In this paper, we propose a simple method for inducing class taxonomies from knowledge graphs that is scalable to large datasets. Our method borrows ideas from tag hierarchy induction methods, relying on class frequencies and co-occurrences, such that it requires no information outside the knowledge graphs triple representation. We demonstrate the use of our method on three real-world datasets and compare our results with existing tag hierarchy induction methods.

The statement was met with significant backlash and Mr Morrison promptly rescinded the statement focusing instead on his desire to reach high levels of voluntary vaccine coverage. Nevertheless, interesting legal questions about the possibility of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination arose. This article explores the possible legal frameworks for implementing a mandatory vaccination scheme in Australia as well as the associated ethical dilemmas. Furthermore, it argues that a mandatory vaccination scheme, while possible and arguably ethical, would have undesirable implications resulting in popular opposition and decreased compliance with other voluntary vaccines such as childhood vaccination and seasonal influenza. Consequently, a voluntary scheme based on incentives and transparent provision of information is much more likely to achieve the desired uptake.","output":"Chasing Immunity: How Viable Is a Mandatory COVID-19 Vaccination Scheme for Australia?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The main objective of this study is to evaluate the frequency of acute kidney injury (AKI) in COVID-19 infected patients who are hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU). Materials and Methods: This study was performed retrospectively on patients above 18 years of age who had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a typical chest computed tomography (CT) for COVID-19 disease. The patients were hospitalized in the medical ICU and kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) criteria was used for AKI classification. Results: We included 16 patients. The median age was 75 years and 88% were male. The most common co-morbid diseases were hypertension (HT) (56%) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (44%).

India has one of the highest rates of antibiotic use in the world. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of self\\\\prescribed antibiotic use of patients presenting with febrile and infectious disease\\\\related complaints to Indian emergency departments. METHODS: This was a prospective observational study conducted at 6 Indian emergency departments (EDs) between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019. Adult patients who presented with a chief complaint of febrile illness or infectious disease complaints were included. Our principal outcomes of interest were self\\\\prescribed use of antibiotics within the prior 6 months or for the presenting complaint. We queried respondents about source of antibiotics as well as about demographic characteristics that influenced use. RESULTS: A total of 1421 patients were enrolled. Sixty percent (n = 856) of respondents reported using antibiotics in the prior 6 months or for their current complaint. Those who reported self\\\\prescribing antibiotics either in the past or currently had at least some college education (P < 0.001), tended to use the pharmacy (P < 0.001) or the ED (P = 0.001) for their care when sick, and were more likely to have some comorbid conditions (P = 0.014) as compared to the group that did not self\\\\prescribe antibiotics. The most common reason respondents reported self\\\\prescribing antibiotics was because they did not want to wait to see their doctor (n = 278, 33%). Thirty\\\\five percent of patients who were self\\\\prescribed antibiotics before presentation did not receive and were not prescribed antibiotics in the ED, at discharge, or both. CONCLUSIONS: Self\\\\prescribing of antibiotics occurs commonly in India. This use increases the risk for resistance due to inappropriate or unnecessary use.

The World Health Organization predicts that by 2030, mental health conditions will be the leading cause of disease burden worldwide. The current need for mental health care is overwhelming. In New Zealand, 1 in 6 adults has been diagnosed with common mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety disorders, according to a national survey. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to effectively help patients overcome a wide variety of mental health conditions. Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) might be one of the most exciting technologies emerging in the clinical setting for the treatment of anxiety and depression. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the virtual reality (VR) technologies currently being used to help support the treatment of depression and anxiety. We also aim to investigate whether and how CBT is included as part of VRET and look at the VR technologies and interventions that have been used in recent studies on depression and anxiety. METHODS: We performed a scoping review. To identify significant studies, we decided to use already aggregated sources from the Google Scholar database. Overall, the goal of our search strategy was to limit the number of initial results related to VR in mental health to only a relevant minimum. RESULTS: Using our defined keywords, Google Scholar identified >17,300 articles. After applying all the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we identified a total of 369 articles for further processing. After manual evaluation, 34 articles were shortlisted; of the 34 articles, 9 (26%) reported the use of CBT with VR. All of the articles were published between 2017 and 2021. Out of the 9 studies, CBT was conducted within a VR environment in 5 (56%) studies, whereas in the remaining 4 (44%) studies, CBT was used as an addition to VRET. All 9 studies reported the use of CBT either in vivo or in a virtual environment to be effective in supporting the treatment of anxiety or depression. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies demonstrated the use of VR to be effective for supporting the treatment of anxiety or depression in a range of settings and recommended its potential as a tool for use in a clinical environment. Even though standalone headsets are much easier to work with and more suitable for home use, the shift from tethered VR headsets to standalone headsets in the mental health environment was not observed. All studies that looked at the use of CBT either in vivo or in a virtual environment found it to be effective in supporting the treatment of anxiety or depression.","output":"Virtual Reality for Supporting the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety: Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To help accelerate the development of antiviral therapies against COVID-19, CAS, a division of the American Chemical Society, has curated a data set of nearly 50,000 chemical substances with known or potential antiviral activity that could serve as potential leads The data set, which CAS has made publicly available through open access, was curated from the CAS Registry of more than 160 million chemical substances We have this wealth of knowledge that were sitting onthese databases in science that weve built for the last 113 yearsand we want to open up key parts of it to help accelerate treatments and/or vaccines to COVID-19, says Michael Dennis, vice president for innovation at CAS Dennis says the idea for this data set came out of two tables in a recent publication by CAS in ACS Central Science that included antiviral and small molecules with potential therapeutic applications against COVID-19 (DOI: 10 1021/acscentsci 0c00272) The article has already received more than 200,000 views, and CAS wanted to expand this resource","output":"CAS curates data set of antiviral compounds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Healthy elderly, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimers disease populations have been among the most affected in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the direct effects of the virus, and numerous indirect effects now emerge and will have to be carefully assessed over time.

RESULTS: The pandemic associated to COVID-19 has shifted most of the health resources to the emergency area and has consequently left the three main medical areas dealing with the elderly population (oncology, time-dependent diseases and degenerative disease) temporarily uncovered. In the phase following the emergency, it will be crucial to guarantee to each area the economic and organizational resources to quickly return to the level of support of the prepandemic state. CONCLUSIONS: The emergency phase represented a significant occasion of discussion on the possibilities of telemedicine which will inevitably become increasingly important, but all the limits of its use in the elderly population have to be considered. In the post-lockdown recovery phase, alongside the classic medical evaluation, the psychological evaluation must become even more important for doctors caring about people with cognitive decline as well as with their caregivers.","output":"Direct and indirect neurological, cognitive, and behavioral effects of COVID-19 on the healthy elderly, mild-cognitive-impairment, and Alzheimers disease populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Rabies is an acute viral disease that causes encephalomyelitis in mammals and human. The only way to prevent this disease is through vaccination before or after exposure. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of the Pasteur virus (PV) minigenome, using PV strain. MATERIALS AND METHODS Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) sequence was placed between the designed necessary elements (Hammerhead, HDV ribozyme, 3' Leader, and 5' Trailer sequences), which resemble the rabies virus PV strain (PV2061) genome and anti-genome. These constructs were placed between T7 polymerase promoter and T7 polymerase terminator sequences. The accuracy of the minigenome was confirmed by the expression of EGFP using the helper virus in T7-BHK cell line. RESULTS The viral necessary elements of positive and negative sense strands were evaluated for the ability of EGFP expression in the presence of the helper virus. While the positive strand showed background results, no EGFP background was observed in the negative strand application. CONCLUSION Establishment of minigenome system does not require advanced biosafety levels. Furthermore, using minigenome system eliminates many potential confounding factors that may be present in coding regions of the genome. Use of the minigenome system is easier and more feasible than the full genome rescue of the virus.

When evaluating published works, one should assess the integrity and academic credentials of the authors, who serve as putative experts. A relationship with a relevant manufacturer may increase the potential risk for bias in relevant studies. Objective To characterize the association of industrial payments by device manufacturers, self-declared conflict of interest (COI), and relevance of publications among physicians receiving the highest compensation. Design, Setting, and Participants This population-based bibliometric analysis identified 10 surgical and medical device manufacturing companies and the 10 physicians receiving the highest compensation from each company using the 2015 Open Payments Database (OPD) general payments data. For each of the 100 physicians, the total amount of general payments, number of payments, institution type, and academic rank were recorded. Royalty or license payments were excluded. A search of PubMed identified articles published by each physician from January 1 through December 31, 2016, and their associated COI declaration. Scopus was used to identify bibliometric data reported as the h index (number of papers by a researcher with at least h citations each). Main Outcomes and Measures Discrepancy between self-declared COI and industry payments. Results The 100 physicians included in the sample population (88% men) were paid a total of $12 446 969, with a median payment of $95 993. Fifty physicians (50.0%) were faculty at academic institutions. The mean (SD) h index was 18 (18; range, 0-75) for the authors. In 2016, 412 articles were published by these physicians, with a mean (SD) of 4 (6) publications (range, 0-25) and median of 1 (36 physicians had no publications). Of these articles, 225 (54.6%) were relevant to the general payments received by the authors. Only in 84 of the 225 relevant publications (37.3%) was the potential COI declared by the authors. Conclusions and Relevance A high level of inconsistency was found between self-declared COI and the OPD among the physicians receiving the highest industry payments. Therefore, a policy of full disclosure for all publications, regardless of relevance, is proposed. No statistically significant association was demonstrated between academic rank or productivity and industrial payments.","output":"Association of Compensation From the Surgical and Medical Device Industry to Physicians and Self-declared Conflict of Interest."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to investigate the associations of previous influenza/URI with the susceptibility of COVID-19 patients compared to that of non-COVID-19 participants.

A total of 8,070 COVID-19 patients (1 January 2020 through 4 June 2020) were matched with 32,280 control participants. Severe COVID-19 morbidity was defined based on the treatment histories of the intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and death. The susceptibility/morbidity/mortality associated with prior histories of 1C14, 1C30, 1C90, 15C45, 15C90, and 31C90 days before COVID-19 onset were analyzed using conditional/unconditional logistic regression. Prior influenza infection was related to increased susceptibility to COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 3.07 [1.61C5.85] for 1C14 days and 1.91 [1.54C2.37] for 1C90 days).

Winter outbreaks in Chile result in 5% of infected children hospitalized, with 0.01% mortality. Increased evidence indicates that viral and host factors modulate the severity of infection. Using DNA microarrays, we characterized the genome-wide transcriptional response of lung mucoepidermoid cells (NCI-H292) at 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post-infection (hpi) with a single dose of RSV/A. During the whole studied period, a bi-phasic gene expression profile was observed by a total of 330 differentially expressed genes. About 60% of them were up-regulated between 24-72 hpi and then turned-off at 96 hpi. This transient, early gene expression pattern was significantly enriched in biological processes like interferon signaling, antigen processing and presentation, double-stranded RNA binding and chemokine activity. We detected 27 common genes up-regulated between 24-72 hpi, from which IFIT1, IFI44, MX1, CXCL11 and OAS1 had the highest expression. The second pattern comprised over 120 genes, which remained silenced until 72 hpi, but were steeply up-regulated by 96 hpi. Biological processes of this late-response profile included cell cycle division and microtubule cytoskeleton organization. Conversely, the genes belonging to virus response pathway showed a decreased expression at 96 hpi. We conclude that RSV induces an early innate immune activation profile response until 72 hpi. Thereafter, the viral response is inhibited, leading to host cell recovery. The presented cellular model allows to study the specific pathways involved in elimination of infection at prolonged time intervals and their subsequent analysis in severe RSV disease of infants and/or older adults.","output":"Time-course of transcriptome response to respiratory syncytial virus infection in lung epithelium cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clusters of COVID-19 cases emerged during the months of December 2020 and January 2021 in the Vaud Alps.

Using conservation of resources theory, the purpose of this study is to empirically test the overall effects of DT within service organisations on service employees beliefs with respect to crisis preparedness, life satisfaction and customer orientation. It also examines the moderating effects of crisis-related anxiety and job experience on these relationships. Design/methodology/approach: This studys hypotheses were tested quantitatively with an online survey of N = 592 frontline service employees working in hospitality and retail services organisation during the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the data. A post-hoc study of customer-facing supervisors (N = 268) was conducted to validate the study findings and establish generalisability. Findings: DT predicts service employees beliefs regarding crisis preparedness. In turn, crisis preparedness increases life satisfaction and customer orientation. Moreover, crisis-related anxiety negatively moderates the relationship between DT and crisis preparedness. Post hoc analyses validate the results derived from service employees data. Surprisingly, there is no significant relationship between crisis preparedness and life satisfaction for supervisors/managers with low job experience. Originality/value: This study makes an empirical contribution to the service management literature by examining the impact of DT on service employees beliefs with respect to crisis preparedness that subsequently influences their life satisfaction and ability to remain customer oriented during a crisis.

METHODOLOGY A total of 271 SARI cases, admitted into the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of Bechir Hamza Children's Hospital in Tunis, were collected between September 2015 and December 2017. The investigation concerned 104 samples positive for HRV and/or HEV (Human Enterovirus) obtained among these cases. Specific HRV and HEV detections were assessed by real-time PCRs. The HRV molecular typing was based on the VP4-VP2 genomic region analyses. RESULTS Among the viral SARI cases, 33.5% and 12.3% were positive for HRV and HEV respectively. Molecular investigations showed high prevalence of HRV-A (63.3%) followed by HRV-C (30.6%) and HRV-B (6.1%) and high genotypic diversity with 27 types. HRV cases were mostly detected in toddlers younger than 6 months. A total of 16 cases (28%) were found with bacterial and/or viral co-infection.

Since, no specific antiviral drug is proven effective for treatment against COVID-19, identification of new therapeutics is an urgent need. In this study, flavonoid compounds were analyzed for its inhibitory potential against important protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 using computational approaches. Virtual docking was performed for screening of flavonoid compounds retrieved from PubChem against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 using COVID-19 docking server. The cut off of dock score was set to >-9kcal/mol and screened compounds were individually docked against main protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and spike proteins using AutoDock 4.1 software. Finally, lead flavonoid compounds were subjected to ADMET analysis. A total of 458 flavonoid compounds were virtually screened against main protease target and 36 compounds were selected based on the interaction energy value >-9kcal/mol. Furthermore, these compounds were individually docked against protein targets and top 10 lead compounds were identified. Among the lead compounds, agathisflavone showed highest binding energy value of -8.4 kcal/mol against main protease, Albireodelphin showed highest dock score of -9.8 kcal/mol and -11.2 kcal/mol against RdRp, and spike proteins, respectively. Based on the high dock score and ADMET properties, top 5 lead molecules such as Albireodelphin, Apigenin 7-(6''-malonylglucoside), Cyanidin-3-(p-coumaroyl)-rutinoside-5-glucoside, Delphinidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside 5-O-(6-coumaroyl-beta-D-glucoside) and (-)-Maackiain-3-O-glucosyl-6''-O-malonate were identified as potent inhibitors against main protease, RdRp, and spike protein targets of SARS-CoV-2. These all compounds are having non-carcinogenic and non-mutagenic properties.This study finding suggests that the screened compounds include Albireodelphin, Apigenin 7-(6''-malonylglucoside), Cyanidin-3-(p-coumaroyl)-rutinoside-5-glucoside, Delphinidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside 5-O-(6-coumaroyl-beta-D-glucoside) and (-)-Maackiain-3-O-glucosyl-6''-O-malonate could be the potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 targets.","output":"Computational selection of flavonoid compounds as inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 main protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and spike proteins: A molecular docking study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The observation of patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) led us to note a lower prevalence of patients affected by chronic respiratory disease, in particular asthmatic patients, compared to the general population. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the possible protective role of corticosteroid therapy in patients with chronic lung disease, regarding the risk of contracting severe COVID-19. MAIN BODY: SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to enter the cells. Considering the high number of these receptors in patients affected by asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the evidence that these patients do not have a high risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 needs further study to understand what the possible protective factors are in these patients. In particular, the finding in some studies of reduced coronavirus replication in cell lines treated with steroids, molecules commonly used for treating chronic lung diseases, needs further attention. SHORT CONCLUSION: The hypothesis that corticosteroids, commonly used in treating airways diseases, might modify the severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease has become a key point and a possible predictive factor of a positive outcome of COVID-19 in patients treated everyday with these molecules.","output":"The potential protective role of corticosteroid therapy in patients with asthma and COPD against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Existing campaign-based healthcare delivery programs used for immunization often fall short of established health coverage targets due to the lack of accurate population estimates and location. A microplan, an integrated set of detailed planning components, can be used to identify this information in order to support programs such as equitable COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: We present a series of steps necessary to create an artificial intelligence-based framework for automated microplanning, and our pilot implementation of this analysis tool across 29 countries of the Americas. Further, we describe our processes for generating a conceptual framework, creating customized catchment areas, and estimate the up-do-date population to support microplanning of health campaigns. Findings: Through our application of the present framework, we found that 68 million individuals across the 29 countries are within five km of a health facility. The number of health facilities analyzed ranged from 2 in Peru to 789 in Argentina, while the total population within five km ranged from 1,233 in Peru to 15,304,439 in Mexico. Interpretation: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using this methodological framework to support the development of customized microplans for health campaigns using open-source data in multiple countries.

As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 inZhejiang Province. Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on \\"Four-Anti and Two-Balance\\" for clinical practice. The \\"Four-Anti and Two-Balance\\"strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological balance. Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinarypersonalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect. The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in10% patients'blood samples at acute periodand 50% of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces. We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identifyingcytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system. The \\"Four-Anti and Two-Balance\\"strategyeffectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviraleffects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and also short periods of moderate glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended. Patients with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be prescribed rationally and was not recommended except for patients with long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbialdysbiosis with decreasedprobiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis. We also integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine. We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation. It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience above and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results.

Drug-induced AIH has similar clinical, serological and histological features of AIH but is less likely to require long term immunosuppression or to relapse after discontinuation of immunosuppressants. It is mostly associated with nitrofurantoin, minocycline, hydralazine, and methyldopa, however other medications may be culprits. Herein, we present a patient with drug-induced AIH with possible relation to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Case Description/Methods: A 38-year-old female with a history of Helicobacter pylori treated with amoxicillin and pantoprazole three months ago and recent COVID-19 vaccination presented with two weeks of right upper quadrant pain and diarrhea. Patient received second dose of vaccination two weeks prior to symptom onset. Five days post-symptom onset, she developed a pruritic rash with vomiting and yellowing of her skin. Physical examination was notable for normal mentation, scleral icterus, jaundice, and a maculopapular rash. Initial blood workup showed international normalized ratio 2.4, alkaline phosphatase 212 U/L, ALT 3769 U/L, AST 1572 U/L and total bilirubin of 23.8 mg/ dL. Viral hepatitis serologies, chronic liver disease workup and autoimmune serologies were normal. Imaging demonstrated no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation. Liver biopsy showed portal inflammation with interface activity, diffuse lobular inflammation, and perivenulitis with abundant lymphocytes and plasma cells consistent with seronegative AIH or drug induced AIH. The patient developed altered mental status meeting the criteria of acute liver failure, she was started on corticosteroids as well as supportive care with resolution of encephalopathy and was discharged home on prednisone. Discussion: Several etiologies of drug-induced AIH are well-established, however cases secondary to COVID-19 vaccination have been minimally reported. Common adverse events for COVID-19 vaccination have been noted such as fever, chills, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain. Several rare side effects have occurred including immune thrombocytopenia and one other suspected case of Pfizer- BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination-induced AIH reported in the literature. In that case the patient developed symptoms within one week of the first dose. This case serves to report a potential association and not necessarily causation between the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination and AIH.","output":"Autoimmune hepatitis: Possible relation to the pfizer-biontech COVID-19 vaccine?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Experts have called attention to the possible negative impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related cytokine storm syndrome on the progression of leprosy-related disabilities.

Methods: Observational, prospective study including all patients undergoing urological surgery from 1st March 2020 to 28th February 2021. According to the hospital organization and local epidemiological situation we delimitate three epidemic waves. A set of screening and protective measures was applied from 4th May onwards. Demographic, baseline, surgical and perioperative variables, as well as postoperative outcomes, were collected. Telephone follow-up was performed at least 3 weeks after hospital discharge. Results: 940 urological surgeries were performed, 12 of them had to be rescheduled due to active or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection identified by the screening protocol. Thirty-one patients developed COVID-19 (3.3% incidence) and 7 died (22.6% mortality). The average time to onset of symptoms was 62.6 days after discharge, being 25 cases attributable to community transmission. The remaining 6 cases, due to in-hospital transmission, had worse outcomes. Five of them were identified during the first wave, especially when no preoperative PCR was obtained. In contrast, during the second and third waves, fewer and milder cases were diagnosed, with just 1 in-hospital transmission among 857 urological patients. Conclusions: after implementing complete protective measures, postoperative in-hospital COVID-19 cases almost disappeared, even during the second and third waves. Most of the cases were due to community transmission and thus driven by the general epidemiological situation.

We performed environmental sampling of staff areas in wards where coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients received care and compared findings to surfaces within COVID-19 patient rooms. METHODS: The study was conducted at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA) from 9/15/20-1/26/21. Sampling of 20cm(2) surfaces in staff common areas (breakroom high-touch surfaces comprising tables and microwave/refrigerator handles; bathroom surfaces comprising toilet, sink, and doorknob; and floors), nurse workstations (computer mice and floors), and COVID-19 patient rooms (high-touch surfaces comprising bedrail, computer mice/keyboards, and doorknobs; bathroom surfaces; and floors) was performed using flocked swabs one or more times per week. Specimens underwent RNA extraction and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect the SC2 N1 region. Median comparisons were performed using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Trends in odds were evaluated using Score test. RESULTS: Proportions of surface specimens with detectable SC2 RNA are summarized in Table 1. Median copy numbers were lower among staff toilets compared to COVID-19 patient toilets (135.6 vs. 503.8 copies/specimen, p=0.02), lower among staff breakroom compared to patient room high-touch surfaces (104.3 vs. 220.3 copies/specimen, p=0.007), and similar between staff and patient room samples from sinks and floors. At nurse workstations, SC2 RNA was detected among 22/177 (12.4%) computer mouse and 147/178 (82.6%) floor samples.

WHO named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19 (CoronaVirus Disease-2019). It is very intriguing to see a mild trend of infection in some countries which could be attributed to mitigation efforts, lockdown strategies, health infrastructure, demographics and cultural habits. However, the lower rate of infection and death rates in mostly developing countries, which are not placed at higher levels in terms of healthcare facilities, is a very surprising observation. To address this issue, we hypothesize that this lower rate of infection is majorly been observed in countries which have a higher transmission/prevalence of protozoan parasite borne disease, malaria. We compared the COVID-19 spread and malaria endemicity of 108 countries which have shown at least 200 cases of COVID-19 till 18th April 2020. We found that the number of COVID-19 cases per million population correlates negatively with the malaria endemicity of respective countries. The malaria free countries not only have higher density of COVID-19 infections but also the higher case fatality rates as compared to highly malaria endemic countries. We also postulate that this phenomenon is due to natural immune response against malaria infection, which is providing a heterologous protection against the virus.

The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of different NMS therapies and to analyze its outcome depending on NMS severity. METHOD Systematic search for NMS cases in biomedical databases. The focus of the analysis was on therapy with dantrolene, bromocriptine and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) when each was compared with symptomatic therapy. Primary outcomes were the survival rate and the duration of treatment. RESULT 405 case reports were included. Overall, no statistically significant differences regarding mortality rate or duration of treatment were found between dantrolene, bromocriptine or ECT compared to supportive care. A subgroup analysis regarding NMS severity showed that the mortality under specific NMS pharmacotherapy (dantrolene, bromocriptine) and under ECT was significantly lower than under purely symptomatic therapy in severe NMS (p = 0.018). The difference was not significant in mild and moderate cases. DISCUSSION An overall superiority of the specific NMS therapy (dantrolene, bromocriptine and ECT) was not found in this study.

In previous case-series, an effect on survival or the duration of the disease could only be observed in part for specific therapies, but the evidence available is inconsistent.

Such antibodies provide protection against reinfection by the same strain of a pathogen. A highly mutable virus, like HIV or influenza, evades recognition by these strain-specific antibodies via the emergence of new mutant strains. A vaccine that elicits antibodies that can bind to many diverse strains of the virus-known as broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs)-could protect against highly mutable pathogens. Despite much work, the mechanisms by which bnAbs emerge remain uncertain. Using a computational model of affinity maturation, we studied a wide variety of vaccination strategies. Our results suggest that an effective strategy to maximize bnAb evolution is through a sequential immunization protocol, wherein each new immunization optimally increases the pressure on the immune system to target conserved antigenic sites, thus conferring breadth. We describe the mechanisms underlying why sequentially driving the immune system increasingly further from steady state, in an optimal fashion, is effective. The optimal protocol allows many evolving B cells to become bnAbs via diverse evolutionary paths.","output":"Optimizing immunization protocols to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Currently there is no clear consensus on the use, value, benefits, and impact of serology testing as part of a comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy.

The first ever case of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from a human owner to a domestic cat was confirmed on March 27, 2020. A tiger from a zoo in New York, USA, was also reportedly infected with SARS-CoV-2. It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted to tigers from their caretakers, who were previously infected with this virus. On May 25, 2020, the Dutch Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality reported that two employees were infected with SARS-CoV-2 transmitted from minks. These reports have influenced us to perform a comparative analysis among angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) homologous proteins for verifying the conservation of specific protein regions. One of the most conserved peptides is represented by the peptide \\"353-KGDFR-357 (H. sapiens ACE2 residue numbering), which is located on the surface of the ACE2 molecule and participates in the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD). Multiple sequence alignments of the ACE2 proteins by ClustalW, whereas the three-dimensional structure of its binding region for the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by means of Spanner, a structural homology modeling pipeline method. In addition, evolutionary phylogenetic tree analysis by ETE3 was used. ACE2 works as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein between humans, dogs, cats, tigers, minks, and other animals, except for snakes. The three-dimensional structure of the KGDFR hosting protein region involved in direct interactions with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD of the mink ACE2 appears to form a loop structurally related to the human ACE2 corresponding protein loop, despite of the reduced available protein length (401 residues of the mink ACE2 available sequence vs 805 residues of the human ACE2). The multiple sequence alignments of the ACE2 proteins shows high homology and complete conservation of the five amino acid residues: 353-KGDFR-357 with humans, dogs, cats, tigers, minks, and other animals, except for snakes.

As projective curves flattened, administrators and surgeons sought to develop strategies to safely resume non-emergent surgery. This article reviews challenges and solutions specific to a children's hospital related to the resumption of elective pediatric surgeries. We present our tiered reentry approach for pediatric surgery as well as report early data for surgical volume and tracking COVID-19 cases during reentry. METHODS The experience of shutdown, protocol development, and early reentry of elective pediatric surgery are reported from Levine's Children's Hospital (LCH), a free-leaning children's hospital in Charlotte, North Carolina. Data reported were obtained from de-identified hospital databases. RESULTS Pediatric surgery experienced a dramatic decrease in case volumes at LCH during the shutdown, variable by specialty. A tiered and balanced reentry strategy was implemented with steady resumption of elective surgery following strict pre-procedural screening and testing. Early outcomes showed a steady thorough fluctuating increase in elective case volumes without evidence of a surgery-associated positive spread through periprocedural tracking. CONCLUSION Reentry of non-emergent pediatric surgical care requires unique considerations including the impact of COVID-19 on children, each children hospital structure and resources, and preventing undue delay in intervention for age- and disease-specific pediatric conditions. A carefully balanced strategy has been critical for safe reentry following the anticipated surge.

CONCLUSIONS: As discussed, some tenets of DKA management may require flexibility in the setting of COVID-19 due to important public health goals, such as preventing transmission to highest risk individuals, reducing healthcare worker exposure to infected patients, and preserving personal protective equipment. Evidence for alternative treatment strategies is explored, with special attention placed on treatment options that may be more relevant during the pandemic, including use of subcutaneous insulin therapy.

Here, we investigated genetic variations in a 414-583 amino acid region of the Spike protein, partially encompassing the ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), across a subset of 570 nasopharyngeal samples isolated between April 2020 and February 2021, from Washington, California, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Illinois. We found that samples isolated since November have an increased number of amino acid mutations in the region, with L452R being the dominant mutation. This mutation is associated with a recently discovered CAL.20C viral variant from clade 20C, lineage B.1.429, that since November-December 2020 is associated with multiple outbreaks and is undergoing massive expansion across California. In some samples, however, we found a distinct L452R-carrying variant of the virus that, upon detailed analysis of the GISAID database genomes, is also circulating primarily in California, but emerged even more recently. The newly identified variant derives from the clade 20A (lineage B.1.232) and is named CAL.20A. We also found that the SARS-CoV-2 strain that caused the only recorded case of infection in an ape - gorillas in the San Diego Zoo, reported in January 2021 - is CAL.20A. In contrast to CAL.20C that carries two additional to L452R mutations in the Spike protein, L452R is the only mutation found in CAL.20A. According to the phylogenetic analysis, however, emergence of CAL.20C was also specifically triggered by acquisition of the L452R mutation. Further analysis of GISAID-deposited genomes revealed that several independent L452R-carrying lineages have recently emerged across the globe, with over 90% of the isolates reported between December 2020 C February 2021. Taken together, these results indicate that the L452R mutation alone is of significant adaptive value to SARS-CoV-2 and, apparently, the positive selection for this mutation became particularly strong only recently, possibly reflecting viral adaptation to the containment measures or increasing population immunity. While the functional impact of L452R has not yet been extensively evaluated, leucine-452 is positioned in the receptor-binding motif of RBD, in the interface of direct contact with the ACE2 receptor. Its replacement with arginine is predicted to result in both a much stronger binding to the receptor and escape from neutralizing antibodies. If true, this in turn might lead to significantly increased infectivity of the L452R variants, warranting their close surveillance and in-depth functional studies.","output":"Acquisition of the L452R mutation in the ACE2-binding interface of Spike protein triggers recent massive expansion of SARS-Cov-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Considering the current importance of leadership, digital transformation and performance in the changes state higher education institutions (HEIs) have been subject to, this study aims to present an analysis of how these three concepts have been related in the literature.Design/methodology/approachThis study proposes to study the state-of-the-art of research on leadership styles, digital transformation and performance in a single study, through a systematic literature review using two major databases, ISI Web of Science and Scopus.FindingsThe results reveal that the most common leadership style in the articles analysed is transformational;the most studied dimension of performance is the one representing teaching and learning activities;and the most discussed aspects of digital transformation are those concerning online learning systems and various types of technology.

The research project aims to study the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva of suspected COVID-19 patients in comparison to its presence in NP swabs. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted in October 2020 in COVID19 clinic in the Bahrain Defense Force Hospital. The study compared the presence of SARS-CoV2 by PCR in saliva samples to nasopharyngeal samples. COVID-19 Clinic tests symptomatic, staff, close contacts and pre-operation patients. Results The saliva PCR has shown a sensitivity of 72.9% (95% CI: 58.2% - 84.7%) and a specificity of 98.8% (95% CI: 97.8% - 99.4%). The PPV was 74.5% (95% CI 59.7% to 86.1%) and the NPV was 98.6% (95% CI 97.7% to 99.3%). Kappa coefficient of agreement between saliva and NP was 0.723 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.82, p<0.001).

HIV self-testing (HIVST), a process where a person collects his/her own specimen, performs a test, and interprets the result, was introduced in 2019 as a new testing modality through the ATLAS project coordinated by the international partner organisation Solthis (IPO). We estimate the costs of implementing HIVST through 23 civil society organisations (CSO)-led models for KP in C?te d'Ivoire (N = 7), Senegal (N = 11), and Mali (N = 5). We modelled costs for programme transition (2021) and early scale-up (2022-2023). Between July 2019 and September 2020, a total of 51,028, 14,472, and 34,353 HIVST kits were distributed in C?te d'Ivoire, Senegal, and Mali, respectively. Across countries, 64-80% of HIVST kits were distributed to FSW, 20-31% to MSM, and 5-8% to PWUD. Average costs per HIVST kit distributed were $15 for FSW (C?te d'Ivoire: $13, Senegal: $17, Mali: $16), $23 for MSM (C?te d'Ivoire: $15, Senegal: $27, Mali: $28), and $80 for PWUD (C?te d'Ivoire: $16, Senegal: $144), driven by personnel costs (47-78% of total costs), and HIVST kits costs (2-20%). Average costs at scale-up were $11 for FSW (C?te d'Ivoire: $9, Senegal: $13, Mali: $10), $16 for MSM (C?te d'Ivoire: $9, Senegal: $23, Mali: $17), and $32 for PWUD (C?te d'Ivoire: $14, Senegal: $50). Cost reductions were mainly explained by the spreading of IPO costs over higher HIVST distribution volumes and progressive IPO withdrawal at scale-up. In all countries, CSO-led HIVST kit provision to KP showed relatively high costs during the study period related to the progressive integration of the programme to CSO activities and contextual challenges (COVID-19 pandemic, country safety concerns). In transition to scale-up and integration of the HIVST programme into CSO activities, this model shows large potential for substantial economies of scale. Further research will assess the overall cost-effectiveness of this model.","output":"Costs and Scale-Up Costs of Integrating HIV Self-Testing Into Civil Society Organisation-Led Programmes for Key Populations in C?te d'Ivoire, Senegal, and Mali"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To report the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient attendance at a radiotherapy department two months after the implementation of specific policies regarding the pandemic METHODS: The proposed treatment schemes, favoring hypofractionated schedules, and COVID-19 management strategies regarding irradiation are presented Attendance after two months of implementation of these policies was measured and compared with that during the same period in 2019 RESULTS: A 10% reduction in the number of treated patients and a 26% reduction in the number of sessions was observed The main impact was a decrease in the treatment of benign diseases and gastrointestinal tumors, with a general increase in breast cancer treatments Eighteen (1 7%) patients were confirmed as having COVID-19 during radiotherapy in April and May 2020, three of whom were hospitalized, and one patient died because of COVID-19 Among the 18 patients, 12 had their treatments interrupted for at least 15 days from symptom appearance CONCLUSION: There was a decrease in the number of treated patients in our radiotherapy department, with a greater decrease in the total number of sessions This indicated, overall, a smaller number of fractions/patients treated, despite our efforts to maintain the treatment routine We had several patients who were infected with COVID-19 and one related death during treatment in the first few months of the pandemic in S?o Paulo Brazil","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on a daily-based outpatient treatment routine: experience of a radiotherapy department of a tertiary public/university hospital in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The existing literature suggests that external shocks, such as pandemics, stimulate people's demand for social protections and prompt them to favor short-term social consumption over long-term investments.

METHODS We performed a prospective study to evaluate humoral immunogenicity among patients with IBD and HCs after completion of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. RESULTS One hundred twenty-two patients with IBD and 60 HCs were enrolled. All HCs and 97% of patients with IBD developed antibodies. Antibody concentrations were lower in patients with IBD compared with those in HCs (median 31 vs 118 g/mL; P < 0.001).

We identified an insertion of two glycine residues, forming the GxxxG motif, in the SCoV spike protein transmembrane domain (TMD), which is not found in any other coronavirus. This surprising finding raises an \\"oligomerization riddle\\": the GxxxG motif is a known dimerization signal, while the SCoV spike protein is known to be trimeric. Using an in vivo assay, we found that the SCoV spike protein TMD is oligomeric and that this oligomerization is driven by the GxxxG motif. We also found that the GxxxG motif contributes toward the trimerization of the entire spike protein; in that, mutations in the GxxxG motif decrease trimerization of the full-length protein expressed in mammalian cells. Using molecular modeling, we show that the SCoV spike protein TMD adopts a distinct and unique structure as opposed to all other coronaviruses. In this unique structure, the glycine residues of the GxxxG motif are facing each other, enhancing helix-helix interactions by allowing for the close positioning of the helices. This unique orientation of the glycine residues also stabilizes the trimeric bundle during multi-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulation in a hydrated lipid bilayer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the GxxxG motif can potentiate other oligomeric forms beside a dimer. Finally, according to recent studies, the stabilization of the trimeric bundle is linked to a higher fusion activity of the spike protein, and the possible influence of the GxxxG motif on this feature is discussed.","output":"A trimerizing GxxxG motif is uniquely inserted in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus spike protein transmembrane domain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate the functional connections between the core components of the face processing network we tested Herschel, an acquired prosopagnosic patient with a right ventral occipitotemporal lesion.

Evidence shows that such a climate is deleterious to mental health and may increase demand for mental health services in emergency departments. The purpose of this study was to determine the difference in emergency department utilization for mental health diagnoses before and after the COVID-19 surge. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study between January-August 2019 and January-August 2020 with emergency department encounter as the sampling unit. The primary outcome was the proportion of all emergency department encounters attributed to mental health. We performed chi-square analyses to evaluate the differences between 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: We found that overall emergency department volume declined between 2019 and 2020, while the proportion attributable to mental health conditions increased (p < 0.01). Substance abuse, anxiety, and mood disorders accounted for nearly 90% of mental health diagnoses during both periods. When stratified by sex, substance abuse was the leading mental health diagnosis for males and anxiety and substance abuse disorders combined accounted for the largest proportion for females. DISCUSSION: The emergency department is an important community resource for the identification and triage of mental health emergencies. This role is even more important during disasters and extended crises, making it imperative that emergency departments employ experienced mental health staff. This study provides a comparison of emergency department utilization for mental health diagnoses before the pandemic and during the spring 2020 surge and may serve as a useful guide for hospitals, health systems and communities in future planning.","output":"Emergency department utilization for mental health conditions before and after the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systems for time sequential capture of microliter volumes of sweat released from targeted regions of the skin offer the potential to enable analysis of temporal variations in electrolyte balance and biomarker concentration throughout a period of interest.

Data from 15 centers were collected on a web-based platform and managed in a de-identified manner. We performed a subgroup analysis of pts with LPD and COVID-19. Primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality. Long-term follow-up was at 90 and 180 days. Results As of data cutoff on April 14, 2021, 626 pts were included, 170 of them with LPD were eligible for primary endpoint assessment n(%): CLL C 64 (38%), Hodgkin lymphoma C 18 (10%), B-cell lymphomas aggressive/indolent C 49(29%) / 19(11%); M/F 96 (56%) / 74(44%), median age 56 [19C90] years, induction phase/R/R/remission 62(36%) / 68(40%) / 40(24%); comorbidities in 86 (51%) pts. Complications occurred in 126 (74%) pts; one-third had severe COVID-19, 25% were admitted to ICU, and 20% required mechanical ventilation. Comparative analysis of basic characteristics between pts with LPD and all other hematologic diseases did not reveal any significant clinical differences. All-cause mortality at 30 days was 14% in pts with LPD vs 15% in pts with other hematologic diseases (p=0.87); 86% of deaths were due to COVID-19 complications. Eight additional deaths due to COVID-19 at 90 days and 5 deaths due to LPD progression at 180 days occurred. In multivariate analysis, ICU + mechanical ventilation (HR, 71.99 [19.5C271.0]), and age 60 years (HR, 5.360 [1.08C11.8] were the most significant risk factors of death. COVID-19 affected treatment of LPD in 55% of pts, and 52% experienced treatment delay for a median of 4 [1C10] weeks. Early relapsed/refractory disease occurred in 5 of 170 (2.9%) pts; the association of relapses with impaired treatment is unknown. COVID-19 re-infection occurred in 1 patient.

Conclusions Thirty-day all-cause mortality in SARS-CoV-2-infected pts with LPD was comparable with other hematological diseases and higher than in the general population. Lower frequency of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in CD20-positive patients is probably due to anti-CD20 therapy.","output":"ABCL-274: Outcomes in Patients with Lymphoproliferative Diseases and COVID-19: Results of a Subgroup Analysis of the CHRONOS19 Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The respiratory epithelium functions as a central orchestrator to initiate and organize responses to inhaled stimuli.

Current serological tests developed for SARS-CoV-2 rely on traditional technologies such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and lateral flow assays, which may lack scalability to meet the demand of hundreds of millions of antibody tests in the coming year.

Upon mixing of the fusion protein, RBD-scFv with recovered COVID-19 patient serum and RBCs, we observed agglutination of RBCs, indicating the patient developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Given that the test uses methods routinely used in hospital clinical labs across the world, we anticipate the test can be rapidly deployed with only the protein reagent required at projected manufacturing cost at U.S. cents per test.

The body of evidence on COVID-19 has been increasing at an impressive pace, creating the need for a method to rapidly assess the current knowledge and identify key information. Gold standard methods such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses are regarded unsuitable because they have a narrow scope and are very time consuming. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the published scientific literature on COVID-19 and map the research evolution during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a PubMed search to analyze the titles, keywords, and abstracts of published papers on COVID-19. We used latent Dirichlet allocation modeling to extract topics and conducted a trend analysis to understand the temporal changes in research for each topic, journal impact factor (JIF), and geographic origin. RESULTS: Based on our search, we identified 16,670 relevant articles dated between February 14, 2020, and June 1, 2020. Of these, 6 articles were reports from peer-reviewed randomized trials on patients with COVID-19. We identified 14 main research topics, of which the most common topics were health care responses (2812/16,670, 16.86%) and clinical manifestations (1828/16,670, 10.91%). We found an increasing trend for research on clinical manifestations and protective measures and a decreasing trend for research on disease transmission, epidemiology, health care response, and radiology. Publications on protective measures, immunology, and clinical manifestations were associated with the highest JIF. The overall median JIF was 3.7 (IQR 2.6-5.9), and we found that the JIF for these publications declined over time. The top countries producing research were the United States, China, Italy, and the United Kingdom. CONCLUSIONS: In less than 6 months since the novel coronavirus was first detected, a remarkably high number of research articles on COVID-19 have been published. Here, we discuss and present the temporal changes in the available COVID-19 research during the early phase of the pandemic. Our findings may aid researchers and policy makers to form a structured view of the current COVID-19 evidence base and provide further research directions.","output":"Analysis of Scientific Publications During the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Topic Modeling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penelitian ini dilakukan dengan tujuan untuk mengetahui efektifitas pembelajaran online yang dilakukan oleh pendidik PAUD di tengan pandemi COVID-19 di Kota Kendari Penelitian ini dilakukan dengan metode penelitian survey deskriptif Sampel pada penelitian ini adalah pendidik PAUD se Kota Kendari Responden pada penelitian ini sebanyak 95 responden dan dilakukan mulai bulau Maret-Juni tahun 2020 Peneliti menggunakan teknik pengumpulan data berupa wawancara dan angket Efektivitas pembelajaran online pada Lembaga PAUD di tengah pandemi COVID-19 belum berjalan efektif Dari hasil temuan penelitian bahwa masih ada pendidik PAUD yang tidak menjalankan pembelajaran di tengah pandemi COVID-19 Masih banyak pendidik PAUD yang belum mahir menggunakan aplikasi pembelajaran online Metode pembelajaran yang digunakan masih dominan pemberian tugas kepada peserta didik Banyak pendidik PAUD yang tidak setuju dengan pembelajaran online karena tidak efektif dan tidak semua orang tua yang memiliki leptop atau HP untuk pembelajaran online","output":"Efektivitas Pembelajaran Online Pendidik Paud Di Tengah Pandemi COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the trends in MODIS/TERRA derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and its correlation with Land Surface Temperature (LST), Soil Moisture (SM), and precipitation over Gautam Buddh Nagar (India), during the period 2005C2018.

METHODS: This case-control study enrolled 323 Saudi adults with COVID-19, confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The participants were selected randomly between August 31, 2020, and July 1, 2020, from the Health Electronic Surveillance Network system, which contains the primary data on COVID-19 infections in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. The sample included 108 patients who died due to COVID-19 disease and 215 controls who recovered from it (1:2 ratio). The chi-square test, independent samples t-test, and logistic regression were used to perform the statistical analysis. RESULTS: Mortality was higher in older age patients with COVID-19 (mean = 65.4 years, standard deviation [SD] = 15.6) compared to recovered patients (mean = 39.5 years, SD = 14.8) (p<0.001) with a moderate effect size (eta squared = 0.06). Diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR] = 9.4), hypertension (OR = 8.6), cardiovascular disease (OR = 7.4), chronic kidney disease (OR = 3.3), and obesity (OR = 2.0) were significantly associated with death due to COVID-19. Using logistic regression analysis, older age and diabetes mellitus were the primary independent predictors of COVID-19 mortality. However, there was no significant association between a specific ABO blood group and mortality risk (P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Older age and the presence of co-morbidities, especially diabetes mellitus, increased the risk of death in patients with COVID-19.

Our objective was to compare Ortho Clinical Diagnostics (OCD) hs-cTnI assay to OCDs contemporary/conventional assay (cTnI ES) and another hs-cTnI assay (Abbott hs-cTnI) in samples obtained from different emergency departments (EDs). Two different sample types were evaluated (lithium heparin and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma) in a non-selected ED population (study 1, n = 469 samples) and in patients for which ED physicians ordered cardiac troponin testing (study 2, n = 1147 samples), from five different EDs. The incidence of injury in study 1 was higher with the OCD hs-cTnI assay (30.9%; 95% CI: 26.9 to 35.2) compared to that of the Abbott hs-cTnI (17.3%; 95% CI: 14.1 to 21.0) and the OCD cTnI ES (15.4%; 95% CI: 12.4 to 18.9) assays, with repeat testing identifying 4.8% (95% CI: 3.0 to 7.5) of the OCD hs-cTnI results with poor reproducibility.

Statistical analyses of the association between these data and queries, where appropriate were carried out.Results: One thousand nine hundred sixteen ophthalmologists were invited to participate in a survey between April 10th and April 30th, 2020 of which 1207 responded, which is a response rate of approximately 63%. The majority of respondents were from India, Indonesia, China, Singapore and the USA. Our study indicates a precipitous drop in surgical procedures with 46% (n = 538) ophthalmologists ceased to operate on their patients and almost 40% (n = 486) were doing less than 25% of their original number of surgeries.

We aimed to highlight differences among suicide completers before and after the onset of Greece's serious debt crisis of 2010 based exclusively on forensic data. The sample's size permitted a further elaboration by means of a time series analysis too. Data were collected from the Piraeus Department of Forensic Medicine for the period 1992-2016. We extracted information on sociodemographic parameters, psychiatric medication and alcohol intake, suicide method, place and month of suicide. The \\"after crisis onset\\" group (2011-2016) was significantly older (p = 0.039)-primarily due to differences in the 55-64 age group-, had more frequently used psychiatric medications (p < 0.001), less often alcohol (p = 0.001) and died more frequently by immolation (p = 0.001). These differences were-almost exclusively-due to changes regarding male suicidal behavior. Time series analysis indicates that no strong increasing trend in total (male + female) suicide count can be observed, despite a local increase in 2009-2010. Antidepressant-positive suicides show an increase after 2010, whereas alcohol-positive suicides show a decrease. Future predicted forecasts for antidepressant-positive suicides indicate a decrease (from 5.6 per year in 2018 to 4.3 per year in 2025) whereas an increase is predicted in alcohol-positive suicides (7.7 per year in 2017, 9.36 per year in 2025).

There are many different ND protocols, both in the scientific literature and also those employed in practice. All ND protocols involve devices sending beacons, and also listening for them. Protocols differ in terms of how the beacon transmissions and reception windows are scheduled, and the device sleeps in between consecutive transmissions and reception windows in order to save energy. A successful discovery constitutes a sending device's beacon overlapping with a receiving device's reception window. The goal of all ND protocols is to minimize the discovery latency. In spite of the ubiquity of ND protocols and active research on this topic for over two decades, the basic question\\"Given an energy budget, what is the minimum guaranteed ND latency?\\", however, still remains unanswered. Given the different kinds of protocols that exist, there has also been no standard way of comparing them and their performance. This paper, for the first time, answers the question on the best-achievable ND latency for a given energy budget. We derive discovery latencies for different scenarios, e.g., when both devices have the same energy budgets, and both devices have different energy budgets. We also show that some existing protocols can be parametrized such that they perform optimally. The fact that the parametrizations of some other protocols were optimal was not known before, and can now be established using our technique. Our results are restricted to the case when a few devices discover each other at a time, as is the case in most real-life scenarios. When many devices need to discover each other simultaneously, packet collisions play a dominant role in the discovery latency and how to analyze such scenarios need further study.","output":"Performance Limits of Neighbor Discovery in Wireless Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe pneumonia which shares several of the features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in Coronavirus disease 19 (Covid-19) for which there is no effective treatment, so far.

Most patients experience relief from GERD symptoms following initial repair; however, those suffering from recurrence can have symptoms severe enough to warrant another operation. Although the standard of care is to revise the fundoplication or convert to magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA) in addition to redo cruroplasty, it stands to reason that with an intact fundoplication, a repeat cruroplasty is all that is necessary to alleviate the patients' symptoms. In other words, only fix that which is broken. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with symptomatic hiatal hernia recurrence who underwent reoperation between January 2011 and September 2018 was conducted. Patients who received revisional cruroplasty alone were compared with cruroplasty plus some other revision (fundoplication revision, or takedown and MSA placement). Demographics, operative details, and postoperative outcomes were collected. RESULTS: There were 73 patients identified. Median time to recurrence after the first procedure was 3.7 (1.9-8.2) years. Thirty-two percent of the patients had GERD symptoms for more than 10 years. Twenty-six patients underwent cruroplasty only. Forty-seven patients underwent cruroplasty plus fundoplication revision. There were no significant differences in operative times (2.4 h cruroplasty alone, 2.8 h full revision, p = 0.75) or postoperative complications between the two groups. Patients had a mean follow-up time of 1.64 years. Of the 73 patients, 8 had subsequent hiatal hernia recurrence. The recurrence rate for patients with cruroplasty alone was 11%, and the recurrence rate for the full revision group was 12% (p = 1.00). CONCLUSION: Leaving an intact fundoplication alone at the time of revisional surgery did not adversely affect surgical outcomes. This data suggests a role for hernia-only repair for recurrent hiatal hernias.","output":"Less is more: cruroplasty alone is sufficient for revisional hiatal hernia surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare resource availability is potentially associated with COVID-19 mortality, and the potentially uneven geographical distribution of resources is a looming concern in the global pandemic.

Comparison of expression profiles of lung cell lines A549 (infected with either SARS-CoV-2 (with ACE2 expression)) or Influenza A virus (IAV)) and Calu3 (infected with SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV) revealed upregulation of the antiviral interferon signaling in all three viral infections. However, perturbations in inflammatory, mitochondrial, and autophagy processes were specifically observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Validation of findings from cell line data revealed perturbations in autophagy and mitochondrial processes in the infected human nasopharyngeal samples. Specifically, downregulation of mTOR expression, mitochondrial ribosomal, mitochondrial complex I, and lysosome acidification genes were concurrently observed in both infected cell lines and human datasets. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection impedes autophagic flux by upregulating GSK3B in lung cell lines, or by downregulating autophagy genes, SNAP29 and lysosome acidification genes in human samples, contributing to increased viral replication. Therefore, drugs targeting lysosome acidification or autophagic flux could be tested as intervention strategies. Additionally, downregulation of MTFP1 (in cell lines) or SOCS6 (in human samples) results in hyperfused mitochondria and impede proper interferon response. Coexpression networks analysis identifies correlated clusters of genes annotated to inflammation and mitochondrial processes that are misregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Finally, comparison of age stratified human gene expression data revealed impaired upregulation of chemokines, interferon stimulated and tripartite motif genes that are critical for antiviral signaling.

DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal cohort analysis from October 1, 2020 until February 14, 2021. SETTING: A total of 130 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Community Living Centers (CLC), analogous to nursing homes. INTERVENTION: Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. MEASUREMENTS: The primary measure is the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests among CLC residents. In a pooled analysis of weekly testing and vaccine data, the proportion of positive tests was compared for the unvaccinated, first dose, and second dose. For each CLC, we identified the week in which 50% of CLC residents were vaccinated (index week). The analysis aligned the index week for CLCs and examined the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests at the CLC level before and after. As a reference, we plotted the proportion of positive tests in nursing homes in the same county as the CLC using publicly reported data. RESULTS: Within the pooled VA CLCs, the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose was delivered to 50% of CLC residents within 1 week of availability and second dose within 5 weeks. Relative to the index week, the risk ratio of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests in the vaccinated relative to unvaccinated was significantly lower in Week 4 (relative risk 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.68).

Hence, cirrhosis may rather be a protective response to injury, where wound-healing processes are set to primarily repair the damaged liver. Although cirrhosis is clinically considered a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), comprehensive population-based studies demonstrate a very modest incidence, refuting the idea that cirrhosis progresses to HCC.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in patients admitted to the intensive care unit. We aimed toassess the incidence, risk factors and in-hospital outcomes of AKI in COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit Methods: : we conducted a retrospective observational study in intensive care unit of Tongji hospital, which was assigned responsibility for the treatments of severe COVID-19 patients by Wuhan government. The AKI was defined and staged based onKidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Mild AKI was defined as stage 1, and severe AKI was defined as stage 2 or stage 3. We used logistic regression analysis to evaluate AKI risk factors and the association between AKI and in-hospital mortality. Results: : A total of 150 patients with COVID-19 were included in our study. The median age of patients was 70 (interquartile range, 60-80) years and 62.7% were male. 70 (46.7%) patients developed AKI during hospitalization, corresponding to the 17.3% in stage 1 and 9.3% in stage 2 and 20.0% in stage 3, respectively. Compared to patients without AKI, patients with AKI had higher proportion of mechanical ventilation mortality and higher in-hospital mortality. 95.5% patients with severe AKI received mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality was up to 79.5%. Severe AKI was independently associated with high in-hospital mortality (OR: 4.30;95% CI: 1.83-10.10). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that high serum interleukin-6 (OR: 2.54;95%CI: 1.00-6.42) and interleukin-10 (OR: 3.02;95%CI: 1.17-7.82) were risk factors for severe AKI development.

Radical changes have been needed to prevent disruptions in patient care and medical education. METHODS: A web-based survey was sent to European Society for Pediatric Nephrology (ESPN) members via the ESPN mailing list to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on delivery of pediatric nephrology (PN) care and educational activities. There were ten questions with subheadings. RESULTS: Seventy-six centers from 24 countries completed the survey. The time period was between the beginning of the pandemic and May 30, 2020. The number of patients admitted in PN wards and outpatient clinics were significantly decreased (2.2 and 4.5 times, respectively). Telemedicine tools, electronic prescriptions, online applications for off-label drugs, and remote access to laboratory/imaging results were used in almost half of the centers. Despite staff training and protective measures, 33% of centers reported COVID-19 infected staff, and 29% infected patients. Difficulties in receiving pharmaceuticals were reported in 25% of centers. Sixty percent of centers suspended living-related kidney transplantation, and one-third deceased-donor kidney transplantation. Hands-on education was suspended in 91% of medical schools, and face-to-face teaching was replaced by online systems in 85%. Multidisciplinary training in PN was affected in 54% of the centers. CONCLUSIONS: This survey showed a sharp decline in patient admissions and a significant decrease in kidney transplantation. Telemedicine and online teaching became essential tools, requiring integration into the current system. The prolonged and fluctuating course of the pandemic may pose additional challenges necessitating urgent and rational solutions.

METHODS: cross sectional observational study, including patients seen one month after hospital discharge for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The patients underwent a multidimensional evaluation. Moreover, we performed dominant medial gastrocnemius ultrasound (US) to characterize their muscle mass and quality. RESULTS: two hundred fifty-nine individuals (median age 67, 59.8% males) were included in the study. COVID-19 survivors with reduced muscle strength had a lower muscle US thickness (1.6 versus 1.73 cm, p =0.02) and a higher muscle stiffness (87 versus 76.3, p = 0.004) compared to patients with normal muscle strength. Also, patients with reduced Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) scores had a lower muscle US thickness (1.3 versus 1.71 cm, p = 0.01) and a higher muscle stiffness (104.9 versus 81.07, p = 0.04) compared to individuals with normal SPPB scores. The finding of increased muscle stiffness was also confirmed in patients with a pathological value ( 4) at the sarcopenia screening tool SARC-F (103.0 versus 79.55, p < 0.001). Muscle stiffness emerged as a significant predictor of probable sarcopenia (adjusted OR 1.02, 95% C.I. 1.002 C 1.04, p = 0.03). The optimal ultrasound cut-offs for probable sarcopenia were 1.51 cm for muscle thickness (p= 0.017) and 73.95 for muscle stiffness (p = 0.004).

Social distancing measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease have greatly affected the functioning of societies and reduced or halted many activities with a risk of injury. The aim of this study was to report the effects of lockdown measures on trauma-related EMS calls in the Finnish capital area. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all EMS calls in the Helsinki University Hospital (HUH) catchment area between 1 January and 31 July 2020. Calls were identified from the HUH EMS database. Calls were grouped into pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown periods according to the restrictions set by the Finnish government and compared to the mean number of calls for the corresponding periods in 2018 and 2019. Statistical comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney U-test for weekly numbers and percentages. RESULTS: During the study period there was a total of 70,705 EMS calls, of which 14,998 (21.2%) were related to trauma; 67,973 patients (median age 61.6 years; IQR 35.3C78.6) were met by EMS. There was no significant change in the weekly number of total or trauma-related EMS calls during the pre-lockdown period. During the lockdown period, the number of weekly total EMS calls was reduced by 12.2% (p = 0.001) and the number of trauma-related calls was reduced by 23.3% (p = 0.004). The weekly number of injured patients met by EMS while intoxicated with alcohol was reduced by 41.8% (p = 0.002). During the post-lockdown period, the number of total and trauma-related calls and the number of injured patients intoxicated by alcohol returned to previous years levels.

(PNX?-14?) is a newly identified neuropeptide with potential anti-inflammatory effects in the gastrointestinal tract. In this study, we evaluated the protective effect of PNX-14 against the formation of experimental indomethacin (IND)-induced duodenal ulcer. Thirty-two? male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to the four following study groups: (1) negative control (2) IND (7.5 mg/kg subcutaneous IND), (3) famotidine (FA) (7.5 mg/kg subcutaneous IND followed by 40 mg/kg intraperitoneal? FA), and (4) PNX-14 (7.5 mg/kg subcutaneous IND followed by 50 /kg intraperitoneal? PNX-14). Outcome measures included macroscopic evaluation of duodenal lesion, serum levels of IL-1?, TNF-, IL-6, and IL-12, and tissue biochemical parameters of oxidative stress, including malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, superoxide dismutase (SOD) ?activity, and catalase activity. Results The macroscopic grade of duodenal lesions were significantly smaller in the PNX-14 group than in the IND group (p < 0.001). Serum inflammatory cytokines were significantly increased in the IND group. PNX-14 treatment significantly decreased the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (p < 0.0001). Oxidative contents (MDA and MPO activity) were significantly smaller in the PNX-14 group compared with the IND group (p < 0.0001), while anti-oxidative contents (SOD and catalase activity) were significantly more (p < 0.0001). PNX-14 was superior to FA in several anti-inflammatory properties, such as inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines and increasing the catalase activity. PNX-14 showed significant protective effects against the formation of IND-induced duodenal ulcers. These results suggest a promising therapeutic implication for PNX-14 in the treatment of gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders.","output":"Protective Effects of Phoenixin-14 Peptide in the Indomethacin-Induced Duodenal Ulcer: An Experimental Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a spectrum of clinical outcomes and diverse memory responses.

We tried to evaluate the impact of the previous percutaneous coronary intervention (p-PCI) for LAD on the clinical outcomes of MIDCAB in this study. METHODS: A total of 197 patients with isolated LAD disease underwent MIDCAB in our center from February 2009 to May 2020. 51 patients had the p-PCI for LAD and 146 patients did not. The primary outcome was the major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). RESULTS: The incidences of the perioperative outcomes were comparable between the two groups (p > .05). The median follow-up time was 48.0 months (interquartile range, 25.9-85.5 months). The incidences of MACE (p < .001) and myocardial infarction or recurrent angina (p < .001) were significantly higher in the p-PCI group than those in the non-PCI group. The estimated 5-year freedom from MACE in the p-PCI group was significantly lower (56.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 41.2%-71.0% vs. 83.4%, 95% CI: 76.7%-90.1%, p < .001). The previous LAD-PCI (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.664, 95% CI: 1.471-4.822, p = .001) and the history of peripheral arterial disease (HR: 3.145, 95% CI: 1.085-9.113, p = .035) were the independent predictors of MACE. The p-PCI group had a higher diseased graft rate than the non-PCI group (10.9% vs. 2.3%, p = .046).

ResultsJapanese government COVID-19 advisory board members were predominantly male (75.0%) and physicians (50.0%). Between 2019 and 2020, two members (10.0%) received a total of $819,244 in government research funding. Another five members (25.0%) received $419,725 in payments, including $223,183 in personal fees, from 28 pharmaceutical companies between 2017 and 2018. The average value of the pharmaceutical payments was $20,986 (standard deviation: $81,762). Further, neither the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare nor the Japanese Cabinet Secretariat disclosed financial or non-financial COI with industry. Further, the government and had no policies for managing COI among advisory board members. ConclusionsThis study found that the Japanese government COVID-19 advisory board had financial and non-financial COI with pharmaceutical companies and the government. Further, there were no rigorous COI management strategies for the COVID-19 advisory board members.

Addressing calls to explore the relationships between emotional-affective atmospheres and politics during the pandemic as well as to centre analyses of gendered violence within geography, this paper explores how women in the favelas of Mar, in Rio de Janeiro have developed mutual support, (self)-care and activism in the face of the crisis. Engaging with nascent debates on responses to COVID-19, together with feminist geographical work on resistance to gendered violence, the article adapts the notion of emotional communities developed by Colombian anthropologist, Myriam Jimeno, to examine how emotional bonds created among survivors of violence are reconfigured into political action. Drawing on qualitative research with 32 women residents and 9 community actors involved in two core community initiatives in Mar, the paper develops the idea of building reactive and transformative emotional-political communities at individual and collective levels to mitigate gendered violence and wider intersectional structural violence. Emotional-political community building is premised on grassroots activism among women and organisations that develops as part of compassionate (self)-care and the quiet rather than spectacular politics of change.

The positive sense RNA genome of JV is organised into ORF1 (non-structural proteins), ORF2 (major capsid protein) and ORF3 (minor capsid protein). The lack of a cell culture system for studying JV replication has meant that work to date has relied upon in vitro systems to study non-structural protein synthesis and processing. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Only two of the three major ORF1 proteins were identified (p110 and 2C) following in vitro translation of JV RNA, the N-term protein was not detected. The N-term encoding genomic sequence (5GS) was tested for IRES-like function in a bi-cistronic system and displayed no evidence of IRES-like activity. The site of translation initiation in JV was determined to be at the predicted nucleotide 22. Following the insertion of an epitope within the 5GS the JV N-term protein was identified in vitro and within RNA transfected cells. CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro transcription/translation system is currently the best system for analysing protein synthesis and processing in JV. Unlike similarly studied human noroviruses JV initially did not appear to express the N-terminal protein, presenting the possibility that the encoding RNA sequence had a regulatory function, most likely involved in translation initiation in an IRES-like manner. This was not the case and, following determination of the site of translation initiation the N-term protein was detected using an epitope tag, both in vitro and in vivo. Although slightly larger than predicted the N-term protein was detected in a processed form in vivo, thus not only demonstrating initial translation of the ORF1 polyprotein but also activity of the viral protease. These findings indicate that the block to noroviral replication in cultured cells lies elsewhere.","output":"Functional Analysis of the 5 Genomic Sequence of a Bovine Norovirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) designated COVID-19 as an international pandemic of disaster.

Clinical, biological and radiological data were collected, as well as treatments and outcomes. An unfavorable outcome was defined as death or transfer to intensive care unit. We compared the characteristics and outcomes between patients with and without antibiotics using propensity score matching. FINDINGS: Among the 222 patients included, 174 (78%) were on antibiotics. The univariate analysis showed that patients with antibiotics were significantly older, frailer and with a more severe presentation at admission.

Here, we fabricate a multilayered nanocoating around the fabric using laponite (LAP) with Cu(2+) ions (LAP-Cu(2+) nanocoating) two contradictory functions in one system: trapping proteinaceous pathogens and antibacterial. Due to the strong LAP-protein interaction, albumin and spike protein (S-protein) are trapped into the fabric when proteins are sprayed using a nebulizer. The protein-blocking performance of the nanocoated fabric is 9.55-fold higher than bare fabric. These trapping capacities are retained after rinsing and repeated adsorption cycles, showing reproducibility for air filtration. Even though the protein-binding occurred, the LAP-Cu(2+) fabric indicates antibacterial effect. LAP-Cu(2+) fabric has an equivalent air and water transmittance rate to that of bare fabric with a stability under physiological environment.

As reported from this laboratory, certain astrocytes in rat brain contain cisternae of the GA not only in perikarya, but also in processes. In order to further investigate which type of astrocytes contain GA in processes we conducted the present study using primary cultures of rat astrocytes and organelle specific antibodies against the GA and the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). While the perikarya of all cells contained elements of the GA, only a single process of a subset of type I astrocytes, negative to antibodies A2B5 and HNK-1, contained GA. In contrast, elements of the RER were found within perikarya and all processes. In order to confirm that the immunostained structures in processes indeed represent the GA, we exposed cultures to Brefeldin A (BFA), a secretion blocker which disperses the GA and redistributes it to the RER. We observed that BFA disrupted the GA of both perikarya and processes. However, astrocytes were resistant to prolonged incubations with BFA, while a similar treatment killed cultured fibroblasts and PC-12 cells. Furthermore, in astrocytes exposed to BFA for several days, the delicate network of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), was replaced by large perinuclear masses of the protein. These observations demonstrate that a subset of type I astrocytes have a single process with elements of the GA. We suggest that this specialization of the GA may be related to yet unrecognized secretory or protein processing functions of these cells. The resistance of astrocytes to BFA and the striking changes in their cytoskeleton induced by the drug, may contribute to studies on the mechanism(s) of action of BFA.","output":"Polarity of processes with Golgi apparatus in a subpopulation of type I astrocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a 55-year-old woman with severe idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure 71 mmHg, pulmonary vascular resistance 30 WU at diagnosis five months ago), who was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) and experienced a relatively mild course with symptoms resembling a common cold.

It is very significant to explore an optimal clinical trial management model during the outbreak period to provide reference and insight for other clinical trial centers worldwide. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the management strategies used to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on oncology clinical trials. METHODS: We implemented a remote management model to maintain clinical trials conducted at Beijing Cancer Hospital, which realized remote project approval, remote initiation, remote visits, remote administration and remote monitoring to get through two COVID-19 outbreaks in the capital city from February to April and June to July 2020. The effectiveness of measures was evaluated as differences in rates of protocol compliance, participants lost to follow-up, participant withdrawal, disease progression, participant mortality, and detection of monitoring problems. RESULTS: During the late of the first outbreak, modifications were made in trial processing, participant management and quality control, which allowed the hospital to ensure the smooth conduct of 572 trials, with a protocol compliance rate of 85.24% for 3718 participants across both outbreaks. No COVID-19 infections were recorded among participants or trial staff, and no major procedural errors occurred between February and July 2020. These measures led to significantly higher rates of protocol compliance and significantly lower rates of loss to follow-up or withdrawal after the second outbreak than after the first, without affecting rates of disease progression or mortality. The hospital provided trial sponsors with a remote monitoring system in a timely manner, and 3820 trial issues were identified.

This research principal aims were to (1) confirm the validity of the Generic Scale of Phubbing in Arabic (GSP), and (2) evaluate the association between phubbing and mental health (depression, anxiety and stress). A first cross-sectional study enrolled 203 participants to confirm the factor structure of the phubbing scale among Lebanese young adults. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was carried out on the whole sample using SPSS AMOS v.24 to confirm the four-factor structure of the GSP. The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) statistic, the comparative fit index (CFI) and the Tucker Lewis Index (TLI) were used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the model. RMSEA values 0.08 and  0.10 indicate a good and acceptable fit respectively. CFI and TLI values 0.90 indicate good model fit. A second cross-sectional study enrolled 461 respondents (18-29 years old) to conduct the multivariable analysis. The fit indices values were as follows: 2/df = 181.74/84 = 2.16, TLI = .92, CFI = .94 and RMSEA = .076 [95% CI .061-.091] respectively, indicating an excellent fit of the model. The results of the multiple linear regression using the ENTER model, when taking the phubbing score as the dependent variable, showed that female gender ( = 0.11; t(454) = 2.50; p = .013), more stress ( = 0.27; t(454) = 3.94; p < .001), more anxiety ( = 0.30; t(454) = 4.24; p < .001), and older age ( = 0.28; t(454) = 6.12; p < .001) were positively correlated with higher phubbing, or higher household crowding index ( = ?0.15; t(454) = ?3.62; p < .001) was significantly correlated with less phubbing. The results of this study were able to confirm the validity of the Arabic version of the GSP scale. This will allow Lebanese clinicians to use this validated tool to screen for the presence of the phubbing phenomenon within this age group.

OBJECTIVE Our aim was to examine the uptake of clinical trials that have changed axillary management in breast cancer patients at MSH and non-MSH cancer centers. METHODS The National Cancer Database was used to identify patients eligible for the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 and Z1071 trials, and mastectomy patients fulfilling the European AMAROS trial. Uptake of trial results (omission of axillary lymph node dissection) was analyzed between patients treated at MSHs and non-MSHs and adjusted for patient, tumor, and facility factors. MSHs were defined as the top decile of hospitals according to the proportion of Black and Hispanic patients treated. RESULTS Of 7167 patients eligible for Z0011, 4546 for Z0171, and 9433 for AMAROS from 2015 to 2016, clinical trial uptake was seen in 1195 (74.6%) MSH and 4056 (72.9%) non-MSH patients (p = 0.173) for Z0011, 588 (41.9%) MSH and 1366 (43.5%) non-MSH patients for Z1071 (p = 0.302), and 272 (11.7%) MSH and 996 (14.0%) non-MSH patients (p = 0.005) for AMAROS. On adjusted analyses, MSH status was not significant for uptake of any of the three trials. Black race, socioeconomic status, and insurance were not associated with clinical trial uptake. CONCLUSION The uptake of three landmark clinical trials of axillary management in breast cancer was not different at MSH and non-MSH centers despite adjustment for social determinants of health.

Suggestions have been made to extend their useful life by using a surgical mask as an outer barrier, but the physiological impact of this added barrier upon the wearer has not been studied. METHODS A surgical mask was worn over an N95 filtering facepiece respirator by 10 healthcare workers for 1 h at each of two work rates. Heart rate, respiratory rate, tidal volume, minute volume, oxygen saturation, transcutaneous carbon dioxide levels and respirator dead space gases were monitored and compared with controls (N95 filtering facepiece respirator without a surgical mask). Subjective perceptions of exertion and comfort were assessed by numerical rating scales. RESULTS There were no significant differences in physiological variables between those who used surgical masks and controls. Surgical masks decreased dead space oxygen concentrations of the filtering facepiece respirators at the lesser work rate (P = 0.03) and for filtering facepiece respirators with an exhalation valve at the higher work rate (P = 0.003). Respirator dead space oxygen and carbon dioxide levels were not harmonious with Occupational Safety and Health Administration workplace ambient atmosphere standards. Exertion and comfort scores were not significantly impacted by the surgical mask.

The study examined ten atypical patients out of 909 severe or critical patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Wuhan Union Hospital West Campus between 25 January 2020 and 10 February 2020. Data were obtained from the electronic medical records of severe or critical patients without respiratory symptoms or fever at onset. Outcomes were followed up to discharge or death. Among 943 COVID-19 patients, 909 (96.4%) were severe or critical type. Of the severe or critical patients, ten (1.1%) presented without respiratory symptoms or fever at admission. The median age of the ten participants was 63 years (interquartile range (IQR): 57C72), and seven participants were men. The median time from symptom onset to admission was 14 d (IQR: 7C20). Eight of the ten patients had chronic diseases.

Objectives: To evaluate the use of high-flow nasal cannula for COVID-19 on population-level mortality and ventilator availability. Methods: We constructed dynamical (deterministic) simulation models of high-flow nasal cannula and mechanical ventilation use for COVID-19 in the United States. Model parameters were estimated through consensus based on published literature, local data, and experience. We had the following two outcomes: 1) cumulative number of deaths and 2) days without any available ventilators. We assessed the impact of various policies for the use of high-flow nasal cannula (with or without early intubation) versus a scenario in which high-flow nasal cannula was unavailable. Results: The policy associated with the fewest deaths and the least time without available ventilators combined the use of high-flow nasal cannula for patients not urgently needing ventilators with the use of early mechanical ventilation for these patients when at least 10% of ventilator supply was not in use. At the national level, this strategy resulted in 10,000C40,000 fewer deaths than if high-flow nasal cannula were not available. In addition, with moderate national ventilator capacity (30,000C45,000 ventilators), this strategy led to up to 25 (11.8%) fewer days without available ventilators. For a 250-bed hospital with 100 mechanical ventilators, the availability of 13, 20, or 33 high-flow nasal cannulas prevented 81, 102, and 130 deaths, respectively.

This study investigates the association of meteorology and the new daily COVID-19 confirmed cases and the effects of the city lockdown on the variation in criteria air pollutants (CAPs) in Daegu. Ambient temperature and relative humidity were negatively correlated to the new daily cases and played an important role in the spread of COVID-19. Wind speed could enhance the virus transmission through the inhalation of aerosols and/or droplets and contact with fomites. The lockdown has directly decreased the concentrations of CAPs. In particular, reductions of 3.75% (PM10), 30.9% (PM2.5), 36.7% (NO2), 43.7% (CO), and 21.3% (SO2) between the period before and during the outbreak were observed over the entire city. An increase in O3 (71.1%) was affected by natural processes and photochemical formation other than the lockdown effects. The three central districts were the areas most affected by the virus and showed the highest reductions in CAPs (except for O3) during the outbreak. Apart from the influence of the lockdown, the decreasing trend in CAPs may be a result of the actions taken by the government to mitigate air pollutants nationwide since 2019.

Upon the hospital medical crisis unit request, the DYNAMO team was accountable to propose solutions for outflow. Under the crisis medical director's green light, the DYNAMO unit has opened flow between the hospital intensive care unit and step down units created de novo (public and private). DYNAMO is the outcome of the collaboration and joint preparation between the university medical department DREAM and RAID Tactical medical unit allowing the use of technical tools and adding the tactical spirit into the hospital frame. This collaboration has supported the transfer in secure conditions of about 100 patients across the intensive care units with a consistent distribution of patients in order to maintain the most efficient intensive care units impacted by the crisis able to accept an influx of new patients. To achieve this, the DYNAMO team defined medical criteria to determine a patient's eligibility to be transferred under the team transfer supervision.

We estimated the potential impact of trends in diabetes prevalence upon mortality and the future burden of dementia and disability in England and Wales. METHODS: We used a probabilistic multi-state, open cohort Markov model to integrate observed trends in diabetes, cardiovascular disease and dementia to forecast the occurrence of disability and dementia up to the year 2060. Model input data were taken from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, Office for National Statistics vital data and published effect estimates for health-state transition probabilities. The baseline scenario corresponded to recent trends in obesity: a 26% increase in the number of people with diabetes by 2060. This scenario was evaluated against three alternative projected trends in diabetes: increases of 49%, 20% and 7%. RESULTS: Our results suggest that changes in the trend in diabetes prevalence will lead to changes in mortality and incidence of dementia and disability, which will become visible after 10C15 years. If the relative prevalence of diabetes increases 49% by 2060, expected additional deaths would be approximately 255,000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 236,000C272,200), with 85,900 (71,500C101,600) cumulative additional cases of dementia and 104,900 (85,900C125,400) additional cases of disability. With a smaller relative increase in diabetes prevalence (7% increase by 2060), we estimated 222,200 (205,700C237,300) fewer deaths, and 77,000 (64,300C90,800) and 93,300 (76,700C111,400) fewer additional cases of dementia and disability, respectively, than the baseline case of a 26% increase in diabetes.

METHODS: Families of 73 typically developing children, 54 children born very preterm (VPT) and 73 children with congenital heart disease (CHD) from two prospective cohort studies were assessed prior to (mean age: 10.4 [SD: 1.2] years) and during (mean age: 12.8 [SD: 2.0] years) the pandemic, more specifically, in April/May 2020. Child well-being and family functioning were assessed with validated, parent-reported questionnaires and tested with linear mixed models. Group comparison of child distress and parental concerns related to medical implications of COVID-19 and homeschooling, assessed with 5-point Likert scales, was done with Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Children's psychological well-being and family functioning (both, p < 0.001) decreased significantly during the pandemic, irrespective of group. Children with CHD were reported to be more concerned about becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 than were others.

The addition of olanzapine (OLZ) 5 mg or 10 mg to the recommended triple antiemetic therapy has demonstrated superiority in antiemetic efficacy compared with the standard triplet therapy for a cisplatin-based HEC regimen. Although OLZ plus the triple antiemetic treatment may also be effective for patients on an AC-based HEC regimen, no study has investigated its efficacy at a lower dose of 5 mg. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: To assess whether 5 mg OLZ, as compared with placebo, in combination with triple combination therapy, significantly improves nausea and vomiting, we are conducting a randomised, parallel-group controlled clinical trial with a total of 500 patients at 15 study centres in Japan. The primary outcome is the complete response rate, defined as no emetic episodes and no use of rescue medication during 120 hours after the initiation of chemotherapy. Treatment group comparison for the primary endpoint will be done by using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the institutional review board of Juntendo University Hospital and relevant approval was obtained from all participating centres. All participants will be required to provide written informed consent. The trial results will be reported at conferences and in peer-reviewed journals.

The objective of this pilot study was to assess the quality of otoendoscopic images obtained by non-medical individuals and to determine the effect of a simple training protocol on image quality. METHODS Non-medical participants were recruited and asked to capture images of the tympanic membrane before and after completion of a training module, as well as complete a survey about their experience using the otoendoscope. Images were de-identified, randomized, and evaluated by 6 otolaryngologists who were blinded as to whether training had been performed prior to the image capture. Images were rated using a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS Completion of a training module resulted in a significantly higher percentage of tympanic membrane visible on otoendoscopic images, as well as increased physician confidence in identifying middle ear effusion/infection, cholesteatoma, and deferring an in-person otoscopy (P < .0001). However, even with improved image quality, in most cases, physicians reported that they would not feel comfortable using the images to for diagnosis or to defer an in-person examination. Most participants reported that the otoendoscope was simple to use and that they would feel comfortable paying for the device. CONCLUSIONS At-home otoendoscopes can offer a sufficient view of the tympanic membrane in select cases. The use of a simple training tool can significantly improve image quality, though often not enough to replace an in-person otoscopic exam.","output":"Otoendoscopes to Enhance Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immune system dysfunction is paramount in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and fatality rate.

METHODS: We conducted an online, cross-sectional social media survey from March 14 -April 1, 2020. We measured changes in social distancing behavior; experienced difficulties with daily activities (i.e., access to healthcare, childcare, obtaining essential food and medications); and level of concern regarding COVID-19 after the March 16 shelter-in-place announcement in the San Francisco Bay Area versus elsewhere in the U.S. RESULTS: In this non-representative sample, the percentage of respondents social distancing all of the time increased following the shelter-in-place announcement in the Bay Area (9.2%, 95% CI: 6.6, 11.9) and elsewhere in the U.S. (3.4%, 95% CI: 2.0, 5.0).

People infected with this highly contagious virus can present with clinically inapparent, mild, or severe disease. Currently, the virus infection in individuals and at the population level is being monitored by PCR testing of symptomatic patients for the presence of viral RNA. There is an urgent need for SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests to identify all infected individuals, irrespective of clinical symptoms, to conduct surveillance and implement strategies to contain spread. As the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is poorly conserved between SARS-CoVs and other pathogenic human coronaviruses, the RBD represents a promising antigen for detecting CoV-specific antibodies in people. Here we use a large panel of human sera (63 SARS-CoV-2 patients and 71 control subjects) and hyperimmune sera from animals exposed to zoonotic CoVs to evaluate RBD's performance as an antigen for reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. By day 9 after the onset of symptoms, the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen was highly sensitive (98%) and specific (100%) for antibodies induced by SARS-CoVs. We observed a strong correlation between levels of RBD binding antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in patients. Our results, which reveal the early kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, support using the RBD antigen in serological diagnostic assays and RBD-specific antibody levels as a correlate of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in people.","output":"The receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein is an immunodominant and highly specific target of antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By definition no model is perfect, and this also holds for biology and health sciences.

As it is not possible to ascertain the Covid status of the patient, hence EMS professionals are at the greatest risk of getting infected. The study aims to assess the level of clinical preparedness of EMS professionals and suggests recommendations to improve upon it. Objective: To assess the level of clinical preparedness amongst EMS professionals in tackling life threatening emergencies in suspected Covid 19 patients. Methodology: The study was conducted amongst 150 Emergency Medical Professionals in Pune, India. Respondents were asked to respond to each item using 5 point Likert scale. The Questionnaire was administered to the respondents through online mode after obtaining informed consent. Responding to all questions was mandatory. The respondents were given a period of two days to fill the questionnaire. Discussion: The present study was aimed at examining the current level of preparedness with regards to the disease after nearly a year of the pandemic. The result obtained in terms of knowledge were encouraging and pointed to the fact that the EMS professionals had received adequate training in identification of suspected cases and their initial management. Majority of the respondents suffered from high grade anxiety of contracting the infection.

Problems of lack of equity in child and youth MH services (CYMHS)-including, but not limited to, problems in inaccessibility and quality of services-are widespread. Characterizing the nature of equity in CYMHS is an ongoing challenge because the field lacks a consistent approach to conceptualizing equity. We will conduct a scoping review of how equity in MH services for children and youth has been defined, operationalized, and measured. Our objectives are to discover: (1) What conceptual definitions of equity are used by observational studies of CYMHS?; (2) What service characteristics of CYMHS care do indices of equity cover?; (3) What population dimensions have been used to operationalize equity?; (4) What statistical constructs have been used in indices that measure CYMHS equity?; and (5) What were the numerical values of those indices? METHODS The following databases will be searched: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials, CINAHL, EconLit, and Sociological Abstracts. Searches will be conducted from the date of inception to the end of the last full calendar year (December 2019). Studies will be included if they include an evaluation of a mental health service for children or youth (defined as those under 19 years of age) and which quantify variation in some aspect of child or youth mental health services (e.g., accessibility, volume, duration, or quality) as a function of socio-demographic and/or geographic variables. Study selection will occur over two stages. Stage one will select articles based on title and abstract using the liberal-accelerated method. Stage two will review the full texts of selected titles. Two reviewers will work independently on full-text reviewing, with each study screened twice using pre-specified eligibility criteria. One reviewer will chart study characteristics and indices to be verified by a second reviewer. Reviewers will resolve full-text screening and data extraction disagreements through discussion.

The majority of infected individuals have mild to moderate symptoms, but a significant proportion develops respiratory failure due to pneumonia. Thrombosis is another frequent manifestation of Covid-19 that contributes to poor outcomes. Vitamin K plays a crucial role in the activation of both pro- and anticlotting factors in the liver and the activation of extrahepatically synthesised protein S which seems to be important in local thrombosis prevention. However, the role of vitamin K extends beyond coagulation. Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a vitamin K-dependent inhibitor of soft tissue calcification and elastic fibre degradation. Severe extrahepatic vitamin K insufficiency was recently demonstrated in Covid-19 patients, with high inactive MGP levels correlating with elastic fibre degradation rates. This suggests that insufficient vitamin K-dependent MGP activation leaves elastic fibres unprotected against SARS-CoV-2-induced proteolysis. In contrast to MGP, Covid-19 patients have normal levels of activated factor II, in line with previous observations that vitamin K is preferentially transported to the liver for activation of procoagulant factors. We therefore expect that vitamin K-dependent endothelial protein S activation is also compromised, which would be compatible with enhanced thrombogenicity. Taking these data together, we propose a mechanism of pneumonia-induced vitamin K depletion, leading to a decrease in activated MGP and protein S, aggravating pulmonary damage and coagulopathy, respectively. Intervention trials should be conducted to assess whether vitamin K administration plays a role in the prevention and treatment of severe Covid-19.","output":"Vitamin K metabolism as the potential missing link between lung damage and thromboembolism in Coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundAn accurate measure of the impact of COVID-19 is the infection fatality ratio, or the proportion of deaths among those infected, which is independent of variable testing rates between nations. The risk of mortality from COVID-19 depends strongly on age and current single estimates of the infection fatality ratio do not account for differences in national age profiles. In addition, it is unclear whether age influences cumulative death trajectories, or if differences between regions are because of the effect and timing of public health interventions. Our objective is to determine whether (1) infection fatality ratios and (2) death trajectories are clustered into more than one group due to differences in national age profiles. MethodsNational age standardised infection fatality ratios were derived from age stratified estimates from China and population estimates from the World Health Organisation. The infection fatality ratios were clustered into groups using Gaussian mixture models. Trajectory analysis clustered cumulative death rates at two time points, 50 and 150 days after the first reported death. FindingsInfection fatality ratios from 201 nations were clustered into three groups: young, middle and older, with corresponding means (SD) of 0.20% (0.03%), 0.38% (0.11%) and 0.93% (0.21%). At 50 and 150 days, there were two and three clusters, respectively, of cumulative death trajectories from 122 nations with at least 25 deaths reported at 100 days. The first cluster had steadily increasing or stable cumulative death rates, while the second and third clusters had moderate and fast increases in rates, respectively. Fifty-eight nations changed cluster group membership between time points. There was an association between the infection fatality ratio clusters and the change in trajectory clusters between 50 and 150 days (p=0.014). ConclusionDifferences in national age profiles created three clusters in the COVID-19 infection fatality ratio, with the impact on younger nations less than the current estimate 0.5-1.0%.

Previous studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) are involved in the detoxification process. However, the functions of lncRNAs in regulating P450 gene expression in spirotetramat resistance in A. gossypii are unknown. RESULTS: In this study, we found CYP4CJ1, CYP6CY7, and CYP6CY21 expression levels to be significantly upregulated in a spirotetramat-resistant (SR) strain compared with a susceptible (SS) strain. Furthermore, knockdown of CYP4CJ1, CYP6CY7, and CYP6CY21 increased nymph and adult mortality in the SR strain following exposure to spirotetramat. Drosophila ectopically expressing CYP380C6, CYP4CJ1, CYP6DA2, CYP6CY7, and CYP6CY21 showed significantly decreased mortality after spirotetramat exposure, and CYP380C6, CYP4CJ1, and CYP6CY21 are putative targets of 6 lncRNAs. Silencing of lncRNAs MSTRG.36649.2/5 and MSTRG.71880.1 changed CYP6CY21 and CYP380C6 expression, altering the sensitivity of the SR strain to spirotetramat. Moreover, MSTRG.36649.2/5 did not compete for microRNA binding to regulate CYP6CY21 expression.

This best practice recommendations guide aims to list the existing technological solutions for the remote examination of a patient with hearing complaint, and to outline their benefits and, where applicable, their limitations. METHODS: The recommendations were developed both from the clinical experience of the medical experts who drafted the guide, and from an extensive review of the literature dealing with clinical practice recommendations for tele-audiology. Tele-audiometry solutions were identified on the basis of a search engine query carried out in April 2020, prior to verification of their availability on the European market. RESULTS: Video otoscopy solutions allow for the teletransmission of images compatible with a high-quality diagnosis, either by connecting via internet to a tele-health platform or using a smartphone or a tablet with an iOS or Android operating system. Using the same telecommunication methods, it is possible to remotely conduct a pure-tone audiometry test in accordance with standard practice, a speech-in-quiet or a speech-in-noise audiometry test, as well as objective measures of hearing. Clinical and paraclinical examinations can be accessed by the physician to be interpreted on a deferred basis (asynchronous tele-audiology). Examinations can also be conducted in real time in a patient, at any age of life, as long as a caregiver can be present during the installation of the transducers or the acoumetry. Tele-audiology solutions also find application in the remote training of future healthcare professionals involved in the management of deafness and hearing impairment.

The UK Armed Forces followed these to protect the force and ensure readiness to respond to various tasking requests. Clinical training has adapted to ensure geographically dispersed medical personnel are trained while social distancing is maintained. This study aimed to evaluate remote training for Combat Medical Technicians, Medical Assistants and Royal Air Force Medics (CMTs/MAs/RAFMs) during the COVID-19 pandemic and the views of trainers on how this should be delivered now and in the future. METHODS: A mixed quantitative and qualitative survey study was conducted to determine the experiences of a sample of Defence Medical Services personnel with remote training during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical and nursing officers involved in teaching CMTs/MAs/RAFMs were eligible to participate. RESULTS: There were 52 survey respondents. 78% delivered remote training to CMTs/MAs/RAFMs, predominantly using teleconferencing and small-group webinars. 70% of respondents report CMTs/MAs/RAFMs received more training during the COVID-19 pandemic than before. 94% of respondents felt webinar-based remote training should continue after COVID-19. The perceived benefits of webinar-based training included reduced travel time, more training continuity and greater clinical development of learners. CONCLUSIONS: The challenge of continuing education of medical personnel while maintaining readiness for deployment and adhering to the Government's social distancing measures was perceived to have been met within our study sample. This suggests that such an approach, along with clear training objectives and teleconferencing, may enable personnel to deliver high-quality training in an innovative and secure way.","output":"Remote training for combat medics during the COVID-19 era: lessons learnt for future crises?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Mineral Raw Materials Industry was hit severely by COVID-19.

The true impact of the disease in the pediatric population is still unknown. AIM: To describe the clinical characteristics, the use of resources and the evolution of children with COVID-19 in the Garrahan Pediatric Hospital, Buenos Aires, Argentina, in the first 20 weeks from the identification of the first case. METHODS: Descriptive, analytical, retrospective study. The epidemiological, clinical, evolutionary characteristics and the use of hospital resources of patients < 18 years with confirmed COVID-19 are described. In addition, these characteristics were compared according to whether they occurred in the first 10 epidemiological weeks from the first case of COVID-19 in the hospital or in the following ten weeks. RESULTS: n: 280. The median age was 83 months (IQR 33-144). 209 patients (74.6%) were hospitalized. The median days of hospitalization was 8 days (IQR 3-13). According to the WHO severity classification, there were 184 mild cases (65.7%), 3 moderate (1.1%), 16 severe (5.7%) and 20 critical patients (7.1%). The main reasons for admission to the ICU were not related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. When comparing the characteristics of the patients in the two periods, in the first period there was a higher frequency of underlying comorbidities, immunosuppressive treatment, the consultation was later and the patients had more requirements for ICU admission. Two children (0.7%) died in relation to the infection, both with severe comorbidities and severe bacterial coinfections. CONCLUSION: In this study, patients with underlying disease predominated. The mild form of the disease was the most frequent presentation. At the beginning of the pandemic, there were more patients under immunosuppressive treatment, the consultation was later and the hospitalization was more frequent, prolonged and with more serious clinical pictures.","output":"Epidemiological characteristics according to the progress of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a highly complex pediatric hospital in Argentina: a descriptive study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Transmission of infectious diseases is often prevented by quarantine and isolation of the populations at risk. These approaches restrict the mobility, social interactions, and daily activities of the affected individuals. In recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, quarantine and isolation are being adopted in many contexts, which necessitates an evaluation of global evidence on how such measures impact the mental health outcomes among populations. This umbrella review aimed to synthesize the available evidence on mental health outcomes of quarantine and isolation for preventing infectious diseases. METHODS: We searched nine major databases and additional sources and included articles if they were systematically conducted reviews, published as peer-reviewed journal articles, and reported mental health outcomes of quarantine or isolation in any population. RESULTS: Among 1,364 citations, only eight reviews met our criteria. Most of the primary studies in those reviews were conducted in high-income nations and in hospital settings. These articles reported a high burden of mental health problems among patients, informal caregivers, and healthcare providers who experienced quarantine or isolation. Prevalent mental health problems among the affected individuals include depression, anxiety, mood disorders, psychological distress, posttraumatic stress disorder, insomnia, fear, stigmatization, low self-esteem, lack of self-control, and other adverse mental health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This umbrella review found severe mental health problems among individuals and populations who have undergone quarantine and isolation in different contexts. This evidence necessitates multipronged interventions including policy measures for strengthening mental health services globally and promoting psychosocial wellbeing among high-risk populations.","output":"Mental health outcomes of quarantine and isolation for infection prevention: a systematic umbrella review of the global evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background A rapidly expanding pandemic of the new coronavirus has become the focus of global scientific attention. Data are lacking on the impact of the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on health-related quality of life among patients affected by primary antibody deficiencies (PADs). Objective To identify factors impacting the health-related-quality of life (HRQOL) among Italian patients affected by PADs switched to remote assistance at the time of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Methods The quality of life was surveyed in 158 patients with PADs by the Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire, a disease-specific tool, and by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, a generic tool to assess the risk of anxiety/depression. Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, we shifted all patients with PADs to home therapy, and activated remote visits. Questionnaires were sent by email 4 weeks later. Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire and 12-item General Health Questionnaire data scores were compared with the same set of data from a survey done in 2017. Results Of 210 patients, 158 (75%) agreed to participate. The quality of life was worse in the group of patients who were at risk of anxiety/depression at the study time. HRQOL was similar in patients forced to shift from hospital-based to home-based immunoglobulin treatment and in patients who continued their usual home-based replacement. The risk of anxiety/depression is associated with pandemia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and with patients' fragility, and not with related clinical conditions associated with common variable immune deficiencies. Anxiety about running out of medications is a major new issue. Conclusions The coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic impacted HRQOL and the risk of anxiety/depression of patients with PADs.

The preparation of a sample is known to have an effect on the representation of virus sequences within the metagenomic dataset yet comparatively little attention has been given to this. Physical enrichment techniques are often applied to samples to increase the number of viral sequences and therefore enhance the probability of detection. With the exception of virus ecology studies, there is a paucity of information available to researchers on the type of sample preparation required for a viral metagenomic study that seeks to identify an aetiological virus in an animal or human diagnostic sample. A review of published virus discovery studies revealed the most commonly used enrichment methods, that were usually quick and simple to implement, namely low-speed centrifugation, filtration, nuclease-treatment (or combinations of these) which have been routinely used but often without justification. These were applied to a simple and well-characterised artificial sample composed of bacterial and human cells, as well as DNA (adenovirus) and RNA viruses (influenza A and human enterovirus), being either non-enveloped capsid or enveloped viruses. The effect of the enrichment method was assessed by both quantitative real-time PCR and metagenomic analysis that incorporated an amplification step. Reductions in the absolute quantities of bacteria and human cells were observed for each method as determined by qPCR, but the relative abundance of viral sequences in the metagenomic dataset remained largely unchanged. A 3-step method of centrifugation, filtration and nuclease-treatment showed the greatest increase in the proportion of viral sequences. This study provides a starting point for the selection of a purification method in future virus discovery studies, and highlights the need for more data to validate the effect of enrichment methods on different sample types, amplification, bioinformatics approaches and sequencing platforms.

The success of such interventions depends on the antibody potency in such plasma donations, but little information on the collection of potent units is currently available. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 8749 plasma units, collected from April until September 2020 from first-time U.S. COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors, were characterized for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by Abbott chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA). The period between COVID-19 onset until donation and donor age, ethnicity, sex, and COVID-19 severity were evaluated against the obtained signal (index S/C). RESULTS: A marked decrease in mean index S/C was seen over the plasma collection period surveyed, which was significantly correlated to decreases in mean plasma donor age (p < .0001; R2 = .726) and percentage of donations obtained from COVID-19 convalescent patients who had been hospitalized (p = .001; R2 = .4426). The highest titer plasma units were obtained soon after convalescence from COVID-19 patients who required hospitalization, from advanced age donors, and from Black/African/Hispanic American versus White/Caucasian ethnicities, whereas there was no effect of donor sex on the values obtained with the Abbott CMIA. CONCLUSION: Since the onset of the pandemic, the average SARS-CoV-2 IgG values of first-time U.S. COVID-19 convalescent plasma donations have significantly dropped, mainly due to donations from progressively younger aged donors who tend to experience less severe COVID-19.","output":"Longitudinal analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 8000 U.S. first-time convalescent plasma donations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A viral metagenomics study was conducted in beef, pork, and chicken sold in supermarkets from Southern Brazil.

The results show that 92.80% of farmers face the shock of multiple livelihood risks. The main livelihood risks of farmers are family capacity building risk, health risk and social risk. When faced with multiple livelihood risks, farmers have the strongest preference to give priority to health risks, followed by family capacity building risks and social risks. Among them, farmers health risk coping preferences are stronger in farming areas than those in purely pastoral and farming-pastoral areas. There are differences in the factors for farmers preferences for coping with different livelihood risks. Human capital is a key factor for health risk coping preferences.

Graft dysfunction or rejection depends on the orchestrated prevention of infection(s) and the level of immune suppression. More recent reports underlined the role and pathogenicity of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in lung transplant recipients and the double-edged sword of maintaining antiviral immune responses versus guided immune suppression to avoid graft rejection. We present data concerning the nature of the cellular response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and CMV, the subsequent use of cellular therapy in antiviral treatment modalities and discuss the role of H1N1 infection and other viral infections in lung transplantation recipients. RECENT FINDINGS Patients after lung transplantation showed a similar susceptibility to H1N1 infections as compared to the local, healthy community. After initial recovery and oseltamivir treatment, lung transplantation patients developed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. The genetic background of lung transplant recipients, defined by polymorphism in immune molecules, contributes to increased risk of CMV disease; CMV induces local pro-inflammatory chemokines (CXCL10). Anti-CMV prophylaxis does not impact on anti-CMV-directed cellular immune responses, defined by IFN and TNF production. Asymptomatic EBV carriers showed higher numbers of EBV-reactive T cells. High EBV load carriers showed T cells with immune-exhaustion markers and decreased IFN production. Anti-CMV-directed cellular therapy may aid to better manage CMV-associated complications after lung transplantation.

Predisposition to obesity early in life is profoundly impacted by feeding habits during the preschool years. The early care and education (ECE) setting impacts children's health by providing daily meals. OBJECTIVE The goal of this study was to identify whether or not health disparities in foods and beverages served in ECE programs in Georgia exist based on socioeconomic, demographic and geographic variables. METHODS A random sample was drawn from 3054 ECE programs across the state of Georgia. The likelihood of serving specific foods and beverages in ECE programs in the previous day was measured. Percentages and frequencies, logistic regressions, Spearman's rho and Odds ratio tests determined outcomes. RESULTS A total of 974 surveys were returned. Data were stratified based on the income level of the participant families, race of enrolled children and geographic location of the ECE program. Disparities existed between programs based on race of enrolled children and geographic location. For example, although the odds of providing sweets increased by 0.6% as the percentage of Black children enrolled increased, the provision of healthier foods, such as the odds of providing fruits (P = .001), vegetables (P = .001) and protein (P = .001) also increased. However, after results were adjusted for covariates findings did not remain significant.

Overall, our simulation results indicate that temporary (1 year) shocks in the economy will lead to a fall in output but a quick recovery, whereas persistent shocks can lead to a full-blown economic crisis. We find that the impact of these shocks can be lowered by public intervention in the form of fiscal stimulus, which can reduce the impact of these shocks and also improve the speed of economic recovery. We also address the economic consequences of financing this stimulus, and whether such a policy response is feasible.

No significant association was observed between adherence to any of the IPC measures and PPE (personal protective equipment) adopted by the HCW during the recent contact with COVID-19 patients and seroconversion. ConclusionA high seropositivity and seroconversion could be either due to exposure to COVID-19 patients or concurrent immunization against COVID-19 disease. In this study the strongest association of seropositivity and seroconversion was observed with recent vaccination. IPC measures were practiced by almost all the HCW in these settings, and thus were not found to be affecting seroconversion. Further study using anti N antibodies serology, which are positive following vaccination may help us to find out the reason for the seropositivity and seroconversion in HCW.","output":"Assessment of Potential Risk Factors for COVID-19 among Health Care Workers in a Health Care Setting in Delhi, India -A Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading worldwide. Drug therapy is one of the major treatments, but contradictory results of clinical trials have been reported among different individuals. Furthermore, comprehensive analysis of personalized pharmacotherapy is still lacking. In this study, analyses were performed on 47 well-characterized COVID-19 drugs used in the personalized treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Clinical trials with published results of drugs use for COVID-19 treatment were collected to evaluate drug efficacy. Drug-to-Drug Interactions (DDIs) were summarized and classified. Functional variations in actionable pharmacogenes were collected and systematically analysed. Gene Score and Drug Score were defined and calculated to systematically analyse ethnicity-based genetic differences, which are important for the safer use of COVID-19 drugs. RESULTS: Our results indicated that four antiviral agents (ritonavir, darunavir, daclatasvir and sofosbuvir) and three immune regulators (budesonide, colchicine and prednisone) as well as heparin and enalapril could generate the highest number of DDIs with common concomitantly utilized drugs. Eight drugs (ritonavir, daclatasvir, sofosbuvir, ribavirin, interferon alpha-2b, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and ceftriaxone had actionable pharmacogenomics (PGx) biomarkers among all ethnic groups. Fourteen drugs (ritonavir, daclatasvir, prednisone, dexamethasone, ribavirin, HCQ, ceftriaxone, zinc, interferon beta-1a, remdesivir, levofloxacin, lopinavir, human immunoglobulin G and losartan) showed significantly different pharmacogenomic characteristics in relation to the ethnic origin of the patient. CONCLUSION: We recommend that particularly for patients with comorbidities to avoid serious DDIs, the predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM, 3 PM) strategies have to be applied for COVID-19 treatment, and genetic tests should be performed for drugs with actionable pharmacogenes, especially in some ethnic groups with a higher frequency of functional variations, as our analysis showed. We also suggest that drugs associated with higher ethnic genetic differences should be given priority in future pharmacogenetic studies for COVID-19 management. To facilitate translation of our results into clinical practice, an approach conform with PPPM/3 PM principles was suggested. In summary, the proposed PPPM/3 PM attitude should be obligatory considered for the overall COVID-19 management.

Viral clearance was similar in wild-type and PAFR-/- mice, and influenza virus was completely removed from the lungs at the time mice were inoculated with S. pneumoniae (day 14 after influenza infection). PAFR-/- mice displayed a significantly reduced bacterial outgrowth in their lungs, a diminished dissemination of the infection, and a prolonged survival.

AREAS COVERED Multiple chemical approaches have been developed to increase the conformational and metabolic stabilities of helical peptides and to improve their biomedical potential. After a brief overview of these technologies and the most recent developments, this review will focus on the main therapeutic areas and targets and will discuss their promise. EXPERT OPINION Potential benefits associated with increased helix stability extend beyond simple affinity enhancement. Some peptidomimetic helices are being endowed with features desirable for cellular activity such as increased resistance to proteolysis and/or cell permeability.

METHODS During May 2003 to October 2010, 44 consecutive patients (26 male and 18 female) received curative lung RF ablation for 51 recurrent NSCLC (mean diameter 1.70.9 cm, range 0.6 to 4.0) after surgical intervention. Safety, tumor progression rate, overall survival, and recurrence-free survival were evaluated. Prognostic factors were evaluated in multivariate analysis. RESULTS A total of 55 lung RF sessions were performed. Pneumothorax requiring pluerosclerosis (n=2) and surgical suture (n=1) were the only grade 3 or 4 adverse events (5.5%, 3 of 55). During mean follow-up of 28.620.3 months (range 1 to 98), local tumor progression was found in 5 patients (11.4%, 5 of 44). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 97.7, 72.9, and 55.7%, respectively. The 1- and 3-year recurrence-free survival rates were 76.7 and 41.1%, respectively. Tumor size and sex were independent significant prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. The 5-year survival rates were 73.3% in 18 women and 60.5% in 38 patients who had small tumors measuring3 cm.

The growth in personal access to telecommunications technology meant an unprecedented number of people in the United States and around the world had access to the equipment and technology that would make virtual care possible from the home. As the mass implementation of telemedicine unfolded, it became quickly apparent that scaling up the use of telemedicine presented considerable new challenges, some of which worsened disparities.

We also tried to identify symptom clusters among mild COVID-19 patients. Fifty-seven patients admitted at a tertiary care centre after a positive RT-PCR report over a period of 2 months, were enrolled in the study. Details of presentation, history of illness, laboratory investigations and disease outcomes were recorded from documented medical records and discharge slip. The patients were contacted (telephonically) at 30 days after discharge and enquired regarding persistent symptoms, if any. Follow up data at 30 days post-discharge was available for 53 patients.

On the basis of additional evidence, in July 2019, the World Health Organization recommended dolutegravir for all adults and adolescents living with HIV. OBJECTIVE To describe dolutegravir uptake and disparities by sex and age group in LMICs. DESIGN Observational cohort study. SETTING 87 sites that began using dolutegravir in 11 LMICs in the Asia-Pacific; Caribbean, Central and South America network for HIV epidemiology (CCASAnet); and sub-Saharan African regions of the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) consortium. PATIENTS 134 672 patients aged 16 years or older who received HIV care from January 2017 through March 2020. MEASUREMENTS Sex, age group, and dolutegravir uptake (that is, newly initiating ART with dolutegravir or switching to dolutegravir from another regimen). RESULTS Differences in dolutegravir uptake among females of reproductive age (16 to 49 years) emerged after the safety signal. By the end of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of dolutegravir uptake among females 16 to 49 years old was 29.4% (95% CI, 29.0% to 29.7%) compared with 57.7% (CI, 57.2% to 58.3%) among males 16 to 49 years old. This disparity was greater in countries that began implementing dolutegravir before the safety signal and initially had highly restrictive policies versus countries with a later rollout. Dolutegravir uptake was similar among females and males aged 50 years or older. LIMITATION Follow-up was limited to 6 to 8 months after international guidelines recommended expanding access to dolutegravir. CONCLUSION Substantial disparities in dolutegravir uptake affecting females of reproductive age through early 2020 are documented. Although this disparity was anticipated because of country-level restrictions on access, the results highlight its extent and initial persistence.

Two surveys were conducted in 2009-2010: a descriptive study in all 96 LBMs of an area encompassing approximately 98% of the Malian poultry population and a network analysis study in Sikasso county, the main poultry supplying county for the capital city Bamako. Regarding LBMs' characteristics, risk factors for the presence of AI and ND viruses (being open every day, more than 2 days before a bird is sold, absence of zoning to segregate poultry-related work flow areas, waste removal or cleaning and disinfecting less frequently than on a daily basis, trash disposal of dead birds and absence of manure processing) were present in 80-100% of the LBMs. Furthermore, LBMs tended to have wide catchment areas because of consumers' preference for village poultry meat, thereby involving a large number of villages in their supply chain.

COVID-19 identification is a difficult assignment that constantly demands a careful analysis of a patient's clinical images, as COVID-19 is found to be very alike to pneumonic viral lung infection. In this paper, a transfer learning model to accelerate prediction processes and to assist medical professionals is proposed. Finally, the main purpose is to do an accurate classification between Covid-19, pneumonia and, healthy lungs using CXR and CT images. Methods: Learning transfer gives the possibility to find out about this new illness COVID-19, using the knowledge we have about the pneumonia virus. This demonstrates the apprehensiveness achieved from a new architecture trained to detect virus-related pneumonia that must be transferred for COVID-19 detection. Transfer learning presents a considerable dissimilarity in results when compared to the result of traditional groupings. It is not necessary to create a separate model for the classification of COVID-19. This simplifies complicated issues by adopting the available model for COVID-19 determination. Automated diagnosis of COVID-19 using Haralick texture features is focused on segmented lung images and problematic lung patches. Lung patches are necessary for the augmentation of COVID-19 image data.

This study tested the hypothesis whether the neutrophil compartment displays characteristics of hyperinflammation in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, a prospective study was performed on all patients with suspected COVID-19 presenting at the emergency room of a large academic hospital. Blood drawn within 2 d after hospital presentation was analyzed by point-of-care automated flow cytometry and compared with blood samples collected at later time points. COVID-19 patients did not exhibit neutrophilia or eosinopenia.

Although demographic and clinical parameters such as sex, age, comorbidities, genetic background and various biomarkers have been identified as risk factors, there is an unmet need to predict the risk and onset of severe inflammatory disease leading to poor clinical outcomes. In addition, very few mechanistic biomarkers are available to inform targeted treatment of severe (auto)-inflammatory conditions associated with COVID-19. Calprotectin, also known as S100A8/S100A9, MRP8/14 (Myeloid-Related Protein) or L1, is a heterodimer involved in neutrophil-related inflammatory processes. In COVID-19 patients, calprotectin levels were reported to be associated with poor clinical outcomes such as significantly reduced survival time, especially in patients with severe pulmonary disease.

The governments of affected countries have implemented various measures to limit the spread of the virus. The starting point of this paper is the different government approaches, in terms of promulgating new legislative regulations to limit the virus diffusion and to contain negative effects on the populations. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to study how the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is linked to the government policies, and to analyse how different policies have produced different results on public health. METHODS: Considering the official data provided by 4 countries (Italy, Germany, Sweden and Brazil) and from the measures implemented by their respective governments, we built an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to study the effects that these measures will have over time on different variables such as the total number of COVID-19 cases, intensive care unit (ICU) bed occupancy rates, and recovery and case fatality rates. The model we implemented provides for the possibility of modifying some starting variables, and it was thus possible to study the effects that some policies (such as keeping the national borders closed or the increase in ICU beds) would have had on the spread of the infection. RESULTS: The 4 considered countries have adopted different containment measures for SARS-CoV-2, and the forecasts provided by the model for the considered variables have given different results. Italy and Germany seem to be able to limit the spread of the infection and any eventual \\"second wave\\", while Sweden and Brazil do not seem to have the situation under control. This situation is reflected also in the forecasts of pressure on the National Health Services, which see Sweden and Brazil with a high occupancy rate of ICU beds also in the coming months, with a consequent high number of deaths. CONCLUSIONS: In line with what we expected, the obtained results show that the countries that have taken very restrictive measures in terms of limiting the mobility of the population have managed, more successfully than others, to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the model demonstrates that herd immunity cannot be reached even in countries which have relied on a strategy without strict containment measures.

Then, participants completed a questionnaire regarding perceptions and cognitive processing of the message. Results revealed that, compared to text, disgusted face emoji increased risk perceptions and avoidance behavior. In terms of emotion, smiling face emoji motivated participants to feel more emotions related to sanitation. In turn, positive feelings decreased elaboration likelihood.

A typical scenario is that of targeted drug delivery systems, which makes use of biological nanomachines close to a biological target, able to release molecules in the diseased area. In this paper, we propose a simple but reliable receiver model for diffusion-based molecular communication systems tackling the time needed for analyzing such a system. The proposed model consists of using an equivalent markovian queuing model, which reproduces the aggregate behavior of thousands of receptors spread over the receiver surface. It takes into account not only the fact that the absorption of molecules can occur only through receptors, but also that absorption is not an instantaneous process and may require a significant time during which the receptor is not available to bind to other molecules. Our results, expressed in terms of number of absorbed molecules and average number of busy receptors, demonstrate that the proposed approach is in good agreement with results obtained through particle-based simulations of a large number of receptors, although the time taken for obtaining the results with the proposed model is an order of magnitudes lower than the simulation time.

Among these, the trypsin-like serine proteases comprise one of the best characterized subfamilies due to their essential roles in blood coagulation, food digestion, fibrinolysis, or immunity. Trypsin-like serine proteases possess primary substrate specificity for basic amino acids. Most of the well-characterized trypsin-like proteases such as trypsin, plasmin, or urokinase are soluble proteases that are secreted into the extracellular environment. At the turn of the millennium, a number of novel trypsin-like serine proteases have been identified that are anchored in the cell membrane, either by a transmembrane domain at the N- or C-terminus or via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage. Meanwhile more than 20 membrane-anchored serine proteases (MASPs) have been identified in human and mouse, and some of them have emerged as key regulators of mammalian development and homeostasis. Thus, the MASP corin and TMPRSS6/matriptase-2 have been demonstrated to be the activators of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and key regulator of hepcidin expression, respectively.

Great efforts have been put into anti-COVID-19 vaccine generation in an effort to protect the world population and block SARS-CoV-2 spread. To validate the protective efficacy of the vaccination campaign and effectively control the pandemy, it is necessary to quantify the neutralizing antibodies induction by vaccination, since they have been established to be a correlate of protection. In this work a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay, based on a replication incompetent lentivirus expressing an adapted form of CoV-2 S protein and an ACE2/TMPRSS2 stably expressing cell line, have been minimized in term of protocol steps without loss of accuracy. The goal of the present simplified neutralization system is to improve SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign by means of an easy and accessible approach to be performed in any medical laboratory, maintaining the sensitivity and quantitative reliability of classical serum neutralization assays.

In contrast to the oxidation process, free-radical fragmentation reactions are more effectively inhibited by oxidizing agents than reducing agents. Therefore, the use of substances possessing both reducing and oxidizing properties, such as natural and synthetic quinones, bioflavonoids, curcuminoids, should reduce the probability of biomolecule destruction by oxidation as well as free-radical fragmentation processes.HighlightsCOVID-19 is accompanied by the iron release from the heme and ?silent? hypoxiaROS initiate fragmentation reactions of biomolecules under conditions of hypoxiaBlocking of fragmentation process by oxidizers may lead to mitigation of COVID-19.","output":"Potential role of free-radical processes in biomolecules damage during COVID-19 and ways of their regulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For the training of interpersonal skills, such as those required in the medical field, virtual agents can provide a safe environment for practice.

Materials and Methods We mined and reverse-geocoded 269,556 coronavirus-related social media postings on Twitter from January 23rd to March 25th, 2020. We then ranked tweets based on the socioeconomic status of the county they originated from using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI); that we also used to identify areas with high initial disease counts (\\"hotspots\\"). We applied topic modeling on the tweets to identify chief concerns and determine their evolution over time. We also investigated how topic proportions varied based on ADI and between hotspots and non-hotspots. Results We identified 45 topics, which shifted from early-outbreak-related content in January, to the presidential election and governmental response in February, to lifestyle changes in March. Highly resourced areas (low ADI) were concerned with stocks, social distancing, and national-level policies, while high ADI areas shared content with negative expression, prayers, and discussion of the CARES Act economic relief package. Within hotspots, these differences stand, with the addition of increased discussion regarding employment in high ADI versus low ADI hotspots. Discussion Topic modeling captures the major concerns in COVID-19-related discussion on a social media platform in the early months of the pandemic. Our study extends previous studies that utilized topic modeling on COVID-19 related tweets and linked the identified topics to socioeconomic status using ADI. Comparisons between low and high ADI areas indicate differential Twitter discussions, corresponding to greater concern with economic hardship and impacts of the pandemic in less resourced communities, and less focus on general public health messaging. Conclusion This work demonstrates a novel framework for assessing differential topics of conversation correlating to income, education, and housing disparities. This, with integration of COVID-19 hotspots, offers improved analysis of crisis response on Twitter. Such insight is critical for informed public health messaging campaigns in future waves of the pandemic, which should focus in part specifically on the interests of those who are most vulnerable in the lowest resourced health settings.","output":"COVID-19 Twitter-based analysis reveals differential concerns across areas with socioeconomic disparities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a worldwide catastrophe, thoroughly challenging the healthcare systems A growing number of victims suffer from a remarkable acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that necessitates admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), but there are no satisfactory treatments Various gas therapies including nitric oxide, ozone, hyperbaric oxygen, hydrogen, and heliox have been employed in the fight against the pandemic and have improved clinical outcomes However, the potential roles of these gases in COVID-19 treatment need to be verified in well-designed randomized controlled trials This paper reviews advances in gaseous therapy of COVID-19","output":"Promising gas therapies for severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Automatic exploit generation for heap vulnerabilities is an open challenge.

During the national lockdown of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain, we developed and launched a Web App (Gestioemocional.cat) to promote emotional self-care in the general population and facilitate contact with healthcare professionals. Methods: Gestioemocional.cat targeted all individuals aged 18 years or more and was designed by adapting the contents of a mobile App for adjuvant treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (i.e., the PTSD Coach App) to the general population and the pandemic/lockdown scenario. We retrospectively assessed the utilization pattern of the Web App using data systematically retrieved from Google Analytics. Data were grouped into three time periods, defined using a join point analysis of COVID-19 incidence in our area: first wave, between-wave period, and second wave. Results: The resulting Web App, maintains the navigation structure of the PTSD Coach App, with three main modules: tools for emotional self-care, a self-assessment test, and professional resources for on-demand contact. The self-assessment test combines the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and offers professional contact in the advent of a high level of depression and anxiety; contact is prioritized according to a screening questionnaire administered at the time of obtaining individual consent to be contacted. The tools for emotional self-care can be accessed either on-demand or symptom-driven. The utilization analysis showed a high number of weekly accesses during the first wave. In this period, press releases regarding critical events of the pandemic progression and government decisions on containment measures were followed by a utilization peak, irrespective of the sense (i.e., positive or negative) of the information. Positive information pieces (e.g., relaxation of containment measures due to a reduction of COVID-19 cases) resulted in a sharp increase in utilization immediately after information release, followed by a successive decline in utilization. The second wave was characterized by a lower and less responsive utilization of the Web App. Conclusions: mHealth tools may help the general population coping with stressful conditions associated with the pandemic scenario.

During periods of crisis communication can become strained for patients and their families. We aimed to evaluate the rapid implementation of this role to provide guidance if it was required in the future and to explore the potential for this to become a standard role. Design: Service evaluation Setting: Single National Health Service hospital in London. Methods: Semi-structured video interviews with a convenience sample of 12 participants.

Genetically diverse SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been detected or isolated from bats, and some of these viruses have been demonstrated to utilize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor and to have the potential to spill over to humans. A pan-sarbecovirus vaccine that provides protection against SARSr-CoV infection is urgently needed. In this study, we evaluated the protective efficacy of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine against recombinant SARSr-CoVs carrying two different spike proteins (named rWIV1 and rRsSHC014S, respectively). Although serum neutralizing assays showed limited cross-reactivity between the three viruses, the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine provided full protection against SARS-CoV-2 and rWIV1 and partial protection against rRsSHC014S infection in human ACE2 transgenic mice. Passive transfer of SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated mouse sera provided low protection for rWIV1 but not for rRsSHC014S infection in human ACE2 mice. A specific cellular immune response induced by WIV1 membrane protein peptides was detected in the vaccinated animals, which may explain the cross-protection of the inactivated vaccine. This study shows the possibility of developing a pan-sarbecovirus vaccine against SARSr-CoVs for future preparedness. IMPORTANCE The genetic diversity of SARSr-CoVs in wildlife and their potential risk of cross-species infection highlight the necessity of developing wide-spectrum vaccines against infection of various SARSr-CoVs. In this study, we tested the protective efficacy of the SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine (IAV) against two SARSr-CoVs with different spike proteins in human ACE2 transgenic mice. We demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 IAV provides full protection against rWIV1 and partial protection against rRsSHC014S. The T-cell response stimulated by the M protein may account for the cross protection against heterogeneous SARSr-CoVs. Our findings suggest the feasibility of the development of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines, which can be a strategy of preparedness for future outbreaks caused by novel SARSr-CoVs from wildlife.","output":"Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Shows Cross-Protection against Bat SARS-Related Coronaviruses in Human ACE2 Transgenic Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most patients with infectious diseases, including biologic warfare casualties, can be safely transported by aeromedical evacuation (AE) using standard precautions.

Here, we review the available literature on newborns born to infected mothers and show that newborns of mothers with positive/suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection rarely acquire the disease or show adverse clinical outcomes. With this evidence in mind, it appears that strict postnatal care policies, including separating mothers and newborns, discouraging breastfeeding, and performing early bathing, may be more likely to adversely impact newborns than they are to reduce the low risk of maternal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or the even lower risk of severe COVID-19 disease in otherwise healthy newborns.","output":"A review of newborn outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Natural Killer (NK) cells are unique immune cells capable of efficient killing of infected and transformed cells.

This can be mainly attributed to limited infiltration of NK cells into solid tumors, downregulation of target antigens on the tumor cells, or suppression by the chemokines and secreted factors present within the tumor microenvironment. Several methods for genetic engineering of NK cells were established and consistently improved over the last decade, leading to the generation of novel NK cell products with enhanced anti-tumor activity and improved tumor homing. New generations of engineered NK cells are developed to better target refractory tumors and/or to overcome inhibitory tumor microenvironment.

Agent-based simulation allowed us to identify different control and prevention means, which are efficient in reducing the natural evolution of a pandemic. The results of the analysis offered insight into the rate of spread and human behavior, or habits that led to a significant increase in the total number of infected agents. Recent literature discussed the simulation of disease spread among the inhabitants of larger areas or studied the way that the pathogen can be spread from person to person through droplets containing the virus.

Critically ill, mechanically ventilated COVID-19 ARDS patients were allocated, by study-blinded coordinating staff, to either closed-loop or conventional mechanical ventilation, based on mechanical ventilator availability. Primary outcome was the overall achieved percentage of lung-protective ventilation in closed-loop versus conventional mechanical ventilation, assessed minute-by-minute, during the initial 7 days and overall mechanical ventilation time. Lung-protective ventilation was defined as the combined target of tidal volume <8 ml per kg of ideal body weight, dynamic driving pressure <15 cmH2O, peak pressure <30 cmH2O, peripheral oxygen saturation &#8805;88% and dynamic mechanical power <17 J/min.

During the initial 7 days of mechanical ventilation, patients in the closed-loop group were ventilated lung-protectively for 65% of the time versus 38% in the conventional group (Odds Ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.76-1.82; P < 0.001) and for 45% versus 33% of overall mechanical ventilation time (Odds Ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.21-1.23; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Among critically ill, mechanically ventilated COVID-19 ARDS patients during an early highpoint of the pandemic, mechanical ventilation using a closed-loop mode was associated with a higher degree of lung-protective ventilation than was conventional mechanical ventilation.","output":"Closed-Loop Versus Conventional Mechanical Ventilation in COVID-19 ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common abdominal emergency. This article aims to document the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on timely diagnosis of AA, duration of symptoms before examination in a medical institution, levels of laboratory inflammatory markers, and the length of hospital stay. Collected data were compared with current world literature. METHOD Two datasets were created, comprising patients with the histological diagnosis of AA determined from March 1 to June 30, 2019 (before of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic) and in the same period of the spring pandemic of COVID-19 in 2020. The following information was obtained from patient medical records: Demographic data, information on symptom duration before AA diagnosis, information on laboratory inflammatory marker levels, the used surgical method, antibiotic treatment, histopathological findings, and the length of hospital stay. These data were processed using descriptive statistics methods and the two created datasets were compared with the use of statistical methods (an unpaired t-test and Welchs t-test). RESULTS Thirty seven patients (26 men and 11 women) with the median age of 41 years were operated on for acute appendicitis at the Department of Surgery, Military University Hospital in Prague from March 1 to June 30, 2019. Thirty four patients (19 men and 15 women) with the median age of 42 years were operated on in the same period of 2020. No significant differences were found between these two compared datasets in terms of symptom duration, laboratory inflammatory marker levels or the length of hospital stay. The distributions of histopathological findings and used antibiotic treatments were also similar.

To date, little evidence on COVID-related concerns have been produced and no report has provided structured feedback from the point of view of people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism or of their family/carers. AIMS: To provide systemised evidence-based information of the priority concerns for people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Senior representatives of major UK-based professional and service-user representative organisations with a stake in the care of people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism were contacted to provide a list of concerns across three domains: mental health and challenging behaviour, physical health and epilepsy and social circumstances and support. The feedback was developed into statements on frequently reported priorities. These statements were then rated independently by expert clinicians. A video-conference meeting to reconcile outliers and to generate a consensus statement list was held. RESULTS: Thirty-two organisations were contacted, of which 26 (81%) replied. From the respondent's data, 30 draft consensus statements were generated. Following expert clinician review, there was initially strong consensus for seven statements (23%), increasing to 27 statements (90%) following video conferencing.

Recent data indicate that dromedaries represent an important source of infection, although information regarding viral cell tropism and pathogenesis is sparse. In the current study, tissues of eight dromedaries receiving inoculation of MERS-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) after recombinant Modified-Vaccinia-Virus-Ankara (MVA-S)-vaccination (n = 4), MVA-vaccination (mock vaccination, n = 2) and PBS application (mock vaccination, n = 2), respectively, were investigated. Tissues were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and scanning electron microscopy. MERS-CoV infection in mock-vaccinated dromedaries revealed high numbers of MERS-CoV-nucleocapsid positive cells, T cells, and macrophages within nasal turbinates and trachea at day four post infection. Double immunolabeling demonstrated cytokeratin (CK) 18 expressing epithelial cells to be the prevailing target cell of MERS-CoV, while CK5/6 and CK14 expressing cells did not co-localize with virus. In addition, virus was occasionally detected in macrophages. The acute disease was further accompanied by ciliary loss along with a lack of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), known to mediate virus entry. DPP4 was mainly expressed by human lymphocytes and dromedary monocytes, but overall the expression level was lower in dromedaries. The present study underlines significant species-specific manifestations of MERS and highlights ciliary loss as an important finding in dromedaries. The obtained results promote a better understanding of coronavirus infections, which pose major health challenges.","output":"Experimental infection of dromedaries with Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus is accompanied by massive ciliary loss and depletion of the cell surface receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research focuses on the 2014 Ebola crisis response by emergency managers in the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) Metropolitan region in the State of Texas, U.S.A.

A major challenge to widespread usage and deployment of such pulmonary health monitoring audio models is to maintain accuracy and robustness across a variety of commodity devices, due to the effect of device heterogeneity. Because of this phenomenon, pulmonary audio models developed with data from one type of device perform poorly when deployed on another type of device. In this work, we propose a framework incorporating feature normalization across individual frequency bins and combining task specific deep neural networks for model invariance across devices for pulmonary event detection. Our empirical and extensive experiments with data from 131 real pulmonary patients and healthy controls show that our framework can recover up to 163.6% of the accuracy lost due to device heterogeneity for four different pulmonary classification tasks across two broad classification scenarios with two common mobile and wearable devices: smartphone and smartwatch.Clinical relevance- The methods presented in this paper will enable efficient and easy portability of clinician recommended pulmonary audio event detection and analytic models across various mobile and wearable devices used by a patient.","output":"Device Invariant Deep Neural Networks for Pulmonary Audio Event Detection Across Mobile and Wearable Devices."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Compared to the automotive sector, where automation is the rule, in many other less standardized sectors automation is still the exception. This could soon hurt the productivity of industrialized countries, where the unemployment is low and the population is aging.

The method takes a holistic and quantitative approach tying together technological, context-related and economic input parameters and synthetizing them in a final economic indicator. Thanks to the modelling of such parameters, it is possible to gain sensibility on the technological and/or process adjustments that would have the highest impact on the efficiency of the automation, thereby delivering value for both technology users and technology providers. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"The STIC Analysis: A Decision Support Method for Investments in Automation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging evidence suggests that people with alcohol use disorders are at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) receptors for cellular entry. While ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes are upregulated in the cortex of alcohol-dependent individuals, information on expression in specific brain regions and neural populations implicated in SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, particularly monoaminergic neurons, is limited. We sought to clarify how chronic alcohol exposure affects ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in monoaminergic brainstem circuits and other putative SARS-CoV-2 entry points. C57BL/6J mice were exposed to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor for 4 weeks and brains were examined using immunofluorescence. We observed increased ACE2 levels in the olfactory bulb and hypothalamus following CIE, which are known to mediate SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion. Total ACE2 immunoreactivity was also elevated in the raphe magnus (RMG), raphe obscurus (ROB), and locus coeruleus (LC), while in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), ROB, and LC we observed increased colocalization of ACE2 with monoaminergic neurons. ACE2 also increased in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and decreased in the amygdala. Whereas ACE2 was detected in most brain regions, TMPRSS2 was only detected in the olfactory bulb and DRN but was not significantly altered after CIE. Our results suggest that previous alcohol exposure may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion and render brain circuits involved in cardiovascular and respiratory function as well as emotional processing more vulnerable to infection, making adverse outcomes more likely.

We compared postoperative delirium in elderly patients following laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) versus open gastrectomy (OG). METHODS In total, 130 patients aged  65 years with gastric cancer undergoing LG and OG were enrolled prospectively. Postoperative delirium and cognitive status were assessed daily using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), respectively, for 3 days postoperatively. For CAM-positive patients, delirium severity was then assessed using the Delirium Index (DI). RESULTS In total, 123 subjects (LG, n = 60; OG, n = 63) were included in the analysis. In both groups, the overall incidences of postoperative delirium were similar: 31.6% (19/60) in the LG group and 41.2% (26/63) in the OG group. When considering only those with delirium, the severity, expressed as the highest DI score, was similar between the groups. A decline in cognitive function (reduction in MMSE  2 points from baseline) during 3 days postoperatively was observed in 23 patients in the LG group (38.3%) and 27 patients in the OG group (42.9%) (P = 0.744). In both groups, postoperative cognitive decline was significantly associated with postoperative delirium (P < 0.001).

One-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA), scatter plot analysis, correlation analysis and distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) analysis were used to analyse the relationship between meteorological factors and the number of patients with COVID-19. We found that the significant influencing factors of the number of COVID-19 cases differed among the four states. Specifically, the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in California and New York was negatively correlated with AWMD (P < 0.01) and positively correlated with AQI, PM2.5 and TAVG (P < 0.01) but not significantly correlated with other factors. Florida was significantly correlated with TAVG (positive) (P < 0.01) but not significantly correlated with other factors.

DKA and HHS have distinctly different pathophysiology but basic management protocols are the same. EDKA is just like DKA but without hyperglycaemia. T1D, particularly children are vulnerable to DKA and T2D, particularly elderly with comorbidities are vulnerable to HHS. But these are not always the rule, these acute conditions are often occur in different age groups with diabetes. It is essential to have a coordinated care from the multidisciplinary team to ensure the timely delivery of right treatment. DKA and HHS, in many instances can present as a mixed entity as well. Mortality rate is higher for HHS than DKA but incidences of DKA are much higher than HHS. The prevalence of HHS in children and young adults are increasing due to exponential growth of obesity and increasing T2D cases in this age group.

At enrollment all participants were negative by qPCR; follow-up occurred biweekly and bimonthly for the next 6 weeks. Study participants who tested positive by qPCR SARS-CoV-2 test were enrolled in an immune response sub-study. FluoroSpot interferon-gamma (IFN-) and IL2 responses following qPCR-confirmed infection at enrollment (day 0), day 7 and 14 and more than 28 days later were measured using pools of 17mer peptides covering S, N, and M proteins, or CD4+CD8 peptide pools containing predicted epitopes from multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Among 124 asymptomatic and 105 symptomatic participants, SARS-CoV-2 infection generated IFN- responses to the S, N and M proteins that persisted longer in asymptomatic cases. IFN- responses were significantly (p = 0.001) more frequent to the N pool (51.4%) than the M pool (18.9%) among asymptomatic but not symptomatic subjects. Asymptomatic IFN- responders to the CD4+CD8 pool responded more frequently to the S pool (55.6%) and N pool (57.1%), than the M pool (7.1%), but not symptomatic participants.

In November they were confronted to the fifth COVID-19 wave despite excellent vaccine coverage. We aimed to estimate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection after complete vaccination among HCWs with different vaccination schemes, and its determinants. METHODS: We enrolled all HCWs in the university hospital of Rennes, France who had received complete vaccination (two doses of COVID-19 vaccine). The delay from last vaccination dose to SARS-CoV-2 infection was computed. Fitted mixed Cox survival model with a random effect applied to exposure risk periods to account for epidemic variation was used to estimate the determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection after complete vaccination. RESULTS: Of the 6674 (82%) HCWs who received complete vaccination (36% BNT162b2, 29% mRNA-1273, and 34% mixed with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and were prospectively followed-up for a median of 7.0 [6.3-8.0] months, 160 (2.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Incidence density of SARS-CoV-2 infection after complete vaccination was 3.39 [2.89-3.96] infections per 1000 person-month. Median time from vaccine completion to SARS-CoV-2 infection was 5.5 [3.2-6.6] months.

To examine these relationships, we designed and preregistered the present study (https://osf.io/qfw9h). We assessed a large, heterogeneous sample including undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and staff of a large, public, Midwestern university (n = 1055) to ascertain whether personality domains uniquely predicted distress in response to COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders. This was a three-panel study in which the same potential participant pools were invited to participate at each survey announcement. Data collection occurred between early March through late May 2020, from within days of local shelter-in-place order onset to within days of reaching 100,000 COVID-related deaths in the USA. Domain and distress scores were determined from self-reported ratings on the Big Five Inventory and the 21-Item Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales, respectively. Participants also reported personal experiences with six COVID-specific lifestyle impacts: insufficient outdoor or indoor living space, job insecurity, income insecurity, or taking care of or homeschooling school-aged children during working hours. Zero-order correlations revealed that all personality domains except openness had statistically significant correlations with distress, and all correlations were negative except for that of neuroticism. When entered simultaneously, neuroticism was the predominant risk factor of distress that held across all preregistered and exploratory analyses. Our expectation that extraversion would be negatively associated with distress was not supported broadly, while agreeableness was a unique potential risk factor (though this effect was mostly limited to exploratory analyses). The results especially highlight the link between employment and income uncertainty with psychological distress, while also identifying insufficient indoor and outdoor space as potential risk factors.

At the same time, it is also a test of concepts and practices of what good care is and requires, and how quality of care can be accounted for. In this paper, we present our Care-Ethical Model of Quality Enquiry (CEMQUE) and apply it to the case of residential care for older people in the Netherlands during the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead of thinking about care in healthcare and social welfare as a set of separate care acts, we think about care as a complex practice of relational caring, crossed by other practices. Instead of thinking about professional caregivers as functionaries obeying external rules, we think about them as practically wise professionals. Instead of thinking about developing external quality criteria and systems, we think about cultivating (self-)reflective quality awareness. Instead of abstracting from societal forces that make care possible but also limit it, we acknowledge them and find ways to deal with them. Based on these critical insights, the CEMQUE model can be helpful to describe, interrogate, evaluate, and improve existing care practices. It has four entries: (i) the care receiver considered from their humanness, (ii) the caregiver considered from their solicitude, (iii) the care facility considered from its habitability and (iv) the societal, institutional and scholarly context considered from the perspective of the good life, justice and decency. The crux is enabling all these different entries with all their different aspects to be taken into account. In Corona times this turns out to be more crucial than ever.","output":"Cultivating quality awareness in corona times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious viral illness of wild and domestic cloven-hoofed animals. The causative agent, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), replicates rapidly, efficiently disseminating within the infected host and being passed on to susceptible animals via direct contact or the aerosol route. To survive in the host, FMDV has evolved to block the host interferon (IFN) response. Previously, we and others demonstrated that the leader proteinase (L(pro)) of FMDV is an IFN antagonist. Here, we report that another FMDV-encoded proteinase, 3C(pro), also inhibits IFN-/ response and the expression of IFN-stimulated genes. Acting in a proteasome- and caspase-independent manner, the 3C(pro) of FMDV proteolytically cleaved nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-B) essential modulator (NEMO), a bridging adaptor protein essential for activating both NF-B and interferon-regulatory factor signaling pathways. 3C(pro) specifically targeted NEMO at the Gln 383 residue, cleaving off the C-terminal zinc finger domain from the protein. This cleavage impaired the ability of NEMO to activate downstream IFN production and to act as a signaling adaptor of the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway. Mutations specifically disrupting the cysteine protease activity of 3C(pro) abrogated NEMO cleavage and the inhibition of IFN induction. Collectively, our data identify NEMO as a substrate for FMDV 3C(pro) and reveal a novel mechanism evolved by a picornavirus to counteract innate immune signaling.","output":"Foot-and-mouth disease virus 3C protease cleaves NEMO to impair innate immune signaling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Compositional changes of cell types are main drivers of biological processes.

Using personal protective equipment (PPE) is necessary to avoid being infected as well as to avoid being the source of infection. Apart from physical limitations, also communication and work efficiency are affected by the barriers created by PPE. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to assess knowledge, attitude and practice regarding the challenges faced by dental practitioners in India due to the use of PPE as well as to discuss the ways of overcoming these barriers by dentists. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted during a period of 1 month. A Google Forms questionnaire was sent out; it included 12 questions regarding the use of PPE, changes in the diet and the work routine, the side effects of PPE, effects on communication and work efficiency, and the patients' attitude toward PPE. The obtained data was subjected to the statistical analysis with the use of the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows software, v. 26.0. For all statistical tests, p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant, keeping  error at 5% and ? error at 20%, thus giving a power to the study of 80%. RESULTS: A total of 390 dentists completed the questionnaire. The study revealed that 85% of the respondents agreed that wearing PPE affected their work efficiency and 89% experienced difficulty in communication. The majority of the participants experienced side effects, like profuse sweating, breathlessness, headaches, and skin irritation. CONCLUSIONS: It was proven that the current use of PPE not only makes communication harder, but also elevates anxiety among patients. Dentists have adapted themselves by switching to other means of communication, such as sending instructions by means of text messages/telemedicine, as well as taking breaks between patients, switching to a healthier diet, and exercising regularly, thus helping to minimize the adverse effects of PPE.","output":"Knowledge, attitude and practice among dental practitioners with regard to overcoming the barriers created by personal protective equipment in the COVID-19 era and delivering effective dental treatment: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"C3A is a subclone of the human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cell line with strong contact inhibition of growth. We fortuitously found that C3A was more susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 infection than HepG2, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into C3A cells. In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential susceptibility of the two cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection, we found that ArfGAP with dual pleckstrin homology (PH) domains 2 (ADAP2), gamma-interferon-inducible lysosome/endosome-localized thiolreductase (GILT), and lymphocyte antigen 6 family member E (LY6E), the three cellular proteins identified to function in interference with virus entry, were expressed at significantly higher levels in HepG2 cells. Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression of LY6E, but not GILT or ADAP2, in HEK 293 cells inhibited the entry of HCoV-O43. While overexpression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of HCoV-OC43, knockdown of LY6E expression in HepG2 significantly increased its susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection. Moreover, we found that LY6E also efficiently restricted the entry mediated by the envelope spike proteins of other human coronaviruses, including the currently pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, overexpression of serine protease TMPRSS2 or amphotericin treatment significantly neutralized the IFN-inducible transmembrane 3 (IFITM3) restriction of human coronavirus (CoV) entry, but did not compromise the effect of LY6E on the entry of human coronaviruses. The work reported herein thus demonstrates that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis via a mechanism distinct from other factors that modulate CoV entry. IMPORTANCE Virus entry into host cells is one of the key determinants of host range and cell tropism and is subjected to the control of host innate and adaptive immune responses. In the last decade, several interferon-inducible cellular proteins, including IFITMs, GILT, ADAP2, 25CH, and LY6E, had been identified to modulate the infectious entry of a variety of viruses. Particularly, LY6E was recently identified as a host factor that facilitates the entry of several human-pathogenic viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A virus, and yellow fever virus. Identification of LY6E as a potent restriction factor of coronaviruses expands the biological function of LY6E and sheds new light on the immunopathogenesis of human coronavirus infection.","output":"LY6E Restricts Entry of Human Coronaviruses, Including Currently Pandemic SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of the ongoing pandemic around the world, the mechanisms underlying the SARS-CoV-2-induced COVID-19 are subject to intense investigation. Based on available data for the SARS-CoV-1 virus, we suggest how CoV-2 localization of RNA transcripts in mitochondria hijacks the host cells mitochondrial function to viral advantage. Besides viral RNA transcripts, RNA also localizes to mitochondria. SARS-CoV-2 may manipulate mitochondrial function indirectly, first by ACE2 regulation of mitochondrial function, and once it enters the host cell, open-reading frames (ORFs) such as ORF-9b can directly manipulate mitochondrial function to evade host cell immunity and facilitate virus replication and COVID-19 disease. Manipulations of host mitochondria by viral ORFs can release mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the cytoplasm and activate mtDNA-induced inflammasome and suppress innate and adaptive immunity. We argue that a decline in ACE2 function in aged individuals, coupled with the age-associated decline in mitochondrial functions resulting in chronic metabolic disorders like diabetes or cancer, may make the host more vulnerable to infection and health complications to mortality. These observations suggest that distinct localization of viral RNA and proteins in mitochondria must play essential roles in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Understanding the mechanisms underlying virus communication with host mitochondria may provide critical insights into COVID-19 pathologies. An investigation into the SARS-CoV-2 hijacking of mitochondria should lead to novel approaches to prevent and treat COVID-19.","output":"Decoding SARS-CoV-2 hijacking of host mitochondria in COVID-19 pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study Objective Physicians seeking specialty certification in Obstetrics and Gynecology are now required to successfully complete the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) exam in order to meet the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ABOG) certification requirement. We conducted a survey of U.S Obstetrics and Gynecology physicians in training in an attempt to assess their laparoscopic surgical training and perceived barriers and limitations to successfully obtain FLS certification. Design Observational. Setting Internet-based survey of United States Obstetrics and Gynecology residency programs. Patients or Participants U.S Obstetrics and Gynecology residents. Interventions Participants were asked to self-evaluate their confidence in conducting laparoscopic procedures. Measurements and Main Results Of the 237 U.S Obstetrics and Gynecology programs, 146 residents responded. Seventy-one (48%) respondents completed the FLS exam and reported a 93% pass rate. All those who did not pass reported poor performance on the manual skills portion. Sixty-six (93%) respondents felt the laparoscopic box trainer was most helpful in preparation for the FLS exam. Fifty-five (79%) respondents felt the cognitive portion of the exam was not at all or slightly representative of subjects taught in residency. Thirty-three (47%) respondents felt the skills portion was moderately reflective of laparoscopic skills needed in gynecologic surgery. Thirty-eight (54%) respondents felt preparing for this exam was not at all or slightly helpful in clinical or surgical practice. Conclusion The laparoscopic box trainer appears to be most useful in preparation for the FLS exam. Most respondents agree the skills portion of the exam represents skills required in Obstetrics and Gynecology. Concern remains whether the cognitive portion of the exam is applicable to Obstetrics and Gynecology residents or if residency programs need to broaden their laparoscopic education.

We previously demonstrated a high incidence of ictal hypoxemia in temporal lobe seizures. We now report on the temporal relationship between ictal apnea and seizure onset and spread in patients undergoing video-EEG (electroencephalography) telemetry (VET) with intracranial electrodes. METHODS Ten patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) undergoing VET were studied. Data from synchronously recorded digital pulse oximetry (SaO(2)), end-tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2)), nasal airflow, abdominal excursions, and electrocardiography were obtained. RESULTS Sixty-one seizures were captured. SaO(2) in the ictal/postictal period was available for 52 seizures, apnea onset times for 27 seizures, and ETCO(2) for 16 seizures. Apneas occurred only when seizures spread to the contralateral temporal lobe. The mean delay to apnea onset was significantly shorter after contralateral seizure spread (2.87 s) than after seizure onset (58.4 s); p < 0.001. The mean SaO(2) nadir with partial seizures or partial seizures prior to secondary generalization was 89.4 +/- 8.6% (91.5, 69-100). Following generalized convulsions the mean oxygen saturation nadir was 75.8 +/- 10.6% (78.5, 58-90). ETCO(2) elevations occurred with each ictal desaturation below 85%. CONCLUSIONS There is a close temporal relationship between spread of seizures to the contralateral hemisphere and the onset of seizure-associated apnea. Apnea onsets are more tightly linked to time of contralateral spread than to time of seizure onset. Patients with TLE in whom there is evidence of contralateral seizure spread may be at higher risk for ictal-related respiratory dysfunction than those in whom seizures remain unilateral.","output":"Ictal apnea linked to contralateral spread of temporal lobe seizures: Intracranial EEG recordings in refractory temporal lobe epilepsy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of COVID-19 has resulted in the shortage of medical resources, which necessitates accurate prognosis prediction to triage patients effectively. This study used the nationwide cohort of South Korea to develop a machine learning model to predict prognosis based on sociodemographic and medical information.

The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that age > 70, male sex, moderate or severe disability, the presence of symptoms, nursing home residence, and comorbidities of diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic lung disease, or asthma were significantly associated with increased risk of mortality (p  0.047). For machine learning, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), linear support vector machine (SVM), SVM with radial basis function kernel, random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbors were tested. In prediction of mortality, LASSO and linear SVM demonstrated high sensitivities (90.7% [95% confidence interval: 83.3, 97.3] and 92.0% [85.9, 98.1], respectively) and specificities (91.4% [90.3, 92.5] and 91.8%, [90.7, 92.9], respectively) while maintaining high specificities > 90%, as well as high area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (0.963 [0.946, 0.979] and 0.962 [0.945, 0.979], respectively). The most significant predictors for LASSO included old age and preexisting DM or cancer; for RF they were old age, infection route (cluster infection or infection from personal contact), and underlying hypertension.

However, real-world data indicate that many patients with HFrEF do not receive optimised GDMT, which involves several different medications, many of which require up-titration to target doses. There are many challenges to implementing GDMT, the most important being patient-related factors (comorbidities, advanced age, frailty, cognitive impairment, poor adherence, low socioeconomic status), treatment-related factors (intolerance, side-effects) and healthcare-related factors that influence availability and accessibility of HF care. Accordingly, international disparities in resources for HF management and limited public reimbursement of GDMT, coupled with clinical inertia for treatment intensification combine to hinder efforts to provide GDMT. In this review paper, authors aim to provide solutions based on available evidence, practical experience, and expert consensus on how to utilise evolving strategies, novel medications, and patient profiling to allow the more comprehensive uptake of GDMT. Authors discuss professional education, motivation, and training, as well as patient empowerment for self-care as important tools to overcome clinical inertia and boost GDMT implementation. We provide evidence on how multidisciplinary care and institutional accreditation can be successfully used to increase prescription rates and adherence to GDMT. We consider the role of modern technologies in advancing professional and patient education and facilitating patient-provider communication. Finally, authors emphasise the role of novel drugs (especially sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors), and a tailored approach to drug management as evolving strategies for the more successful implementation of GDMT.

Little data is available on long-term CXR follow-up for moderate and severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This study aims to evaluate compliance with clinico-radiological follow-up of patients recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia at a local hospital in the UK, as per the BTS guidance, and to analyse radiological changes at clinical follow-up at 12 weeks, in order to risk-stratify and improve patient outcomes. METHODS: This is a single-centre retrospective audit of 255 consecutive COVID-19 positive patients admitted to a local hospital in the UK over 5 months between May and October 2020. All CXRs and clinic follow-up at 12  8 weeks were checked on an electronic database. RESULTS: Over one in two (131/255) patients had CXR evidence of COVID-19 pneumonia during the initial hospital admission. Half of the patients (60/131) died before CXR or clinic follow-up. Fifty-eight percent (41/71) of the surviving patients had a follow-up CXR, and only two developed respiratory complications- one had residual lung fibrosis, another a pulmonary embolism. Eighty-eight percent (36/41) of the patients had either resolution or improved radiological changes at follow-up. Most patients who had abnormal follow-up CXR were symptomatic (6/8), and many asymptomatic patients at follow-up had a normal CXR (10/12). CONCLUSIONS: Although there were concerns about interstitial lung disease (ILD) incidence in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, most of our patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had no pulmonary complications at follow-up with CXR. This emphasises that CXR, a cost-effective investigation, can be used to risk-stratify patients for long term pulmonary complications following their COVID-19 pneumonia.

With NCDs accounting for 70% of deaths in Qatar, there exists a perfect opportunity to promote healthy lifestyles to prevent, treat, and reverse NCDs. We believe that the FIFA World Cup 2022? presents an opportunity that could contribute to generating valuable evidence on the lifestyle benefits of such large-scale events. This event comes at an opportune moment for countries in the region to make their health systems lifestyle-sensitive. FIFA World Cup 2022? could just be the tipping point in the region that establishes the role of sports in mitigating the burden of NCDs. With the impact of COVID-19 on persons with pre-existing NCDs, the urgency for addressing the syndemic cannot be overemphasized and sport can be the lifestyle medicine.","output":"Scoring Lifestyle Medicine Goals With FIFA 2022An Opportunity to Strike Big!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is causing global morbidity and mortality, straining health systems, and disrupting society, putting individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) at risk of significant harm.

RESULTS: Most respondents intended to get vaccinated. However, they tended to underestimate their risks of contracting COVID-19. Disease exposure led to higher uptake intent via the mediation of fear. Safety concerns negatively influenced vaccination intention, while perceived community benefits were positively associated with vaccination intention. Positive attitudes toward vaccines and recent vaccine history were positively linked to vaccination intent. CONCLUSION: This study attests the effectiveness of HBT constructs in predicting people's intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

METHODS: This paper discusses the process of organizational change within our healthcare delivery system using the Strengths, Opportunities, Aspirations, and Results (SOAR) framework. Within this framework a structured mixed methods survey of 38 clinicians representing 5 different disciplines was conducted. Internal and survey data were analyzed to evaluate and guide the iterative change process. RESULTS: The majority of BH clinicians reported that they were as or more effective with TMH. The transition to TMH in our organization resulted in increased access to care, with a 10.3% increase in BH visit completions. The transition to TMH may benefit clinician work-life balance, but requires resources to support clinical, technological, and communication/teamwork changes.

This research letter presents a cluster of severe medical conditions that were delayed in diagnosis due to postponed presentation to healthcare facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ewing sarcoma, severe hemolytic anemia, endocarditis requiring surgery, and septic hip requiring surgery are some examples of cases we encountered with delayed diagnoses. This led to the appearance of a rather low burden of disease in the pediatric population during the pandemic, and pediatric hospitals and clinics experienced a very low volume of activity. Given the low burden of COVID-19 in children, and the well-defined separation between infected and non-infected areas within the hospitals, we should consider improving the guidelines and messages conveyed to the public regarding the importance of prompt medical assessment for other medical conditions, even during a pandemic, along with reassurance of the safety of entering medical facilities given the strict isolation procedures being observed.

Data from June 2020 - January 2021 from several publicly available sources were combined to create a dataset that included facility name, size, ownership, mortality rate, Covid case rate, personal protective equipment (PPE) and staff shortages, % white residents, and % Medicaid residents. Community factors included core-based statistical area (CBSA) Covid case rates, urban/rural, CBSA death rates, and the CDCs Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). Zero-inflated Poisson regression models were used to determine predictors of 8-month Covid case counts, normalized by facility size. Results indicated that higher staff shortages, poorer facility rating, for-profit ownership, proportionally more Medicaid and non-white residents were all significantly associated with higher Covid case rates over 8 months (all P < 0.0001). Significant community level predictors of higher cases included urban setting and higher SVI. PPE shortages was not associated with higher case counts. Of all the factors included, SVI was the strongest predictor of Covid case counts. This large US study assists in determining critical facility and community factors that predict increasing Covid burden in nursing homes.

METHODS We retrospectively investigated 208 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer between January 2007 and September 2014. After excluding 15 patients with unusual medical histories or surgical treatments, 193 were selected for this cohort study. We divided the patients into two cohorts: elderly patients (75 years old) and non-elderly patients (<74 years old). We compared these cohorts with respect to clinicopathological characteristics and intraoperative and postoperative parameters. RESULTS The overall complication rates were 11.4% (8 of 70 patients) in the elderly cohort and 8.1% (10 of 123 patients) in the non-elderly cohort (P = 0.449). In a univariate analysis, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) of 3, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of 3, operative time of 330 min, and intraoperative blood loss of 50 ml were found to correlate significantly with postoperative complications. In a multivariate analysis, CCI of 3 (P = 0.034), ASA score of 3 (P = 0.019), and intraoperative blood loss of 50 ml (P = 0.016) were found to be independent risk factors of postoperative complications. In contrast, age was not found to significantly affect the risk of postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer can be successfully performed in elderly patients with an acceptable complication rate.

RPSA has reduced postprocedural pain and morbidity with shorter recovery time for the patient compared with EVLA using bare-tip fibers. However, new-generation EVLA devices with less traumatic radial-tip fibers (RTFs) operating at longer wavelengths up to 1470 nm also reduce postprocedural pain. The objective of this study was to compare long-term effectiveness of GSV thermal ablation and postprocedural recovery using RPSA or 1470-nm EVLA with RTF (EVLA-RTF). METHODS In a comparative prospective monthly altering-treatment cohort study of 311 patients (346 treated legs), each leg with incompetence of the GSV was treated with either RPSA (158 patients, 175 legs) or EVLA-RTF (153 patients, 171 legs). The primary outcome was anatomic occlusion of the GSV, assessed at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months using Kaplan-Meier statistics and compared using the log-rank test. Secondary outcomes included freedom of varicose vein recurrence, clinical success measured by Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), disease-specific quality of life determined using the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ), postoperative pain scores, and time to return to work. RESULTS The total primary obliteration rate after 36 and 60 months was 96.2% with RPSA and 96.7% with EVLA-RTF (P = .81). Freedom of symptomatic anterior accessory vein recurrence after 5 years was 85% after RPSA and 87% after EVLA-RTF (P = .50). VCSS and AVVQ score presented similar and durable improvements in both groups between 6 weeks and 60 months. There was no difference in postoperative pain scores after both treatments during the first 14 days (mean visual analog scale score, 0.54-2.19). The median time for return to work was 1 day after both treatments. No severe adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS RPSA and EVLA-RTF have similarly high GSV obliteration rates in the long term, and the treatments are equally effective clinically. Both treatments are associated with similar minimal postprocedural pain scores and short recovery times.","output":"Prospective comparative cohort study evaluating incompetent great saphenous vein closure using radiofrequency-powered segmental ablation or 1470-nm endovenous laser ablation with radial-tip fibers (Varico 2 study)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On May 13, 2020, the Wisconsin Supreme Court declared the state's Safer at Home Emergency Order (https://evers.wi.gov/Documents/COVID19/EMO28-SaferAtHome.pdf) \\"unlawful, invalid, and unenforceable,\\"* thereby increasing opportunities for social and business interactions.

This age group accounts for 12.5% of the population in the county. To identify factors that influence exposure to COVID-19 among young adults in Winnebago County, characteristics of COVID-19 cases and drivers of behaviors in this age group were examined. During March 1-July 18, 2020, 240 young adults received positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, accounting for 32% of all Winnebago County cases. In 30 key informant interviews, most interviewees reported exposure to misinformation, conflicting messages, or opposing views about the need for and effectiveness of masks. Thirteen young adults described social or peer pressure to not wear a mask and perceived severity of disease outcome for themselves as low but high for loved ones at risk. Having low perceived severity of disease outcome might partly explain why, when not in physical contact with loved ones at risk, young adults might attend social gatherings or not wear a mask (2). Exposure to misinformation and unclear messages has been identified as a driver of behavior during an outbreak (3,4), underscoring the importance of providing clear and consistent messages about the need for and effectiveness of masks. In addition, framing communication messages that amplify young adults' responsibility to protect others and target perceived social or peer pressure to not adhere to public health guidance might persuade young adults to adhere to public health guidelines that prevent the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Factors Influencing Risk for COVID-19 Exposure Among Young Adults Aged 18-23 Years - Winnebago County, Wisconsin, March-July 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Respiratory infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality in reptiles; however, the causative agents are only infrequently identified.

Inclusion criteria were oxygen saturation less than or equal to 92%, signs of interstitial pneumonia, and no need of mechanical ventilation. Patients received 5 mg b.i.d. of ruxolitinib for 15 days, data were collected at baseline and on days 4, 7, and 15 during treatment. Two main targets were identified, C-reactive protein (CRP) and PaO2 /FiO2 ratio. In the 31 patients who received ruxolitinib, symptoms improved (dyspnea scale) on day 7 in 25 of 31 patients (80.6%); CRP decreased progressively from baseline (79.1  73.4 mg/dl) to day 15 (18.6  33.2, p = 0.022). In parallel with CRP, PO2/FiO2 ratio increased progressively during the 3 steps from 183  95 to 361  144 mmHg (p < 0.001). In those patients with a reduction of polymerase chain reaction less than or equal to 80%, delta increase of the PO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly more pronounced (129  118 vs. 45  35 mmHg, p = 0.02). No adverse side effects were recorded during treatment. In patients hospitalized for COVID-19, compassionate-use of ruxolitinib determined a significant reduction of biomarkers of inflammation, which was associated with a more effective ventilation and reduced need for oxygen support. Data on ruxolitinib reinforces the hypothesis that targeting the hyperinflammation state, may be of prognostic benefit in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Compassionate use of ruxolitinib in patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection not on mechanical ventilation: Short-term effects on inflammation and ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Allergic history in individuals with confirmed anaphylaxis to a messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine is common. However, the risk factors for allergy symptoms after receiving the vaccine are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between self-reported history of high-risk allergy and self-reported allergic reactions after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination of health care employees. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study obtained demographic, medical, and vaccine administration data of employees of Mass General Brigham from the institutional electronic health record. Employees who received at least 1 dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine between December 14, 2020, and February 1, 2021, and who completed at least 1 postvaccination symptom survey in the 3 days after vaccination were included. EXPOSURES: Self-reported history of high-risk allergy, defined as a previous severe allergic reaction to a vaccine, an injectable medication, or other allergen. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 1 or more self-reported allergic reactions in the first 3 days after dose 1 or dose 2 of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Multivariable log binomial regression was used to assess the association between allergic reactions and high-risk allergy status. RESULTS: A total of 52 998 health care employees (mean [SD] age, 42 [14] years; 38 167 women [72.0%]) were included in the cohort, of whom 51 706 (97.6%) received 2 doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and 474 (0.9%) reported a history of high-risk allergy. Individuals with vs without a history of high-risk allergy reported more allergic reactions after receiving dose 1 or 2 of the vaccine (11.6% [n = 55] vs 4.7% [n = 2461]). In the adjusted model, a history of high-risk allergy was associated with an increased risk of allergic reactions (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 2.46; 95% CI, 1.92-3.16), with risk being highest for hives (aRR, 3.81; 95% CI, 2.33-6.22) and angioedema (aRR, 4.36; 95% CI, 2.52-7.54). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that self-reported history of high-risk allergy was associated with an increased risk of self-reported allergic reactions within 3 days of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. However, reported allergy symptoms did not impede the completion of the 2-dose vaccine protocol among a cohort of eligible health care employees, supporting the overall safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.","output":"Association of Self-reported High-Risk Allergy History With Allergy Symptoms After COVID-19 Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On February 3, 2020, the Brazilian Ministry of Health declared a state of emergency in public health of national relevance due to the pandemic caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

A systematic benefit-risk assessment was designed and conducted to examine the benefit-risk profile of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients compared with standard of care, placebo or other treatments. A key objective of this study was to provide a platform for a dynamic systematic benefit-risk evaluation, which starts with inevitably limited information (to meet the urgent unmet public health need worldwide), then update the benefit-risk evaluation as more data become available. METHODS: The Benefit-Risk Action Team (BRAT) framework was used to assess the overall benefit-risk of the use of remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19 compared with standard of care, placebo or other treatments. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar and government agency websites to identify literature reporting clinical outcomes in patients taking remdesivir for COVID-19. A value tree was constructed and key benefits and risks were ranked by two clinicians in order of considered importance. RESULTS: Using the BRAT method, several key benefits and risks for use of remdesivir in COVID-19 compared with placebo have been identified. In one trial, the benefit of time to clinical improvement was not statistically significant (21 vs 23 days, HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.87-1.75), although the study was underpowered. In another trial, a shorter time to recovery in patients treated with remdesivir was observed (11 vs 15 days), with non-significant reduced mortality risk (8% vs 12%). Risk data were only available from one trial. This trial reported fewer serious adverse events in patients taking remdesivir (18%) compared with the placebo group (26%); however, more patients in the remdesivir group discontinued treatment as a result of an adverse event compared with those patients receiving placebo (12% vs 5%). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary clinical trial results suggest that there may be a favourable benefit-risk profile for remdesivir compared with placebo in severe COVID-19 infection and further data on benefits would strengthen this evaluation. There is limited safety data for remdesivir, which should be obtained in further studies. The current framework summarises the key anticipated benefits and risks for which further data are needed. Ongoing clinical trial data can be incorporated into the framework when available to provide an updated benefit-risk assessment.","output":"Remdesivir in Treatment of COVID-19: A Systematic Benefit-Risk Assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated an alternative home-based cardiac telerehabilitation model in consideration of the recommendations for the COVID-19 quarantine of people diagnosed with coronary heart disease (CHD). We hypothesized that using a 200 m fast walking test (200 mFWT) and telerehabilitation would create an effective alternative cardiac rehabilitation (CR) intervention that could improve cardiorespiratory fitness. Participants (n = 19, mean age 60.4  9.6) of the 8-week intervention performed regular physical exercise at the target heart rate zone determined by calculations based on the 200 mFWT results. In our study, the participants were supervised using telerehabilitation. A total of 84% of participants completed the 8-week intervention. No adverse events were reported during telerehabilitation. The study participants noted a significant improvement (p < 0.001) in cardiorespiratory fitness expressed by an 8% reduction in the walking test time (&#916; 8.8  5.9 s). Home-based telerehabilitation based on 200 mFWT effectively increased the cardiorespiratory fitness in people with CHD with a low to moderate cardiovascular risk.

The current standard for expanding NK cells relies on feeder cells and fetal bovine serum to achieve large expansion, but both encounter regulatory concerns. We developed NK Cloudz, a dissolvable polymer-based microsphere platform, as an alternative to a feeder cell approach to expand NK cells. We demonstrated that a combination of NK Cloudz, a G-Rex6M culture vessel, and GMP Human Platelet Lysate expanded NK cells 387  100-fold in 10 days from a PBMC starting population. The NK purity, viability, and cytotoxicity were similar to both a feeder cell protocol and an FBS-based protocol. Additionally, we found no significant differences between FBS and GMP Human Platelet Lysate and concluded that platelet lysate is a good xeno-free alternative to FBS for NK expansion.

Our objective was to share with the scientific community how, during the COVID-19 period, there has been a huge modification in urological emergencies throughout all hospitals included in the Ente Ospedaliero Cantonale (EOC). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed urgent urological consultations requested by the emergency department (ED) of the 4 public hospitals located in Tessin belonging to EOC in the 3-month period between February 15 and May 15, 2020, and compared them to the 2 previous years cases within the same time frame (February 15 to May 15, 2018 and 2019). The number of daily consultations, urgent invasive procedures performed, and admissions were evaluated. RESULTS: The final sample resulted in 594 consultations performed in 2020, 974 in 2018, and 974 in 2019. A higher number of daily consultations were performed during 2018 and 2019. The number of daily admissions dropped consistently during the COVID-19 pandemic (737 vs. 392).

SETTINGS AND DESIGN : This is a retrospective, multicentric, observational study. MATERIALS AND METHODS : The study included children with heart disease and GUCH population, who presented with either symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection to any of the participating centers. COVID-19-negative patients admitted to these centers constituted the control group. RESULTS : From 24 pediatric cardiac centers across India, we included 94 patients with a median age of 12.5 (interquartile range 3C96) months and 49 (52.1%) patients were males.

When the diagnostic test result is continuous numerical data, ROC analysis is often utilized. The performance of a diagnostic test with binary results are usually evaluated using the measures of sensitivity and specificity. However, there are some important measures other than these two measures for binary test results. These measures are predictive values, overall accuracy, diagnostic odds ratio, Youden index, and likelihood ratios. Results: A hypothetical data has been produced based on the studies conducted on the performance of rapid tests (Specific IgM/IgG) according to the RT-PCR test for Covid 19 in the literature. An example of a diagnostic test (Specific IgM/IgG) with a binary result is given and all measurements and their confidence interval are obtained for this data.

OBJECTIVES The main outcome of this study is to find correlations between remnant morphology in the immediate post-operative stage, its dilation in years, and the long-term results. The second purpose aims to correlate preoperative eating disorders, taste alteration, hunger perception, and early satiety with post-SG results. MATERIALS AND METHODS Remnant morphology was evaluated, in the immediate post-operative stage and over the years (2 years), through X-ray of the oesophagus-stomach-duodenum calculating the surface in anteroposterior (AP) and right anterior oblique projection (RAO). Presurgery diagnosis of eating disorders and their evaluation through \\"Eating Disorder Inventory-3\\" (EDI3) during follow-up were performed. Change in taste perception, sense of appetite, and early satiety were evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups: \\"failed SGs (EWL<50%) and \\"efficient SGs\\" (EWL >50%). RESULTS There were a total of 50 patients (37 F, 13 M), with mean age 52 years, preoperative weight 131  21.8 kg, and BMI 47.4  6.8 kg/m2. Post-operative remnant mean dimensions overlapped between the two groups. On a long-term basis, an increase of 57.2 and 48.4% was documented in the AP and RAO areas respectively. In \\"failed\\" SGs, dilation was significantly superior to \\"efficient\\" SGs (AP area 70.2 vs 46.1%; RAO area 59.3 vs 39%; body width 102% vs 41.7%). Preoperative eating disorders were more present in efficient SGs than in failed SGs with the exception of sweet eating. There were no significant changes to taste perception during follow-up. Fifty-two percent of efficient SGs vs 26% of failed SGs reported a persistent lack of sense of hunger; similarly, 92.5 vs 78% declared the persistence of a sense of early satiety. The two groups did not statistically differ as far as all the variables of the EDI3 are concerned. CONCLUSION On a long-term basis, the remnant mean dilation is around 50% compared to the immediate post-operative stage but failed SGs showed larger remnant dilation than efficient SGs and, in percentage, the more dilated portion is the body of the stomach. As far as all the EDI3 variables obtained are concerned, the two groups did not statistically differ. Of all eating disorders, sweet eating seems to be weakly connected to SG failure.","output":"Sleeve Gastrectomy: Correlation of Long-Term Results with Remnant Morphology and Eating Disorders."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a long-term (10-year) study of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as bridging therapy in patients listed for orthotopic liver transplantation (LT), we evaluated the impact of RFA on waiting list dropout rate, post-LT tumor recurrence, and long-term intention-to-treat, disease-specific survival (DSS). From March 2004 to October 2014, RFA was performed as the initial stand-alone bridge therapy to LT for 121 patients (men/women ratio, 83:38; mean age, 60.0 years) with 156 de novo HCCs (mean size, 2.4 cm). Follow-up period from initial RFA ranged from 1.3 to 128.0 months (median, 42.9 months). We assessed the overall and tumor-specific waiting list dropout rates, post-LT tumor recurrence, and 10-year post-LT and intention-to-treat survival rates. Dropout from the waiting list due to tumor progression occurred in 7.4% of patients. HCC recurrence after LT occurred in 5.6% of patients. The post-LT overall survival (OS) rate at 5 and 10 years was 75.8% and 42.2%, respectively, and the recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate was 71.1% and 39.6%, respectively. Intention-to-treat OS, RFS, and DSS rates for the entire study population at 5 and 10 years were 63.5% and 41.2%, 60.8% and 37.7%, and 89.5% and 89.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION RFA as a first-line stand-alone bridge therapy to LT achieves excellent long-term overall and tumor-specific survivals, with a low dropout rate from tumor progression despite long wait list times and a sustained low tumor recurrence rate upon post-LT follow-up of up to 10 years.

The intensity of treatment is currently guided by cytogenetic and molecular genetic risk classifications; however, these incompletely predict outcomes, requiring additional information for more accurate predictions. Objective We aimed to identify potential prognostic implications of epigenetic modification of histone proteins in relation to driver mutations in chromatin, splicing and transcriptional regulators in adult-onset acute lymphoblastic (ALL) and myeloid leukemia (AML). Design Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples were collected from 114 newly diagnosed B-cell ALL, 14 T-cell ALL, and 241 AML patients who were admitted at the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) between September 1991 and March 2007. Proteomic profiling was performed using reverse phase protein array and additional mutational analysis was performed on 65 AML BM aspirates. Setting H3K4Me2, H3K4Me3 and H3K27Me3 levels were evaluated along with the expression of 227 other protein antibodies at time of diagnosis. Patients or other participants Patient's ages ranged from 16 to 81 years (median=4016) in ALL and from 17 to 87 years (median=6416) in AML. Interventions Patients were treated according to standard MDACC treatment protocols. Main outcome measures Overall survival was considered as the primary study outcome. Results H3K4Me2, H3K4Me3 and H3K27Me3 were significantly higher in AML than in ALL. In AML, greater loss of H3K27Me3 was associated with increased proliferative potential and shorter overall survival in the whole patient population (HR=0.64, 95%CI=0.47-0.87, p=0.004) and in subsets, e.g. cytogenetically normal AML (HR=0.62, 95%CI=0.40-0.97, p=0.03) and IDH1 mutated patients (HR=0.21, 95%CI=0.062-0.72, p=0.009). H3K27Me3 was lower in ASXL1, BCOR, U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutated subgroups (p<0.05). Moreover, AML patients with decreased H3K27Me3 demonstrated an upregulated anti-apoptotic phenotype. In ALL, levels of histone methylation correlated with response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor in patients who carried the Philadelphia cytogenetic aberration and prior smoking behavior. Conclusions Proteomic profiling of histone modifications has clinical implications in acute leukemia and support the idea that epigenetic patterns contribute to a more accurate picture of the leukemic state and complement cytogenetic and molecular genetic subgrouping. H3K27Me3 measurement might be a suitable method to improve acute leukemia outcome prediction and subsequent treatment intensity stratification in selected subgroups.","output":"AML-343: Loss of H3K27 Methylation Identifies Poor Outcomes in Adult-Onset Acute Lymphoblastic and Myeloid Leukemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spatially extended stochastic processes in epidemiology lead to classical reaction\\\\diffusion process, when infection spreads only locally.

The team, which includes dedicated inpatient and outpatient nurse coordinators, instituted a plan to support the transition from the inpatient to outpatient setting. Purpose: A survey was used to determine family preparedness for clinic and ease of scheduling their appointment. The data were collected before and after enacting remote scheduling and telehealth visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Our team provided educational materials and an outpatient appointment time to families at time of discharge starting in 2019. In January 2020, the stroke clinic staff surveyed parents and guardians about their preparedness for clinic. Telehealth encounters were initiated due to COVID-19 in March 2020, with staff conducting RedCAP surveys by telephone. The survey measured several components of visit preparedness and satisfaction including: understanding of diagnosis, reason for referral prior to clinic visit, familiarity with the stroke team prior to clinic visit, and ease in appointment scheduling. We compared results before and after March 2020 via two-tailed chisquare analysis or two-tailed Fischer's test. Results: Prior to telehealth, families favorably reported responses with 92% (47/52) knowing the reason for referral, 86% (42/49) receiving educational material prior to clinic, and 84% (42/50) reporting familiarity with our team. All patients (50/50) reported that scheduling was easy. Only scheduling ease had a significant change during the pandemic, with 11% (2/11) of patients reporting difficulties with scheduling after starting telehealth (P=0.03). Conclusion: Childhood stroke is a disease with significant morbidity and mortality, requiring close follow-up care. Families report robust preparedness for clinic after the implementation of a comprehensive discharge plan. Although small numbers, remote scheduling and telehealth transition may present previously unseen barriers to scheduling during the pandemic.

It is not yet known whether people with DS are more susceptible to being diagnosed with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To explore whether DS is associated with increased susceptibility to COVID-19. DESIGN: Matched-cohort study design using anonymised primary care electronic health records from the May 2021 release of Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum. SETTING: Electronic health records from approximately 1400 general practices (GPs) in England. PARTICIPANTS: 8854 people with DS and 34,724 controls matched for age, gender and GP who were registered on or after the 29th January 2020. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was COVID-19 diagnosis between January 2020 and May 2021. Conditional logistic regression models were fitted to estimate associations between DS and COVID-19 diagnosis, adjusting for comorbidities. RESULTS: Compared to controls, people with DS were more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 (7.4% vs 5.6%, p  0.001, odds ratio (OR) = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.23C1.48). There was a significant interaction between people with DS and a chronic respiratory disease diagnosis excluding asthma and increased odds of a COVID-19 diagnosis (OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.20C2.43), whilst adjusting for a number of comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Individuals with DS are at increased risk for contracting COVID-19.

Anecdotal evidence shows that during COVID-19, providers are increasingly recommending these deliveries, but little is known regarding the extent and the patterns of such recommendations across pregnant women in the United States (U.S.). Study Design We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional survey of 740 racial-diverse U.S. pregnant women with >8-week pregnancy, and aged 18?44?years during 5/4/2020?5/6/2020 to evaluate maternal and provider characteristics associated with birth plan changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand the birth plan changes, we asked each participant, ?has a health care professional recommended a change to your birth plan as a result of COVID-19 Options include 1) No, there have been no recommended changes to my original birth plan as a result of COVID-19. 2) Yes, my provider recommended inducing labor as a result of COVID-19. 3) Yes, my provider recommended a planned cesarean (c-section) delivery as a result of COVID-19. 4) I don't know yet. Women who responded, ?I don't know yet? were excluded, yielding a total of 678 sample pregnant women in the analysis. Multivariable regressions were used to assess rural?urban differences in the likelihoods of provider recommendations for birth plan changes to labor induction or planned c-section, controlling for race/ethnicity, age, insurance-type, education, employment, household income, pregnancy condition, pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index, parity, trimester, provider specialty, delayed prenatal care initiation, positive-tested family member, state positivity rates as of 5/6/2020, and census region. Population Studied 740 racial-diverse U.S. pregnant women with >8-week pregnancy, and aged 18?44?years in 2020. Principal Findings Of 678 eligible pregnant women, the majority lived in urban communities (87.0%). Rural women reported lower household income, were less likely to initiate prenatal care at the first trimester, visit obstetricians for prenatal care, be privately insured, be employed full-time than urban women participants. They were similar in age, race/ethnicity, education, pregnancy condition, pre-pregnancy BMI, and state COVID-19 positivity rates. Overall, 22.6% were recommended to change delivery plans to either labor induction or planned c-section due to the pandemic, with a higher rate in rural women (34.5%) than urban women (20.9%). Controlling for other maternal, provider, and state COVID-19 characteristics, these recommendations were disproportionately prevalent among rural women (Odds ratios [OR]: 1.6), primiparous women (OR: 7.7), women delaying prenatal care initiation (OR: 5.2), those visiting family physicians but no obstetricians for prenatal care (OR: 4.3), Medicaid insured (OR: 3.2), and those with family members tested positive for COVID-19 (OR: 5.4). Conclusions In May 2020, women living in rural areas, Medicaid insured, having delayed prenatal care initiation, and visiting only family physicians for prenatal care were more likely to be recommended for elective procedures. Implications for Policy or Practice There is an urgent need for health system and policymakers to establish safe and effective protocols to ensure pregnant women obtain evidence-based care as needed during the pandemic and beyond to avoid long-term detrimental effects.

CT-scans specifically requested for COVID-19 suspicion, diagnosis or aggravation were monitored. Teleradiological and epidemiological time series were aligned. Their relationships were estimated through a cross-correlation function, and their extremes and breakpoints compared. Dynamic linear models were trained to forecast the weekly hospitalizations in France based on teleradiological activity predictors.Results: Overall, 100,018 CT-scans were included over 36 weeks, and 19,133 (19%) performed within the COVID-19 workflow. Concomitantly, 227,677 hospitalizations were reported. Teleradiological and epidemiological time series were almost perfectly superimposed (cross-correlation coefficients at lag 0: 0.90C0.92). Maximal number of COVID-19 CT-scans was reached the week of 2020-03-23 (1,086 CT-scans), one week before the highest hospitalizations (23,542 patients).

Fear of COVID-19 leads to delays in seeking medical care at a time when pandemic information overflows. However, little is known about the role of COVID-19 related fear, attention to information, and fact-checking in such delay. Objective: Under the Hong Kong Jockey Club SMART Family-Link Project, we examined the associations of delay in doctor consultation amidst the pandemic with sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 related fear, attention to information, and fact-checking. Methods: We conducted a population-based online cross-sectional survey in May 2020 on Hong Kong Chinese adults. Respondents reported whether the pandemic caused any delay in doctor consultation (yes/no), level of COVID-19 related fear, attention to information and fact-checking (all on a scale of 0 to 10 and recoded into tertiles of low, moderate, high). Regression analyses were used to examine the associations of delay and fear with sociodemographic characteristics, attention and fact-checking, adjusting for covariates. Data were weighted by sex, age and education level of the population. Results: Of 4,551 respondents (46.5% male, 59.7% aged over 45 years), 10.1% reported delay in doctor consultation. The mean score was 6.4 for fear, 8.0 for attention and 7.4 for fact-checking. Delay was more common in males and increased with age and fear. High vs. low level of fear was associated with delay [adjusted odd ratios (AOR) 2.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.08, 3.47]. Moderate level of fact-checking was negatively associated with delay (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 0.98, 1.67). Females reported greater fear and fear decreased with age.

In this study, we explored the feasibility of using tracking data from a football match to assess interpersonal contact between individuals by calculating two measures of respiratory exposure. The dynamic tracking positioning of all players and referees during one international football match was analyzed. For each individual, two measures of respiratory exposure were calculated, based on the 2 m interpersonal distance recommendations for contact tracing for COVID-19 control. Overall, individuals spent a median of 0:12 mm:ss (IQR = 0:45 mm:ss) exposed to interpersonal contact of fewer than 2 m from others. The highest value of exposure was observed between two players of opposing teams (6:35 mm:ss). The results suggest that tracking data can be used to assess respiratory exposure to interpersonal contact in team sports, such as football. The measures of exposure calculated can be used to the prompt identification of high-risk contacts of COVID-19 cases during a match or a training session, but also the risk stratification of different sports and physical activities.","output":"Can Tracking Data Help in Assessing Interpersonal Contact Exposure in Team Sports during the COVID-19 Pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many viruses can cause respiratory diseases in humans.

To address this research gap, we aimed to explore the association between social capital and QoL among stroke patients in Anhui Province, China. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using a multi-stage stratified random sampling method. The following data including demographic characteristics, health-related conditions, five dimensions of social capital status, and quality of life (QoL) were collected using a questionnaire. Generalized linear models were then used to determine the relationship between social capital and QoL after adjusting for confounding factors. RESULTS: A total of 390 participants were included for the final analysis in this study. Our results indicated that subjects with higher social capital including social connection (coefficient: 28.28, 95% CI: 19.39C37.16), social support (coefficient: 21.17, 95% CI: 10.63C31.71), trust (coefficient: 13.46, 95% CI: 2.73C24.19), reciprocity (coefficient: 25.56, 95% CI: 15.97C35.15), and cohesion (coefficient: 19.30, 95% CI: 9.90C28.70) had increased odds of reporting poor QoL when compared with lower social capital group.

However, limited information is available on the effect of colostrum source (single dam or pooled) on passive immunity, as well as subsequent antibody survival in the calf. This study aimed to assess the effect of feeding single-dam colostrum (own and other dam) or pooled colostrum on transfer of passive immunity, and also investigate the rate of depletion of disease-specific antibodies among dairy calves. In total, 320 cows and 119 dairy heifer calves were enrolled in the study. Calves were blood-sampled immediately after birth and received either own-dam, other-dam, or pooled colostrum. Calves were blood-sampled at 24 h to assess serum IgG concentrations and at monthly intervals thereafter to document disease-specific antibody survival. Mean colostrum IgG concentration was higher for other-dam treatment group, whereas own-dam and pooled treatments were similar. For all treatment groups, the mean IgG concentration was >80 mg/mL, exceeding the quality threshold of 50 mg/mL. Mean calf serum IgG concentration was lower for calves fed pooled colostrum compared with those that received colostrum from a single cow. There was a negative association with 24-h serum IgG and calf birth bodyweight; calves <30 kg at birth had the highest 24-h serum IgG concentration. Survival of antibodies to bovine viral diarrhea, Salmonella infection, leptospirosis, bovine parainfluenza 3 virus, bovine respiratory syncytical virus, rotavirus, and coronavirus was not associated with colostrum source; however, antibodies to infectious bovine rhinotracheitis had a greater period of survival among calves fed own-dam colostrum. We found that feeding single-dam colostrum can thus improve calf immunity through increased serum IgG levels and antibody survival rates. Furthermore, we hypothesize that immune exclusion may occur with pooled colostrum; therefore, providing pooled colostrum may still be a good practice as long as it can be ensured that enough antibodies are absorbed into the blood stream to deal with pathogens calves may encounter because different dams may have antibodies against different strains of viruses and bacteria, yielding cross protection.","output":"Effect of feeding single-dam or pooled colostrum on maternally derived immunity in dairy calves."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper compares several fault-tolerance methods for the detection and correction of floating-point errors in matrix-matrix multiplication.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, and molecular characteristics including serotypes and antibiotic susceptibility of S. pneumoniae isolated from children living in Southwest China from 2017 to 2019 to facilitate the selection of effective vaccine formulations and appropriate antibiotic treatment regimens. METHODS: This study was conducted at West China Second University Hospital (Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China), Zunyi Medical University Third Affiliated Hospital/First Peoples Hospital of Zunyi (Zunyi, Guizhou Province, China) and Chengdu Jinjiang District Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital (Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China). Demographic and clinical characteristics of children infected with S. pneumoniae were collected and analysed. Next-generation sequencing and sequence analysis were used to determine the serotypes, sequence types, antibiotic resistance and potential protein vaccine target genes of the pneumococcal isolates. The coverage rate provided by PCV13 was estimated by calculating the percentage of the specific serotypes that were specifically the PCV13-included serotypes. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the microdilution broth method. RESULTS: The most prevalent pneumococcal serotypes were 19F (25.8%), 19A (14.1%), 6B (12.5%), 6A (9.4%) and 14 (7.8%). The predominant STs were ST271 (23.3%), ST320 (15.5%) and ST90 (8.6%), dominated by the clonal complex Taiwan(19F)-14 (39.1%). The coverage rate of PCV13 was 77.3% in all the isolates, with relatively higher values in invasive isolates (86.4%). Over the decade, the rates of resistance to penicillin, amoxicillin and cefotaxime were 5.6%, 5.3% and 5.1%, respectively, with significantly higher values in invasive isolates (22.4%, 14.9% and 11.9%). Almost all the isolates were resistant to erythromycin (99.1%) and clindamycin (95.9%). All isolates carried virulence-related genes, including ply, psaA, piaA, piuA, phtE, nanA, pepO, danJ, pvaA, clpP, pcsB, stkP, potD, and strH. The carriage of virulence and resistance genes varied among serotypes and clades, with serotype 19F/ST271 showing higher resistance to antibiotics and being more likely to carry pilus genes and other virulence genes.

The authors also look at the impact of rising and falling oil prices on herding behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the model of Chang et al. (2000) to estimate herding behaviour in the Islamic bank markets. Findings: First, the authors estimate herding at the GCC region level, and the results reveal an absence of herding under all market conditions and during all the events considered, except for the GCC crisis of 2017. Second, the authors investigate herding in four Gulf countries (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates [UAE], Qatar and Kuwait) separately and find that herding is evident in all these countries during various market conditions. During Ramadan, herding appears in the Saudi Arabia and Kuwait Islamic bank equity markets. Herding is not prevalent during OPEC meeting days in any of the markets, whereas herding is evident in Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait Islamic bank equity markets during the GCC crisis of 2017 and the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, the rising and falling oil prices do not influence herding at either GCC region or country level. Practical implications: From the practitioner's perspective, this study provides useful insights for investors in Islamic banks and policymakers, in terms of asset pricing, portfolio diversification, trading strategies and market stability.

In severe or unclear situations, a chest X-ray is done and analysis is frequently done by interns. Radiologists frequently see those patients that suffer from recurrent, nosocomial pneumonia, or an additional predisposing disease. The appropriate investigational technique, frequently targeted differential diagnosis, and the special needs of these patients need to be understood by radiologists. Early detection of a focus of infection is the major goal in immunocompromised patients. As pneumonia is the most common focus, chest imaging is to be done at the beginning. The sensitivity of chest X-rays, especially in the supine position, is known to be low. Therefore the very sensitive high-resolution CT (HRCT) became the gold standard in neutropenic hosts and is widely replaced by thin-section multi-detector-row-CT (MDCT). Underlying diseases such as pulmonary embolism or bronchial carcinoma might also be depicted. Furthermore, the costs of CT are low in comparison to antibiotics. The infiltrate needs to be localised, so that a physician can utilise this information as a guidance for invasive procedures for further microbiological work-up.

HAH has been shown to be safe and effective for medical patients but has not been investigated in surgical readmissions. We estimated the potential impact of an HAH program for patients readmitted within 60 days postoperatively and described the characteristics of eligible patients to aid in the design of future programs. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study of 60-day postoperative readmissions at a tertiary care center in 2018. METHODS: We identified the number of readmissions that may have been eligible for HAH, collected descriptive information, and estimated the financial margin that could have been generated had eligible readmissions been diverted to HAH. RESULTS: There were 2366 readmissions within 60 days of surgery in 2018. A total of 731 readmissions met inclusion criteria for HAH (30.1%), accounting for 4152 bed days. Of these readmissions, the most common diagnoses were infection, gastrointestinal complications, and cardiac complications. Patients' home addresses were within 16 miles of the hospital in 447 cases (61.1%). Avoidance of these readmissions and use of the beds for new admissions represented a potential backfill margin of $8.8 million, not incorporating the cost of HAH.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess consistent condom utilization and associated factors among HIV-positive individuals attending an antiretroviral therapy clinic at Pawi general hospital, North West Ethiopia in 2020. METHODS: An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted among 419 HIV-positive individuals who have follow-up in the Pawi general hospital antiretroviral therapy clinics, from January to February 2020. The study subjects were reached using a systematic sampling technique and data were collected using a pretested and structured questionnaire. Data entry and analysis were performed using epi-data version 3.1 and SPSS version 23 respectively. Binary and multivariable analyses with a 95% confidence level were performed. In the final model, variables with P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 419 antiretroviral therapy study participants were participated in the study with a response rate of 100%. In this finding, the consistent condom utilization rate was 49.2% [95% CI: 42.2C56.5%].

METHODS: We conducted a cohort study between March and May 2020 at the Lille University Hospital (France), including all patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Psychological distress symptoms were measured 3 weeks after onset of COVID-19 symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale-6 items (IES-6). The evaluation of PTSD symptoms using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) took place 1 month later. Bivariate analyses were performed to analyze the relationship between PCL-5 scores and the demographic and health variables. The significant variables were then introduced into a multivariable linear regression analysis to establish their relative contributions to the severity of PTSD symptoms. RESULTS: 180 patients were included in this study, and 138 patients completed the 2 evaluations. Among the 180 patients, 70.4% patients required hospitalization, and 30.7% were admitted to the intensive care unit. The prevalence of PTSD was 6.5%, and the predictive factors of PTSD included psychological distress at the onset of the illness and a stay in an intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PTSD in patients with COVID-19 is not as high as that reported among patients during previous epidemics. Initial psychological responses were predictive of a PTSD diagnosis, even though most patients showing acute psychological distress (33.5% of the sample) improved in the following weeks. PTSD symptoms also increased following a stay in an intensive care unit.

However, the duration of publication process is a major concern for authors and funding bodies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the duration of the publication process in pharmacy practice journals compared with other biomedical journals indexed in PubMed. METHODS: All the articles published from 2009 to 2018 by the 33 pharmacy practice journals identified in Mendes et al. study and indexed in PubMed were gathered as study group. A comparison group was created through a random selection of 3000 PubMed PMIDs for each year of study period. Articles with publication dates outside the study period were excluded. Metadata of both groups of articles were imported from PubMed. The duration of editorial process was calculated with three periods: acceptance lag (days between submission date and acceptance date), lead lag (days between acceptance date and online publication date), and indexing lag (days between online publication date and Entry date). Null hypothesis significance tests and effect size measures were used to compare these periods between both groups. RESULTS: The 33 pharmacy practice journals published 26,256 articles between 2009 and 2018. Comparison group random selection process resulted in a pool of 23,803 articles published in 5,622 different journals. Acceptance lag was 105 days (IQR 57C173) for pharmacy practice journals and 97 days (IQR 56C155) for the comparison group with a null effect difference (Cohens d 0.081). Lead lag was 13 (IQR 6C35) and 23 days (IQR 9C45) for pharmacy practice and comparison journals, respectively, which resulted in a small effect. Indexing lag was 5 days (IQR 2C46) and 4 days (IQR 2C12) for pharmacy practice and control journals, which also resulted in a small effect. Slight positive time trend was found in pharmacy practice acceptance lag, while slight negative trends were found for lead and indexing lags for both groups.

It has been previously argued that cold and dry conditions are more conducive to the transmission of VRDs than warm and humid climates, although this relationship appears restricted to temperate regions and the causal relationship is not well understood. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causing COVID\\\\19 has emerged as a serious global public health problem after the first COVID\\\\19 reports in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It is still unclear whether this novel respiratory disease will ultimately prove to be a seasonal endemic disease. Here, we suggest that air drying capacity (ADC; an atmospheric state variable that controls the fate/evolution of the virus\\\\laden droplets) and ultraviolet radiation (UV) are probable environmental determinants in shaping the transmission of COVID\\\\19 at the seasonal time scale. These variables, unlike temperature and humidity, provide a physically based framework consistent with the apparent seasonal variability in COVID\\\\19 and prevalent across a broad range of climates (e.g., Germany and India). Since this disease is known to be influenced by the compounding effect of social, biological, and environmental determinants, this study does not claim that these environmental determinants exclusively shape the seasonality of COVID\\\\19.

Unlike to asthma, the association between helminthes infection and allergic rhinitis (AR) has been poorly studied. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the association between exposure to Ascaris and Toxocara infections and AR. METHODS: We did an age- and gender-matched caseCcontrol study of 81 children with physician-confirmed AR and 101 control subjects in a referral hospital for pediatric diseases in northern Iran. Exposure to Ascaris and Toxocara infections was evaluated by anti-A. lumbricoides- and anti-Toxocara- IgG antibodies using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Associations were determined using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Ascaris seropositivity was higher in children with rhinitis than in controls (12.34 vs. 3.96%). Ascaris seropositivity was positively associated with AR in univariate analysis (OR, 3.42; 95% CI 1.03C11.3; P value = 0.035), but this association was not significant after adjustment for potential confounders (OR, 1.85; 95% CI 0.42C8.18).

The impact of safety measures on neurosurgical training remains unclear. To understand how neurosurgical residents have been affected, the authors analyze operative experience in months leading up to and during the pandemic. Materials and Methods Resident and institutional case totals were tallied for a single residency program in Miami-Dade County, USA from January 01, 2019 to June 30, 2020. Matched cohort analysis was performed before and during the pandemic to assess effect on resident surgical training. Results Case totals for all levels of training were lower when restrictions were placed on elective surgeries. An average of 11 cases were logged in April 2020, down from 26 in April 2019 (mean 8.7 C 22, 95% CI; p <0.01), and an average of 20 cases was logged in May 2020, down from 25 in May 2019 (mean 1.2 C 8.8, 95% CI; p = 0.01). In April 2020 there were 299 (66%) fewer cases performed at our institution compared to the year prior, and in May 2020 there were 148 (50%) fewer cases. Conclusions Operative experience was reduced for residents during months when elective cases were restricted.

METHODS: This observational study of a clinical HD population during the 'safer-at-home' orders asked patients or caregivers about their current access to healthcare resources and patient stress levels. A chart review allowed for an assessment of socioeconomic status and characterization of HD severity. RESULTS: Two-hundred and twelve HD patients were contacted with 156 completing the survey.

VITT is mediated by anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies activating platelets through the Fc-receptor II (FcRII), and it is associated with strong fibrin turnover. The complement system is involved in several other immunothrombotic entities, but its impact on VITT is not established. OBJECTIVE: To assess antibodies in interaction with the activation of platelets and complement triggered by VITT. METHODS: Antibodies against adenovirus type 2 hexon protein, ChAdOx1 adenoviral vector-specific IgG and PF4 were analyzed by enzyme immunoassays from VITT patients (n = 5). The EDTA plasma samples of the patients and controls were used to measure both terminal complement complexes (TCC) by ELISA and aggregation of healthy donor platelets. We studied the effects of human immunoglobulin (IVIG) and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPIIb/IIIa) on spontaneous and collagen-induced platelet aggregation supplemented with VITT plasma. RESULTS: None of the patients had experienced a COVID-19 infection. Antibody analyses confirmed the immunogenicity of the adenovirus-vectored ChAdOx1 vaccine. Moreover, VITT plasma had anti-PF4 antibodies and elevated TCC levels as a sign of complement activation. In isolated healthy donor platelets, VITT patient plasma caused marked, spontaneous aggregation of platelets, which was abolished by eptifibatide and high-dose therapeutic IVIG. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that VITT is triggered by antibodies against adenovirus vector and PF4-polyanion complexes which strongly co-activate complement and platelets. The spontaneous platelet aggregation was suppressed by IVIG or eptifibatide, indicating that besides FcRII, also GPIIb/IIIa receptor exerts platelet procoagulant role in VITT.","output":"COVID-19 adenovirus vaccine triggers antibodies against PF4 complexes to activate complement and platelets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Project ECHO is a collaborative model of medical education that engages clinicians in a continuous learning system via real-time, interactive videoconferencing.

Based on these results, we formulate general recommendations on how to minimise non-response error when sampling frame data are available, both at the survey design stage and at the data management stage. ? 2021 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

However, the estimated proportions of men in sub-Saharan Africa meeting the UNAIDS 95-95-95 goals vary substantially between studies. We sought to estimate proportions of men meeting each of the 95-95-95 goals across studies in sub-Saharan Africa, describe heterogeneity, and summarize qualitative evidence on factors influencing care engagement. METHODS We systematically searched PubMed and Embase for peer-reviewed articles published between 1 January 2014 and 16 October 2020. We included studies involving men 15 years old, with data from 2009 onward, reporting on at least one 95-95-95 goal in sub-Saharan Africa. We estimated pooled proportions of men meeting these goals using DerSimonion-Laird random effects models, stratifying by study population (e.g. studies focusing exclusively on men who have sex with men vs. studies that did not), facility setting (healthcare vs. community site), region (eastern/southern Africa vs. western/central Africa), outcome measurement (e.g. threshold for viral load suppression), median year of data collection (before vs. during or after 2017) and quality criteria. Data from qualitative studies exploring barriers to men's HIV care engagement were summarized using meta-synthesis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We screened 14,896 studies and included 129 studies in the meta-analysis, compiling data over the data collection period. Forty-seven studies reported data on knowledge of serostatus, 43 studies reported on antiretroviral therapy use and 74 studies reported on viral suppression. Approximately half of men with HIV reported not knowing their status (0.49 [95% CI, 0.41-0.58; range, 0.09-0.97]) or not being on treatment (0.58 [95% CI, 0.51-0.65; range, 0.07-0.97]), while over three-quarters of men achieved viral suppression on treatment (0.79 [95% CI, 0.77-0.81; range, 0.39-0.97]. Heterogeneity was high, with variation in estimates across study populations, settings and outcomes. The meta-synthesis of 40 studies identified three primary domains in which men described risks associated with engagement in HIV care: perceived social norms, health system challenges and poverty. CONCLUSIONS Psychosocial and systems-level interventions that change men's perceptions of social norms, improve trust in and accessibility of the health system, and address costs of accessing care are needed to better engage men, especially in HIV testing and treatment.","output":"Men missing from the HIV care continuum in sub-Saharan Africa: a meta-analysis and meta-synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fourier analysis can provide policymakers useful information for analysing the pandemic behaviours.

However, little data are available related to product-specific differences, which have important programmatic impacts. Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate reporting rates of myocarditis/pericarditis following COVID-19 mRNA vaccine by product, age, sex, and dose number, as well inter-dose interval. Design: We conducted a population-based cohort study using passive vaccine safety surveillance data. All individuals in Ontario, Canada who received at least one dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine between December 14, 2020 and September 4, 2021 were included. Setting: This study was conducted in Ontario, Canada (population: 14.7 million) using the provincial COVID-19 vaccine registry and provincial adverse events following immunization database. Participants: We included all individuals with a reported episode of myocarditis/pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccine in the study period. We obtained information on all doses administered in the province to calculate reporting rates. Exposure: Receipt of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1273 [Moderna Spikevax] or BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty]). Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Reported rate of myocarditis/pericarditis meeting level 1-3 of the Brighton Collaboration case definitions. Results: There were 19,740,741 doses of mRNA vaccines administered and 297 reports of myocarditis/pericarditis meeting our inclusion criteria. Among these, 69.7% occurred following the second dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and 76.8% occurred in males. The median age of individuals with a reported event was 24 years. The highest reporting rate of myocarditis/pericarditis was observed in males aged 18-24 years following mRNA-1273 as the second dose; the rate in this age group was 5.1 (95% CI 1.9-15.5) times higher than the rate following BNT162b2 as the second dose. Overall reporting rates were higher when the inter-dose interval was shorter (i.e., []30 days) for both vaccine products. Among individuals who received mRNA-1273 for the second dose, rates were higher for those who had a heterologous as opposed to homologous vaccine schedule. Conclusions and Relevance: Our results suggest that vaccine product, inter-dose interval and vaccine schedule combinations may play a role in the risk of myocarditis/pericarditis, in addition to age and sex. Certain programmatic strategies could reduce the risk of myocarditis/pericarditis following mRNA vaccines.","output":"Epidemiology of myocarditis and pericarditis following mRNA vaccines in Ontario, Canada: by vaccine product, schedule and interval"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ruxolitinib (RUX), a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, is approved for second-line therapy in patients with polycythemia vera (PV) who are resistant or intolerant to hydroxyurea Due to the immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive effect of RUX, there is an increased susceptibility to infections However, an increased risk of infection is inherent to even untreated myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) To obtain more information on the clinical significance of RUX-associated infections in PV, we reviewed the available literature There is no evidence-based approach to managing infection risks Most data on RUX-associated infections are available for MF In all studies, the infection rates in the RUX and control groups were fairly similar, with the exception of infections with the varicella zoster virus (VZV) However, individual cases of bilateral toxoplasmosis retinitis, disseminated molluscum contagiosum, or a mycobacterium tuberculosis infection or a hepatitis B reactivation are reported A careful assessment of the risk of infection for PV patients is required at the initial presentation and before the start of RUX Screening for hepatitis B is recommended in all patients The risk of RUX-associated infections is lower with PV than with MF, but compared to a normal population there is an increased risk of VZV infection However, primary VZV prophylaxis for PV patients is not recommended, while secondary prophylaxis can be considered individually As early treatment is most effective for VZV, patients should be properly informed and trained to seek medical advice immediately if cutaneous signs of VZV develop Vaccination against influenza, herpes zoster, and pneumococci should be considered in all PV patients at risk of infection, especially if RUX treatment is planned Current recommendations do not support adjusting or discontinuing JAK inhibition in MPN patients to reduce the risk of COVID-19","output":"Ruxolitinib-Associated Infections in Polycythemia Vera: Review of the Literature, Clinical Significance, and Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA) are the most common inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) The aim of this study was to elucidate differences in the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in RA- and SpA-patients METHODS: Data from the German COVID-19 registry for IRD patients from 30th March to 16th November 2020 were analysed 208 RA and SpA patients were included in the study, matched for gender and age RESULTS: 104 SpA patients (40% patients with ankylosing spondylitis, 54% with psoriatic arthritis and 6% with enteropathic arthritis) were compared to 104 RA patients For both groups, median age was 56 years TNF-i treatment was reported in 45% of the SpA and in 19% of RA patients (p=0 001) Glucocorticoids were used in 13% of the SpA and in 40% of the RA patients (p=0 001) In both groups, the majority of the patients (97% SpA, 95% RA) recovered from COVID-19 Hospitalisation was needed in 16% of the SpA and in 30% of the RA patients (p=0 05), and oxygen treatment in 10% and 18% respectively (p=ns) Three versus six (p=ns) fatal courses were reported in the SpA versus the RA group CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that the hospitalisation rate during COVID-19 infection, but not the mortality, was significantly higher in RA as compared to SpA patients This could be explained either by different treatment strategies or by different susceptibilities of the two diseases","output":"Do patients with rheumatoid arthritis show a different course of COVID-19 compared to patients with spondyloarthritis?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the generic components of Arabic wedding invitation cards issued during the Covid-19 period in Jordanian society.

We estimate (i) the time and treatment scale-up required to achieve the World Health Organization's HCV elimination target of an 80% reduction in incidence; and (ii) the ongoing frequency of HCV testing and harm reduction coverage among people who inject drugs (PWID) required to minimize the likelihood of future HCV outbreaks occurring. METHODS We used a dynamic compartmental model of HCV transmission, liver disease progression and the HCV cascade of care, calibrated to reproduce the epidemic of HCV in Iceland. The model was stratified according to injecting drug use status, age and stage of engagement. Four scenarios were considered for the projections. RESULTS The model estimated that an 80% reduction in domestic HCV incidence was achievable by 2030, 2025 or 2020 if a minimum of 55/1,000, 75/1,000 and 188/1,000 PWID were treated per year, respectively (a total of 22, 30 and 75 of the estimated 400 PWID in Iceland per year, respectively). Regardless of time frame, this required an increased number of PWID to be diagnosed to generate enough treatment demand, or a 20% scale-up of harm reduction services to complement treatment-as-prevention incidence reductions. When DAA scale-up was combined with annual antibody testing of PWID, the incidence reduction target was reached by 2024. Treatment scale-up with no other changes to current testing and harm reduction services reduced the basic reproduction number of HCV from 1.08 to 0.59, indicating that future outbreaks would be unlikely. CONCLUSION HCV elimination in Iceland is achievable by 2020 with some additional screening of PWID. Maintaining current monitoring and harm reduction services while providing ongoing access to DAA therapy for people diagnosed with HCV would ensure that outbreaks are unlikely to occur once elimination targets have been reached. LAY SUMMARY In Iceland, a nationwide program has been launched offering treatment for the entire population living with hepatitis C virus (HCV). A mathematical model was used to estimate the additional health system requirements to achieve the HCV elimination targets of the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as the year that this could occur. With some additional screening of people who inject drugs, Iceland could reach the WHO targets by 2020, becoming one of the first countries to achieve HCV elimination. The model estimated that once elimination targets were reached, maintaining current monitoring and harm reduction services while providing ongoing access to DAA therapy for people diagnosed with HCV would ensure that future HCV outbreaks are unlikely to occur.","output":"Modelling the elimination of hepatitis C as a public health threat in Iceland: A goal attainable by 2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Norms-shifting interventions (NSI) seek to improve people's well-being by facilitating the transformation of harmful social norms, the shared rules of acceptable actions in a group that prop up harmful health behaviours. Community-based NSI aim for incremental normative change and complement other social and behaviour change strategies, addressing gender, other inequalities, and the power structures that hold inequalities in place. Consequently, they demand that designers and implementers-many who are outsiders-grapple with power, history, and community agency operating in complicated social contexts. Ethical questions include whose voices and values, at which levels, should inform intervention design; who should be accountable for managing resistance that arises during implementation? As interest and funding for NSI increases in lower and middle-income countries, their potential to yield sustained change is balanced by unintentionally reinforcing inequities that violate human rights and social justice pillars guiding health promotion efforts. A review of 125 articles on ethical considerations in public health, social justice, and human rights-where NSI actions intersect-indicated little guidance on practice.

The problem of rationing of care is present all over the world and usually occurs when available resources are too low to provide adequate care to all patients. The most common reasons for loss of care are shortages of nurses, use of modern treatment methods, increased demand for care by a large number of patients, and greater knowledge of patients about their rights. A questionnaire survey was conducted among 295 nurses employed in hospital wards. The survey was conducted from September to December 2020 using the standardized BERNCA (The Basel Extent of Rationing of Nursing Care) questionnaire to measure the level of rationing of nursing care. The research was hampered by the sanitation regime associated with the SARS CoV-2 pandemic. Nursing care rationing is dependent on seniority and place of work.

In this study, we longitudinally screened for clinically relevant systemic autoantibodies to assess their prevalence, temporal trajectory, and association with immunity, comorbidities, and severity of COVID\\\\19. METHODS: We performed highly sensitive indirect immunofluorescence assays to detect antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), along with serum proteomics and virome\\\\wide serological profiling in a multicentric cohort of 175 COVID\\\\19 patients followed up to 1 year after infection, eleven vaccinated individuals, and 41 unexposed controls. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, similar prevalence and patterns of ANA were present in patients during acute COVID\\\\19 and recovery. However, the paired analysis revealed a subgroup of patients with transient presence of certain ANA patterns during acute COVID\\\\19. Furthermore, patients with severe COVID\\\\19 exhibited a high prevalence of ANCA during acute disease. These autoantibodies were quantitatively associated with higher SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2\\\\specific antibody titers in COVID\\\\19 patients and in vaccinated individuals, thus linking autoantibody production to increased antigen\\\\specific humoral responses. Notably, the qualitative breadth of antibodies cross\\\\reactive with other coronaviruses was comparable in ANA\\\\positive and ANA\\\\negative individuals during acute COVID\\\\19. In autoantibody\\\\positive patients, multiparametric characterization demonstrated an inflammatory signature during acute COVID\\\\19 and alterations of the B\\\\cell compartment after recovery.

Material and methods From March 16, the ENT and Head and Neck departments of the HMM and HVC Hospitals began telephone consultations. Due to the disparity in the actions of the different department members, the decision was made to create a protocol to manage these consultations which started to be implemented March 23. Results During the study period, 1054 patients were attended in the consultations of both departments; 663 (62.9%) were first visits and 391 (37.10%) were successive visits. Twenty-one percent (229) of the consultations could be resolved by telephone, 10.82% (114) required face-to-face care, 57.40% (605) were indicated for an on-demand check-up depending on their disease course, and 10.05% (106) of the patients could not be reached by telephone. Discussion The state of alarm caused by COVID-19 has been a determining factor in how we undertake our care work. In the ENT and Head and Neck departments of the HMM and HVC Hospitals we decided to carry out consultations by telephone as an alternative to the traditional consultation. During this period, we have observed that up to 21.73% of the consultations could be dealt with by telephone. Conclusion The telephone consultation seems to be a very useful tool to attend our patients avoiding the risk of COVID-19 infection during the state of alarm.

This case presents an otherwise healthy young 35-year-old male who contracted the novel coronavirus, leading to multi-organ hypoxia and triggering a syncopal episode which resulted in physical trauma to the head leading to a minor subarachnoid hemorrhage.","output":"COVID-19-Induced Hypoxia With Accompanying Syncope Event and Traumatic Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In the stressful context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, some reports have raised concerns regarding psychiatric disorders with the use of hydroxychloroquine. In this study, we reviewed all psychiatric adverse effects with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients, as well as in other indications, reported in VigiBase, the World Health Organizations (WHO) global database of individual case safety reports. METHODS: First, we analyzed all psychiatric adverse effects, including suicide, of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients reported to 16 June 2020. We also performed disproportionality analysis to investigate the risk of reporting psychiatric disorders with hydroxychloroquine compared with remdesivir, tocilizumab, or lopinavir/ritonavir prescribed in COVID-19 patients. We used reporting odds ratios (RORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to calculate disproportionality. Second, we sought to examine the psychiatric safety profile of hydroxychloroquine in other indications (before 2020). RESULTS: Among the 1754 reports with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients, we found 56 psychiatric adverse effects. Half of these adverse effects were serious, including four completed suicides, three cases of intentional self-injury, and 12 cases of psychotic disorders with hallucinations. Compared with remdesivir, tocilizumab, or lopinavir/ritonavir, the use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with an increased risk of reporting psychiatric disorders (ROR 6.27, 95% CI 2.74C14.35). Before 2020, suicide was the main cause of death among all adverse drug reactions reported with hydroxychloroquine, followed by cardiac adverse effects (cardiomyopathy) and respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: This pharmacovigilance analysis suggests that COVID-19 patients exposed to hydroxychloroquine experienced serious psychiatric disorders, and, among these patients, some committed suicide. Further real-world studies are needed to quantify the psychiatric risk associated with hydroxychloroquine during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Psychiatric Disorders and Hydroxychloroquine for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A VigiBase Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As an upshot, the countrywide lockdown and unlock period due to the COVID-19 pandemic has been supportive of altering residential mobility trends in India.

Objective: To describe the clinical practice experience using telemedicine towards COVID-19 and the respective clinical outcomes. Methods: We performed a pilot open-label non-randomized controlled clinical trial. The patients were divided into four groups according severity of symptoms: (1) asymptomatic (2) mild symptoms (3) moderate symptoms and (4) severe symptoms and were followed up for five days counted from the beginning of the symptoms. A drug intervention was performed in group 3 for which the protocol followed as suggested by the International Pulmonology Societys consensus for adults with moderate symptoms: first day (attack phase) hydroxychloroquine sulfate 400 mg 12/12h second to fifth day (maintenance phase) 200 mg (half pill) 12/12h. The medication was associated with azithromycin 500mg once a day for five days. For children with moderate symptoms were used: hydroxychloroquine sulfate 6.5 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours in the first day and 3.25 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours from day 2 to 5. The therapeutic response was telemonitored. Group 4 patients were directly oriented to seek hospital care. During the use of the drugs, the patients were telemonitored daily. Results: One hundred eighty-seven patients were seen with mean age of 37,6 years (about 15,6). The most frequent symptom was cough (57,6%) followed by malaise (60,3%) fever (41,1%) headache (56,0%) muscle pain (51,1%). Of all the patients that sought telemedicine service in our center 23% were asymptomatic despite contact with people with probable diagnostic of COVID-19 29,4% reported mild symptoms 43,9% moderate symptoms and 3,7% severe symptoms. It was possible to observe in patients treated their symptoms of COVID-19 (group 3) with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for five days presented statistically better improvement of the symptoms when compared to those that did not follow the protocol (p = 0.039). Three patients were hospitalized and discharged after recovery. Conclusions: Our study showed that patients with COVID-19 who had delivery of health care through telemedicine initiated in early stages of the disease presented satisfactory clinical response, reducing the need of face-to-face consultations and hospitalizations.

The aim of our study was to explore the dynamic between a second CRP test taken within 12 hours from admission CRP test in a cohort of patients diagnosed with acute bacterial infection in comparison to CRP in a control group of apparently healthy individuals. This was a historical cohort study comprised of all patients admitted to the Sourasky Tel-Aviv Medical Center, Israel, between July 2007 and March 2016. The study cohort included adult patients who were diagnosed as having an infection, assumed to be of bacterial etiology (cellulitis and erysipelas, pneumonia, cholecystitis, pyelonephritis, or septicemia), who had a CRP test during the first 6 hours of hospital admission (baseline CRP), and a successive CRP test up to 12 hours from the first one (recurrent CRP). The control group was of healthy subjects who attended our medical center for a routine annual check-up. The study included 950 patients. Baseline CRP ranged from 0.04 to 454 mg/L. The median CRP velocity was 0.53 mg/L/h. Patients were grouped by baseline CRP into 4 groups (CRP < 10, 10C74.9, 75C199.9, 200). There was an increase in median CRP velocity between the first (0.48 mg/L/h) and the second (0.93 mg/L/h) groups, which then was decreased in the next 2 groups (0.46 and ?2.58 mg/L/h, respectively). In 45 of 103 (44%) patients of the group of baseline CRP concentration less than 10 mg/dL with bacterial diagnosis, there was a complete overlap with CRP values of apparently healthy individuals during their routine annual checkup. A first single low CRP result cannot exclude the presence of a significant bacterial infection. Patients with acute bacterial infection might present with a relatively low CRP value that at times correspond to normal limit CRP concentrations.

Students completed an online survey to self-report their stress management techniques, perceived stress (PSS-10), grade point average (GPA) and demographics (age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity). Independent samples t-tests compared each PSS-10 item for those who did/not use exercise as a stress management technique for each gender. Separate linear regression models compared perceived stress levels in those who did/not use exercise as a stress management tool for each gender.

Four PSS-10 items showed significant differences in women who did/not use exercise as a stress management technique. Women who used exercise as a stress management technique reported significantly lower levels of perceived stress compared to those women who did not (p < 0.05); while men showed no significant differences whether or not they used exercise as a stress management technique.

However, the anti-influenza activities of LBO and the underlying mechanism remain to be investigated. METHODS: The in vitro anti-influenza activity of LBO was tested with methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) and plaque assays. The effects of LBO on the expressions of viral nucleoprotein and cytokines were evaluated. In the polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid- (Poly I: C-) induced inflammation model, the influences of LBO on the expression of cytokines and the activation of NF-B P65 (P65) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) were tested. After influenza A virus (IVA) infection, mice were administered with LBO for 5 days. The lung index, histopathologic change, the expression of viral protein, P65, and IRF3 in the lung tissue were measured. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines in serum were examined. RESULTS: In vitro, LBO could significantly inhibit the infection of IVA, decrease the formation of plaques, and reduce the expression of viral nucleoprotein and cytokines. LBO could also effectively downregulate the expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon- and the activation of P65 and IRF3 in Poly I:C-treated cells. In the IVA-infected mice model, inhalation of LBO with atomizer could decrease the lung index, alleviate the pathological injury in the lung tissue, and reduce the serum levels of IL-1 and IL-6. LBO could significantly downregulate the expression of viral protein (nucleoprotein, PB2, and matrix 2 ion channel) and the phosphorylation of P65 and IRF3 in the lungs of mice. CONCLUSION: The therapeutic effects of LBO on treating influenza might result from the regulation of the immune response of IVA infection.

Results. The prevalence of fatty liver disease estimated by CAP >300 dB/m was 28.8% and of fibrosis (liver stiffness >8 kPa) was 10.4%. Only 7.2% of participants with fatty liver disease and 10.9% with fibrosis reported being told by a health care provider that they had liver disease.

Our aim was to evaluate the impact of a gamified e-learning module on adequacy of PPE in student paramedics. METHODS: This was a web-based, randomized 1:1, parallel-group, triple-blind controlled trial. Student paramedics from three Swiss schools were invited to participate. They were informed they would be presented with both an e-learning module and an abridged version of the current regional prehospital COVID-19 guidelines, albeit not in which order. After a set of 22 questions designed to assess baseline knowledge, the control group was shown the guidelines before answering a set of 14 post-intervention questions. The e-learning group was shown the gamified e-learning module right after the guidelines, and before answering post-intervention questions. The primary outcome was the difference in the percentage of adequate choices of PPE before and after the intervention. RESULTS: The participation rate was of 71% (98/138). A total of 90 answer sets was analyzed. Adequate choice of PPE increased significantly both in the control (50% [33;83] vs 25% [25;50], P = .013) and in the e-learning group (67% [50;83] vs 25% [25;50], P = .001) following the intervention. Though the median of the difference was higher in the e-learning group, there was no statistically significant superiority over the control (33% [0;58] vs 17% [- 17;42], P = .087).

Only one knowledge synthesis has attempted to bring together different types of evidence. The aim of the present work was to update it. METHODS Evidence for associations between OFC and dietary folate, supplement use, folic acid fortification, biomarkers of folate status, and variants of MTHFR (C677T and A1298C) were included. Potentially eligible articles were systematically identified from PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science (2007-2020) and combined using random-effects meta-analysis when appropriate. Quality assessments were conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and Cochrane's risk of bias tool. RESULTS Sixty-four studies published since the previous knowledge synthesis were identified, with eight of these identified through a supplementary search from October, 2018 to August, 2020. There was an inverse association between folic acid-containing supplement use before or during pregnancy and cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.51-0.69), with considerable between-study heterogeneity. The prevalence of CL/P showed a small decline post-folic acid fortification in seven studies (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.86-1.02). No association was found between OFC and genetic markers of folate status. The coronavirus-19 pandemic has threatened food availability globally and therefore there is a need to maintain and even enhance surveillance concerning maternal intake of folate and related vitamins. CONCLUSIONS The risk of non-syndromic OFC was reduced among pregnant women with folic acid-containing supplements during the etiologically relevant period. However, high heterogeneity between included studies, incomplete reporting of population characteristics and variation in timing of exposure and supplement types mean that conclusions should be drawn with caution.","output":"Folate intake, markers of folate status and oral clefts: An updated set of systematic reviews and meta-analyses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We introduce the concept of places of social inclusioninstitutions endowed by a society or a community with material resources, meaning, and values at geographic sites where citizens can access services for specific needsas taken-for-granted, essential, and inherently precarious.

METHODS: We reviewed 13-Feb-2020 through 15-Apr-2021 National Poison Data System (NPDS) COVID-19 records for changes over time. We examined NPDS cases and VAERS COVID-19 vaccine reports 1-Nov-2020 through 2-Apr-2021 for vaccine manufacturer, patient characteristics, state, and clinical effects. RESULTS: PCs reported 1,052,174 COVID-19 contacts; maximum (peak) contacts/day (12,163) on 16-Mar-2020.

While many individuals comply with these recommendations, compliance has been far from universal. Identifying predictors of compliance is crucial for improving health-behavior messaging and thereby reducing disease spread and fatalities. METHOD We report pre-registered analyses from a longitudinal study which investigated personality predictors of compliance with behavioral recommendations in diverse U.S. adults across five waves from March through August, 2020 (N=596) and cross-sectionally in August, 2020 (N=405). RESULTS Agreeableness-characterized by compassion-was the most consistent predictor of compliance, above and beyond other traits and socio-demographic predictors (Sample A  = 0.25; Sample B  = 0.12). The effect of agreeableness was robust across two diverse samples and sensitivity analyses. In addition, openness, conscientiousness, and extraversion were also associated with greater compliance but effects were less consistent across sensitivity analyses and were smaller in Sample A. CONCLUSIONS Individuals who are less agreeable are at high-risk for non-compliance with behavioral mandates, suggesting that health messaging can be meaningfully improved with approaches that address these individuals in particular.

Ocrelizumab has been shown to reduce the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination, but the T-cell response to vaccination has not been fully characterized. We sought to provide data regarding B and T-cell mediated responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in ocrelizumab-treated patients, and to determine what variables correlate with vaccine immunogenicity. We hypothesized that patients without a humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination would still have intact T-cell responses. METHODS: : We conducted a prospective, observational, single center cohort study of patients with MS treated with either ocrelizumab or natalizumab as a comparator between March 2, 2021, and July 1, 2021. Eligible patients were age 18 to 55 and had no known prior infection with, or vaccination against, SARS-CoV-2. Patients with prior use of immunosuppressive or chemotherapeutic agents, or treatment with any anti-CD20 therapy other than ocrelizumab within 12 months of enrollment, were excluded. The Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay was performed prior to and 3-4 weeks post vaccination to evaluate the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG. The Adaptive Biotechnologies T-Detect COVID Test was performed to evaluate the adaptive T-cell immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in OCR-treated patients with no detectable antibodies. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Fisher's exact test, and Wilcoxon rank sum. RESULTS: : Forty-eight patients were enrolled in the study, 69% treated with ocrelizumab and 31% treated with natalizumab. Eighteen percent of ocrelizumab and 100% of natalizumab patients had a positive antibody response. In ocrelizumab-treated patients, there was no correlation between age, sex, BMI, total number of infusions, immunoglobulin G, CD19, or absolute lymphocyte count and antibody response. There was a trend suggesting that a longer interval between the last infusion and vaccination increased the likelihood of producing antibodies (P=0.062). All ocrelizumab patients with negative antibody responses had positive T-cell responses. CONCLUSIONS: : Treatment with ocrelizumab substantially impaired the humoral response to SAR-CoV-2 vaccination but did not impair T-cell responses. Further research is needed to determine if the T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is sufficient to prevent infection or reduce severity of COVID in patients who did not produce antibodies.","output":"Humoral and T-Cell Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Multiple Sclerosis Patients Treated with Ocrelizumab"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the Covid-19 pandemic fake news has been circulating impacting on the general population's opinion about a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2.

Following viral infection, autophagy is often initiated to curtail infection by delivering viral particles for lysosomal degradation and further integrating with innate pattern recognition receptor signaling to induce interferon (IFN)-mediated viral clearance. However, some viruses have evolved anti-autophagy strategies to escape host immunity and to promote viral replication. In this chapter, we illustrate how autophagy prevents viral infection to generate an optimal anti-viral milieu, and then concentrate on how viruses subvert and hijack the autophagic process to evade immunosurveillance, thereby facilitating viral replication and pathogenesis. Understanding the interplays between autophagy and viral infection is anticipated to guide the development of effective anti-viral therapeutics to fight against infectious diseases.","output":"Autophagy and Viral Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liver transplantation rates have been negatively affected by the pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

It is the leading cause of death in HIV patients in Asia and Africa. No major advance has been made in the treatment of CM since the 1970s. The mainstays of induction therapy are amphotericin B and flucytosine, but these are often poorly available where the disease burden is highest. Adjunctive treatments, such as dexamethasone, have had dramatic effects on mortality in other neurologic infections, but are untested in CM. Given the high death rates in patients receiving current optimal treatment, and the lack of new agents on the horizon, adjuvant treatments, which offer the potential to reduce mortality in CM, should be tested. The principal research question posed by this study is as follows: does adding dexamethasone to standard antifungal therapy for CM reduce mortality? Dexamethasone is a cheap, readily available, and practicable intervention. METHOD: A double-blind placebo-controlled trial with parallel arms in which patients are randomised to receive either dexamethasone or placebo, in addition to local standard of care. The study recruits patients in both Asia and Africa to ensure the relevance of its results to the populations in which the disease burden is highest. The 10-week mortality risk in the control group is expected to be between 30% and 50%, depending on location, and the target hazard ratio of 0.7 corresponds to absolute risk reductions in mortality from 30% to 22%, or from 50% to 38%. Assuming an overall 10-week mortality of at least 30% in our study population, recruitment of 824 patients will be sufficient to observe the expected number of deaths. Allowing for some loss to follow-up, the total sample size for this study is 880 patients.

Likewise, the identification of factors that shape symbiont metacommunity structures is important in disease ecology because resulting structures drive disease transmission. We tested the hypothesis that distributions of virus species and viral families from rodents and bats are defined by shared responses to host phylogeny and host functional characteristics, shaping the viral metacommunity structures at four spatial scales (Continental, Biogeographical, Zoogeographical, and Regional). The contribution of host phylogeny and host traits to the metacommunity of viruses at each spatial scale was calculated using a redundant analysis of canonical ordering (RDA). For rodents, at American Continental scale the coherence of viral species metacommunity increased while the spatial scale decreased and Quasi-Clementsian structures were observed. This pattern suggests a restricted distribution of viruses through their hosts, while in the Big Mass (Europe, Africa, and Asia), the coherence decreased as spatial scale decreased. Viral species metacommunities associated with bats was dominated by random structures along all spatial scales. We suggest that this random pattern is a result of the presence of viruses with high occupancy range such as rabies (73%) and coronavirus (27%), that disrupt such structures. At viral family scale, viral metacommunities associated with bats showed coherent structures, with the emergence of Quasi- Clementsian and Checkerboard structures. RDA analysis indicates that the assemblage of viral diversity associated with rodents and bats responds to phylogenetic and functional characteristics, which alternate between spatial scales. Several of these variations could be subject to the spatial scale, in spite of this, we could identify patterns at macro ecological scale. The application of metacommunity theory at symbiont scales is particularly useful for large-scale ecological analysis. Understanding the rules of host-virus association can be useful to take better decisions in epidemiological surveillance, control and even predictions of viral distribution and dissemination.

The prefusion Spike protein (S) is a large trimeric protein where each protomer may be in a so-called Up state or Down state, depending on the configuration of its receptor binding domain (RBD) within its distal, prefusion S1 domain. The Up state is believed to allow binding of the virion to ACE-2 receptors on human epithelial cells, whereas the Down state is believed to be relatively inactive or reduced in its binding behavior. We have performed detailed all-atom, dominant energy landscape mappings for noncovalent interactions (charge, partial charge, and van der Waals) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in its static prefusion state based on two recent and independent experimental structure publications. We included both interchain interactions and intrachain (domain) interactions in our mappings in order to determine any telling differences (different so-called \\"glue\\" points) between residues in the Up and Down state protomers. The S2 proximal, fusion domain demonstrated no appreciable energetic differences between Up and Down protomers, including interchain as well as each protomer's intrachain, S1-S2 interactions. However, the S1 domain interactions across neighboring protomers, which include the RBD-NTD cross chain interactions, showed significant energetic differences between Up-Down and Down-Down neighboring protomers. This included, for example, a key RBD residue ARG357 in the Up-Down interaction and a three residue sequence ALA520-PRO521-ALA522, associated with a turn structure in the RBD of the Up state protomer, acting as a stabilizing interaction with the NTD of its neighbor protomer. Additionally, our intra chain dominant energy mappings within each protomer, identified a significant \\"glue\\" point or possible \\"latch\\" for the Down state protomer between the S1 subdomain, SD1, and the RBD domain of the same protomer that was completely missing in the Up state protomer analysis. Ironically, this dominant energetic interaction in the Down state protomer involved the backbone atoms of the same three residue sequence ALA520-PRO521-ALA522 of the RBD with the amino acid R-group of GLN564 in the SD1 domain. Thus, this same three residue sequence acts as a stabilizer of the RBD in the Up conformation through its interactions with its neighboring NTD chain and a kind of latch in the Down state conformation through its interactions with its own SD1 domain. The dominant interaction energy residues identified here are also conserved across reported variations of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the closely related virions SARS-Cov and the bat corona virus RatG13. We conducted preliminary molecular dynamics simulations across 0.1  seconds to see if this latch provided structural stability and indeed found that a single point mutation (Q564G) resulted in the latch releasing transforming the protomer from the Down to the Up state conformation. Full trimeric Spike protein studies of the same mutation across all protomers, however, did not exhibit latch release demonstrating the critical importance of interchain interactions across the S1 domain, including RBD-NTD neighboring chain interactions. Therapies aimed at disrupting these noncovalent interactions could be a viable route for the physico-chemical mitigation of this deadly virion.","output":"Static all-atom energetic mappings of the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein and dynamic stability analysis of \\"Up\\" versus \\"Down\\" protomer states"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"College English classroom teaching evaluation is one of the key issues discussed by all schools at present.

To fill this gap, we conducted regression analysis based on country level time series data from the United Nations and World Bank datasets. The results of the random effects panel regression models show that, the country import and export values are positively affected by health-related policies, while there is a negative association between stringency measures and import and export values. More specifically, school closing, stay-at-home requirements, and testing policy measures were found to have significant negative effects on countries' trade values. In contrast, facial covering policies were found to have significant positive effects on countries' import, export and total trade values.","output":"Impacts of COVID-19 public measures on country-level trade flows: Global panel regression analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the development of higher resolution contents and displays, its significant volume poses significant challenges to the goals of acquiring, transmitting, compressing, and displaying high-quality video content. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning video compression architecture that does not require motion estimation, which is the most expensive element of modern hybrid video compression codecs like H.264 and HEVC. Our framework exploits the regularities inherent to video motion, which we capture by using displaced frame differences as video representations to train the neural network. In addition, we propose a new space-time reconstruction network based on both an LSTM model and a UNet model, which we call LSTM-UNet. The new video compression framework has three components: a Displacement Calculation Unit (DCU), a Displacement Compression Network (DCN), and a Frame Reconstruction Network (FRN). The DCU removes the need for motion estimation found in hybrid codecs and is less expensive. In the DCN, an RNN-based network is utilized to compress displaced frame differences as well as retain temporal information between frames. The LSTM-UNet is used in the FRN to learn space-time differential representations of videos. Our experimental results show that our compression model, which we call the MOtionless VIdeo Codec (MOVI-Codec), learns how to efficiently compress videos without computing motion. Our experiments show that MOVI-Codec outperforms the Low-Delay P veryfast setting of the video coding standard H.264 and exceeds the performance of the modern global standard HEVC codec, using the same setting, as measured by MS-SSIM, especially on higher resolution videos. In addition, our network outperforms the latest H.266 (VVC) codec at higher bitrates, when assessed using MS-SSIM, on high-resolution videos.","output":"Learning to Compress Videos without Computing Motion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Although the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the incidence of distress in youth, some children show increased resilience, emphasizing the need to better understand the predictors of distress in youth. Objective This longitudinal study aimed to assess the combined impact of known socio-emotional predictors of stress-related psychopathology, namely anxiety sensitivity, anxiety trait, intolerance to uncertainty, and rumination, on COVID-related distress in healthy youth. Method A total of 92 parent-child dyads that previously participated in a laboratory-based experiment assessing observational fear learning in families between 2017 and 2019 (T0) were recontacted. Of them, 84 children aged between 9 and 14 agreed to participate. They completed online questionnaires in June 2020 (T1), September 2020 (T2), December 2020 (T3), and March 2021 (T4). Participants were free of mental illness at T0 and T1. To create a socio-emotional composite score (SECS), we measured anxiety sensitivity (Childhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index) at T0, trait anxiety (Trait subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAI-C)), intolerance to uncertainty (Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale for Children), and trait rumination (Childrens Response Style Scale) at T1 and created a weighted z-score. To assess symptoms of anxiety, post-traumatic stress (PTS), and depression in reaction to COVID-19, participants completed the State subscale of the STAI-C, the Childrens Revised Impact of Event Scale, and the Childrens Depression Inventory at T1CT4. Three general linear models were run with sex, age group (9C11 and 12+ years old), and SECS as predictors. Results Analyses revealed a SECS*Time interaction, with higher SECS predicting elevated anxiety symptoms at T1 and T4, and elevated PTS symptoms at T1 and T2. Conclusion These results suggest that healthy youth endorsing high levels of socio-emotional vulnerability to psychopathology have a higher risk of suffering from anxiety and PTS, but not depressive symptoms, in the year following a major stressor. HIGHLIGHTS This longitudinal study conducted in Quebec, Canada shows that healthy youth endorsing elevated socio-emotional vulnerability, as assessed by a composite score, report greater post-traumatic stress and anxiety symptoms, but not depressive symptoms in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

IBD patient conditions and treatments, such as with immunosuppressants, may result in a higher risk of viral and bacterial infection and more severe outcomes of infections. The effect of the clinical and demographic factors on the prognosis of COVID-19 among IBD patients is still a significant area of investigation. The lack of available data on a large set of COVID-19 infected IBD patients has hindered progress. To circumvent this lack of large patient data, we present a random sampling approach to generate clinical COVID-19 outcomes (outpatient management, hospitalized and recovered, and hospitalized and deceased) on 20,000 IBD patients modeled on reported summary statistics obtained from the Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion (SECURE-IBD), an international database to monitor and report on outcomes of COVID-19 occurring in IBD patients. We apply machine learning approaches to perform a comprehensive analysis of the primary and secondary covariates to predict COVID-19 outcome in IBD patients. Our analysis reveals that age, medication usage and the number of comorbidities are the primary covariates, while IBD severity, smoking history, gender and IBD subtype (CD or UC) are key secondary features. In particular, elderly male patients with ulcerative colitis, several preexisting conditions, and who smoke comprise a highly vulnerable IBD population. Moreover, treatment with 5-ASAs (sulfasalazine/mesalamine) shows a high association with COVID-19/IBD mortality. Supervised machine learning that considers age, number of comorbidities and medication usage can predict COVID-19/IBD outcomes with approximately 70% accuracy. We explore the challenge of drawing demographic inferences from existing COVID-19/IBD data. Overall, there are fewer IBD case reports from US states with poor health ranking hindering these analyses. Generation of patient characteristics based on known summary statistics allows for increased power to detect IBD factors leading to variable COVID-19 outcomes. There is under-reporting of COVID-19 in IBD patients from US states with poor health ranking, underpinning the perils of using the repository to derive demographic information.","output":"A machine learning approach identifies 5-ASA and ulcerative colitis as being linked with higher COVID-19 mortality in patients with IBD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has resulted in a rapid pivot toward telemedicine owing to closure of in-person elective clinics and sustained efforts at physical distancing worldwide Throughout this period, there has been revived enthusiasm for delivering and receiving orthopaedic care remotely Unfortunately, rapidly published editorials and commentaries during the pandemic have not adequately conveyed findings of published randomized trials on this topic QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials, we asked: (1) What are the levels of patient and surgeon satisfaction with the use of telemedicine as a tool for orthopaedic care delivery? (2) Are there differences in patient-reported outcomes between telemedicine visits and in-person visits? (3) What is the difference in time commitment between telemedicine and in-person visits? METHODS: In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a systematic review with the primary objective to determine patient and surgeon satisfaction with telemedicine, and secondary objectives to determine differences in patient-reported outcomes and time commitment We used combinations of search keywords and medical subject headings around the terms \\"telemedicine\\", \\"telehealth\\", and \\"virtual care\\" combined with \\"orthopaedic\\", \\"orthopaedic surgery\\" and \\"randomized \\" We searched three medical databases (MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) in duplicate and performed manual searches to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating the outcomes of telemedicine and in-person orthopaedic assessments Trials that studied an intervention that was considered to be telemedicine (that is, any form of remote or virtual care including, but not limited to, video, telephone, or internet-based care), had a control group that comprised in-person assessments performed by orthopaedic surgeons, and were reports of Level I original evidence were included in this study Studies evaluating physiotherapy or rehabilitation interventions were excluded Data was extracted by two reviewers and quantitative and qualitive summaries of results were generated Methodological quality of included trials was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, which uniformly rated the trials at high risk of bias within the blinding categories (blinding of providers, patients, and outcome assessors) We screened 133 published articles;12 articles (representing eight randomized controlled trials) met the inclusion criteria There were 1008 patients randomized (511 to telemedicine groups and 497 to control groups) Subspecialties represented were hip and knee arthroplasty (two trials), upper extremity (two trials), pediatric trauma (one trial), adult trauma (one trial), and general orthopaedics (two trials) RESULTS: There was no difference in the odds of satisfaction between patients receiving telemedicine care and those receiving in-person care (pooled odds ratio 0 89 [95% CI 0 40 to 1 99];p = 0 79) There were also no differences in surgeon satisfaction (pooled OR 0 38 [95% CI 0 07 to 2 19];p = 0 28) or among multiple patient-reported outcome measures that evaluated pain and function Patients reported time savings, both when travel time was excluded (17 minutes shorter [95% CI 2 to 32];p = 0 03) and when it was included (180 minutes shorter [95% CI 78 to 281];p &lt; 0 001) CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from heterogeneous randomized studies demonstrates that the use of telemedicine for orthopaedic assessments does not result in identifiable differences in patient or surgeon satisfaction compared with in-person assessments Importantly, the source studies in this review did not adequately capture or report safety endpoints, such as complications or missed diagnoses Future studies must be adequately powered to detect these differences to ensure patient safety is not compromised with the use of telemedicine Although telemedicine may lead to a similar patient experience, surgeons should maintain a low threshold for follow-up with in-person assessments whenever possible in the absence of further safety data LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, therapeutic study","output":"How Satisfied Are Patients and Surgeons with Telemedicine in Orthopaedic Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic?

While COVID-19 patients are known to exhibit a variety of symptoms, the major symptoms include fever, cough, and fatigue. Since these symptoms also appear in pneumonia patients, this creates complications in COVID-19 detection especially during the flu season. Early studies identified abnormalities in chest X-ray images of COVID-19 infected patients that could be beneficial for disease diagnosis. Therefore, chest X-ray image-based disease classification has emerged as an alternative to aid medical diagnosis. However, manual detection of COVID-19 from a set of chest X-ray images comprising both COVID-19 and pneumonia cases is cumbersome and prone to human error. Thus, artificial intelligence techniques powered by deep learning algorithms, which learn from radiography images and predict presence of COVID-19 have potential to enhance current diagnosis process. Towards this purpose, here we implemented a set of deep learning pre-trained models such as ResNet, VGG, Inception and EfficientNet in conjunction with developing a computer vision AI system based on our own convolutional neural network (CNN) model: Deep Learning in Healthcare (DLH)-COVID. All these CNN models cater to image classification exercise. We used publicly available resources of 6,432 images and further strengthened our model by tuning hyperparameters to provide better generalization during the model validation phase. Our final DLH-COVID model yielded the highest accuracy of 96% in detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images when compared to images of both pneumonia-affected and healthy individuals. Given the practicality of acquiring chest X-ray images by patients, we also developed a web application (link: https://toad.li/xray) based on our model to directly enable users to upload chest X-ray images and detect the presence of COVID-19 within a few seconds. Taken together, here we introduce a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence-based system for efficient COVID-19 detection and a user-friendly application that has the capacity to become a rapid COVID-19 diagnosis method in the near future.","output":"COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Image Classification Using Deep Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) has been identified as a risk factor for severe COVID-19. DM is highly prevalent in the general population. Defining strategies to reduce the health care system burden and the late arrival of some patients thus seems crucial. The study aim was to compare phenotypic characteristics between in and outpatients with diabetes and infected by COVID-19, and to build an easy-to-use hospitalization prediction risk score. This was a retrospective observational study. Patients with DM and laboratory- or CT-confirmed COVID-19, who did (n = 185) and did not (n = 159) require hospitalization between 10 March and 10 April 2020, were compared. Data on diabetes duration, treatments, glycemic control, complications, anthropometrics and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) were collected from medical records. Stepwise multivariate logistic regressions and ROC analyses were performed to build the DIAB score, a score using no more than five easy-to-collect clinical parameters predicting the risk of hospitalization. The DIAB score was then validated in two external cohorts (n = 132 and n = 2036). Hospitalized patients were older (68.0  12.6 vs. 55.2  12.6 years, p < 0.001), with more class III obesity (BMI  40 kg/m(2), 9.7 vs. 3.5%, p = 0.03), hypertension (81.6 vs. 44.3%, p < 0.0001), insulin therapy (37% vs. 23.7%, p = 0.009), and lower SpO(2) (91.6 vs. 97.3%, p < 0.0001) than outpatients. Type 2 DM (T2D) was found in 94% of all patients, with 10 times more type 1 DM in the outpatient group (11.3 vs. 1.1%, p < 0.0001). A DIAB score > 27 points predicted hospitalization (sensitivity 77.7%, specificity 89.2%, AUC = 0.895), and death within 28 days. Its performance was validated in the two external cohorts. Outpatients with diabetes were found to be younger, with fewer diabetic complications and less severe obesity than inpatients.

One of the earliest questions was in relation to the ability of the immunocompromised patients to clear the infection. In COST EuNet-INNOCHRON we were interested in the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with different types of chronic neutropenia (CNP). The aim of the current study is to understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to identify any possible characteristic patterns of the clinical course in patients with CNP. Patients and Methods: The COST EuNet-INNOCHRON Action in collaboration with the European Haematology Association - Scientific Working Group (EHA-SWG) on Granulocytes and Constitutional Marrow Failure Syndromes has conducted an online survey on SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with CNP. The EuNet-INNOCHRON participants from different countries got access to an on-line platform fulfilling the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and could register adult and paediatric CNP patients who had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 from March 2020 to June 2021. Data on demographic characteristics, type of CNP, patients' background and SARS-CoV-2 infection history (symptoms, laboratory features, radiological appearance, therapeutic approach and outcome) were collected. Results: Twenty-six patients with diagnosis of CNP, 7 males and 19 females were registered. Patient age distribution as follows: 16 patients >18 years old (y.o.)5 patients 5-18 y.o, 4 patients < 5 y.o whereas age was not available for one of the patients. Nine of the patients were diagnosed with idiopathic CNP, 7 patients with congenital neutropenia (6 of them with severe congenital neutropenia), 3 with secondary CNP, 2 with suspected autoimmune neutropenia of infancy (although antineutrophil Ab were negative), one with autoimmune neutropenia, one with drug induced neutropenia and 3 with other types of CNP. Twelve patients were on treatment with G-CSF and 6 patients had a history of previous viral or bacterial infections. Clonal Cytopenia(s) of Undetermined Significance (CCUS) was excluded in the eight patients who were investigated. Twenty-four out of 26 patients had positive PCR and one was found incidentally with positive antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. One more patient was symptomatic with history of close contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected family members. The commonest observed symptoms were fever >38 oC (19 patients), cough (10 patients), rhinorrhoea (10 patients), sore throat (6 patients), musculoskeletal pains (7 patients), taste/smell loss (5 patients), headache (5 patients), dyspnoea (4 patients), chest pain (one patient) and none of them had gastrointestinal symptoms. No other associated respiratory viral or bacterial infections were reported. Four patients who had one or more underlying conditions (immune deficiency, heart/respiratory/kidney disease) were admitted in hospital and needed anti SARS-CoV-2 treatment. Two of them had non-invasive ventilation and one of them needed admission in intensive care unit (ICU); both recovered. Another patient with Fallot's tetralogy needed mechanical ventilation in ICU and sadly passed away. No other deaths were observed. Deterioration of the pre-existing neutropenia was seen in two patients, two patients developed thrombocytopenia, one patient developed worsening lymphopenia and one anaemia. Twelve patients had chest X-ray and consolidation was found in two of them. All three patients who had chest CT scans were found with ground-glass changes. During the observation period (up to two months), no re-infection from SARS-CoV-2 was found. The Stockholm, Sweden experience is similar to the above data. One hundred fifty-four patients with CNP were followed up, for 10 months (March 1 to December 31, 2020) for SARS-CoV-2. Seventeen of these (i.e. 11 %) were infected. None needed hospitalization and there were no fatalities. Conclusion: Although the relative susceptibility of neutropenic patients to contract SARS-CoV-2 needs to be assessed with further studies, the clinical course and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection doesn't seem to be worse in CNP patients (regardless the type of neutropenia and the need for GCSF treatment) compared to the general population. Also, like what has been observed in non-neutropenic patients, underlying comorbidities is a significant risk factor for severe disease and adverse outcome.

Furin and the other proprotein convertases modify certain other proteins to change them from their inactive to active forms. Previous attempts to find an effective, non-toxic furin inhibitor to treat diseases facilitated by furin have had only limited success, due to toxicity or large molecular size that impedes absorption of the molecule. This has placed increased importance on the development of small-molecule furin inhibitors. The object of this study was to consider the effect of the noble gas helium as a furin inhibitor. Methods This study uses a fluorometric furin inhibition assay to compare the enzymatic activity of recombinant human furin after exposure to balloon-grade helium gas, compared to the enzymatic activity of untreated recombinant human furin. Results Helium exposure was found to decrease the in vitro enzymatic activity of recombinant human furin by as much as 55%; this inhibition lasted for up to 16 hours. Fluorescence measurements of enzymatic activity were taken for 24 hours. Conclusions These findings appear to be the first to report helium as a partial furin inhibitor. The observed partial inhibition was consistent throughout the experiment. The effectiveness of helium as a partial furin inhibitor, its favorable side-effect profile, and its long history of safe use in respiratory therapy, when mixed with 20% oxygen or more and administered under direct medical supervision, make it a promising treatment for diseases facilitated by furin or its substrates.

Amongst the broad-acting ISGs was BST2/tetherin, which impeded viral release, and is antagonized by SARS-CoV-2 Orf7a protein. Overall, these data illuminate a set of ISGs that underlie innate immune control of SARS-CoV-2/-1 infection, which will facilitate the understanding of host determinants that impact disease severity and offer potential therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.","output":"Functional Landscape of SARS-CoV-2 Cellular Restriction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThe UK has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact on the adult population has been disproportionately higher when compared to children with consequent challenges to organ donation and liver transplantation (LT). Across the three UK paediatric liver centres there has only been a very small number of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and all made a speedy and full recovery. We report here the response during the pandemic across the 3 paediatric LT centres.MethodsA series of nationally agreed policy changes affecting the liver procurement, listing and transplant process were agreed during regular meetings with LT centre directors and NHSE. Actions at a local and national level were agreed to protect and maintain the paediatric LT programmes.Data were collected from 27/03/20 until 26/11/20 and compared with same time period for the years 2016C19.ResultsDuring the study period, there was a significant reduction in the adult population in the mean number of weekly liver offers, donors and LTs compared to before the pandemic with signs of recovery between the 1st and 2nd UK lockdown periods (figure 1). More specifically the number of livers offered nationally was reduced from an average 30C40/week to only &lt;10/week during the 1st wave in the March-April period. The number of children on the LT list during the study period across all 3 centres was 74 in total with 17 (23%) super-urgent and 57(77%) electives, which was comparable to previous years.Overall, 65C80 paediatric LTs are performed annually across the UKs 3 paediatric centres. From March-November 2020 there were 58(82%) elective and 13(18%) super urgent (acute liver failure & hepatoblastoma) paediatric LTs performed.Donor Brain Dead (DBD) and Donor Cardiac Dead (DCDC) LTs were 54(76%) and 3(4%), respectively. Living related LT (LRLT) programme was sustained comprising 20% of LTs performed.The number of paediatric LTs performed during the pandemic was comparable to those performed yearly since 2016. The number of LT per paediatric centre for Kings College Hospital (KCH), Birmingham Childrens Hospital (BCH) and Leeds Liver Unit were 40 (56%), 15(21%) and 16(23%), respectively with excellent outcome. A 15-year-old girl from KCH diagnosed with Wilson disease presented with liver failure and became COVID-19 positive whilst listed. She underwent LT soon after becoming COVID-19 negative. No perioperative mortality was reported with excellent outcome so far in all.ConclusionThe current COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the UK adult LT programme. The paediatric programme LT was preserved despite a decrease in organ offering and retrieval nationally plus limitations on adult intensive care resources at a regional level. Overall, paediatric LT outcome remained very good.","output":"O3 The UK paediatric liver transplant programme during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To summarize the clinical characteristics and chest CT findings of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19)patients in Peking Union Medical College Hospital(PUMCH). Methods A total of 13 patients with COVID-19 confirmed at PUMCH from January 20 to February 6,2020 were selected as the research subjects.Their epidemiological histories,clinical characteristics,laboratory tests,and chest CT findings were analyzed retrospectively.The location,distribution,density,and other accompanying signs of abnormal lung CT lesions were recorded,and the clinical types of these patients were assessed. Results The clinical type was \\"common type\\" in all these 13 patients aged(46.814.7)years(range:27-68 years).Ten patients had a travel history to Wuhan or direct contact with patients from Wuhan,2 cases had recent travel histories,and 1 case had a travel history to Beijing suburb.The white blood cell(WBC)count was normal or decreased in 92.3% of the patients and the lymphocyte count decreased in 15.4% of the patients.Twelve patients(92.3%)had a fever,among whom 11 patients were admitted due to fever and 2 patients(15.4%)had low fever.Eight patients(61.5%)had dry cough.The CT findings in these 13 patients were all abnormal.The lesions were mainly distributed along the bronchi and under the pleura.The lesions were relatively limited in 8 patients(affecting 1-3 lobes,predominantly in the right or left lower lobe),and diffuse multiple lesions of bilateral lungs were seen in 5 patients.The CT findings mainly included ground glass opacities(GGOs)(n=10,76.9%),focal consolidation within GGOs(n=7,53.8%),thickened vascular bundle passing through the lesions(n=10,76.9%),bronchial wall thickening(n=12,92.3%),air bronchogram(n=10,76.9%),vacuole signs in the lesions(n=7,53.8%),fine reticulation and interlobular septal thickening(n=3,23.1%),reversed halo-sign(n=2,15.4%),crazy-paving pattern(n=2,15.4%),and pleural effusion(n=2,15.4%).Conclusions Most of our patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at PUMCH had a travel history to Wuhan or direct contact with patients from Wuhan.The first symptoms of COVID-19 mainly include fever and dry cough,along with normal or reduced counts of WBC and lymphocytes.CT may reveal that the lesions distribute along the bronchi and under the pleura;they are typically localized GGOs in the early stage but can become multiple GGOs and infiltrative consolidation in both lungs in the advanced stage.Scattered vacuole signs may be visible inside the lesions in some patients.","output":"[Preliminary Study on Clinical Features and CT Findings of Common-type Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients in Peking Union Medical College Hospital]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Older adults are the main risk group for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Many factors have potential for detrimental impacts on psychological wellbeing and eating disorder recovery, including: Disruption to living situations, social distancing restrictions, difficult access to healthcare, and societal changes to food behaviours and technology usage. To date, little is known on the impact of the pandemic on this population particularly within the UK. Method: A mixed-methods online survey was developed for the purpose of this study. Data was collected from 129 individuals currently experiencing, or in recovery from, an eating disorder during the early stages of the UK pandemic lockdown. Participants were aged between 16-65 years, with 121 participants identifying as female, 7 male and 1 participant preferring not to disclose their gender. Results: Findings suggest that the pandemic is having a profound, negative impact upon individuals with experience of eating disorders. 8 key themes are generated: Disruption to living situation, increased social isolation and reduced access to usual support networks, changes to physical activity rates, reduced access to healthcare services, disruption to routine and perceived control, changes to relationship with food, increased exposure to triggering messages, and positive outcomes. The results suggest detrimental impacts on psychological wellbeing including decreased feelings of control, increased feelings of social isolation, increased rumination about disordered eating, and low feelings of social support. Conclusions: Individuals with eating disorders are at significant risk of negative impacts of the pandemic. There is a vital need for interventions to support this population. Inequalities in healthcare provision were identified, emphasising a need for a more cohesive approach to remote treatment across UK healthcare services. Positive aspects of technology use were identified but the results suggest a need to address and/or limit the potential for negative impacts of public messages around food and exercise behaviours, and to co-design technologies with end-users to facilitate effective treatment.","output":"Exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and UK lockdown on individuals with experience of eating disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Protein structures solved by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) or X-ray crystallography often miss the sugar molecules known as glycans that cover large swaths of the proteins surfaces The recently reported structures of the spike protein on SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, are no different Researchers are now working to fill in some of those sugary blanks to better understand the viruss biology and to help drugmakers develop vaccines and treatments People usually go for what they can analyze and focus mostly on the protein components of a structure, says Andrea Thorn, a structural biologist at the Julius Maximilian University of Wrzburg She is a member of the Coronavirus Structural Task Force, a group of scientists who specialize in modeling and processing crystallographic and cryo-EM data Because structural biology measurements dont reveal much about glycans on proteins, we often fail to recognize what an important part of the structure they","output":"Adding the missing sugars to coronavirus protein structures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We report on the first identified cluster of the B.1.1.7 variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in the northeast of Italy.

In the present study, we are reporting a de novo designed novel hybrid antiviral 'VTAR-01' molecule that binds at the interface of RBD-hACE2 interaction. A series of antiviral molecules were tested for binding at the interface of RBD-hACE2 interaction. In silico screening, molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) analysis suggest ribavirin, ascorbate, lopinavir and hydroxychloroquine have strong interaction at the RBD-hACE2 interface. These four molecules were used for de novo fragment-based antiviral design. De novo designing, docking and MDS analysis identified a 'VTAR' hybrid molecule that has better interaction with this interface than all of the antivirals used to design it. We have further used retrosynthetic analysis and combinatorial synthesis to design 100 variants of VTAR molecules. Retrosynthetic analysis and combinatorial synthesis, along with docking and MDS, identified that VTAR-01 interacts with the interface of the RBD-ACE2 complex. MDS analysis confirmed its interaction with the RBD-ACE2 interface by involving Glu35 and Lys353 of ACE2, as well as Gln493 and Ser494 of RBD.

RESULTS A total of 533 patients who underwent NOTES procedures were included in the study. Four different hybrid techniques for 435 cholecystectomies were described, registering postoperative complications in 2.8% of patients, addition of a single trocar in 5.3%, and conversions to laparoscopy in 0.5%. Both flexible endoscopic and rigid laparoscopic cholecystectomy techniques proved to be safe and effective with minor differences. There was a shorter operative time in the rigid laparoscopic group. Thirty-three appendectomies were reported by transgastric and transvaginal techniques, with transvaginal techniques scoring shorter operative time and hospital stay, but with a frequent need to add more trocars. Overall complications occurred in 14.7% of patients but they did not differ significantly among the different techniques. One transvaginal and 31 transanal sigmoidectomies were included for prolapse and diverticulitis, with four postoperative complications (12.5%), but none needing further treatment. Twenty peroral esophageal myotomies were included with three postoperative complications (15.0%), but none needing further treatment. CONCLUSIONS Five years since the introduction of NOTES into clinical practice, hybrid techniques have gained considerable clinical application. Several NOTES hybrid cholecystectomy and appendectomy techniques are practicable and safe alternatives to laparoscopic procedures. Also, sigmoidectomies and peroral esophageal myotomies were described, proving feasibility and safety. Nevertheless, the real benefit of NOTES for patients still needs to be assessed.","output":"The EURO-NOTES clinical registry for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery: a 2-year activity report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic forged theexponential use of masks of various kinds, not just by health workers but also by general population as a personal protective equipment (PPE).

Despite a long history of safety-focused work, a recent cluster of patient safety events prompted a renewed comprehensive approach to improve safety processes and transform culture. Methods Our team comprehensively approached perioperative safety through integration across traditional silos and a focus on institutional safety culture. This approach consisted of a careful review of all events, developing Perioperative Safety Coordinating and Education teams, testing and implementing new/revised safety processes, and an ongoing evaluation plan. Results Updates to our Perioperative Safety Mission and Tenets and the development of an empowered Safety Culture Champion team composed of a diverse group of frontline team members addressed our safety culture. In addition, key safety processes (time-outs, intraoperative huddles, and prevention of retained foreign bodies) were revised and implemented. Observation of key safety processes demonstrates a 90% compliance, which includes all steps and team engagement. After implementation, a span of 377 days between events was accomplished, which is significantly higher than the 33 days between events during our cluster. Conclusions This work builds upon prior incremental improvements through a comprehensive investment in not only improving key processes but transforming the safety culture. Acceptable deviance from the standard process is no longer the norm. Instead, an approach that emphasizes understanding, integration, engagement, and accountability for safety by each team member for every patient, every time, every day, has been implemented.","output":"Perioperative Safety: Engage, Integrate, Empower, Sustain to Eliminate Patient Safety Events."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Metal complexes have numerous applications in the current era, particularly in the field of pharmaceutical chemistry and catalysis. A novel synthetic approach for the same is always a beneficial addition to the literature. Henceforth, for the first time, we report the formation of three new Pd(II) complexes through the Michael addition pathway. Three chromone-based thiosemicarbazone ligands (SVSL1CSVSL3) and Pd(II) complexes (1C3) were synthesized and characterized by analytical and spectroscopic tools. The Michael addition pathway for the formation of complexes was confirmed by spectroscopic studies. Distorted square planar structure of complex 2 was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Complexes 1C3 were subjected to DNA- and BSA-binding studies. The complex with cyclohexyl substituent on the terminal N of thiosemicarbazone (3) showed the highest binding efficacy toward these biomolecules, which was further understood through molecular docking studies. The anticancer potential of these complexes was studied preliminarily by using MTT assay in cancer and normal cell lines along with the benchmark drugs (cisplatin, carboplatin, and gemcitabine). It was found that complex 3 was highly toxic toward MDA-MB-231 and AsPC-1 cancer cells with IC(50) values of 0.5 and 0.9 M, respectively, and was more efficient than the standard drugs. The programmed cell death mechanism of the complexes in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells was confirmed. Furthermore, the complexes induced apoptosis via ROS-mediated mitochondrial signaling pathway. Conveniently, all the complexes showed less toxicity (50 M) against MCF-10a normal cell line. Molecular docking studies were performed with VEGFR2, EGFR, and SARS-CoV-2 main protease to illustrate the binding efficiency of the complexes with these receptors. To our surprise, binding potential of the complexes with SARS-CoV-2 main protease was higher than that with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.","output":"Synthesis of Palladium(II) Complexes via Michael Addition: Antiproliferative Effects through ROS-Mediated Mitochondrial Apoptosis and Docking with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In times of uncertainty, the messages we receive can be long-lasting and influential This study sought to understand what memorable messages students recalled receiving from their instructors at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and what kind of impact those messages had on them Based on open-ended responses, students (N = 297) recalled emotional support messages most frequently, followed by motivational, solidarity/unifying, compliment/praise, and tangible/informational support messages Students described how these messages influenced them in a variety of ways, including impacts on their motivation and performance, the instructorCstudent relationship, and their level of confidence and morale The majority of these messages had the most significant associations with perceptions of the instructorCstudent relationship Results highlight the influential role of instructor messages and provide important implications for instructors future communication practices, whether in times of uncertainty or stability [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Communication Education is the property of Taylor & Francis Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Memorable messages in times of uncertainty: communicative strategies to encourage motivation and connection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2019-2020 the global economy faced an unprecedented transition to remote employment New information technologies have made this transition possible, but prior to the pandemic it was implemented with great hesitation even in technologically advanced companies, whose activities are focused on data analysis The sudden push toward remote work has formed a new reality of the global labor market - mass foreign outsourcing of labor in a wide range of professions New trends are adding additional challenges for the legal regulation of labor relations at the level of states and international organizations (ILO and UN) The article asks what the socio-economic consequences of the surge in remote employment on a state and international level will be The methodology of the study consists in conducting cross-country comparisons of the social behavior of employers and employees, as well as analyzing the response of international organizations and states in terms of adapting the regulatory framework to the changed social relations The results show that the \\"point of no return\\" in the organization of labor relations has not been reached yet The effects of the increased scale of remote employment is observed only in individual and usually very large companies However, at the national level the situation with remote employment returns to a large extent to the pre-crisis level, although not completely At first glance socially comfortable model of remote employment triggers systemic risks, which, if further accelerated, will fully manifest themselves in the foreseeable future Remote employment is one of the means of labor market globalization, the pandemic of COVID-19 has acted as an accelerator for the growth of cross-border remote employment In this regard, we should expect an intensification of the international discussion on the need and sufficiency of national legislative borders that restrain the globalization of the labor market, which needs to liberalize remote employment with the participation of foreign citizens","output":"Globalization of Employment Amid COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effects of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could not have been more profound, with the world encountering health crises as well as enormous economic crises.

Some of those changes occurred in public procurement as well, with Member States struggling to react to the dissemination of the virus. The purpose of this paper is to assess what scope the EU's public procurement legal framework provides to deal with a crisis, and how the rules should be interpreted. This paper will show how the EU public procurement legal framework deals with extreme urgency situations and how it has been intentionally designed to allow Member States flexibility within very clearly defined boundaries. This means that the path to award contracts without competition on the grounds of extreme urgency is narrow due to Article 32(2)(c) of Directive 2014/24/EU() and the case law from the CJEU. The narrowness of this path is due to the exceptional nature of procedure and the obligation for the contracting authority to discharge the tight grounds for use in full for every contract. Therefore, this paper concludes that the view exposed by the European Commission on its guidance from April 2020 that the pandemic is a single unforeseeable event amounts to an incorrect reading on how the grounds for the use of Article 32(2)(c) operate. If such interpretation was already too broad in April 2020, it certainly is no longer in line with the transition from an unfolding crisis into a new and more permanent equilibrium. In the context of COVID-19, particularly the need for the crisis to be unforeseeable and the extreme urgency not being attributable to the contracting authority raise significant difficulties for some contracting authorities to discharge the grounds for use of the negotiated procedure without prior notice. This is particularly the case in those situations where governments centralized pandemic-related procurement. As such, the paper concludes that existing substantive rules for extremely urgent procurement are adequate and, albeit sufficient to respond to crisis situations, that does not entail that the wholesale use of the negotiated procedure without prior notice is necessarily legal.","output":"Extremely urgent public procurement under Directive 2014/24/EU and the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Simulation is an alternative or complementary method for students who cannot obtain sufficient direct care experience, as they allow students to experience various clinical situations. Mixed learning is becoming increasingly common as a way to provide students with opportunities to experience real-life clinical scenarios. This study compared the learning effects of a virtual simulation and a high-fidelity simulation in a different order of presentation, with a focus on training for premature rupture of membranes in the field maternity nursing. Through this comparison, this study aimed to obtain evidence to support decision-making regarding the most effective way to utilize mixed simulation strategies. METHODS: A quasi-experimental, crossover-design study was performed with two randomly allocated groups of 26 junior nursing students each. The virtual simulation used the vSim? for nursing, and the high-fidelity simulation used a scenario developed by the research team. The learning effects were measured in terms of the problem-solving process, clinical reasoning, reflective thinking, satisfaction with the practicum, and self-confidence. The data collected with a structured questionnaire were analyzed using the MannCWhitney test. RESULTS: The virtual simulation-first, high-fidelity simulation-second order led to significantly higher scores for reflective thinking (z = 3.53, p < .001) and self-confidence (z = 2.47, p = .013) than the other order. CONCLUSIONS: The initial application of virtual simulation seemed to improve students thought processes, and then high-fidelity simulation seemed to allow them to perform actual practice better.

Researchers worldwide are studying ways to decrease SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 related deaths. Several studies found altitude having a negative association with both COVID-19 incidence and deaths. Ecuadorian data was used to explore the relationship between altitude and COVID-19. METHODS: This is an ecological study examining province-level data. To explore a relationship between altitude and COVID-19, this study utilized publicly available COVID-19 data and population statistics. ANOVA, correlation statistics, and a multivariate linear model explored the relationship between different Ecuadorian altitudes against incidence, mortality, and case-fatality rates. Population statistics attributed to COVID-19 were included in the linear model to control for confounding factors. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed in the regions of Amaznica, Sierra, Costa of Ecuador for incidence, mortality, and case fatality rates, suggesting an association between altitude and SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 disease severity (p-value 0.05). In univariate analysis, altitude had a negative association to mortality rate with a 1-unit change in altitude resulting in the decrease of 0.006 units in mortality rate (p-value = 0.03). The multiple linear models adjusted for population statistics showed a statistically significant negative association of altitude with mortality rate (p-value = 0.01) with a 1-unit change in altitude resulting in the decrease in mortality rate by 0.015 units. Overall, the model helped in explaining 50% (R(2) = 0.4962) of the variance in mortality rate. CONCLUSION: Altitude may have an effect on COVID-19 mortality rates.

Internet-based behavioural activation (iBA) therapy has demonstrated its efficacy for improving postnatal depression. No study has examined whether the iBA program is also effective at preventing child abuse. This study aims to investigate whether iBA improves depressive symptoms among mothers and prevents abusive behaviours towards children in postpartum mothers in a randomized controlled trial, stratifying on depressive mood status. The study also evaluates the implementation aspects of the program, including how users, medical providers, and managers perceive the program in terms of acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and harm done. METHODS: The study is a non-blinded, stratified randomized controlled trial. Based on cut-off scores validated on Japanese mothers, participants will be stratified to either a low Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) group, (EPDS 0C8 points) or a high EPDS group (EPDS 9 points). A total of 390 postnatal women, 20 years or older, who have given birth within 10 weeks and have regular internet-access will be recruited at two hospitals. Participants will be randomly assigned to either treatment, with treatment as usual (TAU) or through intervention groups. The TAU group receives 12 weekly iBA sessions with online assignments and feedback from trained therapists. Co-primary outcomes are maternal depressive symptoms (EPDS) and psychological aggression toward children (Conflict Tactic Scale 1) at the 24-week follow-up survey. Secondary outcomes include maternal depressive symptoms, parental stress, bonding relationship, quality of life, maternal health care use, and paediatric outcomes such as physical development, preventive care attendance, and health care use. The study will also investigate the implementation outcomes of the program. DISCUSSION: The study investigates the effectiveness of the iBA program for maternal depressive symptoms and psychological aggression toward children, as well as implementation outcomes, in a randomized-controlled trial.

Acute infections should be diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based tests, but serology tests can demonstrate previous exposure to the virus. METHODS: We compared the performance of the Diazyme, Roche, and Abbott SARS-CoV-2 serology assays using 179 negative participants to determine negative percentage agreement (NPA) and in 60 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed positive patients to determine positive percentage agreement (PPA) at 3 different time frames following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result. RESULTS: At &#8805;15 days, the PPA (95% CI) was 100 (86.3-100)% for the Diazyme IgM/IgG panel, 96.0 (79.7-99.9)% for the Roche total Ig assay, and 100 (86.3-100)% for the Abbott IgG assay. The NPA (95% CI) was 98.3 (95.2-99.7)% for the Diazyme IgM/IgG panel, 99.4 (96.9-100)% for the Roche total Ig assay, and 98.9 (96.0-99.9)% for the Abbott IgG assay.

Because neuroendocrine mechanisms may mediate these effects, we measured the effect of FR on the messenger ribonucleicacids (mRNAs) encoding all of the tropic hormones of the anterior pituitary (AP). Slot blot and solution hybridization were conducted on AP ribonucleicacid (RNA) samples obtained at 0500 h (AM) and 1500 h (PM) from 3-month-old male Fischer 344 rats fed ad libitum (AL) or FR (60% of AL calories) since 6 weeks of age. Poly A RNA/g total RNA was similar in AL and FR rats, indicating that there was no overall effect of FR on mRNA levels. The level of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA was not reduced by FR when expressed per fig of RNA or as total AP content. By contrast, the total AP content of the mRNAs encoding LH, FSH TSH, GH, and PRL was markedly reduced by FR. When expressed per fig of RNA, however, only GH (AM and PM), FSH (AM), TSHbeta; (PM), and PRL (PM) were reduced by FR.

The intent of this study is to identify and quantify the factors affecting injury severity outcomes for single-vehicle truck crashes on rural curved segments in North Carolina. The crash data were extracted from the Highway Safety Information System (HSIS) from 2010 to 2017. METHOD: This study applied a mixed logit with heterogeneity in means and variances approach to model driver injury severity. The approach accounts for possible unobserved heterogeneity in the data resulting from driver, roadway, vehicle, traffic characteristics and/or environmental conditions. Results' Conclusion: The model results indicate that there is a complex interaction of driver characteristics such as demographics (male and female drivers, age below 30 years, and age between 50 to 65 years), driver physical condition (normal driving condition and sleepy while driving), driver actions (unsafe speed, overcorrection, and careless driving), restraint usage (lap-shoulder belt usage and unbelted), roadway and traffic characteristics (undivided road, medium right shoulder width, graded surface, low and medium speed limit, low traffic volume), environmental conditions (rainy condition), vehicle characteristics (tractor-trailer and semi-trailer), and crashes characteristics (fixed object crashes and rollover crashes). In addition, this study compared the contributing factor leading to driver injury severity for curved and straight rural segments. Practical Applications: The results clearly indicate the importance of driving behavior, such as, exceeding the speed limit and careless driving along the high-speed curved segments, need to be prioritized for the trucking agency.

INTRODUCTION: Cystic fibrosis (CF) often leads to a double-lung transplant, making patients highly vulnerable to viral infections For instance, the H1N1 influenza pandemic affected many people, with those who incurred it suffering significant morbidity A recent study published in the Journal of Cystic Fibrosis has shown 40 confirmed cases of CF patients with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide up to April 2020 This is a unique case of a cystic fibrosis patient with ARDS with SARS-CoV-2 that required mechanical ventilation CASE PRESENTATION: A 23-year-old Caucasian male with double-lung transplant due to cystic fibrosis, complicated by pancreatic insufficiency presented with acute dyspnea, cough, and fever He was immunosuppressed due to tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and chronic prednisone use His mycophenolate was held in the setting of presumed sepsis however his tacrolimus and prednisone were continued given the risk of rejection Subsequently, his respiratory status rapidly declined prompting admission to the Intensive Care Unit for mechanical ventilation Computed tomography of the chest endorsed worsening acute respiratory distress syndrome-like feature requiring high positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] settings Labs revealed elevated d-dimer, CRP, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and clinical features consistent with cytokine storm Recent literature suggested a possible role of tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 antibody He received 400mg of Tocilizumab, following which the patient drastically improved ICU care was challenging because of potential pharmacologic variance and adynamic ileus in the setting of cystic fibrosis with sedation and paralytics Patient was liberated after 5 days of mechanical ventilation Interestingly, he remained SARS-COV-2 positive post discharge for several weeks afterward DISCUSSION: This critically ill immunosuppressed patient, unusually, exhibited rapid recovery From the 40 patients in the study from Journal of Cystic Fibrosis, there was no mortality reported and only one patient reported to require mechanical ventilation associated with SARS-CoV-2 Factors that may have influenced this patient's recovery and lower mortality is the prompt use of Tocilizumab and his young age Tocilizumab is currently an experimental medication, noted to inhibit further clinical deterioration CONCLUSIONS: Fortunately, this case did not have long term consequences, however, that may not be the norm Many CF patients have double lung transplants and the long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 amongst CF patients is not known More research may be warranted for

Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic arose as a new challenge. We here attempt to delineate their relationship with each other from our perspective. Global greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels have exponentially increased since 1950. The main contributors to such greenhouse gas emissions are manufacturing and construction, transport, residential, commercial, agriculture, and land use change and forestry, combined with an increasing global population growth from 1 billion in 1800 to 7.8 billion in 2020 along with rising obesity rates since the 1980s. The current Covid-19 pandemic has caused some decline in greenhouse gas emissions by limiting mobility globally via repetitive lockdowns. Following multiple lockdowns, there was further increase in obesity in wealthier populations, malnutrition from hunger in poor populations and death from severe infection with Covid-19 and its virus variants. There is a bidirectional relationship between adiposity and global warming. With rising atmospheric air temperatures, people typically will have less adaptive thermogenesis and become less physically active, while they are producing a higher carbon footprint. To reduce obesity rates, one should be willing to learn more about the environmental impact, how to minimize consumption of energy generating carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, and to reduce food waste. Diets lower in meat such as a Mediterranean diet, have been estimated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 72%, land use by 58%, and energy consumption by 52%.","output":"Climate Change and Obesity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Corona crisis has initiated a structural change: The work organization has shifted towards home office Online retail has seen high growth rates Other economic sectors that can make greater use of digitization and also exploit this potential also benefited However, German companies are not world leaders in digitization It is therefore necessary to create the prerequisites for a comprehensive digital operational transformation - also by improving broadband access It depends on whether jobs can be relocated from metropolitan areas to larger areas In mechanical engineering, the corona crisis revealed weaknesses in the global value creation system and showed that concentrating on individual suppliers in the supply chains leads to problems","output":"Strukturwandel durch die Corona-Krise: Digitalisierung, Homeoffice und Online-Handel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: This retrospective study aims to quantify the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on trauma and orthopaedic surgery at a Major Trauma Centre (MTC) in the United Kingdom. We hypothesise that the social restrictions placed on the public by the government will reduce the amount of trauma presentations and operations performed. METHODS: A database of all trauma patients at the MTC was retrospectively reviewed from start of social restrictions on 16 March 2020, to 22nd April 2020 inclusive. Referrals to the orthopaedic team were identified and included; these were sub-classified into major trauma patients, fragility hip fractures and paediatric trauma. All patients undergoing surgical intervention were identified. The outcome measures were the total number of referrals and trauma operations performed in the time period. This was compared with the corresponding dates of the 2019. RESULTS: There was an overall decrease in the number of referrals to the orthopaedic team from 537 in 2019 to 265 in 2020 (50.7% reduction). The number of trauma operations carried out at the trust decreased from 227 in 2019 to 129 in 2020 (43.2% reduction). The number of paediatric referrals decreased from 56 in 2019 to 26 in 2020 (53.6% reduction), and the number of major trauma patients reduced from 147 in 2019 to 95 in 2020 (35.4%). Fragility hip fracture referrals remained similar, with 52 in 2019 compared to 49 in 2020. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect of the provision of trauma and orthopaedic surgery. We report a significant decrease in all orthopaedic referrals during the pandemic, leading to a greatly reduced number of trauma operations performed. This has allowed for reallocation of staff and resources. We must plan for the lifting of social restrictions, which may lead to an increase in patients presenting with trauma requiring operative intervention.","output":"Where did all the trauma go?

No published data are available on the indirect effects of COVID-19 on high-risk medical specialties. Otorhinolaryngology is considered as one such specialty. Hence, we designed a national survey to address these issues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A google questionnaire was sent to all the otorhinolaryngologists in Czech Republic with the help of the Czech Society of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery to evaluate the problems they encountered during the first wave of COVID-19. Personal, professional and financial losses were also addressed. Online access to the survey was from 15th April 2020 to 26th April 2020. RESULTS: The psychosomatic indirect impact of the disease affected female doctors than males. Burnout syndrome was the most commonly reported problem. Around 44.75% of all doctors had a combination of health, financial and economic as well as professional development and educational issues. Doctors from private practices faced higher financial losses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that personal, professional and financial disturbances amongst doctors can lead to more serious consequences. With the lack of drastic measures in improving the support system for healthcare workers, the healthcare systems will fail quickly.

However, some face-to-face contact remained necessary and practices needed to ensure such contact could continue safely.AimTo examine how practices determined when face-to-face contact was necessary and how face-to-face consultations were reconfigured to reduce COVID-19 infection risk. Design and SettingQualitative interview study in general practices in Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire.MethodLongitudinal semi-structured interviews with clinical and managerial practice staff at four timepoints between May and July 2020.ResultsPractices worked flexibly within general national guidance to determine when face-to-face contact with patients was necessary, influenced by knowledge of the patient, experience, and practice resilience. For example, practices prioritised patients according to clinical need using face-to-face contact to resolve clinician uncertainty or provide adequate reassurance to patients. To make face-to-face contact as safe as possible and keep patients separated, practices introduced a heterogeneous range of measures that exploited features of their indoor and outdoor spaces and altered their appointment processes. As national restrictions eased in June and July, the number and proportion of patients seen face-to-face generally increased. However, the reconfiguration of buildings and processes reduced the available capacity and put increased pressure on practices.ConclusionPractices responded rapidly and creatively to the initial lockdown restrictions. The variety of ways practices organised face-to-face contact to minimise infection highlights the need for flexibility in guidance.","output":"Maintaining face-to-face contact during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal qualitative investigation in UK primary care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a respiratory-centered systemic disorder caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Therefore, we reasoned that CD48 could be deregulated in COVID-19 as well. Here we analyzed CD48 expression in autoptic sections and peripheral blood leukocytes and sera of COVID-19 patients by gene expression profiling (HTG? autoimmune panel), immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and ELISA. Lung tissue of COVID-19 patients showed increased CD48 mRNA expression and infiltration of CD48+ lymphocytes. In the peripheral blood, mCD48 was considerably increased on all evaluated cells, and additionally, sCD48 levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients independently of disease severity.

We have modeled viral dynamics by simulating various cellular systems and artificial conditions, including macromolecular crowding, based on experimental and transcriptomic data to infer parameters associated with viral growth and predict cell susceptibility. We have accomplished this based on the type, number and level of expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane serine 2 (TMPRSS2), basigin2 (CD147), FURIN protease, neuropilin 1 (NRP1) or other less studied candidate receptors such as heat shock protein A5 (HSPA5) and angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AGTR2). In parallel, we studied the effect of simulated artificial environments on the accessibility to said proposed receptors. In addition, viral kinetic behavior dependent on the degree of cellular susceptibility was predicted. The latter was observed to be more influenced by the type of proteins and expression level, than by the number of potential proteins associated with the SARS CoV-2 infection. We predict a greater theoretical propensity to susceptibility in cell lines such as NTERA-2, SCLC-21H, HepG2 and Vero6, and a lower theoretical propensity in lines such as CaLu3, RT4, HEK293, A549 and U-251MG. An important relationship was observed between expression levels, protein diffusivity, and thermodynamically favorable interactions between host proteins and the viral spike, suggesting potential sites of early infection other than the lungs.

For tackling Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), researchers from around the world are swiftly working on designing and identifying inhibitors against all possible viral key protein targets. One of the attractive drug targets is guanine-N7 methyltransferase which plays the main role in capping the 5-ends of viral genomic RNA and sub genomic RNAs, to escape the hosts innate immunity. We performed homology modeling and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, in order to understand the molecular architecture of Guanosine-P3-Adenosine-5,5-Triphosphate (G3A) binding with C-terminal N7-MTase domain of nsp14 from SARS-CoV-2. The residue Asn388 is highly conserved in present both in N7-MTase from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and displays a unique function in G3A binding. For an in-depth understanding of these substrate specificities, we tried to screen and identify inhibitors from the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) database. The combination of several computational approaches, including screening, MM/GBSA, MD simulations, and PCA calculations, provides the screened compounds that readily interact with the G3A binding site of homology modeled N7-MTase domain. Compounds from this screening will have strong potency towards inhibiting the substrate-binding and efficiently hinder the viral 5-end RNA capping mechanism.

Comparison of three strategies to achieve venodilation (tourniquet, electrical stimulation, or a combined strategy) on increase in venous size. METHODS: A total of 54 volunteers participated in this cross-over observational study with healthy adults, measuring venous cross-sectional area and diameter at six different sites of the upper extremity. Measurements are performed with ultrasound after performing any dilation strategy, and compared with its non-dilated venous size. An increased cross-sectional area of 25 square millimetres was denoted as clinical relevant, which was detected with paired t testing, Wilcoxon signed rank testing or with ANOVA testing. RESULTS: The cephalic vein is the greatest at all sites (t=12.43, df=39, P<0.001 for the crosssectional area), unless the largest increase in venous size was obtained in the basilic veins (t=12.11, df=39, P<0.001 for the cross-sectional area).

Evidence from animal and human studies suggests that vagus nerve stimulation can lead to reduced levels of various biomarkers of inflammation. We conducted a prospective randomized controlled study (SAVIOR-I) to assess the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) for the treatment of respiratory symptoms and inflammatory markers among patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04368156). METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 allocation to receive either the standard of care (SoC) alone or nVNS therapy plus the SoC. The nVNS group received 2 consecutive 2-min doses of nVNS 3 times daily as prophylaxis. Efficacy and safety were evaluated via the incidence of specific clinical events, inflammatory biomarker levels, and the occurrence of adverse events. RESULTS: Of the 110 participants who were enrolled and randomly assigned, 97 (nVNS, n = 47; SoC, n = 50) had sufficient available data and comprised the evaluable population. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels decreased from baseline to a significantly greater degree in the nVNS group than in the SoC group at day 5 and overall (i.e., all postbaseline data points collected through day 5, combined). Procalcitonin level also showed significantly greater decreases from baseline to day 5 in the nVNS group than in the SoC group. D-dimer levels were decreased from baseline for the nVNS group and increased from baseline for the SoC group at day 5 and overall, although the difference between the treatment groups did not reach statistical significance. No significant treatment differences were seen for clinical respiratory outcomes or any of the other biochemical markers evaluated. No serious nVNS-related adverse events occurred during the study. CONCLUSIONS: nVNS therapy led to significant reductions in levels of inflammatory markers, specifically CRP and procalcitonin. Because nVNS has multiple mechanisms of action that may be relevant to COVID-19, additional research into its potential use earlier in the course of COVID-19 and its potential to mitigate some of the symptoms associated with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 is warranted.","output":"Non-invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulation for COVID-19: Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial (SAVIOR I)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Whitening toothpastes exert a whitening effect on teeth through higher surface cleaning effectiveness resulting from the abrasive properties of the paste or specific chemical components.

Methods: Criteria for including studies in the review were done based on population, intervention, comparison, outcomes and study and studies were identified from electronic databases. Covidence? was used for data screening and data extraction. The CONSORT tool was used for checking relevant content and methodology used in each of the papers reviewed. Systematic review was done followed by meta-analysis, using Review Manager. Results: A total of 125 articles were obtained on key word search. After duplicate removal and title screening, 17 articles were eligible for full text review. Finally, 7 studies were included for systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on 4 studies. The forest plot for surface roughness showed that that the meta-analytic effect was statistically significant with surface roughness value being higher in the intervention group. The forest plot for microhardness showed that the meta-analytic effect was statistically significant with the microhardness value being lesser in the intervention group. Conclusions: Although whitening toothpastes typically can lighten tooth color by about one or two shades, there is some evidence to show that these toothpastes also affect the mineral content of teeth by increasing surface roughness and reducing microhardness. More evidence and further research are needed to identify the type of whitening agent which will whiten the tooth effectively while maintaining the integrity of the tooth structure.","output":"Effect of whitening toothpaste on surface roughness and microhardness of human teeth: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Diverse coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortalities have been reported but focused on identifying susceptible patients at risk of more severe disease or death. This study aims to investigate the mortality variations of COVID-19 from different hospital settings during different pandemic phases. METHODS: We retrospectively included adult (18 years) patients who visited emergency departments (ED) of five hospitals in the state of Texas and who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between MarchCNovember 2020. The included hospitals were dichotomized into urban and suburban based on their geographic location. The primary outcome was mortality that occurred either during hospital admission or within 30 days after the index ED visit. We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate the associations between independent variables and outcome. Generalized additive models were employed to explore the mortality variation during different pandemic phases. RESULTS: A total of 1,788 adult patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were included in the study. The median patient age was 54.6 years, and 897 (50%) patients were male. Urban hospitals saw approximately 59.5% of the total patients. A total of 197 patients died after the index ED visit. The analysis indicated visits to the urban hospitals (odds ratio [OR] 2.14, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41, 3.23), from March to April (OR 2.04, 95% CI, 1.08, 3.86), and from August to November (OR 2.15, 95% CI, 1.37, 3.38) were positively associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Visits to the urban hospitals were associated with a higher risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19 when compared to visits to the suburban hospitals. The mortality risk rebounded and showed significant difference between urban and suburban hospitals since August 2020. Optimal allocation of medical resources may be necessary to bridge this gap in the foreseeable future.","output":"Mortality Variations of COVID-19 from Different Hospital Settings During Different Pandemic Phases: A Multicenter Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An indirect porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) anti-immunoglobulin (Ig) G ELISA based on the S1 portion of the spike protein was validated and compared with an indirect immunofluorescence assay.

Omicron variant, as an emerging mutation recently in South Africa, spreaded fastly to other countries worldwide. However, the gene charicterstic of Omicron and the effect on epitopes are still unclear. In this study, we retrieved 800 SARS-CoV-2 full-length sequences from GISAID database on 14 December 2021 (Alpha 110, Beta 101, Gamma 108, Delta 110, Omicron 107, Lambda 98, Mu 101, GH/490R 65). Overall, 1320 amino acid (AA) sites were mutated in these 800 SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Covariant network analysis showed that the covariant network of Omicron variant was significantly different from other variants. Further, 218 of the 1320 AA sites were occurred in the S gene, including 78 high-frequency mutations (>90%). Notably, we identified 25 unique AA mutations in Omicron, which may affect the transmission and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we analyzed the effect of Omicron on epitope peptide. As expected, 64.1% mutations (25/39) of Omicron variants were in epitopes, which was significantly higher than in other variants. These mutations may cause a poor response to vaccines to Omicron variants. In conclusion, Omicron variants, as an emerging mutation, should be alerted for us due that it may lead to poor vaccine response, and more data is needed to evaluate the virulence and vaccines responses to this variants.","output":"Spike mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron: more likely to occur in the epitopes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSES Single-incision laparoscopic surgery improves the cosmetic outcome after surgery. We herein report six cases of successful single-incision laparoscopic (SILS) herniorrhaphy. METHODS Six patients, five with unilateral inguinal hernias and one with bilateral inguinal hernias, underwent SILS herniorrhaphy. A Covidien SILS port was inserted via an umbilical incision, through which three trocars of 5, 5 and 12 mm (or 5 mm) were inserted. The peritoneum was then opened with flexible scissors and electrocoagulation, after which, the preperitoneal space was dissected. A mesh was then fixed, and the peritoneum was finally closed using Covidien SILS Stitch or AbsorbaTack. RESULTS The mean length of the operation for the unilateral cases was 136 min. The increased time was due to difficulties unrelated to this methodology. However, the length of the operation in the bilateral case was 94 min. All patients were discharged without complications. CONCLUSIONS SILS herniorrhaphy requires experience and more time than conventional three-port herniorrhaphy. However, if the length of the operation can be shortened, then this novel surgical technique is considered to be feasible and it is expected to improve the cosmetic outcome without any additional risk.","output":"Single-incision laparoscopic herniorrhaphy for inguinal hernia repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has overwhelmed Healthcare Systems requiring the rapid development of treatments, at least, to reduce COVID-19 severity.

The study aimed to develop point of care technology for assessing the systolic and diastolic cardiac functions in animal model of systemic inflammation. Ultrasound and ventricular pressure were continuously recorded in Langendorff perfused isolated adult rat hearts. A computer controlled system controlled the ventricle loading conditions. The preload of both ventricles swung in a sinusoidal manner between target values of 2 and 22 mmHg. Collagenase (MMP8) was added to the Krebs-Henseleit solution following baseline recordings, to emulate the release of MMPs from activated leukocytes and macrophages. Collagenase perfusion led to gradual decline in peak systolic pressure and decrease in the end-diastolic volume (EDV), that were associated with concentric myocardial wall thickening. Extracellular matrix degradation by collagenases caused sever diastolic dysfunction with overt shift of the end-diastolic volume toward lower volumes, without significant changes in the epicardial diameter.

Little is known, however, about the impact of the reporting of suspected protestor suicide deaths during social unrest, particularly in an age of social media. In June 2019, the most substantial social unrest in Hong Kong since its handover in 1997 was triggered by the proposed Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill (Anti-ELAB). The social unrest subsided when Hong Kong and many parts of the world were hit by Covid-19 and very strict quarantine measures were imposed on crowd gatherings in Hong Kong at the end of January 2020. A number of reported suicides and deaths of undetermined cause took place during this 8-month period that received considerable attention. To better understand the possible effects of these highly publicized deaths, we examined media reports of suspected suicide cases before, during and after the protest period, as well as topics of suicide-related threads and their replies in social media forums. We found no clear evidence of increased rates of suicide as a result of these incidents, or during the protest period; however, it is suggested that certain narratives and attention surrounding the suspected suicides and undetermined deaths may have contributed to collective emotions such as sadness and anxiety.

Airway inflammation, cytokine expression, mucus production, and airway reactivity was assessed in wild-type, IL-17A, or IL-23p19-deficient, and in NK cell-depleted mice. Local application of poly(inosinic-cytidylic) acid exacerbated experimental allergic asthma in mice as characterized by enhanced release of proinflammatory cytokines, aggravated airway inflammation, and increased mucus production together with pronounced airway hyperresponsiveness. This was further associated with augmented production of IL-17 by Th17 cells and NK cells. Whereas experimental exacerbation could be induced in IL-23p19-deficient mice lacking mature, proinflammatory Th17 cells, this was not possible in mice lacking IL-17A or in NK cell-depleted animals.

In the present study an experimental methodology was adopted to test the potential of advanced remote sensing techniques such as multispectral Sentinel-2, PRISMA hyperspectral satellite, and UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) remotely-sensed data for the multitemporal mapping of burned areas by soilCvegetation recovery analysis in two test sites in Portugal and Italy. In case study one, innovative multiplatform data classification was performed with the correlation between Sentinel-2 RBR (relativized burn ratio) fire severity classes and the scene hyperspectral signature, performed with a pixel-by-pixel comparison leading to a converging classification. In the adopted methodology, RBR burned area analysis and vegetation recovery was tested for accordance with biophysical vegetation parameters (LAI, fCover, and fAPAR). In case study two, a UAV-sensed NDVI index was adopted for high-resolution mapping data collection. At a large scale, the Sentinel-2 RBR index proved to be efficient for burned area analysis, from both fire severity and vegetation recovery phenomena perspectives. Despite the elapsed time between the event and the acquisition, PRISMA hyperspectral converging classification based on Sentinel-2 was able to detect and discriminate different spectral signatures corresponding to different fire severity classes. At a slope scale, the UAV platform proved to be an effective tool for mapping and characterizing the burned area, giving clear advantage with respect to filed GPS mapping. Results highlighted that UAV platforms, if equipped with a hyperspectral sensor and used in a synergistic approach with PRISMA, would create a useful tool for satellite acquired data scene classification, allowing for the acquisition of a ground truth.","output":"Multitemporal Mapping of Post-Fire Land Cover Using Multiplatform PRISMA Hyperspectral and Sentinel-UAV Multispectral Data: Insights from Case Studies in Portugal and Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is one of the most concerning health problems around the globe.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the indication of CPM, it's evolution and the surgical techniques used for this type of surgery. Materials and methods: This prospective study enrolled patients with unilateral breast cancer for which conservative treatment was not an option and underwent CPM concomitant with therapeutic mastectomy, using different techniques, followed by immediate breast reconstruction using alloplastic materials. Results: A total of 45 patients with unilateral breast cancer underwent therapeutic mastectomy and CPM followed by immediate breast reconstruction, between January 2015-December 2020. The mean age was 43.5 years, 64,44% patients had stage I and II breast cancer and 22,22% were triplenegative. The indications for CPM were: pathogenic mutation of BRCA or of other genes associated with high risk of breast cancer, strong family history, suspicious findings on breast MRI, extended micro-calcifications, dense breasts, and extreme anxiety. Conclusions: A growing rate of bilateral mastectomy for unilateral breast cancer was observed. Availability of immediate breast reconstruction and reimbursement plays an important role for patients in choosing CPM. Factors associated with CPM include: young age, pathogenic BRCA mutation, significant family history and triple-negative disease. The rate of immediate postoperative complications was low.

These lockdowns resulted in large cuts of atmospheric pollutant emissions, notably related to the vehicular traffic source, especially during spring 2020. As a result, air quality changed in manners that are still currently under investigation. The robust quantitative assessment of the impact of lockdown measures on ambient concentrations is however hindered by weather variability. In order to circumvent this difficulty, an innovative methodology has been developed. The Analog Application for Air Quality (A3Q) method is based on the comparison of each day of lockdown to a group of analog days having similar meteorological conditions. The A3Q method has been successfully evaluated and applied to a comprehensive in situ dataset of primary and secondary pollutants obtained at the SIRTA observatory, a suburban background site of the megacity of Paris (France). The overall slight decrease of submicron particulate matter (PM1) concentrations (-14 %) compared to business-as-usual conditions conceals contrasting behaviors. Primary traffic tracers (NOx and traffic-related carbonaceous aerosols) dropped by 42 %C66 % during the lockdown period. Further, the A3Q method enabled us to characterize changes triggered by NOx decreases. Particulate nitrate and secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), two of the main springtime aerosol components in northwestern Europe, decreased by -45 % and -25 %, respectively. A NOx relationship emphasizes the interest of NOx mitigation policies at the regional (i.e., city) scale, although long-range pollution advection sporadically overcompensated for regional decreases. Variations of the oxidation state of SOA suggest discrepancies in SOA formation processes. At the same time, the expected ozone increase (+20 %) underlines the negative feedback of NO titration.

Others noted negative impacts including less structure and accountability, less information to inform clinical decision-making, challenges in establishing a connection, technological challenges, and shorter visits. Conclusions In the context of the pandemic, buprenorphine prescribers quickly transitioned to providing telemedicine visits in high volume; nonetheless, there are still many unknowns, including the quality and safety of widespread use of telemedicine for OUD treatment.","output":"Treatment of opioid use disorder during COVID-19: Experiences of clinicians transitioning to telemedicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Entity Matching is an essential part of all real-world systems that take in structured and unstructured data coming from different sources.

Georgia announced a state-wide shelter-in-place on April 2 and partially lifted restrictions on April 27. We estimated the time-varying reproduction numbers (Rt) of COVID-19 in Georgia, Metro Atlanta, and Dougherty County and environs from March 2, 2020, to November 20, 2020. METHODS: We analyzed the daily incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Georgia, Metro Atlanta, and Dougherty County and its surrounding counties, and estimated Rt using the R package EpiEstim. We used a 9-day correction for the date of report to analyze the data by assumed date of infection. RESULTS: The median Rt estimate in Georgia dropped from between 2 and 4 in mid-March to < 2 in late March to around 1 from mid-April to November. Regarding Metro Atlanta, Rt fluctuated above 1.5 in March and around 1 since April. In Dougherty County, the median Rt declined from around 2 in late March to 0.32 on April 26. Then, Rt fluctuated around 1 in May through November. Counties surrounding Dougherty County registered an increase in Rt estimates days after a superspreading event occurred in the area. CONCLUSIONS: In Spring 2020, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 transmission in Georgia declined likely because of social distancing measures. However, because restrictions were relaxed in late April and elections were conducted in November, community transmission continued, with Rt fluctuating around 1 across Georgia, Metro Atlanta, and Dougherty County as of November 2020. The superspreading event in Dougherty County affected surrounding areas, indicating the possibility of local transmission in neighboring counties.","output":"Time-varying Reproduction Numbers of COVID-19 in Georgia, USA, March 2, 2020 to November 20, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the face of the sudden outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (coronavirusdisease-19, COVID-19), the research and development of new antiviral drugs requires a certain amount of time and cost, and it is urgent to find safe and effective antiviral drugs that can be used clinically.

Photon-multiplier luminescent solar concentrators (PM-LSCs) contain chromophores which exceed 100\\\\% photoluminescence quantum efficiency. PM-LSCs have recently been experimentally demonstrated and hold promise to outcompete traditional LSCs. However, we find that the thermodynamic limits of PM-LSCs are different and are sometimes more extreme relative to traditional LSCs. As might be expected, to achieve very high concentration factors a PM-LSC design must also include a free energy change, analogous to the Stokes shift in traditional LSCs. Notably, unlike LSCs, the maximum concentration ratio of a PM-LSC is dependent on brightness of the incident photon field. For some brightnesses, but equivalent energy loss, the PM-LSC has a greater maximum concentration factor than that of the traditional LSC. We find that the thermodynamic requirements to achieve highly concentrating PM-LSCs differ from traditional LSCs.

This study takes advantage of newly collected rich spatio-temporal mouse data to develop a data-driven mathematical model of breast tumors that considers cells location and key interactions in the tumor. The results show that cancer cells have a minor presence in the area with the most overall immune cells, and the number of activated immune cells in the tumor is depleted over time when there is no influx of immune cells. Interestingly, in the case of the influx of immune cells, the highest concentrations of both T cells and cancer cells are in the boundary of the tumor, as we use the Robin boundary condition to model the influx of immune cells. In other words, the influx of immune cells causes a dominant outward advection for cancer cells. We also investigate the effect of cells diffusion and immune cells influx rates in the dynamics of cells in the tumor micro-environment. Sensitivity analyses indicate that cancer cells and adipocytes diffusion rates are the most sensitive parameters, followed by influx and diffusion rates of cytotoxic T cells, implying that targeting them is a possible treatment strategy for breast cancer.","output":"A PDE Model of Breast Tumor Progression in MMTV-PyMT Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The STriTuVaD project, funded by Horizon 2020, aims to test through a Phase IIb clinical trial one of the most advanced therapeutic vaccines against tuberculosis.

Traffic noise exposure was measured using the L(den) metric in both continuous and categorical forms. A cross-sectional study was performed and information about sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors was collected. Noise level < 60 dB(A) representing the quiet areas was used as the reference group. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to estimate the odds for self-reported coronary artery disease concerning road traffic noise after adjusting for confounding variables. The residents living in noisy areas were found to have a 2.25 times higher risk per 5 dB(A) increment in the noise levels (95% CI = 1.38 to 3.67).

Multivariable logistic regression analysis performed on age-matched samples of both cohorts to determine associations between frailty and symptoms of COVID-19 including delirium, fever and cough. Results Hospital cohort: there was a significantly higher prevalence of delirium amongst the frail sample, with no difference in fever or cough. Of those presenting with delirium, 10/53 (18.9%) presented with delirium as the only documented symptom. Community-based cohort: there was a significantly higher prevalence of probable delirium in the frail sample, and also of fatigue and shortness of breath. Of those reporting probable delirium, 28/84 (33%) did not report fever or cough. Conclusions This study demonstrates a higher prevalence of delirium as a presenting symptom of COVID-19 infection in older adults with frailty compared to their age-matched non-frail counterparts. Clinicians should suspect COVID-19 in frail older adults presenting with delirium. Early detection facilitates infection control measures to mitigate against catastrophic spread and preventable hospitalisations and deaths amongst this population.

Traditional definitions have assigned many negative connotations surrounding the term of authoritarian. We realize that it might not be considered value-neutral in other countries. But authoritarian in the Chinese context emphasizes more on centralized decision making, collectivism, coordinating all activities of the nation, and public support, which is considered a value-neutral term. Therefore, it is adopted in this paper. We would like to clarify this. Authoritarian governance is considered an important mechanism for developing China's economy and solving social problems. The COVID-19 crisis is no exception. Most of the current research on crisis management and government crises focuses on advanced, democratic countries. However, the consequences of crisis management by authoritarian governments have not been fully appreciated. Although prior research has addressed authoritarian initiatives to manage crises in China, authoritarian interventions have rarely been theorized in public health emergencies. Methods: Based on a literature review and theoretical analysis, we use a descriptive and qualitative approach to assess public health policies and mechanisms from an authoritarian perspective in China. In light of the key events and intervention measures of China's government in response to COVID-19, the strategic practices of the Communist Party of China (CPC) to construct, embody, or set political goals through authoritarian intervention in public health crisis management are discussed. Results: China's government responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with a comprehensive authoritarian intervention, notably by establishing a top-down leadership mechanism, implementing a resolute lockdown, rapidly establishing square cabin hospitals, enhancing cooperation between different government departments, mobilizing a wide range of volunteer resources, enforcing the use of health codes, imposing mandatory quarantine on those returning from abroad, and implementing city-wide nucleic acid testing. These measures ensured that China was able to contain the outbreak quickly and reflect on the unique role of the Chinese authoritarian system in responding to public health crises. Conclusions: Our paper contributes to expanding the existing understanding of the relationship between crisis management and authoritarian system. China's response to COVID-19 exemplifies the unique strengths of authoritarian institutions in public health crisis management, which is a helpful and practical tool to further enhance the CPC's political legitimacy. As a socialist model of crisis management with Chinese characteristics, it may offer desirable experiences and lessons for other countries still ravaged by the epidemic.","output":"China's Public Health Policies in Response to COVID-19: From an Authoritarian Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The antiviral activities of ribavirin (1--D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide; virazole), either alone or in combination with recombinant human leukocyte (alpha) interferon (rHuIFN-), were evaluated against feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) in feline kidney-cell cultures. The 50% inhibitory dose (ID(50)) of ribavirin for uninfected, rapidly dividing cells was 17 g ml(?1) whereas the ID(50) for FIPV was 2.5 g ml(?1). The therapeutic index (TI) of ribavirin (i.e. the ratio of the minimum cell-toxic dose to minimum virus-inhibitory dose) was 6.8. Although a dose-dependent inhibition of viral infectivity occurred at non-toxic doses, maximum antiviral effects (?4 log(10) reduction in FIPV) occurred at cytotoxic doses. When low or moderate doses of ribavirin were combined with either 10 or 100 U of rHuIFN- ml(?1), the resulting antiviral effects were significantly greater than the sum of the observed effects from either ribavirin or rHuIFN- alone. Significant synergistic interactions with rHuIFN- occurred at ribavirin doses of 1, 5, 12.5 and 25 g ml(?1). Synergistic combinations of rHuIFN- and ribavirin produced up to an 80-fold or a 200-fold relative increase in FIPV antiviral activities compared with that produced by equivalent doses, respectively, or ribavirin or rHuIFN- alone. In cell growth studies, the addition of either 10 or 100 U of rHuIFN- ml(?1) to test doses of ribavirin did not increase the anticellular effect observed with ribavirin alone; seemingly, the potentiation of ribavirin antiviral activity by rHuIFN- was independent of any additive cytotoxic effects.

WMLs were graded on baseline noncontrast computed tomography using a visual grading scale. The primary outcome was the score on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included early neurological recovery, successful reperfusion (extended Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b), futile recanalization (modified Rankin Scale score 3 despite successful reperfusion), and occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. We used multivariable logistic regression models to assess associations between WML severity and outcomes, taking the absence of WML on noncontrast computed tomography as the reference category.

Favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0C2) was achieved in 838 patients (49%) without WML, 192 patients (34%) with mild WML, and 130 patients (24%) with moderate-to-severe WML. Increasing WML grades were associated with a shift toward poorer functional outcome in a dose-dependent manner (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.13C1.60] for mild WML and 1.67 [95% CI, 1.39C2.01] for moderate-to-severe WML; P(trend), <0.001).

Methods In March 2020, the United Kingdom Primary Immunodeficiency Network (UKPIN) established a registry of cases to collate the outcomes of individuals with PID and SID following SARS-CoV-2 infection and treatment. Anonymised demographic data, pre-SARS-CoV-2 infection lymphocyte counts, co-morbidities, targeted treatments and outcomes were collected. Three groups were analysed in further detail: individuals with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), individuals with any PID, including CVID, receiving immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT) and individuals with secondary immunodeficiency. Results A total of 310 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with PID or SID have now been reported in the UK. The overall mortality within the cohort was 17.7% (n = 55/310). Individuals with CVID demonstrated an infection fatality rate (IFR) of 18.3% (n = 17/93), individuals with PID receiving IgRT had an IFR of 16.3% (n = 26/159) and individuals with SID, an IFR of 27.2% (n = 25/92). Individuals with PID and SID, had higher inpatient mortality and died at a younger age than the general population. Increasing age, low pre-SARS-CoV-2 infection lymphocyte count and the presence of common co-morbidities increased the risk of mortality in PID. Access to specific COVID-19 treatments in this cohort was limited: only 22.9% (n = 33/144) of patients admitted to hospital received dexamethasone, remdesivir, an anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based therapeutic (e.g. REGN-COV2 or convalescent plasma) or tocilizumab as a monotherapy or in combination. Dexamethasone, remdesivir and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based therapeutics appeared efficacious in PID and SID. Conclusion Compared to the general population, individuals with PID or SID are at high risk of mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Increasing age, low baseline lymphocyte count and the presence of co-morbidities are additional risk factors for poor outcome in this cohort.","output":"Outcomes Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Patients With Primary and Secondary Immunodeficiency in The United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, research into internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) has suggested that therapist-guided digital interventions have greater engagement, adherence, and effectiveness than self-directed digital therapies. While research has focused on the effectiveness of, and adherence to, these interventions, less attention has been paid to their implementation in practice and what aspects of the therapist role support success. An understanding of the key factors related to the therapist role and intervention delivery is required if these iCBTs are to be applied in routine clinical care and outcomes optimized. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is greater emphasis on allowing patients access to remote therapies. We report the experiences and reflections of 4 therapists and their 2 supervisors in delivering an online, therapist-supported intervention in a randomized controlled trial for children and young people with tic disorders (the Online Remote Behavioural Intervention for Tics [ORBIT] trial). Themes discussed include the importance of training, supervision, creating support documents/manuals, and record keeping. Alongside this are communication strategies used by therapists to encourage patient adherence and treatment effectiveness. These include rapport building, treatment personalization, and suggestions for overcoming non-engagement. These reflections offer important considerations for the delivery of iCBTs as well as implications associated with the implementation of these interventions in existing services and future research studies. We share thoughts on where iCBTs may sit in a stepped care model, how services may deal with comorbid conditions, and the potential role of iCBTs in collecting clinical data.","output":"Therapist-Supported Online Interventions for Children and Young People With Tic Disorders: Lessons Learned From a Randomized Controlled Trial and Considerations for Future Practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study sought to evaluate the candidacy of plasma osteopontin (OPN) as a biomarker of COVID-19 severity and multisystem inflammatory condition in children (MIS-C) in children. A retrospective analysis of 26 children (0-21 years of age) admitted to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta with a diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 17 and May 26, 2020 was undertaken. The patients were classified into three categories based on COVID-19 severity levels: asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic (control population, admitted for other non-COVID-19 conditions), mild/moderate, and severe COVID-19. A fourth category of children met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's case definition for MIS-C. Residual blood samples were analyzed for OPN, a marker of inflammation using commercial ELISA kits (R&D), and results were correlated with clinical data. This study demonstrates that OPN levels are significantly elevated in children hospitalized with moderate and severe COVID-19 and MIS-C compared to OPN levels in mild/asymptomatic children. Further, OPN differentiated among clinical levels of severity in COVID-19, while other inflammatory markers including maximum erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and ferritin, minimum lymphocyte and platelet counts, soluble interleukin-2R, and interleukin-6 did not. We conclude OPN is a potential biomarker of COVID-19 severity and MIS-C in children that may have future clinical utility.

METHODS: An 11-person panel comprising intensive care practitioners rated the appropriateness of ARDS management options at different times during hospital admission, in the presence or absence of, or varying severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection on a scale of 1-9 (where 1-3 is inappropriate, 4-6 is uncertain and 7-9 is appropriate). A summary of the anonymised results was discussed at an online meeting moderated by an expert in RAND methodology. The modified online survey comprising 76 questions, subdivided into investigations (16), non-invasive respiratory support (18), basic intensive care unit management of ARDS (20), management of refractory hypoxaemia (8), pharmacotherapy (7) and anticoagulation (7), was completed again. RESULTS: Disagreement between experts was significant only when addressing the appropriateness of diagnostic bronchoscopy in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Adherence to existing published guidelines for the management of ARDS for relevant evidence-based interventions was recommended. Responses of the experts to the final survey suggested that the supportive management of ARDS should be the same, regardless of a COVID-19 diagnosis. For patients with ARDS with COVID-19, the panel recommended routine treatment with corticosteroids and a lower threshold for full anticoagulation based on a high index of suspicion for venous thromboembolic disease.

METHODS: We conducted an observational analysis from April to May 2020 and included both countries and US states with known stay-at-home orders. Our primary exposure was the time between the date of the first reported case of COVID-19 to an implemented stay-at-home mandate for each region. Our primary outcomes were the time from the first reported case to the highest number of daily cases and daily deaths. We conducted linear regression analyses, controlling for the case rate of the outbreak in each respective region. RESULTS: For countries and US states, a longer period of time between the first reported case and stay-at-home mandates was associated with a longer time to reach both the peak daily case and death counts. The largest effect was among regions classified as the latest 10% to implement a mandate, which in the US, predicted an extra 35.3 days (95% CI: 18.2, 52.5) to the peak number of cases, and 38.3 days (95% CI: 23.6, 53.0) to the peak number of deaths.

Although there have only been rare reports of reverse zoonosis events associated with the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic from SARS-CoV-2 so far, comparison with the pH1N1 influenza pandemic can provide a better understanding of the possible consequences of such events for public and animal health.

Specific risk factors include sufficient interaction between infected humans and recipient animals, suitability of the animal host factors for productive virus infection, and suitability of the animal host population for viral persistence. Of particular concern is virus spread to susceptible animal species, in which group housing and contact network structure could potentially result in an alternative virus reservoir, from which reintroduction into humans can take place. Virus exposure in high-density populations could allow sustained transmission in susceptible animal species. Identification of the risk factors and serological surveillance in SARS-CoV-2-susceptible animal species that are group-housed should help reduce the threat from reverse zoonosis of COVID-19.","output":"Reverse Zoonosis of COVID-19: Lessons From the 2009 Influenza Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, an untreatable hereditary polyneuropathy, may mimic chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), a treatable neuropathy. OBJECTIVE In this retrospective study, we analyzed the characteristics of CMT patients misdiagnosed as CIDP in 16 University Hospitals from 3 countries, compared these patients with a reference group of CIDP patients, and estimated the cost of misdiagnosis. RESULTS Amongst 1104 CIDP cases, we identified 35 CMT patients misdiagnosed as CIDP (3.2%). All were initially diagnosed with definite or probable CIDP (EFNS/PNS criteria), and mutations in the PMP22, MPZ and 10 other CMT genes were found in 34%, 31% and 35% of cases respectively. In comparison with a reference group of 35 CIDP patients, CMT patients were younger (median age at disease-onset: 39 vs 56 years), and more frequently had motor weakness at disease onset (80% vs 29%), hearing loss (14% vs 0%), normal brachial plexus imaging (70% vs 40%), lower cerebrospinal fluid protein content (median: 0.5 vs 0.8 g/L), and lower treatment response (20% vs 69%).

It is also necessary to also consider posttreatment resource consumption in regards to complications and repeat procedures. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The ideal ureteric stone treatment during a pandemic such as COVID\\\\19 would involve minimum resource consumption and a minimum number of patient attendances. We compared all patients initially treated with SWL to those initially treated with URS for acute ureteral colic within the state of Victoria, Australia in 2017. RESULTS: A total of 2724 ureteric stones were analyzed, a cumulative 3\\\\month exposure and burden on the healthcare system was calculated for each patient by their initial procedure type. The readmission rate for URS was significantly higher than for SWL, 0.92 readmissions/patient for URS versus 0.54 readmissions/patient for SWL (P < .001). The cumulative hospital stay per patient for these two procedures was 2.35 days for SWL versus 3.21 days for URS (P < .001). The number of procedures per patient was 1.52 for SWL versus 1.89 for URS (P = .0213). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ureteric stones treated initially by SWL have shorter length of stay with fewer overall attendances and procedures at 3 months than those treated with URS. During a pandemic such as COVID\\\\19, SWL may have benefits in preserving hospital resources and limiting opportunity for virus transmission, compared to URS.","output":"What is the best way to manage ureteric calculi in the time of COVID\\\\19?

Preparations were made to face the spread of COVID-19, as predicting the most probable risk areas by using spatial models. Prediction spatial models of COVID-19 risk areas can help the governmental authorities to generate sustainable strategies and set up suitable protocols to control the pandemic. This research presents an attempt of a potential spatial prediction modeling of COVID-19 risk areas in Cairo governorate-Egypt. Four indicator models (demographic, residential, environmental and topographic) were developed using geomatics technology based on the guidelines of the UN-habitat sustainable development goals (SDGs) target (11 & 3). Five predicted scenarios were generated for the most pandemic probability areas by the integration of the four indicator models. The results showed that there are common areas in all scenarios for highly COVID-19 pandemic risk areas. These common risk areas were found in (El Marag, El Salam, Ain Shams, El Mataria, El Gammaleya, Manshiat Nasser, El Mosky , Bolak , Hadaak El Koba, and El Sharbeya) districts. The hotspots zones are characterized by overcrowding, high population density and economic activities, large family size, poor infrastructure service and low rate of education. Moreover, it was noticed that crowding points resulted in traffic density and air pollution, which may affect the pandemic spread. The accuracy assessment results displayed that, the environmental predicted scenario was more consistent with the official data of the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population) MOHP), while the residential one was less convenient. The result of this study supports the health sector by predicting the hot spots areas. The present study is aimed to develop a proactive plan to confront the pandemic before spreading in the Cairo governorate-Egypt.

The study addresses a call for an application of big data and text mining in different fields of research, as well as proposes more objective research methods in studies on food consumption. There is a growing interest in understanding consumer choices for foods which are caused by the predominant contribution of the food industry to climate change. So far, customer attitudes towards organic food have been studied mostly with self-reported methods, such as questionnaires and interviews, which have many limitations. Therefore, in the present study, we used big data and text mining techniques as more objective methods to analyze the public attitude about organic foods. A total of 43,724 Twitter posts were extracted with streaming Application Programming Interface (API). Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was applied for topic modeling. A test of topic significance was performed to evaluate the quality of the topics. Public sentiment was analyzed based on the NRC emotion lexicon by utilizing Syuzhet package. Topic modeling results showed that people discuss on variety of themes related to organic foods such as plant-based diet, saving the planet, organic farming and standardization, authenticity, and food delivery, etc. Sentiment analysis results suggest that people view organic foods positively, though there are also people who are skeptical about the claims that organic foods are natural and free from chemicals and pesticides. The study contributes to the field of consumer behavior by implementing research methods grounded in text mining and big data.

Several species of pathogenic bacteria secrete IgA1 proteases at mucosal sites of infection to destroy the structure and function of human IgA1 thereby eliminating an important aspect of host defence. IgA1 proteases are known as autotransporter proteins as their gene structure encodes the information to direct their own secretion out of the bacterial cell. The iga gene structure is also thought to contribute to the antigenic heterogeneity demonstrated by the IgA1 proteases during infections and the cleavage specificity of the IgA1 proteases for human IgA1. The IgA1 proteases have therefore been implicated as important virulence factors that contribute to bacterial infection and colonisation.

Body-surface gastric mapping (BSGM) is a non-invasive method for the detection of gastric electrophysiological biomarkers including slow wave direction, which have correlated with symptoms in patients with gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia. However, no studies have validated the relationship between gastric slow waves and body surface activation profiles. This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the relationship between gastric slow waves and body-surface recordings. High-resolution electrode arrays were placed to simultaneously capture slow waves from the gastric serosa (326 electrodes at 4 mm resolution) and abdominal surface (88 at 20 mm inter-electrode spacing) in a porcine model. BSGM signals were extracted based on a combination of wavelet and phase information analyses. A total of 1185 individual cycles of slow waves assessed, out of which 897 (76%) were normal antegrade waves, occurring in 10/14 (71%) subjects studied. BSGM accurately detected the underlying slow wave in terms of frequency (r = 0.99, p = 0.43) as well as the direction of propagation (p = 0.41, F-measure: 0.92). In addition, the cycle-by-cycle match between BSGM and transitions of gastric slow waves in terms either or both temporal and spatial abnormalities was demonstrated.

As new infections have decreased in many PEPFAR-supported countries, PEPFAR is increasingly focusing on understanding and decreasing mortality among PLHIV, specifically by addressing advanced HIV disease (AHD) and its attendant opportunistic infections (OIs). Several developments in identifying AHD, in preventing, diagnosing, and treating selected OIs, and in PEPFARs support for mortality surveillance make this an opportune moment for PEPFAR to address HIV-related mortality. DISCUSSION: AHD upon diagnosis or re-engagement in HIV care is not uncommon, and it substantially increases risk of death from OIs. The World Health Organization provides evidence-based guidelines for a package of interventions for preventing, diagnosing, and treating common OIs, including tuberculosis (TB), cryptococcal meningitis, and severe bacterial infections. PEPFAR facilitates implementation of these guidelines. To identify PLHIV with low CD4, PEPFAR plans to support expanded access to CD4 testing, including a point-of-care assay that differentiates CD4 cell count as a binary of greater than or less than 200 cells/L. To prevent AHD-related mortality, PEPFAR supports rapid ART initiation with integrase inhibitorCbased regimens and implementation and documentation of TB preventive treatment. To diagnose selected OIs, PEPFAR is implementing urine lateral flow lipoarabinomannan use to identify TB among PLHIV who have a CD4 cell count < 200 cells/L. To treat selected OIs, PEPFAR has focused on improving patient-centered care in TB/HIV co-infection services and scaling up implementation of new drug regimens for cryptococcal meningitis. To better understand mortality, PEPFAR has introduced an indicator, TX_ML, to routinely and systematically categorize outcomes, including deaths, among PLHIV on ART. CONCLUSIONS: PEPFAR is increasing its efforts to identify AHD; to prevent, diagnose, and treat OIs; and to track mortality in its programs. These ongoing efforts, done in collaboration with other stakeholders, seek to decrease mortality among PLHIV.","output":"Addressing advanced HIV disease and mortality in global HIV programming"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine mobile technology as being a key apparatus and interface for collaborative innovation, which allows organisations to develop their information ecology Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative research was performed by in-depth interviews, observations and field notes The eight main interviews are supported by an interdisciplinary narrative literature review of knowledge management and associated fields Findings: This study validates the following propositions: mobile technology can offer users timely information, mobile technology can foster collaboration beyond physical and organisational boundaries, in general, mobile technology enables a wider amount of interactions between people Thereby, this paper draws some implications about the knowledge management of creative (and non-creative) workers Research limitations/implications: The collected data sheds light on how organisations and individuals positioned themselves about mobile technology co-creative practices before the COVID era Therefore, it shall be pertinent to further investigate these findings through a quantitative approach to better ascertain path models and to strengthen the new results with another qualitative perspective, in the post-COVID era Practical implications: The study highlights how mobile devices are facilitating collaborative innovation practices by improving management decisions, enabling new business and/or operating models, developing a flow of ideas inner/outer an organisation and fostering the ability to make innovation Social implications: Mobile technology transforms the way to work (knowledge creation and/or conversion) and it changes the relations between collaborators in a working environment (beyond physical boundaries) This study deciphers how a creative and/or decision-making person can change their work schedule and/or routines based on the use of mobile devices Originality/value: The added value of this transdisciplinary study is that it improves research on collaborative innovation and collective knowledge by revealing three pertinent characteristics of mobile technology: enabling quick decision;connecting with a glocal network and fostering collective creativity It also creates a bridge between the fields of education and business ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Being mobile: a call for collaborative innovation practices?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Emotional distress is a major impact of COVID-19 among not only the general public but also healthcare workers including medical students.

Methods: A cross-sectional design was utilized to collect data early on during the outbreak in Jordan. All medical students in Jordan were eligible to complete an online questionnaire assessing self-reported emotional reactions to COVID-19 that covered four main domains: negative emotion (anxiety, worry, depression, panic, loneliness, and nervousness), positive emotion (happiness, joy, and excitement), sleep disorders (insomnia, shallow sleep, nightmares, and insufficient sleep), and aggression (verbal argument and physical fighting). The frequency of social media utilization as a main source of COVID-19 information was also assessed. Results: 59.9% of participants were females, 64.9% were enrolled at the two major medical schools in Jordan, and 59.6% were in the pre-clinical stage (years). A significant proportion of participants self-reported increased negative emotional levels of anxiety (49.2%), worry (72.4%), depression (23.1%), panic (22.6%), and nervousness (38.2%) and decreased positive emotional levels of happiness (44.8%), joy (47.3%), and feelings of excitement (45.1%).

The objective of the study was to assess the influence of random leaks occurring either during inspiration or expiration. METHODS Analysis of the volume-targeted pressure support mode in 6 commercial ventilators with single-limb circuits and intentional leak in a bench study (restrictive model). Unintentional leaks were introduced through a mechanical system during inspiration (threshold valve with 2 levels of leaks) or during expiration (active valve). Results of delivered tidal volume (VT) and pressure support were externally recorded. A pre-set VT of 550 mL was programmed, with a wide range of pressure support values. RESULTS All the ventilators showed a deviation of delivered versus programmed VT below 10% in the period without unintentional leaks. In the model with unintentional inspiratory leaks, a progressive drop in delivered VT and pressure support was observed for all ventilators. The reduction in the delivered VT for the highest inspiratory leak ranged between 21 and 40%, corresponding to a decrease in pressure support between 3.09 and 10.15 cm H2O after 5 min. Conversely, in the expiratory model, increases in delivered VT and pressure support were observed, ranging between 16 and 33% and between 2.7 and 6.5 cm H2O, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The introduction of random leaks influences the performance of commercial ventilators with single-limb circuits and intentional leak.

THE RESEARCH PROBLEM AND METHODS: The main problem is to determine how to effectively respond to changes in the functioning of local government units in terms of satisfying citizens' needs. The research methodology is based on two techniques: a review of the literature on the subject and the analysis of the results of surveys conducted among local government officials. THE PROCESS OF ARGUMENTATION: consists of two essential elements. The first characterizes the essence and purpose of the development of e-administration and specifies the legal conditions. The second part focuses on the results of own research on the pandemic effects for the development of eadministration in local governments. RESEARCH RESULTS: The analysis shows that despite the growing digital competences this area is not a priority within the framework of public policies. As the study shows, most of the surveyed officials declare to not have a strategy for implementing public e-services, and the changes are incidental. The most important barriers include complex regulations and high costs of their implementation as well as their usefulness for citizens. CONCLUSIONS, INNOVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Further implementation of e-administration requires both: the simplification of the regulations and a strategic plan ensuring the integration of various systems and their interoperability.

This article summarizes the evidence on standards for personal protective equipment for personnel in the central emergency admission department and in the operations area as well as restructuring measures for the procedures in the operations area in a COVID-plus area. METHOD: A systematic literature search was carried out. RESULTS: The grey area of unknown infected and potential transmitters of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 is high. Patients with an unclear infection status or who are highly suspected of having an infection should be classified as infectious until the contrary can be proven. The protection of personnel in healthcare professions against infections is of particular importance. The supply of adequate personal protective equipment in a risk-stratified form can substantially influence the success of combating the pandemic. Most operations must be assessed as aerosol-forming procedures and necessitate the maximum protection of personnel working directly on the patient. Particular attention should be paid to obligatory hygiene regulatory measures for protection against contamination during the reorganization in the operations area and on the transport routes between the wards. CONCLUSION: The correct personal protective equipment considering the occupational safety helps to sustainably protect personnel from infections. Reorganizational measures in the operating room are urgently indicated for potential aerosol-forming procedures in infected patients or patients with an unclear infection status.

Currently the COVID-19 health pandemic and the resulting economic and labour market consequences are having a major impact on people's lives and livelihoods. Unfortunately, impoverished families and their children are often the first to suffer, which may push many more vulnerable children into child labour situations. Child labour in India is more prevalent than in many other countries, with approximately 10 million children actively engaged in, or seeking, work. This paper focuses on the issue of child labour, its causes and its ill effects. Further, it also reviews the international legal framework relating to child labour and legislative issues in India. There is clearly an urgent need for this issue to be effectively addressed and resolved.","output":"Prevalence and potential consequences of child labour in India and the possible impact of COVID-19 - a contemporary overview."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 epidemic has triggered unmatched impairment to businesses globally.

Our analysis examines the increase in unemployment due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic among people with and without severe disabilities in Germany. METHODS: Monthly cross-sectional data on unemployment for 2019 and 2020 were provided by the Federal Employment Agency. We used a difference-in-differences model to estimate the increase in unemployment attributable to the pandemic. The months April to December 2020 represented the months of exposure to the pandemic. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) are reported. RESULTS: The increase in unemployment among people with severe disabilities due to the pandemic is 11.2% (IRR 1.112; 95% CI 1.107 to 1.117). People with severe disabilities receiving unemployment benefits due to unemployment lasting less than a year (Social Code III: short-term unemployment) and women have been most affected. Among people without severe disabilities, unemployment has increased by 24.8% due to the pandemic (IRR 1.248; 95% CI 1.246 to 1.249), while people receiving unemployment benefits according to social code III and men have been most affected. Both groups show a varying increase in unemployment depending on the region of residency. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show a particularly significant increase in unemployment among people without severe disabilities. People with severe disabilities might be less impacted due to the special legal protection against their dismissal.

Tocilizumab and Anakinra were included in the local protocol as an optional treatment in critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by SARS-CoV2 infection. This cohort study evaluated the effects of therapy with cytokine blocking agents on in-hospital mortality in COVID19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation and admitted to intensive care unit. Methods The association between therapy with Tocilizumab or Anakinra and in-hospital mortality was assessed in consecutive adult COVID19 patients admitted to our ICU with moderate to severe ARDS. The association was evaluated by comparing patients who receive to those who did not receive Tocilizumab or Anakinra and by using different multivariable Cox models adjusted for variables related to poor outcome, for the propensity to be treated with Tocilizumab or Anakinra and after patient matching. Results Sixty-six patients who received immunotherapy (49 Tocilizumab, 17 Anakinra) and 28 patients who did not receive immunotherapy were included. The in-hospital crude mortality was 30,3% in treated patients and 50% in non-treated (OR 0,77, 95% CI 0,56-1,05, p=0,069). The adjusted Cox model showed an association between therapy with immunotherapy and in-hospital mortality (HR 0,35, 95% CI 0,16-0,77, p=0,009). This protective effect was further confirmed in the analysis adjusted for propensity score, in the propensity-matched cohort and in the cohort of patients with invasive mechanical ventilation within 2 hours after ICU admission. Conclusions Although important limitations, our study showed that cytokine-blocking agents seem to be safe and to improve survival in COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU with ARDS and the need of mechanical ventilation.","output":"Effects of Cytokine Blocking Agents on Hospital Mortality in Patients Admitted to ICU With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome by SARS-CoV2 Infection: An Observational Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The current target oxygen saturation range for patients with COVID-19 recommended by the National Institutes of Health is 92C96%. MAIN BODY: This article critically examines the evidence guiding current target oxygen saturation recommendation for COVID-19 patients, and raises important concerns in the extrapolation of data from the two studies stated to be guiding the recommendation. Next, it examines the influence of hypoxia on upregulation of ACE2 (target receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry) expression, with supporting transcriptomic analysis of a publicly available gene expression profile dataset of human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells cultured in normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Finally, it discusses potential implications of specific clinical observations and considerations in COVID-19 patients on target oxygen saturation, such as diffuse systemic endothelitis and microthrombi playing an important pathogenic role in the wide range of systemic manifestations, exacerbation of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in the setting of pulmonary vascular endothelitis/microthrombi, the phenomenon of silent hypoxemia with some patients presenting to the hospital with severe hypoxemia disproportional to symptoms, and overburdened health systems and public health resources in many parts of the world with adverse implications on outpatient monitoring and early institution of oxygen supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: The above factors and analyses, put together, call for an urgent exploration and re-evaluation of target oxygen saturation in COVID-19 patients, both in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Until data from such trials become available, where possible, it may be prudent to target an oxygen saturation at least at the upper end of the recommended 92C96% range in COVID-19 patients both in the inpatient and outpatient settings (in patients that are normoxemic at pre-COVID baseline).

Malawi has committed to achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030, the timeframe set out by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As in other low income countries, scarce resources stand in the way of more equitable health access and quality in Malawi. Its health sector is highly dependent on donor contributions, and recent poor governance of government-funded healthcare saw donors withdraw funding, limiting services and resources. The 2017 National Health Plan II and accompanying Health Strategic Plan II identify the importance of improved governance and strategies to achieve more effective cooperation with stakeholders. This study explores health sector stakeholders perceptions of the challenges to improving governance in Malawis national health system within the post-2017 context of government attempts to articulate a way forward. METHODS: A qualitative study design was used. Interviews were conducted with 22 representatives of major international and faith-based non-government organisations, civil society organisations, local government and government-funded organisations, and governance bodies operating in Malawi. Open questions were asked about experiences and perceptions of the functioning of the health system and healthcare decision-making. Content relating to healthcare governance was identified in the transcripts and field notes and analysed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: Stakeholders view governance challenges as a significant barrier to achieving a more effective and equitable health system. Three categories were identified: accountability (enforceability; answerability; stakeholder-led initiatives); health resource management (healthcare financing; drug supply); influence in decision-making (unequal power; stakeholder engagement). CONCLUSIONS: Health sector stakeholders see serious political, structural, and financial challenges to improving governance in the national health system in Malawi which will impact the governments goal of achieving UHC by 2030. Stakeholders identify the need for improved oversight, implementation, service delivery and social accountability of government-funded service providers to communities. Eighteen months after the introduction of the policy documents, they see little evidence of improved governance and have little or no confidence in the governments ability to deliver UHC. The difficulties stakeholders perceive in relation to building equitable and effective healthcare governance in Malawi have relevance for other resource-limited countries which have also committed to the goal of UHC.

Using an approximation to the SIR model and incorporating spatiotemporal dependence, the proposed model estimates a direct and indirect (spillover) effect of intervention. Under an interference and treatment ignorability assumption, this model is able to estimate causal intervention effects, and additionally allows for spatial interference between locations.

Methods: : In this retrospective cohort study, 1030 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were recruited in two hospitals of Wuhan, China. We collected baseline data on demographics, SOFA parameters, and VTE risk assessment models (RAMs) including Padua Prediction Score (PPS), IMPROVE and Caprini RAM.

Because of weaker health-care systems, existing comorbidities burden (HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, and non-communicable conditions), and poor socioeconomic determinants, initial predictive models had forecast a disastrous impact of COVID-19 in Africa in terms of transmission, severity, and deaths. Nonetheless, current epidemiological data seem not to have matched expectations, showing lower SARS-CoV-2 infection and fatality rates compared to Europe, the Americas and Asia.

In infectious diseases, corticosteroids have been regarded as a thread due to their immunosuppressive effects and therefore their anti-inflammatory properties. MAIN: In recent years, there have been several studies published that aimed to determine the role of corticosteroids in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), because, despite significant advances in new antibiotics and supportive care, deaths of patients with CAP remain unacceptably high. While the 2007 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) CAP guidelines did not mention the use of corticosteroids in the management of CAP, the recently published 2019 IDSA/ATS guidelines recommended their use in patients with septic shock refractory to vasopressors and fluid resuscitation. Regarding viral infection, the use of corticosteroids in patients with influenza has shown to be associated with significantly higher mortality and higher incidence of nosocomial infection, while in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) there is a good body of evidence of the benefit of corticosteroids in terms of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The use of corticosteroids has been considered as a potential alternative co-adjuvant treatment in patients with pneumonia.

The specific modalities that could improve exercise tolerance in these patients remain to be established. OBJECTIVE To investigate exercise endurance and associated physiological responses with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) during exercise in restrictive CRF patients. METHODS Eighteen patients (63+/-11 years, total lung capacity (TLC)=59+/-16% of predicted value) performed maximal exercise in spontaneous breathing conditions (MWLE) and during two constant workload exercise (CWLE) tests at 75% Pmax, with or without NIV in random order. \\"NIV Responders\\" were defined by an increase in CWLE duration of more than 50% when using NIV. RESULTS For the whole group, CWLE duration when using NIV increased from 5.6+/-4.6 to 9.6+/-8.1 min. Increase in CWLE duration correlated with reduction in heart rate and oxygen desaturation, and dyspnea relief during exercise. NIV responders (n=9) showed more severe lung restriction (TLC: 2.6+/-0.7 versus 3.5+/-1.1L; forced vital capacity: 1.0+/-0.16 versus 1.46+/-0.38 L). At the end of MWLE, responders had a lower Vt (0.60+/-0.09 versus 0.89+/-0.34 L), a higher dead-space ratio (0.51+/-0.06 versus 0.38+/-0.12) and lower oxygen pulse (4.5+/-1.2 versus 7.4+/-3.9 ml/beat).

The commonly observed chicken astrovirus (CAstV) was recently reported to be responsible for the white chicks syndrome associated with an increased embryo/chick mortality. CAstV-mediated pathogenesis in chickens occurs due to complex interactions between the infectious pathogen and the immune system. Many aspects of CAstVCchicken interactions remain unclear, and there is no information available regarding possible changes in gene expression in the chicken spleen in response to CAstV infection. We aim to investigate changes in gene expression triggered by CAstV infection. Ten 21-day-old SPF White Leghorn chickens were divided into two groups of five birds each. One group was inoculated with CAstV, and the other used as the negative control. At 4 days post infection, spleen samples were collected and immediately frozen at ?70 C for RNA isolation. We analyzed the isolated RNA, using RNA-seq to generate transcriptional profiles of the chickens spleens and identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The RNA-seq findings were verified by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). A total of 31,959 genes was identified in response to CAstV infection. Eventually, 45 DEGs (p-value < 0.05; log(2) fold change > 1) were recognized in the spleen after CAstV infection (26 upregulated DEGs and 19 downregulated DEGs). qRT-PCR performed on four genes (IFIT5, OASL, RASD1, and DDX60) confirmed the RNA-seq results. The most differentially expressed genes encode putative IFN-induced CAstV restriction factors. Most DEGs were associated with the RIG-I-like signaling pathway or more generally with an innate antiviral response (upregulated: BLEC3, CMPK2, IFIT5, OASL, DDX60, and IFI6; downregulated: SPIK5, SELENOP, HSPA2, TMEM158, RASD1, and YWHAB). The study provides a global analysis of host transcriptional changes that occur during CAstV infection in vivo and proves that, in the spleen, CAstV infection in chickens predominantly affects the cell cycle and immune signaling.","output":"Transcriptome Sequencing of the Spleen Reveals Antiviral Response Genes in Chickens Infected with CAstV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We combine mobile locations, weather data, and COVID-19 confirmed cases in a transformed two-way fixed effects mediation model to estimate the causal impact of weather on the COVID-19 infection rate in the United States, disentangling its direct impact from the indirect effect via the endogenous response of social activity. We show that, while temperature has a negative impact on viral infectiousness, it also increases the amount of time individuals spend out of home, which instead favours the spread of the virus. This second channel substantially attenuates the beneficial effect of temperature in curbing the spread of the virus, offsetting half of the potential seasonal fluctuations in the reproduction rate. The mediation role of social activity is particularly relevant when viral incidence is low, while it becomes negligible when the epidemiological situation is more serious. Wind speed and precipitation, despite being significant predictors of social activity, do not induce sufficient variation to affect infections. Estimates are robust to an alternative definition of social activity based on the number of visits to indoor venues. This suggests that our results are not driven by individuals spending less time indoors on warmer days, leaving a biological effect of temperature on the virus as the most probable mechanism.

We measured participants ability to identify whether information was scientifically valid or invalid. Analysis of participants search style reveals that both monetary incentives and pop-up increased the use of fact-checking strategies. Monetary incentives were overall effective in increasing accuracy, whereas the pop-up worked when the source of information was unknown.

Ribosome remodeling, induced upon relatively moderate depletion of zinc, involves replacement of multiple ribosomal proteins containing the zinc-binding CXXC motif (called C+ r proteins) by their motif-free C? paralogs. Severe zinc depletion induces binding of mycobacterial protein Y (Mpy) to the 70S C? ribosome, thereby stabilizing the ribosome in an inactive state that is also resistant to kanamycin and streptomycin. Because the Mpy binding region on the ribosome is proximal to the binding pocket of spectinamides (Spa), the preclinical drug candidates for tuberculosis, we addressed the impact of remodeling and hibernation of ribosomes on Spa sensitivity. We report here that while Mpy binding has no significant effect on Spa sensitivity to the ribosome, replacement of S14(C+) with its C? counterpart reduces the binding affinity of the drug by 2-fold, causing increased Spa tolerance in Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis cells harboring the C? ribosome. The altered interaction between Spa and ribosomes likely results from new contact points for D67 and R83 residues of S14(C?) with U1138 and C1184 of 16S rRNA helix 34, respectively.

Individuals who value individualism were more likely to respond positively to individual-centered messages, but those who believe more in communitarianism value were less likely. CONCLUSION: Results showed that individuals are motivated selectively to respond to certain claims that cohere with their worldview and therefore respond differently to vaccine benefit frames.

Data on children with COVID-19, including demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, imaging and laboratory results, therapies, and clinical outcomes, were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 96 children admitted with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, 63.8% were aged  3 years, 52.1% were male, 56.2% had an unknown source of infection, and 51% had no comorbidities. Most cases had severe infection (71.88%) as they required oxygen, 10.42% of whom were critical. The most common symptoms were respiratory-related (98%), and the common physical sign was fever (49%).

Our analysis offers new insights into the ways in which practitioners pivoted their services to respond remotely to women experiencing violence and the challenges of effectively undertaking safety planning and risk assessment without face-to-face contact. The second half of this article examines the implications of remote service delivery on practitioner mental health and well-being. The findings have global relevance and reveal the critical need to prioritize well-being supports for DFV practitioners in crisis response plans.","output":"Responding to women experiencing domestic and family violence during the COVID-19 pandemic: Exploring experiences and impacts of remote service delivery in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 needs to efficiently make use of the resources from hosts in order to survive and propagate. Among the multiple layers of regulatory network, mRNA translation is the rate-limiting step in gene expression. Synonymous codon usage usually conforms with tRNA concentration to allow fast decoding during translation. It is acknowledged that SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to the codon usage of human lungs so that the virus could rapidly proliferate in the lung environment. While this notion seems to nicely explain the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to lungs, it is unable to tell why other viruses do not have this advantage. In this study, we retrieve the GTEx RNA-seq data for 30 tissues (belonging to over 17 000 individuals). We calculate the RSCU (relative synonymous codon usage) weighted by gene expression in each human sample, and investigate the correlation of RSCU between the human tissues and SARS-CoV-2 or RaTG13 (the closest coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2). Lung has the highest correlation of RSCU to SARS-CoV-2 among all tissues, suggesting that the lung environment is generally suitable for SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, for most tissues, SARS-CoV-2 has higher correlations with the human samples compared with the RaTG13-human correlation. This difference is most significant for lungs. In conclusion, the codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to human lungs to allow fast decoding and translation. This adaptation probably took place after SARS-CoV-2 split from RaTG13 because RaTG13 is less perfectly correlated with human. This finding depicts the trajectory of adaptive evolution from ancestral sequence to SARS-CoV-2, and also well explains why SARS-CoV-2 rather than other viruses could perfectly adapt to human lung environment.","output":"Compelling Evidence Suggesting the Codon Usage of SARS-CoV-2 Adapts to Human After the Split From RaTG13"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The study was designed to explore epidemiological characteristics, determinants of COVID-19 infection development and mortality of patients presenting with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) to a tertiary care health facility of Bihar METHODS: This was an observational record-based study, longitudinal in design Data of 281 SARI patients who have attended All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, Bihar, India during 25(th) April 2020, till 12(th) July 2020 (16 weeks) were used for the study RESULTS: Out of 281 study participants, 95 (33 8%) were detected to have COVID-19 and 42 (14 9%) died Among COVID-positive study subject's death rate was 28 4% In the multivariable logistic regression analysis;increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1 02 [1 00-1 03]), gender (males) (AOR = 2 51 [1 27-4 96]), presenting symptom (cough) (AOR = 2 88 [1 46-5 70]), co-morbidity (hypothyroidism) (AOR = 4 59 [1 45-14 56]) and delay between symptom onset and admission (&gt;2 days) (AOR = 2 46 [1 19-5 07]) were significant predictors of COVID-19 infection among study participants adjusted with other co-morbidities (diabetes and hypertension) Similarly, place of residence (outside Patna district) (AOR = 2 38 [1 03-5 50]), co-morbidity (diabetes) (AOR = 3 08 [1 12-8 50]), intensive care unit (ICU) requirement at admission (yes) (AOR = 9 47 [3 98-22 52]) and COVID status (positive) (AOR = 6 33 [2 68-14 96]) were significant predictors of death among the study participants whereas place of residence (outside Patna district) (AOR = 4 04 [1 33-12 28]) and ICU requirement at admission (yes) (AOR = 7 22 [2 54-20 52]) were attributes affecting death of COVID-positive study participants CONCLUSION: Risk of COVID-19 infection among the study participants was high Age, gender and co-morbidities increased the risk of infection COVID-19 infection negatively impacted the treatment outcome of the study participants Age, co-morbidity and ICU requirement were the other attributes affecting mortality","output":"Epidemiological determinants of COVID-19 infection and mortality: A study among patients presenting with severe acute respiratory illness during the pandemic in Bihar, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Thymomas are the most common type of anterior mediastinal tumors. Calcification is sometimes observed in thymomas using computed tomography (CT), and it is more frequent in invasive thymomas than in noninvasive thymomas. However, the significance of calcification in thymomas remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the significance of calcification in thymomas on invasiveness to surrounding organs and investigate the characteristics of thymoma cases with calcification at our institution. METHODS We included thymoma patients treated at our institution between 2000 and 2016, and evaluated their characteristics, including demographics, calcification on CT, histology, Masaoka stage, and myasthenia gravis status. The patients were categorized into calcification (C) and noncalcification (NC) groups. RESULTS Among 51 included patients, 11 (21.6%) had calcification. A higher proportion of group C patients had World Health Organization histological type B2 and B3 tumors (high-risk) than type A, AB, and B1 tumors (low-risk; p = 0.0477). The number of patients with Masaoka stages III and IV were significantly higher in the C group than in the NC group (p < 0.0001). The C group patients had significantly higher rates of invasion to the mediastinal pleura, pericardium, lung, phrenic nerve, and chest wall and pleural dissemination than the NC group patients. CONCLUSIONS Calcification reflects invasiveness of tumors to surrounding organs and tissues, and may thus predict thymoma stage and histologically high-risk thymomas. Calcification in thymomas may also predict the pathological stage and help decide therapeutic methods and surgical approaches to treat thymomas based on the calcification status according to CT findings.","output":"Calcification in thymomas can predict invasiveness to surrounding organs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Voiding dysfunction (VD) leading to urinary retention is a common neurogenic lower urinary tract symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Currently, the only effective management for MS patients with VD is catheterization. Transcranial Rotating Permanent Magnet Stimulator (TRPMS) is a noninvasive, portable, multifocal neuromodulator that simultaneously modulates multiple cortical regions and the strength of their functional connections. In this pilot trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03574610), we investigated the safety and therapeutic effects of TRPMS in modulating brain regions of interest (ROI) engaged with voiding initiation to improve VD in MS women. METHODS Ten MS women with VD (having %post-void residual/bladder capacity (%PVR/BC) 40% or being in the lower 10th percentile of the Liverpool nomogram) underwent concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging/urodynamic study (fMRI/UDS) with three cycles of bladder filling/emptying, at baseline and post-treatment. Predetermined ROIs and their activations at voiding initiation were identified on patients' baseline fMRI/UDS scans, corresponding to microstimulators placement. Patients received ten consecutive 40-minute treatment sessions. Brain activation group analysis, non-instrumented uroflow, and validated questionnaires were compared at baseline and post-treatment. RESULTS No treatment-related adverse effect were reported. Post-treatment, patients showed significantly increased activation in regions known to be involved at voiding initiation in healthy subjects. %PVR/BC significantly decreased. Significant improvement of bladder emptying symptoms were reported by patients via validated questionnaires. CONCLUSION Both neuroimaging and clinical data suggested TRPMS effectively and safely modulated brain regions that are involved in the voiding phase of the micturition cycle, leading to clinical improvements in bladder emptying in MS patients.","output":"Noninvasive, Individualized Cortical Modulation Using Transcranial Rotating Permanent Magnet Stimulator for Voiding Dysfunction in Women with Multiple Sclerosis: A Pilot Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report describes a case of pituitary apoplexy with rapidly evolving hemorrhage in a 74-year-old female with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease.

Unemployment rates skyrocketed past their Great Recession highs as businesses closed their doors.18 Uber and Lyft drivers, some of whom had taken out loans to purchase vehicles, saw their ridership and income plummet.19 Within weeks of the World Health Organization declaring a pandemic,20 Congress stepped in to stabilize businesses' and households' financial situations with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\\"CARES\\") Act.21 As detailed in Part II of this Essay, the CARES Act provided households with money and enforced pauses of other debt payments such that people were seemingly able to stay current on car loan payments through the fall of 2020.22 A handful of states also legislated additional debt relief for households.23 Auto dealers and lenders likewise struggled during the pandemic, and they focused on enticing people to become or remain customers, rather than repossessing cars.24 Through these combined measures, auto loan defaults did not increase immediately. Staving Off the Bubble's Burst COVID-19's emergence ended the post-Great Recession economic expansion.26 Employment losses between March 2020 and the end of August 2020 wiped out almost all of the job growth during the prior decade and GDP plummeted over 30 percent in those five months.27 Retail spending also quickly dropped, particularly at brick-and-mortar stores and for discretionary items.28 Although spending rebounded later in the summer of 2020, the pace of its recovery was slowed by the coronavirus's continued spread.29 Employment figures bounced back a bit as well, but the chair of the Federal Reserve viewed this growth with caution and commented that \\"so many people [are] in need. Yet the second and third quarters of 2020 saw decreases in auto loan delinquencies.33 These declines coincided with decreases in delinquencies across non-mortgage consumer credit products, such as credit cards.34 In contrast, mortgage delinquencies increased, although the CARES Act's foreclosure moratorium provided homeowners the ability to defer payments.35 Consumer credit products, including auto loans, benefitted from the CARES Act's provisions designed to help households weather the economic fallout of stay-at-home orders.36 The CARES Act's extra unemployment compensation and relief rebate payments, delivered primarily in April through the end of July, aided households in paying recurring expenses and allowed them to stay current on some debts.37 Indeed, the CARES Act's payments \\"ke[pt] more than [ten] million people out of poverty\\" according to a report from the Urban Institute. 38 The CARES Act also allowed people to prioritize auto debt over other debt by pausing payments on home loans, some rent payments, and student loans.39 A handful of states legislated or decreed additional protections, such as eviction and debt collection moratoria.40 Although very few states added protections such as halts on auto repossessions,41 pausing the collection of other delinquent debts likely further allowed people to focus on remaining current with their auto loans.","output":"Bursting the Auto Loan Bubble in the Wake of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Two-port (2P) and three-port (3P) video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) are well-established surgical methods for the treatment of complicated spontaneous pneumothorax (SP).

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare postoperative pain, as well as clinical outcome, following 2P and 3P VATS for SSP in our institution. METHODS Between January 2008 and December 2020, we retrospectively analyzed the data of 115 SSP patients treated by VATS in our institution. Fifty-two patients underwent 2P-VATS, while 63 patients were treated by 3P-VATS. The total dose of analgesic use per stay (opioid and non-opioid), length of hospital stay (LOS), operation time, total area of pleurectomy, recurrence rates and postoperative complications were compared between both groups. RESULTS The 3P-VATS group had a significantly higher total dose of analgesic use compared with the 2P-VATS patients. The LOS and mean operation time were significantly shorter in the 2P-VATS group. A larger area of pleurectomy was resected using 3P-VATS compared to 2P-VATS. The postoperative complications and recurrence of SSP during a median follow-up period of 76.5 months were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION 2P-VATS is a safe surgical technique.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated triage of elective cases postponed within our department due to the Covid-19 pandemic (3/9/20-5/22/20) using QSP (American College of Surgeons MeNTS instrument), EOP (based upon a published urologic recommendations), and ISP scoring (developed and managed within our department). Lower scores represented greater urgency. MeNTS scores were compared across EOP and ISP scores. RESULTS 204 cases were evaluated. Median MeNTS score was 50 (IQR 44-55), and mean EOP and ISP scores were 2.60.6 and 2.20.8, respectively. Median MeNTS scores were 52 (46.5, 57.5), 50 (44.5, 54.5), 48 (43.5,54) for ISP priority 1, 2, and 3 cases (p=0.129) and 55 (51.5, 57), 47.5 (42, 56), and 49 (44, 54) for EOP priority scores 1, 2, and 3 (p=0.002).

RESULTS: Observational multicenter cohort study. All COVID-19 adult patients admitted to 25 ICUs belonging to the VENETO ICU network (February 28th 2020-april 4th 2021) were enrolled. Patients admitted to the ICUs before 4th March 2021 were used for model training (training set), while patients admitted after the 5th of March 2021 were used for external validation (test set 1). A further group of patients (test set 2), admitted to the ICU of IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico of Milan, was used for external validation. A SuperLearner machine learning algorithm was applied for model development, and both internal and external validation was performed. Clinical variables available for the model were (i) age, gender, sequential organ failure assessment score, Charlson Comorbidity Index score (not adjusted for age), Palliative Performance Score; (ii) need of invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, O(2) therapy, vasoactive agents, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, continuous venous-venous hemofiltration, tracheostomy, re-intubation, prone position during ICU stay; and (iii) re-admission in ICU. One thousand two hundred ninety-three (80%) patients were included in the training set, while 124 (8%) and 199 (12%) patients were included in the test set 1 and test set 2, respectively. Three different predictive models were developed. Each model included different sets of clinical variables.

Historically, upper and lower respiratory illness has been cared for at home or in the ambulatory primary care setting. It is likely that patients experiencing COVID-19-like symptoms may first contact their primary care provider. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) is a representative sample of patients from the United States that regularly assesses their use of medical care services. We analyzed 2017 MEPS data to determine the number and proportion of patients who were seen in primary care or family medicine ambulatory settings or hospitalized for upper or lower respiratory illness or pneumonia.

Periodic assessment of R can inform public health strategies during long-standing epidemics like the current Covid-19 situation. This is especially relevant for large and resource-poor countries like India, which may require differential intervention strategies in different regions. However, the complexity of the calculation involved often proves to be a barrier for calculation of R. This communication proposes a simpler data collection and analytical method C involving a combination approach instead of full-fledged primary data collection - to estimate R for public-health decision-making. Study design Review of literature. Methods Data from available sources (time series data of new cases at population level) can be combined with some primary data (time interval between infection of index and secondary cases in family clusters) that can be collected with little resources. These data can then be fed into an approximation-based method (Wallinga and Lipsitch) for R calculation at the state/regional levels. The calculations can be repeated every fortnight using newly available data. Results The value of R, estimated using the proposed method, from subsequent periods can be used for assessing the status of the epidemic and values from subsequent periods can be compared for decision-making regarding implementation/modification of control measures. Conclusions The approximate R may be a little inaccurate but can still prove useful for rough estimation of epidemic evolution and for comparison between different periods, as the extent of error in R values across different periods is likely to be similar. Thus, the approximate R may not only be utilized to estimate the epidemic change in smaller geographies such as states/regions but also used for making appropriate changes to public health measures for managing a pandemic like Covid-19.","output":"An approximation-based approach for periodic estimation of effective reproduction number: a tool for decision-making in the context of Covid-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The problem of proctoring off-campus exams is considered Under unexpected situation such as COVID-19 pandemics, for many university courses, high-stake summative exams must be conducted from student home as a result of lockdown and social distancing policies This paper addresses the issue of how to proctor off-campus exams in this unprepared situation, where a few constraints limited the choices of possible solutions A proctoring method was developed with the aim to provide a solution that can be applied as widely as possible under the constraints imposed on the situation The method is based on free software and services It makes use of only hardware and devices universally available among the target students A proctoring concept based on the use of E-Cam and S-Cam, a procedure, as well as a portable cross-platform proctor monitoring tool have been developed and described Results from applying the proposed tool and method to an actual off-campus exam has been reported and discussed Lessons learned and suggestions are provided ? 2020 ACM","output":"Affordable Proctoring Method for Ad-hoc Off-campus Exams"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (10C14 March, 2020) we conducted a survey (n = 1028) of a nationally representative sample (age, sex, and locale) in Poland. Respondents indicated how strong they thought the threat was to themselves, to Poland, and the world. They also described their emotional reactions to the pandemic, which we used to calculate three scores: Anxiety, Hopelessness, and Panic. Respondents also indicated how often they engaged in various coping behaviors and how much they supported different types of economic sacrifice. We used these responses to calculate measures that we labelled as Spread Prevention (e.g., social distancing), Self-preservation (food stockpiling), and Economic Sacrifice (e.g., fighting COVID-19 regardless of the cost). Multiple regression analyses found that perceived threat to self was the most reliable predictor (positive) of emotional reactions and of coping behaviors, and that Anxiety was the most reliable predictor (positive) of Spread prevention and Economic sacrifice. Panic predicted (positively) Self-preservation. A series of mediation analyses found that Anxiety mediated relationships between threat and coping behaviors, and that Panic mediated the relationship between perceived threats and Self-preservation. In addition, we found that scores on all measures, except Panic, increased following the announcement of the first COVID-19 related fatality in Poland, which occurred on the third (middle) day of the study.

Ketamine influences many key processes that are altered during sepsis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this study, TNF--treated mice, as well as HT-29 and L929 cell models, were applied to characterize TNF--induced systemic and local cecal tissue inflammatory responses. Behavioral, biochemical, histological, and molecular biological approaches were applied to illustrate the related processes. Mice with TNF--induced SIRS showed systemic and local cecal tissue inflammatory responses, as indicated by increased levels of high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), chemokines (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-10, as well as high mortality. Ketamine pretreatment alleviated death rates, symptoms, and the production of inflammatory cytokines induced by TNF- in mice. Moreover, ketamine also protected the mice from TNF--induced cecal damage by suppressing the phosphorylation of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIP3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). In addition, our results showed that ketamine efficiently inhibited TNF--induced necroptosis in HT-29 and L929 cells. Furthermore, we explored the mechanism using different L929 cell lines. The results displayed that ketamine inhibited TNF--induced necroptosis by enhancing RIP1 ubiquitination and reducing the RIP1-RIP3 and RIP3-MLKL interactions, as well as the formation of necrosomes. Thus, our study may provide a new theoretical and experimental basis for treating diseases characterized by SIRS-associated inflammatory factor storms.

Several studies have explored Saliva as an alternate clinical specimen for the SARS-CoV-2 and IgG detection, reporting varied degree of sensitivity of detection. This study was aimed to investigate the influence of method of saliva collection on the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection.Methods: We performed a cross sectional study where patients were screened for the COVID-19 infection. Saliva was collected by four different methods (Expectoration, drooling, gargling and by using salivary swabs). SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the paired saliva and NPS were determined by using the reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). IgG levels were assayed in the serum and saliva of the COVID-19 patients by nephelometry and ELISA resp.Findings: Out of 350 patients screened, 43 patients were included in the study which was found to be positive for COVID-19 as evidenced by RT-PCR in the NPS (positivity rate-12.2%). Expectorated saliva exhibited 78.5% sensitivity (11 out of 14 patients, median CT (saliva e gene 27.06.03 vs NPS e gene 29.5.06.18, p=NS). Drooling method showed 22.2% sensitivity (2 out 9 patients, median CT (saliva e gene 30.50.7 vs NPS e gene 30.01.5, p=NS)) whereas salivary swab method yielded 21.42% sensitivity (3 out 14 patients, median CT (saliva e gene 29.05.1vs NPS e gene 29.05.1, p=NS)). We found lowest sensitivity (16.66%) in the gargled saliva (1 out of 6 patients, median CT (saliva e gene, 247.5 vs NPS e gene 14.0, p=NS)). Furthermore, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection was reduced to 18.1% (2 out of 9 patients) and 0.0% (0 out 3 patients) in the saliva collected by salivary swab and gargling method above the CT value 25.0 (NPS). Interestingly, salivary IgG showed better concordance with viral load as compared to the serum IgG (R 2 0.23 vs 0.04, p=0.044).Interpretation: Expectorated saliva is a better specimen as compared to the drooling, gargling and salivary swabs for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Exposure of saliva to the upper and lower respiratory track may be the primary explanation to our findings. Also, salivary IgG can be a better predictor of the viral load as compared to the blood IgG.

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and the postoperative opioid-sparing effect of dexmedetomidine-based OFA in adult cardiac surgery patients. METHODS We conducted a single-centre and retrospective study including 80 patients above 18 years old who underwent on-pump cardiac surgery between November 2018 and February 2020. Patients were divided into two groups: OFA (lidocaine, ketamine, dexmedetomidine, MgSO4) or opioid-based anaesthesia (remifentanil and anti-hyperalgesic medications such as ketamine and/or MgSO4 and/or lidocaine at the discretion of the anesthesiologist). The primary endpoint was the total amount of opioid consumed in its equivalent of intravenous morphine during the first 48 postoperative hours. Secondary outcomes included perioperative hemodynamics, post-operative maximal pain at rest and during coughing and adverse outcomes. Data are expressed as median [interquartile range]. RESULTS Patients in the OFA-group had a higher EuroSCORE II, with more diabetes, more dyslipidemia and more non-elective surgery but fewer smoking history. In the OFA group, the median loading dose of dexmedetomidine was 0.6 [0.4-0.6] g.kg- 1 while the median maintenance dose was 0.11 g.kg- 1.h- 1 [0.05-0.20]. In 10 (25%) patients, dexmedetomidine was discontinued for a drop of mean arterial pressure below 55 mmHg. The median total amount of opioid consumed in its equivalent of intravenous morphine during the first 48 postoperative hours was lower in the OFA group (15.0 mg [8.5-23.5] versus 30.0 mg [17.3-44.3], p < 0.001). While no differences were seen with rest pain (2.0 [0.0-3.0] versus 0.5 [0.0-5.0], p = 0.60), the maximal pain score during coughing was lower in OFA group (3.5 [2.0-5.0] versus 5.5 [3.0-7.0], p = 0.04). In OFA group the incidence of atrial fibrillation (18% versus 40%, p = 0.03) and non-invasive ventilation use (25% versus 48%, p = 0.04) were lower. The incidence of bradycardia and the intraoperative use of norepinephrine were similar between both groups. CONCLUSION Dexmedetomidine-based OFA in cardiac surgery patients is feasible and could be associated with a lower postoperative morphine consumption and better postoperative outcomes.

Dysfunction/absence of primary cilia in PKD endothelial cells (ECs) may impair mechano-transduction of WSS and favour vascular disorders. The molecular links between primary cilia dysfunction and IAs are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS Wild-type and primary cilia-deficient Tg737orpk/orpk arterial ECs were submitted to physiological (30 dynes/cm2) or aneurysmal (2 dynes/cm2) WSS and unbiased transcriptomics were performed. Tg737orpk/orpk ECs displayed a 5-fold increase in the number of WSS-responsive genes compared to wild-type cells. Moreover, we observed a lower trans-endothelial resistance and a higher endothelial permeability, which correlated with disorganized intercellular junctions in Tg737orpk/orpk cells. We identified ZO-1 as a central regulator of primary cilia-dependent endothelial junction integrity. Finally, clinical and histological characteristics of IAs from non-PKD and PKD patients were analysed. IAs in PKD patients were more frequently located in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory than in non-PKD patients. IA domes from the MCA of PKD patients appeared thinner with less collagen and reduced endothelial ZO-1 compared with IA domes from non-PKD patients. CONCLUSION Primary cilia dampen the endothelial response to aneurysmal low WSS. In absence of primary cilia, ZO-1 expression levels are reduced, which disorganizes intercellular junctions resulting in increased endothelial permeability. This altered endothelial function may not only contribute to the severity of IA disease observed in PKD patients, but may also serve as a potential diagnostic tool to determine the vulnerability of IAs.","output":"Primary cilia control endothelial permeability by regulating expression and location of junction proteins."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In the United States, infection with SARS-CoV-2 caused 380,000 reported deaths from March to December 2020.

METHODS: From among Japanese nationals, yearly incidence data of HIV diagnoses and patients with AIDS who had not previously been diagnosed as HIV positive, from 1985 to 2017, were analyzed. Using the McKendrick partial differential equation, general convolution-like equations were derived, allowing estimation of the HIV incidence and the time-dependent rate of diagnosis. A likelihood-based approach was used to obtain parameter estimates. RESULTS: Assuming that the median incubation period was 10.0 years, the cumulative number of HIV infections was estimated to be 29,613 (95% confidence interval (CI): 29,059, 30,167) by the end of 2017, and the proportion of diagnosed HIV infections was estimated at 80.3% (95% CI [78.7%C82.0%]). Allowing the median incubation period to range from 7.5 to 12.3 years, the estimate of the proportion diagnosed can vary from 77% to 84%. DISCUSSION: The proportion of diagnosed HIV infections appears to have not yet reached 90% among Japanese nationals. Compared with the peak incidence from 2005C2008, new HIV infections have clearly been in a declining trend; however, there are still more than 1,000 new HIV infections per year in Japan.

Furthermore, the unprecedented context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic, with daily media bombardment about COVID-19 mortality, may have amplified life-threatening perception also in patients with moderate infection. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors of PTSD at 3-month follow-up in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 infection. DESIGN: In this cohort follow-up study conducted in a large Italian academic COVID-19 hospital, 115 recruited survivors were contacted by telephone 3 months after discharge to home care. The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 was administered. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyse risk factors for the development of PTSD. KEY RESULTS: A total of 10.4% of the sample received a PCL-5-based diagnosis of PTSD. Other 8.6% of the sample received a diagnosis of subthreshold PTSD, which leads to significant levels of distress and impairment. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that previous psychiatric diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) = 6.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.7-78.6, p < 0.001) and obesity (OR = 3.51, 95% CI: 1.4-857.9, p = 0.03) were risk factors for developing PTSD.

The value of additional interventions to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. We calculated the cost-effectiveness and cases averted of each intervention in combination with implementing the CDC guidelines. METHODS: We built a decision-analytic model to examine the cost-effectiveness of interventions to re-open universities. The interventions included implementing the CDC guidelines alone and in combination with 1) a symptom-checking mobile application, 2) university-provided standardized, high filtration masks, 3) thermal cameras for temperature screening, 4) one-time entry (gateway) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and 5) weekly PCR testing. We also modeled a package of interventions (package intervention) that combines the CDC guidelines with using the symptom-checking mobile application, standardized masks, gateway PCR testing, and weekly PCR testing. The direct and indirect costs were calculated in 2020 US dollars. We also provided an online interface that allows the user to change model parameters. RESULTS: All interventions averted cases of COVID-19. When the prevalence of actively infectious cases reached 0.1%, providing standardized, high filtration masks saved money and improved health relative to implementing the CDC guidelines alone and in combination with using the symptom-checking mobile application, thermal cameras, and gateway testing. Compared with standardized masks, weekly PCR testing cost $9.27 million (95% Credible Interval [CrI]: cost-saving-$77.36 million)/QALY gained. Compared with weekly PCR testing, the package intervention cost $137,877 (95% CrI: $3,108-$19.11 million)/QALY gained. At both a prevalence of 1% and 2%, the package intervention saved money and improved health compared to all the other interventions.

After analyzing the symptoms and medicine networks, we identified the key factors using six evaluation metrics of node centrality. The experimental results indicate that the proposed analysis model is capable of discovering the critical symptoms and symptom distribution for diagnosis; the key medicines and medicine combinations for treatment. Based on the latest COVID-19 clinical guidelines, this model could result in the higher accuracy results than the other representative clustering algorithms.

Due to their underlying disease as well as therapeutic immunosuppression these patients may be at higher risk of being more severely affected by SARS-CoV2. Furthermore, SARS-CoV2 infection might trigger a flare of the underlying disease. Objectives: To evaluate clinical characteristics and disease course of COVID-19 in children and adolescents with RMD and to analyze possible effects of SARSCoV2 infection on the underlying disease under different therapeutic regimens. Methods: Data from juvenile patients with RMD recorded via the SARS-CoV2 questionnaire within the National Pediatric Rheumatology Database and the registry for hospitalized children and adolescents with COVID-19 of the German Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases were analyzed. In addition to age, sex and diagnosis, information was collected about the date and method of a positive SARS-CoV2 testing, reason for testing, on clinical manifestations, disease course, treatment and outcome of COVID-19, on drug therapy at the time of virus detection, on disease activity (NRS 0 -10, 0 = best) of the underlying disease at the last visit before and after the SARS-CoV2 infection. Results: From April 17th 2020 until January 25th 2021, data of 67 patients with RMD and confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection were collected. Mean age was 13.5  3.9 years with equal sex distribution. The majority of patients were diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA, 64%), 12 (18%) patients had an autoinflammatory disease (FMF, CAPS, PFAPA, TRAPS) and 5 (7%) a connective tissue disease. Fifty-two patients (78%) were treated with a disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), 39% with a biological DMARD and 9% systemic glucocorticoids at the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nineteen patients (28%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 because of typical symptoms, the majority (67%) because of contact to an infected person. PCR was used most often (in 60 %). 52 patients (78%) developed symptoms of COVID-19, 15 patients remained asymptomatic. The most common symptom of COVID-19 was rhinitis (42%) and fever (38%), followed by fatigue (34%), taste/smell disorder (33%), sore throat (27%) and cough (23%). Disease severity was graded as mild in 44 of 52 (85%) symptomatic patients, only two patients were hospitalized, one of whom required intensive care and died of cardiorespiratory failure 3 days after symptom onset. In 22 of 26 (85%) SARS-CoV2-positive patients, no relevant increase in disease activity (difference in NRS  1 before/after infection) of the underlying disease was observed 31 days after symptom onset (median, IQR 17-52 days). One patient, who had paused tocilizumab for 2 doses, experienced a flare of his seronegative polyarthritis 2 months after asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion: In our cohort, the clinical picture of COVID-19 in children and adolescents with RMD was similar to that of healthy peers. The majority of patients showed mild disease course with good outcome under various medications, however, one patient with a severe course of COVID-19 died. In addition, SARSCoV2 infection does not appear to have a relevant impact on the underlying disease activity, whereas discontinuation of therapy might pose a risk of flare.","output":"Clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV2 infections in children and adolescents with rheumatic and musculuskeletal diseases-survey data from Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CATEGORY: Ankle; Ankle Arthritis; Arthroscopy; Bunion; Hindfoot; Lesser Toes; Midfoot/Forefoot; Sports INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE: With the development of the COVID-19 pandemic, elective foot and ankle surgeries were delayed throughout the U.S. to divert healthcare resources and limit exposure. Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on patients willingness to proceed with elective procedures once restrictions are lifted and factors contributing to such decision. METHODS: Patients across six U.S. Orthopedic Institutions who had their elective foot and ankle surgeries cancelled secondary to the pandemic were given a questionnaire. Specifically, patients were asked about their willingness to move forward with surgery once restrictions were lifted and if not why. Pain-level and pain medication use were also assessed. Univariate analysis was used to identify factors that contribute to patients decisions. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients participated in this study. N=21 (14%) opted not to proceed with surgery once restrictions were lifted. 43% (N=9) listed concern for COVID infection as the reason, however, 14% of them would proceed if procedures were performed in surgery center. Twenty-nine (19% of the total cohort) patients had increased pain and 11% of patients were taking more pain meds because of the delay to their procedure. Patients who decided not to proceed with surgery reported pain reduction (3% vs. 14%) and lower increase in pain medication used (5% vs. 12%).

It also affirms that the immunological contribution to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is predictive of the neurological sequelae particularly ischemic stroke, which makes it the expectation rather than the exception. This work is of fundamental significance to the neurorehabilitation community given the increasing number of COVID-related ischemic strokes, the current limited knowledge regarding the risk of reinfection, and recent reports of a PCNS. It further highlights the need for global collaboration and research into new pathobiology-based neurorehabilitation treatment strategies and more integrated evidence-based care.","output":"COVID-19 Pathophysiology Predicts That Ischemic Stroke Occurrence Is an Expectation, Not an ExceptionA Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During government-implemented restrictions in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, people's everyday lives changed profoundly. However, there is to date little research chronicling how people perceived their changed everyday lives and which consequences this had. In a two-wave study, we examined the psychological characteristics of people's situations and their correlates during shutdown in a large German sample (NT1 = 1,353;NT2 = 446). First, we compared characteristics during government-issued restrictions with retrospective accounts from before and with a follow-up assessment 6 to 7 months later when many restrictions had been lifted. We found that mean levels were lower and variances were higher for most characteristics during the shutdown. Second, the experience of certain situation characteristics was associated in meaningful and theoretically expected ways with people's traits, appraisals of the COVID-19 crisis, and subjective well-being. Lastly, situation characteristics often substantially explained the associations of traits with appraisals and well-being. Our findings highlight the importance of considering perceived situations as these contribute to people's functioning during crises.","output":"The situation during the COVID-19 pandemic: a snapshot in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Suicide is now the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. Suicide rates for health care providers are thought to be higher than for people in other occupations because of job strain and burnout. Despite the National Academy of Medicine's Action Collaborative on Clinician Well-Being and Resilience, which focuses on reducing stress and preventing suicide, a shortage of data limits our understanding of nurse suicide. Neither employers nor professional nursing associations track suicide data. PURPOSE: To determine the number of suicides and estimated rate of suicide among RNs, using data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). METHODS: We extracted data from the NVDRS, which is based on death certificates, coroner reports, and law enforcement reports, for the year 2015. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Industry and Occupation Computerized Coding System was used to code the data. Industry and occupation coding experts reviewed the coding for accuracy. RESULTS: Analysis of 2015 NVDRS data from 17 states showed that among civilian employed nurses ages 16 to 64 years, the estimated suicide rates for female and male nurses (11.4 and 29.3 per 100,000 nurses, respectively) were each higher than the rates for the comparable total population (8.2 and 26.1 per 100,000 people, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that RNs may die by suicide at higher rates than the total employed population in the 16-to-64-year age range. Implementation of evidence-based approaches to prevent suicide are warranted.","output":"Original Research: Suicide Among RNs: An Analysis of 2015 Data from the National Violent Death Reporting System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The challenge for academic success in higher education is getting tougher with the implementation of study from home (SFH) in the COVID-19 pandemic. One aspect that supports the success of online learning is the ability of students to survive in difficult conditions or referred to as coping skills. Coping skills consist of several strategies divided into positive and negative coping strategies. The objectives of this study: 1) are there any differences in student coping strategies in dealing with online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic;2) are there differences in student approach strategies in dealing with online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic;3) Are there differences in student avoidance strategies in dealing with online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic;and 4) Are there differences in student social support strategies in dealing with online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this study, we developed the snowflake Cu(2)S/Pd/CuO nanocomposite to construct an original label-free electrochemical immunosensor for the ultrasensitive detection of CEA levels. The nanocomposite of cuprous sulfide (Cu(2)S) with Pd nanoparticles (Pd NPs) was synthesized through an in situ formation of Pd NPs on the Cu(2)S. Cuprous sulfide (Cu(2)S) and CuO can not only be used as a carrier to increase the reaction area but also catalyze the substrate to generate current signal. Palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) have excellent catalytic properties and good biocompatibility, as well as the ability of excellent electron transfer. The immunosensor was designed using 5 mmol/L H(2)O(2) as the active substrate by optimizing the conditions with a detection range from 100 fg/ml to 100 ng/ml and a minimum detection limit of 33.11 fg/ml. The human serum was detected by electrochemical immunoassay, and the results were consistent with those of the commercial electrochemical immunosensor.

Severity mainly depends on the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a predominance of subpleural lesions. Lung point-of-care ultrasonography (L-POCUS) is highly effective in detecting pulmonary peripheral patterns and may be appropriate for examining patients with COVID-19. We suggest that L-POCUS performed during the initial examination may identify patients with COVID-19 who are at a high risk of complicated treatment or unfavourable evolution. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Point-of-care ultrasonography for risk stratification of non-critical COVID-19 patients on admission is a prospective, multicentre study. Adult patients visiting the emergency department (ED) of participating centres for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are assessed for inclusion. Included patients have L-POCUS performed within 48 hours following ED admission. The severity of lung damage is assessed using the L-POCUS score based on 36 points for ARDS. Apart from the L-POCUS score assessment, patients are treated as recommended by the WHO. For hospitalised patients, a second L-POCUS is performed at day 53. A follow-up is carried out on day 14, and the patient's status according to the Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement for COVID-19 from the WHO is recorded.The primary outcome is the rate of patients requiring intubation or who are dead from any cause during the 14 days following inclusion. We will determine the area under the ROC curve of L-POCUS. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol has been approved by the French and Belgian Ethics Committees and is carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The study is funding by a grant from the French Health Ministry, and its findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at scientific conferences.

Methods: Six databases were searched until March 2022 for studies assessing colchicine versus control in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The primary outcome was mortality, and secondary outcome was length of hospitalization. Inverse variance and random effect meta-analyses were performed. The strength of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Results: Nine studies (five randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and four non-randomized studies of intervention (NRSI); n = 13,478). Colchicine did not reduce mortality in comparison with the standard of care in RCTs (RR 0.99; 95%CI 0.90 to 1.10; p = 0.90); however, it did reduce mortality in NRSI studies (RR 0.45; 95%CI 0.26 to 0.77; p = 0.02).

The purpose of this study, therefore, is to determine the key dimensions of memorable tourism experiences (MTEs) that influence tourists' satisfaction with the vacation experience motivated by the beauty of nature and landscape, as well as the impact of satisfaction with vacation experience on behavioural intentions. Design - Using a structured questionnaire on pencil and paper, data were collected from a sample of 334 travellers who were citizens of the Republic of Croatia and whose primary motive for travel was to visit a natural attraction. Methodology/approach - The questionnaire adopted previously validated scales and was used to explore MTEs, satisfaction with the vacation experience and behavioural intentions. The hypotheses were empirically tested using partial least square structural equation modelling. Findings - The results show that not all MTE dimensions influence satisfaction with the vacation experience among tourists whose primary travel motive was the beauty of nature and landscape. Hedonism, refreshment, and involvement as MTE dimensions had a statistically significant influence on satisfaction with the vacation experience. In addition, satisfaction with the vacation experience had a statistically significant influence on several behavioural intentions, with the strongest influence on intention to recommend. Originality of the research - Tourists in nature-based destinations were found to exhibit specific behaviours, as not all MTE dimensions contribute equally to satisfaction with the vacation experience.

Most studies examined cancer detection via screening. Very few studies examined cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment or palliative care. Most studies focused on patient-sided barriers to care and there was a paucity of information regarding institutional barriers to health. Cancer-related outcomes were seldom examined, and most studies were qualitative or behavioral analysis. Results highlighted significant communication issues spanning the cancer care continuum and a context of inadequate support for both patients and clinicians.

The purpose of this multicenter retrospective study was to evaluate the natural progression of the synovial fluid WBC count, PMN percentage, and total neutrophil count in patients who underwent knee aspiration during the first two years after primary total knee arthroplasty and had no evidence of periprosthetic joint infection. METHODS From April 1999 to March 2012, 571 patients who presented within the first two years after primary total knee arthroplasty underwent knee aspiration as part of an evaluation for periprosthetic joint infection. Patients were categorized into four groups on the basis of the number of days between surgery and arthrocentesis. The synovial fluid WBC count, PMN percentage, and total neutrophil count were compared among the four time periods with use of separate one-way analyses of variance and Tamhane post-hoc analyses. RESULTS Four hundred and fifty-two samples not associated with a periprosthetic joint infection were adequate for analysis. The synovial fluid WBC count, PMN percentage, and total neutrophil count all decreased after the first ninety postoperative days. The synovial fluid WBC count showed an earlier return to a level similar to the two-year time point than the PMN percentage did. The mean total neutrophil count decreased from 2533.2 cells/L during the first forty-five days to 649.0 cells/L from forty-six to ninety days, 269.5 cells/L from three months to one year, and 240.8 cells/L from one to two years. CONCLUSIONS The synovial fluid WBC count and PMN percentage changed at different rates over the first two years after total knee arthroplasty, with the WBC count exhibiting an initially more rapid decrease and the PMN percentage demonstrating a more linear decrease. Hence, the total neutrophil count, which combines these two parameters, may provide a better method to identify patients with a periprosthetic joint infection. Values for the synovial fluid WBC count, PMN percentage, and total neutrophil count were all significantly elevated in the early postoperative period, and the use of standard cutoff values for the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection can lead to false-positive results.","output":"The natural progression of synovial fluid white blood-cell counts and the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells after primary total knee arthroplasty: a multicenter study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case explores a situation that affected almost all artists -- especially musicians -- after the COVID-19 pandemic occurred: the need to perform shows in a context where agglomerations are prohibited Based on the reality of the famous samba singer Diogo Nogueira, a situation is presented in which the decision to make presentations through lives is evaluated From this scenario, the possible options are exposed for Diogo to remain in evidence before an audience still eager for entertainment The case makes it possible to discuss strategy, platform management, and innovation It is recommended to be used in strategy subjects for postgraduate courses (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] O presente caso explora uma situao que atingiu a quase totalidade de artistas - msicos em particular - aps a ocorrncia da pandemia de COVID-19: a necessidade de realizar shows em um contexto em que aglomeraes s?o proibidas Com base na realidade do famoso sambista Diogo Nogueira, apresenta-se uma situao em que a decis?o por realizar apresentaes por meio de lives  avaliada A partir do cenrio vislumbrado, s?o expostas possveis opes para que Diogo, por meio das lives, mantenhase em evidncia perante um pblico ainda vido por entretenimento O caso possibilita a discuss?o sobre estratgia, gest?o de plataformas e inovao Recomenda-se a utilizao do caso em disciplinas de estratgia para cursos de ps-graduao (Portuguese) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of RAC - Revista de Administrao Contemporanea is the property of Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao (ANPAD) and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Pandemic, Samba, and Diogo Nogueira's Livestreams: Platform Management Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

METHODS: HCWs participating in regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing were invited for serological testing prior to first and second vaccination, and 4 weeks post-vaccination if receiving a 12-week dosing interval. Quantitative post-vaccination anti-spike antibody responses were measured using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay (detection threshold: 50 AU/ml). We used multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of seropositivity and generalised additive models to track antibody responses over time. RESULTS: 3570/3610(98.9%) HCWs were seropositive >14 days post-first vaccination and prior to second vaccination, 2706/2720(99.5%) after Pfizer-BioNTech and 864/890(97.1%) following Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. Previously infected and younger HCWs were more likely to test seropositive post-first vaccination, with no evidence of differences by sex or ethnicity. All 470 HCWs tested >14 days after second vaccine were seropositive. Quantitative antibody responses were higher after previous infection: median(IQR) >21 days post-first Pfizer-BioNTech 14,604(7644-22,291) AU/ml vs. 1028(564-1985) AU/ml without prior infection (p<0.001).

A Dalian outbreak in July 2020 and a Yingkou outbreak ten months later are epidemiologically connected and derived from a cold-chain related variant. Mutation-dormant variants are detected during the spread of spike D614G variant and the Delta Variant of Concern. Cold-chain contaminations repeatedly caused by epidemiologically connected patients are also found and have resulted in infections. Moreover, the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan is likely to be cold-chain related.

Simple, closed fractures are assessed and considered for closed manipulation under anesthesia (MUA #nasal bones). Most departments perform this under general anesthesia (GA). Our protocol changed in the face of COVID-19, where procedures were alternatively performed under local anesthesia (LA) in the clinic, to cope with lack of elective theater capacity during the pandemic, while still allowing a nasal fracture service to take place. We present postoperative patient outcomes on breathing and shape, comparing GA versus LA. METHODS: Patient records retrospectively analyzed (January 2020-August 2020), and patients undergoing MUA #nasal bones interviewed by telephone after one month. Exclusion criteria were open injuries or depressed nasal bones requiring elevation. Breathing and shape scores were evaluated subjectively using a Likert scale (1 = very unsatisfied, 5 = very satisfied). RESULTS: Two hundred five nasal injury referrals were made (21 MUA #nasal bones under GA and 27 under LA). Manipulation under anesthesia #nasal bones significantly improved both breathing satisfaction scores (GA; 2.88  0.24 to 4.06  0.23, P < 0.05; LA; 2.86  0.22 to 3.77  0.27, P < 0.05) and aesthetic scores (GA; 2.00  0.21 to 3.94  0.23, P < 0.05; LA; 1.64  0.19 to 3.59  0.28, P < 0.05) in both GA and LA groups. There was no statistically significant difference between LA and GA in postoperative outcomes. There was a trend toward greater satisfaction for GA, though this was not statistically significant and may be impacted by the rate of cartilaginous deformity in the LA group. Both techniques were well tolerated and most patients would repeat the procedure in hindsight. CONCLUSIONS: Local anesthesia could provide a safer, cheaper, and satisfactory alternative for performing MUA #nasal bones in the clinic for selected patients, particularly with reduction of elective theater capacity in the event of further COVID-19 surges.

However, development of different strategies such as SARS-CoV-2-based vaccines and antibody therapy are urgently required beside other effective therapies such as plasma, anticoagulants, and immune as well as antiviral therapies. We encourage giving more attention to antibody based treatments as an immediate strategy. Although, there has not been any approved specific vaccine until now, developing vaccination strategies may have a protective effect against COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION An antiviral mAbs could be a safe and high-quality therapeutic intervention which is greatly recommended for COVID-19. Additionally, the high sequence homology between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS/MERS viruses, could shed light on developing to design a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"The immunology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the potential antibody based treatments and vaccination strategies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is revealing profound differences between men and women in disease outcomes worldwide.

While there were mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission, there were no established or tested protocols of COVID-19 testing or mitigation for school administrators to follow. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of a multifaceted COVID-19 mitigation strategy using social, behavioral, and educational interventions and a program of frequent testing with prevalence of disease spread. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted as a retrospective review of COVID-19 positivity from August 16, 2020, to April 30, 2021, at Delaware State University, a publicly funded historically Black university. Participants included all students, faculty, and staff members with a campus presence. Positivity rates after use of mitigation strategies and testing on campus were compared with those of the surrounding community. Data were analyzed from July through September 2021. EXPOSURES: Mitigation strategies included education and outreach about social distancing, masking, and handwashing, and a COVID-19 testing plan consisted of twice-weekly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening using anterior nasal samples (fall and early spring semester) and then saliva-based samples (middle to late spring semester). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cumulative tests, infections, daily quarantine, and isolation residence hall occupancy were measured, and comparisons were made with statewide COVID-19 positivity rates. RESULTS: The campus cohort included 2320 individuals (1575 resident students, 415 nonresident students, and 330 faculty or staff members). There were 1488 (64.1%) women and 832 (35.9%) men; mean (SD) age was 27.5 (12.9) years. During the fall semester, 36 500 COVID-19 PCR tests were performed. Weekly positivity rates ranged from 0 of 372 tests to 16 of 869 tests (1.8%) (mean [SD] positivity rate, 0.5% [0.5%]; 168 positive results and 36 312 negative results). During the same period, statewide positivity ranged from 589 of 25 120 tests (2.3%) to 5405 of 54 596 tests (9.9%) (mean [SD] positivity rate, 4.8% [2.6%]). In the spring semester, 39 045 PCR tests were performed. Weekly positivity rates ranged from 4 of 2028 tests (0.2%) to 36 of 900 tests (4.0%) (mean [SD] positivity rate, 0.8% [0.9%]; 267 positive results and 38 767 negative results). During the same period, statewide positivity ranged from 1336 of 37 254 tests (3.6%) to 3630 of 42 458 tests (8.5%) (mean [SD] positivity rate, 5.1% [1.3%]). Compared with statewide rates, campus positivity rates were mean (SD) 4.4 (2.6) percentage points lower during the fall semester (P < .001) and mean (SD) 5.6 (1.6) percentage points lower during the spring semester (P < .001). Total daily quarantine and isolation residence hall occupancy ranged from 0 to 43 students in the fall and 1 to 47 students during the spring. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that the combination of campuswide mitigation policies and twice-weekly COVID-19 PCR screening was associated with a significant decrease in COVID-19 positivity at a residential historically Black university campus compared with the surrounding community. Given the socioeconomic demographics of many students at historically Black colleges and universities, keeping these resident campuses open is critical not only to ensure access to educational resources, but also to provide housing and food security.","output":"Assessment of a Multifaceted Approach, Including Frequent PCR Testing, to Mitigation of COVID-19 Transmission at a Residential Historically Black University"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Recent literature on racial or ethnic discrimination and mental health was reviewed to assess the current science and identify key areas of emphasis for social epidemiology. Objectives of this review were to: 1) Determine whether there have been advancements in the measurement and analysis of perceived discrimination; 2) Identify the use of theories and/or frameworks in perceived discrimination and mental health research; and 3) Assess the extent to which stress buffers are being considered and evaluated in the existing literature. RECENT FINDINGS Metrics and analytic approaches used to assess discrimination remain largely unchanged. Theory and/or frameworks such as the stress and coping framework continue to be underused in majority of the studies. Adolescents and young adults experiencing racial/ethnic discrimination were at greater risk of adverse mental health outcomes, and the accumulation of stressors over the life course may have an aggregate impact on mental health. Some growth seems evident in studies examining the mediation and moderation of stress buffers and other key factors with the findings suggesting a reduction in the effects of discrimination on mental health. SUMMARY Discrimination scales should consider the multiple social identities of a person, the context where the exposure occurs, how the stressor manifests specifically in adolescents, the historical traumas, and cumulative exposure. Life course theory and intersectionality may help guide future work. Despite existing research, gaps remain in in elucidating the effects of racial and ethnic discrimination on mental health, signaling an opportunity and a call to social epidemiologists to engage in interdisciplinary research to speed research progress.","output":"Perceived Racial/Ethnic Discrimination and Mental Health: a Review and Future Directions for Social Epidemiology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: School attendance during the COVID-19 pandemic is intensely debated. AIM: In November 2020, we assessed SARS-CoV-2 infections and seroreactivity in 24 randomly selected school classes and connected households in Berlin, Germany. METHODS: We collected oro-nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples, examining SARS-CoV-2 infection and IgG antibodies by RT-PCR and ELISA. Household members self-swabbed. We assessed individual and institutional prevention measures. Classes with SARS-CoV-2 infection and connected households were retested after 1 week. RESULTS: We examined 1,119 participants, including 177 primary and 175 secondary school students, 142 staff and 625 household members. SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in eight classes, affecting each 1C2 individuals. Infection prevalence was 2.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2C5.0; 9/338), 1.4% (95% CI: 0.2C5.1; 2/140), and 2.3% (95% CI: 1.3C3.8; 14/611) among students, staff and household members. Six of nine infected students were asymptomatic at testing. We detected IgG antibodies in 2.0% (95%CI: 0.8C4.1; 7/347), 1.4% (95% CI: 0.2C5.0; 2/141) and 1.4% (95% CI: 0.6C2.7; 8/576). Prevalence increased with inconsistent facemask-use in school, walking to school, and case-contacts outside school. For three of nine households with infection(s), origin in school seemed possible. After 1 week, no school-related secondary infections appeared in affected classes; the attack rate in connected households was 1.1%. CONCLUSION: School attendance under rigorously implemented preventive measures seems reasonable. Balancing risks and benefits of school closures need to consider possible spill-over infection into households. Deeper insight is required into the infection risks due to being a schoolchild vs attending school.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in school settings during the second COVID-19 wave: a cross-sectional study, Berlin, Germany, November 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of culturally responsive sexual health educational programs for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth, barriers to their uptake and utilization persist in tribal communities. These challenges were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which required flexible program delivery using both in-person and virtual classrooms. OBJECTIVE: This exploratory study provides a preliminary understanding of the extent to which pre-existing challenges impact the delivery of culturally responsive sexual health education programs in Native communities and to what extent they were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. It also highlights the challenges faced by adolescent health advocates when adapting culturally responsive health curricula to online platforms. Finally, this study discloses major socioeconomic, health, and mental challenges experienced by AI/AN youth during the pandemic. METHODS: An exploratory, descriptive, qualitative design approach was adopted to carry out 5 individual and 1 collective in-depth key informant interviews. A total of 8 Native and non-Native sexual health educators served as key informants and shared their personal experiences with the delivery of sexual health education programs for youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. The interviews were conducted virtually from October to November 2020 using Zoom to reach participants dispersed across different regions of the United States. We followed the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) as a reference for the study methodology. We also used the Braun and Clarke framework (2006) to conduct a thematic analysis. RESULTS: Experts opinions were structured according to 5 main themes: (1) competing community priorities during COVID-19; (2) moving to web-based programming: skills, training, support; (3) recruiting youth; and (4) challenges for implementation in a household environment; and (5) recommendations to overcome implementation challenges. These themes are complementary, connected, and should be considered holistically for the development, dissemination, and implementation of online sexual health programs for AI/AN youth, specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results raised the following points for discussion: (1) Building partnerships with schools and community organizations facilitates program adaptation and implementation, (2) there is a need to adopt a holistic approach when addressing youth sexual health in AI/AN communities, (3) a systematic and culturally responsive adaptation approach ensures effective virtual program delivery, and (4) community and youth engagement is essential for the success of virtual sexual health programs. CONCLUSIONS: Findings can provide recommendations on actions to be taken by sexual health educators and guidelines to follow to ensure cultural sensitivity, effective adaptation, and successful implementation when setting out to advocate for online sexual health programs for AI/AN youth.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on the Delivery of Educational Programs in Native American Communities: Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is negatively affecting patient enrollment, therapy administration, and patient visits in breast cancer clinical trials worldwide COVID-19 may have a lasting impact on how clinical trials are conducted, and guidelines are necessary to inform trial design and patient safety While many groups and journals have recently published guidelines, including NCCN, ESMO, IQVIA, and Lancet Oncology, there is no consensus on how to treat patients in the current environment Understanding and quantifying the impact of the pandemic on clinical study sites will help inform the rational development of a consensus approach The goal of this survey was to gather site-level data on the impact of COVID-19 from clinical sites participating in the POLARIS study (NCT03280303), an ongoing, prospective, real-world, noninterventional study in patients with hormone receptorpositive/ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer receiving palbociclib plus endocrine therapy Methods: Two rounds of questionnaires were sent to investigators at POLARIS study sites: 1 via email March 26-27, 2020, and 1 via telephone from April 30-May 20, 2020 The questions on COVID-19 impact and management are shown in the Table Results: Eighty of 122 POLARIS study sites contacted responded to the March questionnaire, and 86 responded to the April-May questionnaire In March, 33% (26/80) of the surveyed population were working predominantly remotely, 26% (21/80) were working both onsite and remotely, and 3 1% (25/80) were working onsite Approximately 24% of sites reported delayed data entry The option of telemedicine or office visits was offered to subjects at approximately 73% (58/80) of sites, and 11% (9/80) of sites were restricted to telemedicine visits In April-May, 36% (31/86) of respondents reported an impact on study management and 64% (55/86) reported no impact Approximately 94% (81/86) of surveyed sites felt they were able to maintain clinical studies despite the challenges due to COVID-19, and 79% (68/86) of sites had the option for telemedicine and/or office visits, while 18% (16/86) had no telemedicine alternative In April-May, 38% of sites reported an impact on patient visits Conclusion: Although these findings must be interpreted with caution due to the limitations of survey studies, the results suggest that approximately 1/3 of the study sites will experience an impact on their responsiveness to correspondence, timely data entry, and subject management due to the COVID-19 pandemic Telemedicine may be used to mitigate the effect of the pandemic on clinical trial execution","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on study sites: Survey analysis from the noninterventional POLARIS study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is primarily a respiratory disease that has become a global pandemic. Close contact plays an important role in infection spread, while fomite may also be a possible transmission route. Research during the COVID-19 pandemic has identified long-range airborne transmission as one of the important transmission routes although lack solid evidence. METHODS: We examined video data related to a restaurant associated COVID-19 outbreak in Guangzhou. We observed more than 40,000 surface touches and 13,000 episodes of close contacts in the restaurant during the entire lunch duration. These data allowed us to analyse infection risk via both the fomite and close contact routes. RESULTS: There is no significant correlation between the infection risk via both fomite and close contact routes among those who were not family members of the index case. We can thus rule out virus transmission via fomite contact and interpersonal close contact routes in the Guangzhou restaurant outbreak. The absence of a fomite route agrees with the COVID-19 literature. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide indirect evidence for the long-range airborne route dominating SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the restaurant. We note that the restaurant was poorly ventilated, allowing for increasing airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration.","output":"Evidence for lack of transmission by close contact and surface touch in a restaurant outbreak of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the third most common cancer type in the United States.

There have been no studies to determine the role of local anesthetic in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. This study evaluates the efficacy of subcutaneous and intraperitoneal anesthetic in reducing postoperative pain following common laparoscopic colorectal procedures, in patients managed with enhanced recovery care pathways. METHODS A single-institution retrospective cohort analysis of 172 patients who underwent common elective laparoscopic colorectal procedures was carried out. Over three consecutive time periods, patients were divided into three study arms, based on administration of local anesthetic. The first group received no local anesthetic (n = 66), the next received only subcutaneous bupivacaine (n = 67), and the final group received both subcutaneous bupivacaine and intraperitoneal lidocaine (n = 44). Pain scores, time in the postoperative care unit, and the amount of opioid pain medication consumed in the immediate postoperative period were quantified. RESULTS There was no difference in pain scores reported between the three study arms, including upon arrival and upon leaving the recovery unit (P  0.086, P  0.166), and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 h postoperatively (P  0.332, P  0.142, P  0.155, P  0.872). There was no significant difference in the amount of postoperative opioid analgesia consumed between the three study arms on postoperative day 0 and on postoperative day 1 (P  0.365, P  0.458).

In this regard, nanomedicine and particularly polymeric nanoparticles have raised attention as a manner to improved drug delivery. Polymeric nanoparticles can optimize existent compounds or be used to improve the formulation for novel therapeutics. In this article the advantages and disadvantages of polymeric nanoparticles will be discussed, and current nanodevices, raw materials for their formulation, methods of formulation, and polymeric nanoparticles in clinical investigations will be reviewed. Finally, options for improvement and clinical applications will be suggested. ABSTRACT: Many therapeutic agents have failed in their clinical development, due to the toxic effects associated with non-transformed tissues. In this context, nanotechnology has been exploited to overcome such limitations, and also improve navigation across biological barriers. Amongst the many materials used in nanomedicine, with promising properties as therapeutic carriers, the following one stands out: biodegradable and biocompatible polymers. Polymeric nanoparticles are ideal candidates for drug delivery, given the versatility of raw materials and their feasibility in large-scale production. Furthermore, polymeric nanoparticles show great potential for easy surface modifications to optimize pharmacokinetics, including the half-life in circulation and targeted tissue delivery. Herein, we provide an overview of the current applications of polymeric nanoparticles as platforms in the development of novel nanomedicines for cancer treatment. In particular, we will focus on the raw materials that are widely used for polymeric nanoparticle generation, current methods for formulation, mechanism of action, and clinical investigations.","output":"Polyester Polymeric Nanoparticles as Platforms in the Development of Novel Nanomedicines for Cancer Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 71 million people have chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. A significant number of these will develop cirrhosis or liver cancer. Currently, during the COVID-19 outbreak, a high mortality rate has been found in patients with COVID-19 and cirrhosis. New direct-acting antiviral agents can cure more than 90% of HCV-infected patients. The new WHO strategy has introduced global goals against viral hepatitis, including a 30% reduction in new HCV cases and a 10% reduction in mortality by 2020. HCV transmission has changed considerably, reflecting both the evolution of medicine and health and social changes. The HCV is usually spread through blood-to-blood contact. After the discovery of HCV in 1989, antibody screening has drastically decreased the incidence of post-transfusion hepatitis. Nowadays, routine blood donor screening by nucleic acid amplification testing for the presence of HCV RNA has been introduced in many countries. It is conceivable that HCV screening could be offered to people born between 1946 and 1964 in the developed world and to people at high risk for HCV infection such as those who have received blood transfusions, blood products or organ donations before the 1990s, prisoners, health care workers, drug users and infants born to HCV-infected women. To achieve HCV elimination, health programmes should include improvement to access to health care services, increased screening and new projects to identify a submerged portion of patients with HCV infection. Submerged people with HCV infection are both people who are unaware of their condition and people diagnosed with HCV but not yet treated.

Results: We did not find any statistically significant difference in the three effectiveness parameters, between countries with and without lockdown (p > 0.76;very small effect size). There was also no significant difference in mortality during the effective phase (p > 0.1;very small to small effect sizes), however a significant difference after the effective phase, with higher mortality for lockdown countries. The effectiveness parameter derived from the daily case data correlated well with the parameter derived from the reproductive number (R 2 = 0.9480). The average duration of the effective phase was 17.3  10.5 days. Conclusions: The results indicate that lockdown measures are not necessarily superior to relaxed measures, which in turn are not necessarily a recipe for failure. Relaxed measures are, however, more economy-friendly. The higher mortality of lockdown countries is explained from the fact that, in our database, more lockdown countries than no-lockdown countries have higher mortality already during the effective phase that became significant only after the effective phase.","output":"COVID19 Pandemic: How Effective Are Interventive Control Measures and Is A Complete Lockdown Justified?

METHODS: Content analysis of the websites of the members of the Association of Scientific Medical Societies (AWMF; na?= 179), the association of statutory (dental) health insurance physicians (K(Z)Vs; na?= 38), selected health insurances (na?= 21), selected healthcare institutions (na?= 25), and supraregional health information providers (na?= 5) for information and offers that address people with noncommunicable diseases. RESULTS: The examined websites provide information about COVID-19, but only rarely about how to behave in the case of another (suspected) disease regarding healthcare utilization. Two health information provider portals, one health insurance company, but none of the KVs offer explicit decision support. KVs refer more often, but not consistently, to the general possibility of video consulting. DISCUSSION: Information concerning the topic is scarce for most of the patients.

Participants completed an online self-survey. In the qualitative analysis, data were subjected to thematic analysis. Results: We analyzed data from 613 participants, of which 8.6%, 9.0%, and 78.2% had moderate-to-severe anxiety, depression, and perceived stress, respectively. Having a previous mental health problem, being concerned about losing ones job, having at least two COVID-19 symptoms in the preceding two weeks, and being afraid of infecting family members increased the prevalence of experiencing moderate-to-severe depression and anxiety. The qualitative analysis allowed us to identify five recurring factors that caused a negative impact on workers lives during the pandemic: emotional distress linked to hospital experiences of suffering and death, modification of routines, fear of COVID-19, exacerbation of mental disorders, and physical problems associated with emotional distress.

Participants were asked to share how the pandemic affects them, their vision for the future, and how they cope during the pandemic. Although they worried about their health, felt isolated and missed seeing family and friends, most participants shared an optimistic view for the future. Some said that they are looking forward to receiving the vaccine, some believed that the effects of the pandemic are just temporary, and others compared that of the pandemic to the wars and other types of hardships which were much worse. Strategies for coping during the pandemic vary from spiritual practices to positive thinking, from exercises to new hobbies, and from calling family members to cutting down on the news. The results also show that the oldest-old and old-old participants seem to be better at regulating their negative effects compared to the young-old.

Experimental studies have shown that exercise acts, at least in part, by inducing the production of myokines that improve metabolic control and activate brown/beige adipose tissue depots. Combined training (CT) is recommended by the major diabetes guidelines due to its metabolic and cardiovascular benefits, however, its impact on brown/beige adipose tissue activities has never been tested in humans with overweight and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here, we evaluated the effects of 16-week combined training (CT) program on brown adipose tissue activity; browning and autophagy markers, and serum pro-thermogenic/inflammatory inducers in patients with overweight and T2D. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with overweight and T2D were assigned to either a control group (CG) or a combined training group (CTG) in a randomized and controlled study. Functional/fitness parameters, anthropometry/body composition parameters, blood hormone/biochemical parameters, thermogenic/autophagic gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue were evaluated before and at the end of the intervention. In addition, cold-induced 18-Fluoroxyglucose Positron Emission Computed Tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) was performed in the training group before and after the end of the intervention. RESULTS: CT increased cervical/supraclavicular brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic activity (p = 0.03) as well as in perirenal adipose tissue (p = 0.02). In addition, CT increased the expression of genes related to thermogenic profile (TMEM26: + 95%, p = 0.04; and EPSTI1: + 26%, p = 0.03) and decreased autophagic genes (ULK1: -15%, p = 0.04; LC3: -5%, p = 0.02; and ATG4: -22%, p < 0.001) in subcutaneous adipose tissue. There were positive correlations between % BAT activity with % of post training energy expenditure cold exposure, HDL-c, IL4, adiponectin, irisin, meteorin-like, and TMEM26 and ZIC1 genes, besides negative correlations with LDL-c, total cholesterol and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSION: This is the first evidence of the beneficial actions of CT on adipose tissue thermogenic activity in humans, and it adds important support for the recommendation of CT as a strategy in the management of diabetes.","output":"Combined training increases thermogenic fat activity in patients with overweight and type 2 diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between the Trial of Org 10172 in acute stroke treatment classification and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of acute cerebral infarction as well as acute cerebral infarction's risk factors.

METHODS Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of published medical literature, selecting studies that investigated and reported barriers to seeking health care among returning travellers and migrants with malaria. In total, 633 articles were screened, of which four studies met the inclusion criteria after a full-text review. RESULTS The four studies reported barriers to seeking healthcare among returning travellers in China, the USA, Thailand, and the Dominican Republic. Three studies had an observational design. The identified barriers were summarized based on the appraisal delay, illness delay, and utilization delay stages. During appraisal delays, low awareness of malaria was the most significant factor. Once the patient assessed that he or she was ill, belonging to a specific minority ethnicity, being infected with P. vivax, and receiving a low level of social support were predictors of delayed health care-seeking. Finally, the most significant factor associated with utilization delays was the monetary cost. CONCLUSION The health care-seeking behaviour of returning travellers with malaria should be further investigated and improved. Addressing the identified barriers and gaps in health care-seeking behaviour among returning travellers with malaria, particularly among groups at high risk of travel-associated infections, is important to prevent severe disease and deaths as well as secondary transmission and epidemics.","output":"Barriers to seeking health care among returning travellers with malaria: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"They say that even a kick in the rear is a step forward, and COVID-19 has delivered one mighty kick to corporate posteriors around the world Now one question is whether boards will lurch forward--on, of all things, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues The ties between COVID-19 and ESG performance are more direct than one might assume The virus has forced organizations to consider a host of specific questions, but the deeper, existential questions boards face are two: How can they preserve sustainable operations amid unpredictable circumstances?

The potential impact of related national events, such as lockdowns and school closures, on these admissions was considered.MethodsInformation was collected on all patients aged <18 years who required involvement of our local CAMHS service during their hospital admission over a 26 month period, 13 months pre-COVID (January 2019-January 2020) and 13 months post-COVID (February 2020-February 2021). Data recorded included: age, length of stay, presenting complaint, interventions required, need for registered mental health nurse (RMN) support during admission and discharge location.ResultsThe total number of mental health admissions remained static during the time period (average pre-COVID admissions 13.9 young people/month and post-COVID 14/month) with no change in the patient average age (mean 14.5 vs 15 years).Despite a rising trend, there was no significant increase in the rates of young people acting upon their suicidal ideations (73% pre vs 80% post, p value 0.14) or the proportion requiring active medical treatment (most commonly N-acetylcysteine) following significant overdoses (12% vs 17.5%, p value 0.18).However, young people presenting during the pandemic were significantly more likely to require RMN support whilst an inpatient (117% increase in demand, p0.001) and subsequently be discharged to somewhere other than their home address (p value 0.01) - either a tier 4 psychiatric bed (2.2% pre-COVID vs 6.6% post) or a social care placement (2.2% vs 5.5%).Patient numbers requiring detention under a Mental Health Act section or chemical sedation remained low throughout (all <1% in both periods).ConclusionsYoung people with mental health concerns have placed a significant demand on acute paediatric services for many years, and not just over the last 12 months of unprecedented additional societal challenges.

Among many of the existing methods, the fortification of foods with iron salts is the best and most cost-effective strategy for targeting large-scale populations to provide nutritional security. The fortification of foods with iron salts is a challenging task because most iron complexes (ferrous sulfate, ferrous chloride) used in fortification are highly water-soluble, which impart unacceptable organoleptic changes in food vehicles and also causes gastrointestinal problems. However, insoluble iron salts (ferric pyrophosphate) do not cause unacceptable taste or color in food vehicles but low bioavailable. Nanosized iron salts can overcome these concerns. The particle size of iron salts has been reported to play an important role in the absorption of iron. Reduction in the particle size of iron compounds increases its surface area, which in turn improves its solubility in the gastric juice leading to higher absorption. Nanosized iron compound produces minimal organoleptic changes in food vehicles compared to water-soluble iron complexes. Thus nanosized iron salts find potential applications in food fortification to reduce IDA. This paper focuses on providing a complete review of the various iron salts used in IDA, including their bioavailability, the challenges to food fortification, the effects of nanosized iron salts on IDA, and their applications in food fortification.

There is concern that the COVID-19 pandemic may be complicating efforts to prevent new HIV infections, reduce AIDS related deaths, and expand access to HIV services. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gay and bisexual men's ability to access services is not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: To understand access to HIV services at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Our study used data collected from two independent global online surveys conducted with convenience samples of gay and bisexual men. Both datasets had common demographic measurements, but only one, the COVID-19 Disparities Survey (n=13,562), collected the outcomes of interest (HIV service access at the height of the first COVID-19 wave) and only the other, GMHR-4 (n=6,188), gathered pre-COVID-19 pandemic exposures/covariates of interest (social/structural enablers of and barriers to HIV service access). We used data fusion methods to combine these datasets utilizing overlapping demographic variables and assessed relationships between exposures and outcomes. We hypothesized that engagement with gay community and comfort with one's healthcare provider would be positively associated with HIV service access and negatively associated with poorer mental health and economic instability as the COVID-19 outbreaks took hold. Conversely, we hypothesized that sexual stigma and experiences of discrimination by a healthcare provider would be negatively associated with HIV services access and positively associated with poorer mental health and economic instability. RESULTS: With 19,643 observations after combining datasets, our study confirmed hypothesized associations between enablers of and barriers to HIV prevention, care, and treatment. For example, community engagement was positively associated with access to an HIV provider (Coef. = 0.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.86, p=0.00), while sexual stigma was negatively associated with access to HIV treatment (Coef. =-1.39, 95% CI -1.42 - -1.36, p=0.00). CONCLUSIONS: HIV service access for gay and bisexual men remained obstructed and perhaps became worse during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Community-led research that utilizes novel methodological approaches can be helpful in times of crisis to inform urgently needed tailored responses that can be delivered in real-time.

Minicircle DNA (mcDNA) is an innovative vector more stable than messenger RNA and more efficient in cell transfection and transgene expression than conventional plasmid DNA. This work describes the construction of a parental plasmid (PP) vector encoding the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the use of the Design of Experiments (DoE) to optimize PP recombination into mcDNA vector in an orbital shaker. First, the results revealed that host cells should be grown at 42 C and the Terrific Broth (TB) medium should be replaced by Luria Broth (LB) medium containing 0.01% L-arabinose for the induction step. The antibiotic concentration, the induction time, and the induction temperature were used as DoE inputs to maximize the % of recombined mcDNA. The quadratic model was statistically significant (p-value < 0.05) and presented a non-significant lack of fit (p-value > 0.05) with a suitable coefficient of determination. The optimal point was validated using 1 h of induction, at 30 C, without the presence of antibiotics, obtaining 93.87% of recombined mcDNA. Based on these conditions, the production of mcDNA was then maximized in a mini-bioreactor platform. The most favorable condition obtained in the bioreactor was obtained by applying 60% pO(2) in the fermentation step during 5 h and 30% pO(2) in the induction step, with 0.01% L-arabinose throughout 5 h. The yield of mcDNA-RBD was increased to a concentration of 1.15 g/L, when compared to the orbital shaker studies (16.48 mg/L). These data revealed that the bioreactor application strongly incremented the host biomass yield and simultaneously improved the recombination levels of PP into mcDNA. Altogether, these results contributed to improving mcDNA-RBD biosynthesis to make the scale-up of mcDNA manufacture simpler, cost-effective, and attractive for the biotechnology industry.","output":"Maximization of the Minicircle DNA Vaccine Production Expressing SARS-CoV-2 RBD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of individuals needing hospital admission has sometimes exceeded the availability of hospital beds. Since hospitalization can have detrimental effects on older individuals, preference has been given to younger patients. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of hospitalization for elderly affected by COVID-19. We hypothesized that their mortality decreases when there is greater access to hospitals. METHODS: This study examined 1902 COVID-19 patients consecutively admitted to three large hospitals in Milan, Italy. Overall mortality data for Milan from the same period was retrieved. Based on emergency department (ED) data, both peak and off-peak phases were identified. The percentage of elderly patients admitted to EDs during these two phases were compared by calculating the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of the individuals younger than, versus older than, 80 years. RESULTS: The median age of the patients hospitalized during the peak phase was lower than the median age during the off-peak phase (64 vs. 75 years, respectively; p <0.001). However, while the SMR for the younger patients was lower during the off-peak phase (1.98, 95% CI: 1.72C2.29 versus 1.40, 95% CI: 1.25C1.58, respectively), the SMR was similar between both phases for the elderly patients (2.28, 95% CI: 2.07C2.52 versus 2.48, 95% CI: 2.32C2.65, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Greater access to hospitals during an off-peak phase did not affect the mortality rate of COVID-19-positive elderly patients in Milan. This finding, if confirmed in other settings, should influence future decisions regarding resource management of health care organizations.","output":"Utility of hospitalization for elderly individuals affected by COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The initial investigation by local hospital attributed the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to pneumonia with unknown cause that appeared like the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as public health emergency after it spread outside China to several countries. Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel estimation approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the spread of the disease through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predicted the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths. Our study revealed that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. We found a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship was confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases. The empirical evidence revealed that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by ~0.10%C~1.71% (95% CI). Our empirical results confirmed the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and common factors that facilitates the novel coronavirus attributable deaths caused by increased levels of confirmed cases. Yet, the role of such a medium that facilitates the transmission of COVID-19 remains unclear.

This study was conducted to assess burnout among oncologists and other healthcare professionals at a large academic center. Methods: An electronic 10- minute questionnaire was sent to actively employed physicians, APRNs and PAs at the University of Miami. Survey items evaluated various personal and professional characteristics including COVID related stress. Burnout was examined with Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), which evaluated severity across two domains: emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. The logistic regression model was used to estimate association between study variables and high burnout levels. Odds ratio (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were obtained. Continuous variables were tested using two-sample t-test by high burnout status. Results:The survey was sent to 739 HCWs, out of which 182 (24.6%) completed the entire survey;63.7% were physicians, 8.6% fellows, and 27.4% APRN or PA. The pandemic led to rescheduling of professional activities (22.2%), increased workload (59.5%), job insecurity (28.6%), and decreased leadership opportunities (32.2%). 62.3% of respondents reported decreased exercise;44.8% reported new sleep disorder;56.1% reported increased home responsibilities;childcare arrangements were affected in 60.6%;61.4% struggled to maintain work-life balance. 70 of 182 respondents were broadly from the fields of Oncology and Palliative Care. 9 out of these 70 respondents reported high depersonalization, 27 reported high emotional exhaustion, and 33 reported overall high burnout symptoms on either emotional exhaustion or depersonalization scales. Amongst physicians holding positions from PGY4 through licensed attendings with less than 5 years' experience, 62.5% (95%CI=35.4-84.8) showed high burnout rate (10 of 16), which was not statistically different from older physicians (11 of 27=40.7% (95%CI=22.4-61.2)). No difference in burnout was seen for other study variables including gender, marital status, and race/ethnicity. Conclusions: COVID-19 pandemic has incited not only an unmatched level of practice changes, but also extraordinary psycho-social uncertainty, leading to a considerable impact on HCWs' wellbeing. Long working hours, lack of sleep, fear of losing job, transition to tele-medicine, risk of getting infection and putting their family at risk, lack of childcare, pressure of home schoolingall seem to have caused an increased physical and psychological pressure among HCWs and warrants an examination of potential coping mechanisms.

Population-level dynamics of COVID-19 can generally be described using a set of ordinary differential equations, but these deterministic equations are insufficient for modeling the observed case rates, which can vary due to local testing and case reporting policies and non-homogeneous behavior among individuals. To assess the impact of population mobility on the spread of COVID-19, we have developed a novel Bayesian time-varying coefficient state-space model for infectious disease transmission. The foundation of this model is a time-varying coefficient compartment model to recapitulate the dynamics among susceptible, exposed, undetected infectious, detected infectious, undetected removed, detected non-infectious, detected recovered, and detected deceased individuals. The infectiousness and detection parameters are modeled to vary by time, and the infectiousness component in the model incorporates information on multiple sources of population mobility. Along with this compartment model, a multiplicative process model is introduced to allow for deviation from the deterministic dynamics. We apply this model to observed COVID-19 cases and deaths in several US states and Colorado counties. We find that population mobility measures are highly correlated with transmission rates and can explain complicated temporal variation in infectiousness in these regions. Additionally, the inferred connections between mobility and epidemiological parameters, varying across locations, have revealed the heterogeneous effects of different policies on the dynamics of COVID-19.","output":"Tracking the Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19 with a Time-Varying Coefficient State-Space Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The second and third trimesters of pregnancy are crucial for the anatomical and functional development of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

METHODS: To determine whether an additional NGR sequence could improve endothelial homing and biologic activity, human endostatin was modified genetically to introduce an NGR motif (NGR\\\\endostatin) and was expressed in yeast. In vitro biologic activity of NGR\\\\endostatin was compared with the native protein in endothelial cell proliferation and migration. NGR\\\\modified endostatin was used in tumor localization studies. Finally, the effects of endostatin and NGR\\\\endostatin on tumor growth were determined in two model systems. RESULTS: Human endostatin has an internal NGR sequence, which is not accessible to bind APN. However, the addition of an NGR\\\\sequence at the amino terminus resulted in strong binding and inhibition of endothelial cell APN. NGR\\\\endostatin showed increased binding to endothelial cells compared with the native protein. Increased binding of endostatin also coincided with improved antiangiogenic properties of endostatin. NGR modification improved tumor localization and, as a consequence, effectively inhibited ovarian carcinoma growth in athymic nude mice. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrated that human endostatin can be modified genetically to improve its ability to inhibit tumor growth.

It has been suggested that socially meaningful online gaming bufered emotional distress during the lockdown. This study aimed to test the protective effect of online gaming during the lockdown and to investigate the diferences between highly involved gamers (those who play videogames intensely without adverse consequences) and problematic gamers in this regard. METHOD: Capitalizing on a data collection that started before the pandemic, we adopted a cross-sectional between-groups study design in which gaming patterns, gaming-related variables and levels of emotional distress were compared between a pre-COVID group (N=298) and a COVID group (N=366). RESULTS: Compared to the pre-COVID group, high involvement in gaming was more prominent and emotional distress was decreased in the COVID group. Moderated regression analyses further revealed that the interaction between social compensation via gaming and highly involved gaming was associated with lower levels of emotional distress in the COVID-19 group. In contrast, the interaction between gaming-related relaxation and problematic gaming predicted higher emotional distress in the COVID-19 group. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that gaming for social compensation might mitigate the experienced emotional distress during pandemic related self-isolation, whereas maladaptive gaming patterns could constitute a vulnerability factor deserving clinical attention.","output":"Online Gaming and Prolonged Self-Isolation: Evidence from Italian Gamers During the Covid-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Smart devices, nowadays, are inspiring the infinite vitality and possibilities of intelligent life, such as self-power electromagnetic (EM) nanogenerator and microsensor, smart window, thermally-driven EM absorber, interstellar energy deliverer, and so on.

DesignA cross-sectional study. SettingCOVID-19 daily case and death data from the initial case through 29 November 2020. Participants46 countries comprising the WHO African region. Main outcome measuresWe used five pandemic response indicators for each country: speed at which the pandemic reached the country, speed at which the first 50 cases accumulated, maximum monthly attack rate, cumulative attack rate, and crude case fatality ratio (CFR). We studied the effect of 13 predictor variables on the country-level variation in them using a principal component analysis, followed by regression. ResultsCountries with higher tourism activities, GDP per capita, and proportion of older people had higher monthly (p < 0.001) and cumulative attack rates (p < 0.001) and lower CFRs (p = 0.052). Countries having more stringent early COVID-19 response policies experienced greater delay in arrival of the first case (p < 0.001). The speed at which the first 50 cases occurred was slower in countries whose neighbors had higher cumulative attack rates (p = 0.06). ConclusionsWhile global connectivity and tourism could facilitate the spread of airborne infectious agents, the observed differences in attack rates between African countries might also be due to differences in testing capacities or age distribution. Wealthy countries managed to minimize adverse outcomes. Further, careful and early implementation of strict government policies, such as restricting tourism, could be pivotal to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidently, good quality data and sufficient testing capacities are essential to unravel the epidemiology of an outbreak.

Its numerous mutated residues containing key sites on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) undoubtedly pose new challenges for epidemic control. Although the preventive measures are becoming more sophisticated, the effects of mutations on the binding of the virus to the receptor protein remain to be elucidated. Here, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the differences in the binding mode between the Omicron variant and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) compared to the wild-type strain (WT). Multi-point mutations in the Omicron variant RBD could cause the conformation shift in the large Loop (where T478K and E484A are located), which makes it easier to wrap the N-terminal helix of ACE2 and form tighter contacts. The stronger electrostatic interaction was the main reason for its enhanced binding affinity as compared to WT. This was due to the large number of positively charged patches (N440K, T478K, Q493R, Q498R, and Y505H) formed by the substitution of neutral amino acids at multiple sites. The appearance of these highly polar hydrophilic amino acids may cause local perturbations and affect the electrostatic complementarity of RBD with the ACE2, and further mediate conformational changes. Thus, a more extensive interaction network was found in the mutation system and the complex interaction cluster was formed near E37@ACE2, which was essential for the stable binding of the two. In addition, we speculated that these mutations may affect the electrostatic complementarity with the four potential antibodies to reduce the sensitivity of the virus to antibodies. This study reveals the key details of the Omicron variant binding to ACE2 and provides important theoretical views for the enhanced infectivity of this variant.

We sought to understand the performance of a modified version of this score (mPRIEST) in our institution for identifying patients with a greater than minimal risk for adverse outcome (death or organ support) at 30 days after index visit. METHODS: Consecutive visits at two northern Manhattan EDs with a new diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 were identified between November and December of 2020. Demographic variables and clinical characteristics were obtained from chart review. Outcomes were obtained from chart review and follow-up phone call. RESULTS: Outcomes were available on 306 patients. The incidence of death or mechanical ventilation at 30 days for patients in patients with mPRIEST above the threshold value was 43/181 (23.8%), and for patients below 1/125 (0.8%). The sensitivity of the score for adverse outcome was 97.7% (95% CI: 93.3% to 100%).

An RTA exposed group of 210 dogs was evaluated within 24 hours of the trauma. Their data were compared with data from a matched group of dogs with other diagnoses. UCCR was positively correlated with the trauma severity and was higher in the exposed group than in the nonexposed group (median 101.500 vs. 21.02; p < 0.0001). tT4 values were statistically similar between the two groups, but were correlated with a trauma score, while TSH (median = 0.050 vs. 0.080 ng/mL; p < 0.0001) and fT4 (median = 15.850 vs. 17.950 pmol/L; p = 0.0037) were significantly lower for the exposed group.

It has been reported in ocular infections including those of patients using contact lenses. Treatment is difficult because Acinetobacter is frequently multidrug resistant. Antibiotic-resistant strains frequently also harbor genes for antiseptic resistance (quaternary ammonium compound [QAC]) genes. Because Acinetobacter is part of the normal flora, it may contaminate contact lens and accessories. This study aims to investigate carriage rates of QAC genes in household and clinical isolates of Acinetobacter and to determine the effectiveness of two multipurpose solutions (MPSs) for soft lenses against organisms carrying QAC genes. METHODS DNA was extracted from 11 bathroom isolates and 15 clinical isolates and amplified by polymerase chain reaction to determine the presence of qacE1. Gene-positive and gene-negative control strains were used to challenge the two MPSs, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of these organisms to benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate were determined. RESULTS More than 90% of isolates carried qacE1. The MICs of clinical isolates were higher than those of isolates of bathrooms. Both MPSs were able to produce a 3-log reduction in the numbers of all isolates. CONCLUSIONS Although most isolates carried qacE1 and elevated MICs to benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate were observed, all were susceptible to both MPSs tested.

They can be divided into agents with relatively broad, non-targeted specificity and targeted drugs developed on the basis of a more refined understanding of individual cancers and directed at specific molecular targets on different cancer cells. Individual drugs in both groups have been classified on the basis of their mechanism of action in killing cancer cells. The targeted drugs include proteasome inhibitors, toxic chimeric proteins and signal transduction inhibitors such as tyrosine kinase (non-receptor and receptor), serine/threonine kinase, histone deacetylase and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. Increasingly used targeted vascular (VEGF) and platelet-derived endothelial growth factor blockade can provoke a range of pathological consequences. Many of the non-targeted drugs are cytotoxic, suppressing haematopoiesis as well as provoking cutaneous eruptions and vascular, lung and liver injury. Cytotoxic side effects of the targeted drugs occur less often and usually with less severity, but they show their own unusual adverse effects including, for example, a lengthened QT interval, a characteristic papulopustular rash, nail disorders and a handCfoot skin reaction variant. The term hypersensitivity is widely used across a number of disciplines but not always with the same definition in mind, and the terminology needs to be standardised. This is particularly apparent in cancer chemotherapy where anti-neoplastic drug-induced thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anaemia, vascular disorders, liver injury and lung disease as well as many dermatological manifestations sometimes have an immune basis.

METHODS The analysis included consecutive patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis treated from 2017 to 2020 with TC-TAVI or TA-TAVI in two high-volume TAVI centers. The approach was selected by multidisciplinary heart teams after analyzing multislice computed tomography of the heart, aorta and peripheral arteries, transthoracic echocardiography and coronary angiography. RESULTS One hundred and two patients were treated with alternative TAVI accesses (TC; n = 49 and TA; n = 53) in our centers. The groups were similar regarding age, gender, New York Heart Association class, and echocardiography parameters. Patients treated with TC-TAVI had significantly higher surgical risk. The procedural success rate was similar in both groups (TC-TAVI 98%; TA-TAVI 98.1%; p = 0.95). The rate of Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 defined clinical events was low in both groups. The percentage of new-onset rhythm disturbances and permanent pacemaker implantation was similar in TC and TA TAVI (4.1% vs. 11.3%; p = 0.17 and 10.2% vs. 5.7%; p = 0.39, respectively). In the TA-TAVI group, significantly more cases of pneumonia and blood transfusions were observed (11% vs. 0%; p = 0.01 and 30.2% vs. 12.2%; p = 0.03). The 30-day mortality was similar in TC and TA groups (4.1% vs. 5.7%; p = 0.71, respectively). CONCLUSION Both TC and TA TAVI are safe procedures in appropriately selected patients and are associated with a low risk of complications.","output":"Comparison of transcarotid versus transapical transcatheter aortic valve implantation outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis and contraindications for transfemoral access."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To identify factors contributing to disproportionate rates of COVID-19 among Hispanic or Latino persons in Prince William Health District, Virginia, and to identify measures to better engage Hispanic and Latino communities in COVID-19 mitigation.

While many infectious causes of diarrhea have been established, approximately 40% of all diarrhea cases are of unknown etiology. In an effort to identify novel viruses that may be causal agents of diarrhea, we used high throughput mass sequencing to analyze stool samples collected from patients with acute diarrhea. RESULTS: Sequences with limited similarity to known picornaviruses were detected in a stool sample collected in Australia from a child with acute diarrhea. Using a combination of mass sequencing, RT-PCR, 5' RACE and 3' RACE, a 6383 bp fragment of the viral genome was sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that this virus was highly divergent from, but most closely related to, members of the genus Kobuvirus. We have tentatively named this novel virus klassevirus 1. We also detected klassevirus 1 by RT-PCR in a diarrhea specimen collected from a patient in St. Louis, United States as well as in untreated sewage collected in Barcelona, Spain.

METHODS: We conducted an open-label study of sarilumab in severe COVID-19 pneumonia (PaO(2)/FiO(2) <300 mm Hg) with hyperinflammation (elevated inflammatory markers and serum IL-6 levels). Sarilumab 400 mg was administered intravenously in addition to standard of care and results were compared with contemporary matched patients treated with standard of care alone. Clinical improvement, mortality, safety and predictors of response were assessed at 28 days. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were treated with sarilumab and 28 contemporary patients receiving standard of care alone were used as controls. At day 28 of follow-up, 61% of patients treated with sarilumab experienced clinical improvement and 7% died. These findings were not significantly different from the comparison group (clinical improvement 64%, mortality 18%; p=NS). Baseline PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio >100 mm Hg and lung consolidation <17% at CT scan predicted clinical improvement in patients treated with sarilumab.

The authors investigated the width of the harvested anterolateral thigh flap allowing primary closure of the donor site. METHODS Sixty-five consecutive patients undergoing reconstructive procedures using anterolateral thigh flaps were divided into two groups: group A, primary closure of the donor site; and group B, donor site covered with split-thickness skin graft. Maximum flap width and thigh circumference were measured at the midpoint of the line connecting the lateral superior margin of the patella and the anterior superior iliac spine. The maximum flap width-to-thigh circumference ratio was calculated. Patients' body mass index and age were recorded. The outcome was evaluated by the surgeon. RESULTS Primary closure of the donor site was possible in 56 patients (86 percent), and in nine patients (14 percent) a split-thickness skin graft was necessary. All of the donor sites were closed primarily when the flap width was less than 16 percent of the thigh circumference. There was a significant correlation between body mass index and the ratio (p<0.001, r=-0.573) and between patient age and the ratio (p=0.033, r=0.267). Muscle herniation was significantly higher in group B (p=0.029). CONCLUSIONS The flap width-to-thigh circumference ratio is a reliable parameter for preoperative planning of primary closure of the anterolateral thigh flap donor site. Primary closure can be achieved if the flap width-to-thigh circumference ratio is less than 16 percent.

A prompt diagnosis is necessary to treat Cushings syndrome as early as possible. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a clinical model for the estimation of pre-test probability of hypercortisolism in an at-risk population. DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective multicenter case-control study, involving five Italian referral centers for Endocrinology (Turin, Messina, Naples, Padua and Rome). One hundred and fifty patients affected by Cushings syndrome and 300 patients in which hypercortisolism was excluded were enrolled. All patients were evaluated, according to current guidelines, for the suspicion of hypercortisolism. RESULTS: The Cushing score was built by multivariable logistic regression, considering all main features associated with a clinical suspicion of hypercortisolism as possible predictors. A stepwise backward selection algorithm was used (final model AUC=0.873), then an internal validation was performed through ten-fold cross-validation. Final estimation of the model performance showed an average AUC=0.841, thus reassuring about a small overfitting effect. The retrieved score was structured on a 17.5-point scale: low-risk class (score value: 5.5, probability of disease=0.8%); intermediate-low-risk class (score value: 6-8.5, probability of disease=2.7%); intermediate-high-risk class (score value: 9-11.5, probability of disease=18.5%) and finally, high-risk class (score value: 12, probability of disease=72.5%).

This study aimed to quantify the extent of state-level policy uptake and the potential number of people with SUD affected by these policy changes across the U.S., as well as to assess if policy uptake correlated with rates of people with SUD already in treatment or needing treatment. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of policies implemented as of April 13, 2020 SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia MEASUREMENTS: State-level implementation of: oral schedule II controlled substances emergency prescription, extended take-home doses for medication for opioid use disorders (MOUD), home-delivery of take-home medications, telemedicine for schedule II-IV prescriptions, telemedicine for buprenorphine prescribing initiation, and waiver of out-of-state DEA registration. Rates per 100,000 population of: adults in treatment for SUD, MOUD treatment at facilities with opioid treatment programs, SUD based on DSM-IV criteria, and needing but not receiving treatment. FINDINGS: Half of states (n=24) enacted no policies, leaving approximately 460,955 people in treatment and 114,370 people on MOUD pre-pandemic uncovered by any policy expansion. Only telemedicine for buprenorphine initiation was marginally associated with pre-pandemic rate of SUD treatment (odds ratio (OR)=1.003, 95% confidence interval (CI)=(1.001, 1.006)) and rate of MOUD therapy (OR=1.006, 95% CI=(1.002, 1.011)) in univariable analysis, but these associations were no longer significant when controlling for state-level demographics.

Here, according to the immune-escape capability and evolutionary convergence, the representative SARS-CoV-2 strains carrying the hotspot mutations were selected. Then, guided by structural and computational analyses, we present a mutation-integrated trimeric form of spike receptor-binding domain (mutI-tri-RBD) as a broadly protective vaccine candidate, which combined heterologous RBDs from different representative strains into a hybrid immunogen and integrated immune-escape hotspots into a single antigen. When compared with a homo-tri-RBD vaccine candidate in the stage of phase II trial, of which all three RBDs are derived from the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain, mutI-tri-RBD induced significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against the Delta and Beta variants, and maintained a similar immune response against the prototype strain. Pseudo-virus neutralization assay demonstrated that mutI-tri-RBD also induced broadly strong neutralizing activities against all tested 23 SARS-CoV-2 variants. The in vivo protective capability of mutI-tri-RBD was further validated in hACE2-transgenic mice challenged by the live virus, and the results showed that mutI-tri-RBD provided potent protection not only against the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain but also against the Delta and Beta variants.","output":"Design of a mutation-integrated trimeric RBD with broad protection against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Evidence has emerged showing potential benefit of Remdesivir and dexamethasone in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but results from large randomized control trials are conflicting. While initial data for dexamethasone indicated a mortality benefit, the impact of Remdesivir was best demonstrated in decreased time to recovery. Despite extensive disease burden throughout the world efficacy data of individual interventions is lacking in part due to extensive concurrent use of confounding investigational therapeutics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the impact of Remdesivir and dexamethasone on real-world outcomes in severe COVID-19. All patients admitted to our community hospital between March 2020 and December 31, 2020 were included, and all patients admitted before national guidelines endorsed Remdesivir and dexamethasone outside of clinical trials were treated with only supportive care and used as historical controls. No other investigational therapeutics were utilized. This study was reviewed and approved by the Fort Belvoir Community Hospital IRB. RESULTS: 58 hospitalized patients met criteria for severe COVID-19 as confirmed by RT-PCR, and 14 (25%) were used as historical controls. Baseline demographics and overall mortality rate (7.1%) did not significantly differ between the groups. The median length of stay was 7 days and 6 days in the historical control group and interventional group, respectively (P = 0.55). CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe an appreciable impact on the duration of hospitalization when Remdesivir and dexamethasone were added to supportive care in a community hospital.

The economy has been suffering due to the strategic lockdown adopted by the local administrative bodies, and in most of the countries, it is further leading to a major wave of unemployment with millions of job and business losses affecting the hotels, travel and tourism industry widely. To attain a sustainable business in the post-pandemic situations, the industry now must think of information system approaches to convince tourists to feel safe with the most hygienic hospitality and services to be offered in any property. The key aspect of the study is to provide the impact of new-age AI-driven technology solutions that will dominate the future direction of the modernized hospitality industry promising robust health-safety measures in a hotel, and further help create sustainable business and leisure travel facilities to cope with post-epidemic scenarios. Design/methodology/approach: The study emphasizes to provide a robust technology-oriented framework based on a mixed research method that would help hotels to adopt and implement new-age AI-driven solution within the hotel premise to serve customers with at most hygiene, contactless service and thereafter, aiming for faster recovery of businesses and regaining customer trust to fuel booking intent in the post-epidemic scenario. Findings: The paper provides a technology-focused solution that would impact hotel industries' post-pandemic scenario. The study contributes to helping boost the tourism industry using information management solutions such as biosensors, robotic room services and contactless hosting. The findings show the adoption of robots/RPA solutions and Biosensors by the industry will be a disruptive paradigm shift.

In this paper we examine Disability Living Allowance (DLA), a non means-tested contribution towards disability-related living costs for disabled people aged less than sixty-five. METHOD: ology: Three census-based measures of self-reported health (number of chronic physical disabilities; activity limitation (a little; a lot); and chronic poor mental health) were linked to contemporaneous DLA records. The 2011 Census returns provided individual demographic, socio-economic, social and area-level characteristics. DLA uptake was modelled using logistic regression, stratified into 0-15 and 16-64 year old age groups. RESULTS: Overall, 118329 (8.4%) of this population received DLA. Poor health outcomes were the main determinants for uptake, which was higher amongst females, those non-married and those of lower socio-economic status: for example those with no qualifications compared against third level education (ORad = 1.80: 95%CI = 1.75-1.85); and those social renting compared against those in more expensive owner occupation (ORadj = 1.92: 1.83-2.02). Uptake was lower amongst Protestants than Catholics (ORadj = 0.75: 0.74-0.77) and amongst immigrants (ORadj = 0.36: 0.34-0.39) and slightly lower in rural communities.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the impact of initial government policies on this vulnerable older population between the UK and Australia during the first wave of attack. METHODS: We searched websites of governments in the UK and Australia and media outlets. We examined the key policies including the national lockdown dates and the distribution of some important resources (personal protective equipment and testing) and the effects of these initial policies on the mortality rates in the aged care homes during the first wave of attack of COVID-19. RESULTS: We found that both countries had prioritized resources to hospitals over aged care homes during the first wave of attack. Both countries had lower priority for aged care residents in hospitals (e.g. discharging without testing for COVID-19 or discouraging admissions). However, deaths in aged care homes were 270 times higher in the UK than in Australia as on 7 May 2020 (despite UK having a population only 2.5 times larger than Australia). The lower fatality rate in Australia may have been due to the earlier lockdown strategy when the total daily cases were low in Australia (118) compared to the UK (over 1000), as well as the better community viral testing regime in Australia. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the public health policy in Australia aimed towards earlier intervention with earlier national lockdown and more viral testing to prevent new cases. This primary prevention could have resulted in more lives being saved. In contrast, the initial policy in the UK focussed mainly on protecting resources for hospitals, and there was a delay in national lockdown intervention and lower viral testing rate, resulting in more lives lost in the aged care sector.","output":"COVID-19 in aged care homes: a comparison of effects initial government policies had in the UK (primarily focussing on England) and Australia during the first wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 global pandemic is in many ways unchartered mental health territory, but history would suggest that long-term resilience will be the most common outcome, even for those most directly impacted by the outbreak.

Despite widespread agreement that Irelands response was rapid and effective, the countrys journey through the pandemic has been no easy ride. In order to contain the virus, the Governments emergency legislation imposed draconian measures including the detention and isolation of people deemed to be even a potential source of infection and a significant extension of An Garda Sochnas power of arrest. In April 2020, journalists John Waters and Gemma ODoherty initiated judicial review proceedings before the High Court to challenge such legislation, which they defined as unconstitutional, disproportionate and based on fraudulent science. The proceedings attracted widespread media coverage in what soon became a debate on the legitimacy of emergency legislation and the notion of fake news itself. After a brief survey of the legislative background to Irelands Covid response, the argumentative strategy is analysed through which the High Court eventually dismissed Mr Waters and Ms ODohertys challenge. Focusing on the process of justification of the judicial decision, the paper provides a descriptive account of the argument structure of the Courts decision. This sheds light on the pattern of multiple argumentation through which the Court interpreted relevant norms in the Constitution and at once re-established the primacy of facts informing political decision-making at a time of national emergency.","output":"The Irish Public Discourse on Covid-19 at the Intersection of Legislation, Fake News and Judicial Argumentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The introduction of non-vitamin K antagonists oral anticoagulants, a class of medicines which includes dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban, has resulted in improvements in the safety and efficacy of non valvular atrial fibrillation treatment for stroke prevention, with significant reductions in stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, and mortality.

Although limited in numbers, case-based evaluations indicate that favipiravir might not be a major teratogen in human pregnancies. This study aimed to present and analyze the outcomes of favipiravir exposure during pregnancy. METHODS In this case series, the outcomes of nine pregnancies that were referred to the Teratology Information Service of Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Pharmacology between 01 April 2020 and 30 November 2021 were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS One spontaneous abortion, two elective terminations, one preterm live delivery and five term live deliveries were detected. The premature newborn was reported dead on the 5th day of neonatal intensive care unit admission. Physiological jaundice and transient respiratory distress were recorded in two term infants. One term infant was antenatally diagnosed with renal pelviectasis, but the findings resolved postnatally without requiring intervention.

To provide a snapshot, in real time, as to how therapists experience the transition to online therapy, we surveyed 166 Israeli couples' therapists during April 2020, when lockdown orders prevented therapists from seeing couples face-to-face. A few weeks later, when the stay-at-home policy was lifted, a subsample (N = 60) of these therapists completed a follow-up assessment. The results suggest that couples therapists had limited experience using the online modality prior to COVID. The therapists reported experiencing online couples' therapy as somewhat successful and that their experience of providing therapy during the COVID-19 crisis had an overall positive impact on their attitudes toward online work. Establishing a strong therapeutic bond with both partners, dealing with escalating conflict, and treatment dropout were identified as the issues of most concern when conducting online couples therapy.

METHODS: 100 participants (79 female, 86% Hispanic/Latino [predominantly Mexican], age 546 [120] years) stratified into (i) at risk of T2D, (ii) with pre-diabetes (pre-T2D), and (iii) with non-insulin treated T2D, wore blinded CGMs for 2 weeks. Beyond standardized CGM measures (average glucose, glucose variability, time in 70C140 mg/dL and 70C180 mg/dL ranges), we also examined additional CGM measures based on the time of day. FINDINGS: Standardized CGM measures were significantly different for participants with T2D compared to at-risk and pre-T2D participants (p<00001). In addition, pre-T2D participants spent more time between 140 and 180 mg/dL during the day than at-risk participants (p<001).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 190 PTC patients who underwent thyroid lobectomy from January 2017 to December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinicopathological characteristics and follow-up data were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with postoperative hypothyroidism and the recovery of thyroid function. RESULTS: In summary, 74.21% of patients (141/190) had normal thyroid function without levothyroxine supplementation, while 40.53% (77/190) developed temporary or permanent hypothyroidism. Multivariate analysis indicated that higher preoperative thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (>2.62 mIU/L), Hashimotos thyroiditis (HT), and right lobectomy were associated with hypothyroidism (all P<0.05). The Area Under Curve (AUC) by logistic analysis was 0.829.

A significant decrease was also observed in peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets and it was related to onset of SARS. A number of potential mechanisms may be involved. The development of auto-immune antibodies or immune complexes triggered by viral infection may play a major role in inducing lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Moreover, SARS-CoV may also directly infect hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells via CD13 or CD66a inducing their growth inhibition and apoptosis. The receptor for group I and III CoV is aminopeptidase N (CD13). CD13 has been identified in human bone marrow CD34+ cells, platelets, megakaryocytes, myeloid cells, and erythroid cells, but not in lymphocytes. The common receptor for group II CoV is CEACAM1a (CD66a). CD66a is an adhesion molecule expressed on bone marrow CD34+ cells, platelets, granulocytes and activated lymphocytes. In addition, glucocorticoids could induce lymphopenia and the use of steroids may account for the decrease of lymphocytes in some SARS patients.

However, pregnant people were not included in any of the COVID-19 vaccine trials that regulatory agencies evaluated when considering authorization. Without pregnancy-specific data, pregnant frontline workers in some settings are being denied COVID-19 vaccines. In other settings, pregnant frontline workers are able to access these same vaccines, but are faced with the burden of decision-making in the absence of an explicit recommendation for use and without pregnancy-specific data. While permissive recommendations for use in pregnancy are ethically preferable to unjustly denying vaccine access, objectives to protect the frontline workforce will fall short until there is evidence to support explicit recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy. In this article, we provide three actionable recommendations to ensure equitable protection of pregnant frontline workers as vaccines against COVID-19 continue to be developed and rolled out globally. First, efforts must be taken now to leverage critical opportunities for narrowing the evidence gaps around currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy. Next, action in the near term is needed to preempt evidence gaps for COVID-19 vaccines still in development. Finally, in the absence of an explicit recommendation for use in pregnancy, and while pregnancy-specific data lags behind, pregnant people should be prioritized for alternate preventive and treatment measures. Achieving equitable protection for those who are pregnant and serving on the frontlines of the pandemic will require no less.","output":"Global equity in protection of pregnant frontline workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oesophagogastric (OG) cancer is a highly lethal disease requiring novel treatment options. c-MYC and/or HER-2 amplified oesophageal cancer models have demonstrated sensitivity to BTK inhibition with ibrutinib.

The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints were disease control rate (DC) at 8 weeks, safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Eleven patients were enrolled. Eight patients had c-MYC amplified tumours, six were HER2 amplified and three were c-MYC and HER2 co-amplified. Grade  3 adverse events were fever, neutropenia, and vomiting. Grade  3 gastrointestinal haemorrhage occurred in three patients and was fatal in two cases. Among seven evaluable patients, three patients (43%) achieved a best response of SD at 8 weeks. No PR or CR was observed. Disease control was achieved for 32 weeks in one patient with a dual c-MYC and HER2 highly co-amplified tumour. The median PFS and OS were 1.5 (95% CI: 0.8C5.1) and 5.1 (95% CI: 0.8C14.5) months, respectively. Ibrutinib had limited clinical efficacy in patients with c-MYC and/or HER2 amplified OG cancer.

METHODS: C57BL/6 mice of 8-week-old were used and CNV was induced with 577 nm laser photocoagulation. Animals were randomly divided into groups and different doses of HXMM were administered daily. One, four, and eight weeks after the intervention, the electroretinogram (ERG), fundus fluorescence angiography, choroidal flat mount and immunofluorescence staining were preformed to evaluate the function and CNV formation. The expression levels of angiogenic proteins were determined by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. An analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to test the differences among the groups. RESULTS: The results showed that HXMM effectively increased amplitude of ERG of mice (P<0.05), alleviated fundus CNV leakage (P<0.05), and reduced the area of neovascularization and the expression of angiogenic proteins (P<0.05) after laser-induced CNV.

To control emerging viruses, existing successful anti(retro)viral therapies can inspire antiviral strategies, as conserved viral enzymes (eg., viral proteases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) represent targets of choice. Since 2003, much effort has been expended in the characterization of the SARS-CoV replication/transcription machinery. Until recently, a pure and highly active preparation of SARS-CoV recombinant RNA synthesis machinery was not available, impeding target-based high throughput screening of drug candidates against this viral family. The current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic revealed a new pathogen whose RNA synthesis machinery is highly (>96 % aa identity) homologous to SARS-CoV. This phylogenetic relatedness highlights the potential use of conserved replication enzymes to discover inhibitors against this significant pathogen, which in turn, contributes to scientific preparedness against emerging viruses. Here, we report the use of a purified and highly active SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex (RTC) to set-up a high-throughput screening of Coronavirus RNA synthesis inhibitors. The screening of a small (1520 compounds) chemical library of FDA-approved drugs demonstrates the robustness of our assay and will allow to speed-up drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2.","output":"A fluorescence-based high throughput-screening assay for the SARS-CoV RNA synthesis complex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the capacitive proximity sensing method, arranging multiple sensing electrodes makes it possible to obtain the three-dimensional position of a nearby object.

During January - July 2020, there were two clusters infections in Beijing, China. This study was to analyze the features of the two COVID-19 infections in Beijing. Methods: : In this retrospective single-center study, 89 cases with the positive novel coronavirus nucleic acid test were collected from January to July 2020 in Beijing. They were divided into January-March group and June-July group. Two groups of data were compared. Results: : The eighty-nine cases, 47 males and 42 females, mean age (4114 years), were used for our study. The most common symptoms were fever (46/89, 52%) and cough (34/89, 38%). The clinical classification were moderate type (56/89,63%), mild type (24/89, 27%), severe type (4/89, 4%), critical type (0), respectively. Ground glass opacity (GGO) (47%) was the majority CT pattern. The frequency of involvement of lower lobe was higher than that of upper lobe ( P 0.01). In January - March group, there were 5 patients (18%) exposure to Wuhan, 15 patients (54%) family clusters, 5 patients (18%) colleague clusters, 3 patients (11%) imported cases. In June-July group, 41 patients (68%) had an exposure to Xinfadi market of Beijing, 6 patients (10%) family clusters, and 14 patients (23%) colleague clusters. The number of patients with fever, cough, chest CT severity score and the number of lesion lung lobes in January-March group was higher than that in June-July group ( P 0.05). Conclusions: : Two COVID-19 clusters were dominated moderate and mild type, but few severe types. Patients in June-July group had less symptoms, imaging and family clusters than that in January-March group. This suggested that closely monitoring, early quarantined, nucleic acid test of COVID-19 and chest CT were important measures to prevent epidemic.","output":"Clinical and Imaging Characteristics of Two COVID-19 Cluster Infections in Beijing, China: A Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced not only rapid changes in how clinical care and educational programs are delivered but also challenged academic medical centers (AMCs) like never before.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether there is a difference in degree of inflammation, hypermetabolism, endocrine and acute-phase response, and clinical outcome between pediatric patients with scald and flame burns. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Children with burns requiring surgical intervention were enrolled in this cohort study and divided into two groups, scald or flame burn. In a second assignment, we analyzed the study populations in representative subgroups containing individuals with third-degree burns of 40% to 60% total body surface area. We determined clinical outcomes, resting energy expenditures, cytokine profiles, acute-phase proteins, constitutive proteins, and hormone panels. Statistical analysis was evaluated by analysis of variance, Student's t test corrected with the Bonferroni post hoc test, and the propensity score. Statistical significance was set at p < .05. A total of 912 patients were identified. Six hundred seventy-four had a flame burn and 238 had a scald burn. There was a significant difference (p < .05) in burn size (flame, 48%  23%; scald, 40%  21%), third-degree burn (flame, 39%  27%; scald 22%  25%), age (flame, 8  5 yrs; scald, 3  3 yrs), and mortality between groups. Propensity analysis confirmed the type of burn as a significant risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Subanalysis conducted in a representative patient group suffering from 40% to 60% burn total body surface area revealed that flame burns lead to significantly increased hypermetabolic, inflammatory, and acute-phase responses when compared to scald burns (p < .05). The frequency of sepsis was 3% in the scald burn group, while it was 14% in the flame group (p < .001). Multiorgan failure occurred in 14% of the scald patients, while it occurred in 17% of flame patients.

Most human populations spend the majority of their time indoors and the COVID-19 pandemic has likely exacerbated this behavior. While significant amounts of research have focused on outdoor air quality, to date there have been no studies that examined simultaneous long-term trends on indoor and outdoor air quality on a site using research-grade sensors. We measured fine particulate matter (PM2.5) for a year using sensors located on the rooftop, air handling room, and indoor office space in a building and captured the impacts of three types of regularly occurring elevated pollution events: wintertime atmospheric inversions, wildfires, and fireworks. The events had different magnitudes and durations, and infiltration rates varied for each event leading to dissimilar indoor air pollution levels. The building's air handling unit and different environmental conditions (lower indoor humidity and temperature during the winter) combined to reduce indoor pollution from inversion events however, particulate matter from wildfires and fireworks infiltrated at higher rates. Together, this suggests possible intervention strategies, such as ventilation rates and filter upgrades, that could be used to mitigate contaminant intrusion during elevated pollution events. This year-long study illustrates an array of ways that elevated pollution events interact with the protective effects that buildings have against air pollution for its occupants.

Whilst unpleasant experience of care during childbirth will halt this achievement and have adverse consequences. We examined the experience of women regarding the care received during childbirth in health institutions in Nepal. METHOD: A prospective cohort study conducted in 11 hospitals in Nepal for a period of 18 months. Using a semi-structured questionnaire based on the typology of mistreatment during childbirth, information on childbirth experience was gathered from women (n = 62,926) at the time of discharge. Using those variables, principal component analysis was conducted to create a single mistreatment index. Bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the association of the mistreatment index with sociodemographic, obstetric and newborn characteristics. RESULT: A total of 62,926 women were consented and enrolled in the study. Of those women, 84.3% had no opportunity to discuss any concerns, 80.4% were not adequately informed before providing care, and 1.5% of them were refused for care due to inability to pay. According to multivariate regression analysis, women 35 years or older (, ? 0.3587; p-value, 0.000) or 30C34 years old (,? 0.38013; p-value, 0.000) were less likely to be mistreated compared to women aged 18 years or younger. Women from a relatively disadvantaged (Dalit) ethnic group were more likely to be mistreated (, 0.29596; p-value, 0.000) compared to a relatively advantaged (Chettri) ethnic group. Newborns who were born preterm (, ? 0.05988; p-value, 0.000) were less likely to be mistreated than those born at term. CONCLUSION: The study reports high rate of some categories of mistreatment of women during childbirth.

The bis-indoles were bactericidal to clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens including MRSA and to the Gram-negative gastroenteric pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Furthermore, the alkaloids were synergistic in combination with conventional antibiotics. Antimicrobial activity of the bis-indole alkaloids was due to rapid disruption and permeabilization of the bacterial cell membrane.

We examine these challenges and propose interventions to protect healthcare workers on the continent, drawing on articles identified on Medline (Pubmed) in a search on 24 March 2020. Global jostling means that supplies of personal protective equipment are limited in Africa. Even low-cost interventions such as facemasks for patients with a cough and water supplies for handwashing may be challenging, as is physical distancing in overcrowded primary health care clinics. Without adequate protection, COVID-19 mortality may be high among healthcare workers and their family in Africa given limited critical care beds and difficulties in transporting ill healthcare workers from rural to urban care centres. Much can be done to protect healthcare workers, however. The continent has learnt invaluable lessons from Ebola and HIV control. HIV counselors and community healthcare workers are key resources, and could promote social distancing and related interventions, dispel myths, support healthcare workers, perform symptom screening and trace contacts. Staff motivation and retention may be enhanced through carefully managed risk allowances or compensation. International support with personnel and protective equipment, especially from China, could turn the pandemics trajectory in Africa around. Telemedicine holds promise as it rationalises human resources and reduces patient contact and thus infection risks. Importantly, healthcare workers, using their authoritative voice, can promote effective COVID-19 policies and prioritization of their safety. Prioritizing healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 testing, hospital beds and targeted research, as well as ensuring that public figures and the population acknowledge the commitment of healthcare workers may help to maintain morale.

Healthcare workers may transmit influenza to patients. OBJECTIVES To identify all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs assessing the effects of vaccinating healthcare workers on the incidence of laboratory-proven influenza, pneumonia, death from pneumonia and admission to hospital for respiratory illness in those aged 60 years or older resident in long-term care institutions (LTCIs). SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1966 to October week 3, 2015), EMBASE (1974 to October 2015) and Web of Science (2006 to October 2015), but Biological Abstracts only from 1969 to March 2013 and Science Citation Index-Expanded from 1974 to March 2013 due to lack of institutional access in 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of influenza vaccination of healthcare workers caring for individuals aged 60 years or older in LTCIs and the incidence of laboratory-proven influenza and its complications (lower respiratory tract infection, or hospitalisation or death due to lower respiratory tract infection) in individuals aged 60 years or older in LTCIs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Effects on dichotomous outcomes were measured as risk differences (RDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE. MAIN RESULTS We identified four cluster-RCTs and one cohort study (n = 12,742) of influenza vaccination for HCWs caring for individuals  60 years in LTCIs. Four cluster RCTs (5896 residents) provided outcome data that addressed the objectives of our review. The studies were comparable in their study populations, intervention and outcome measures. The studies did not report adverse events. The principal sources of bias in the studies related to attrition, lack of blinding, contamination in the control groups and low rates of vaccination coverage in the intervention arms, leading us to downgrade the quality of evidence for all outcomes due to serious risk of bias.Offering influenza vaccination to HCWs based in long term care homes may have little or no effect on the number of residents who develop laboratory-proven influenza compared with those living in care homes where no vaccination is offered (RD 0 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.03), two studies with samples taken from 752 participants; low quality evidence). HCW vaccination probably leads to a reduction in lower respiratory tract infection in residents from 6% to 4% (RD -0.02 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.01), one study of 3400 people; moderate quality evidence). HCW vaccination programmes may have little or no effect on the number of residents admitted to hospital for respiratory illness (RD 0 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.02, one study of 1059 people; low quality evidence). We decided not to combine data on deaths from lower respiratory tract infection (two studies of 4459 people) or all cause deaths (four studies of 8468 people). The direction and size of difference in risk varied between the studies. We are uncertain as to the effect of vaccination on these outcomes due to the very low quality of evidence. Adjusted analyses, which took into account the cluster design, did not differ substantively from the pooled analysis with unadjusted data. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Our review findings have not identified conclusive evidence of benefit of HCW vaccination programmes on specific outcomes of laboratory-proven influenza, its complications (lower respiratory tract infection, hospitalisation or death due to lower respiratory tract illness), or all cause mortality in people over the age of 60 who live in care institutions. This review did not find information on co-interventions with healthcare worker vaccination: hand-washing, face masks, early detection of laboratory-proven influenza, quarantine, avoiding admissions, antivirals and asking healthcare workers with influenza or influenza-like illness (ILI) not to work. This review does not provide reasonable evidence to support the vaccination of healthcare workers to prevent influenza in those aged 60 years or older resident in LTCIs. High quality RCTs are required to avoid the risks of bias in methodology and conduct identified by this review and to test further these interventions in combination.","output":"Influenza vaccination for healthcare workers who care for people aged 60 or older living in long-term care institutions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive T-cell therapy based on chimeric antigen receptors are the spearhead strategies to exploit the immune system to fight cancer.

Although the convolutional neural network (CNN) has been proven to have excellent performance in image segmentation tasks, it is difficult to obtain global information. The lack of global information will seriously affect the accuracy of the segmentation results of the lesion area. In addition, there are visual representation differences between multimodal data of the same patient. These differences will affect the results of the automatic segmentation methods. To solve these problems, we propose a segmentation method suitable for multimodal medical images that can capture global information, named TranSiam. TranSiam is a 2D dual path network that extracts features of different modalities. In each path, we utilize convolution to extract detailed information in low level stage, and design a ICMT block to extract global information in high level stage. ICMT block embeds convolution in the transformer, which can extract global information while retaining spatial and detailed information. Furthermore, we design a novel fusion mechanism based on cross attention and selfattention, called TMM block, which can effectively fuse features between different modalities. On the BraTS 2019 and BraTS 2020 multimodal datasets, we have a significant improvement in accuracy over other popular methods.","output":"TranSiam: Fusing Multimodal Visual Features Using Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Musculoskeletal corticosteroid injection is commonly used as an adjunct to help patients in pain management In this current COVID-19 pandemic, many clinicians would differ from this treatment as steroid is considered an immunosuppressive drug and could risk the patient of developing severe adverse effects if contracting COVID-19 This is a retrospective study based in Sabah, Malaysia, examining the prevalence of COVID-19 infection following musculoskeletal corticosteroid injection from 1 December 2019 until 30 June 2020 in the sports medicine clinic and the orthopedic clinic Patients who received musculoskeletal corticosteroid injection were called by telephone and asked about visits to the emergency department or government health clinic for influenza-like illness symptoms or severe acute respiratory infection that would require screening of COVID-19 Thirty-five patients who responded to the call were included, with mean ages of 47 9 years  15 1 52% were male respondents, while 48% were female 25% of them were diabetics, and 2 9% of them had a history of lymphoproliferative disorders The mean pain score before injection was 6 74  1 03 and after injection pain was 2 27  1 63 In this study, there were 11 4% (n = 4) with minor complications of steroid injection, that is, skin discoloration Nonetheless, there were no severe complications due to corticosteroids reported There were no reported cases of COVID-19 among the respondents following corticosteroid injection Musculoskeletal pain would affect a person's well-being and activities;thus, its management requires that careful consideration with risk-benefit analysis be made before administering musculoskeletal corticosteroid injection during COVID-19 pandemic [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Advances in Orthopedics is the property of Hindawi Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Musculoskeletal Corticosteroid Injection during COVID-19 Pandemic in Sabah: Is It Safe?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: After renovation of the adult intensive care unit (ICU) with installation of ten single rooms, an enhanced infection control program was conducted to control the spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in our hospital. METHODS: Since the ICU renovation, all patients colonized or infected with MRSA were nursed in single rooms with contact precautions. The incidence of MRSA infection in the ICU was monitored during 3 different phases: the baseline period (phase 1); after ICU renovation (phase 2) and after implementation of a hand hygiene campaign with alcohol-based hand rub (phase 3). Patients infected with extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species were chosen as controls because they were managed in open cubicles with standard precautions. RESULTS: Without a major change in bed occupancy rate, nursing workforce, or the protocol of environmental cleansing throughout the study period, a stepwise reduction in ICU onset nonbacteraemic MRSA infection was observed: from 3.54 (phase 1) to 2.26 (phase 2, p = 0.042) and 1.02 (phase 3, p = 0.006) per 1000-patient-days. ICU onset bacteraemic MRSA infection was significantly reduced from 1.94 (phase 1) to 0.9 (phase 2, p = 0.005) and 0.28 (phase 3, p = 0.021) per 1000-patient-days. Infection due to ESBL-producing organisms did not show a corresponding reduction. The usage density of broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluoroquinolones increased from phase 1 to 3. However a significant trend improvement of ICU onset MRSA infection by segmented regression analysis can only be demonstrated when comparison was made before and after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. This suggests that the deaths of fellow healthcare workers from an occupational acquired infection had an overwhelming effect on their compliance with infection control measures. CONCLUSION: Provision of single room isolation facilities and promotion of hand hygiene practice are important. However compliance with infection control measures relies largely on a personal commitment, which may increase when personal safety is threatened.","output":"Sequential introduction of single room isolation and hand hygiene campaign in the control of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in intensive care unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to examine tumor response with positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during chemoradiotherapy as a predictor of outcome in patients with p16-positive oropharynx cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with p16-positive oropharynx cancer were treated with chemoradiotherapy. Low-risk (LR) disease was defined as T1-T3 and N0-2b and 10 pack-years and intermediate-risk (IR) disease as T4 or N2c-3 or >10 pack-years. Patients underwent a PET/MRI scan pretreatment and at fraction 10. Change in value of imaging means were analyzed by analysis of variance. K-means clustering with Euclidean distance functions were used for patient clustering. Silhouette width was used to determine the optimal number of clusters. Linear regression was performed on all radiographic metrics using patient and disease characteristics. RESULTS Twenty-four patients were enrolled with 7 LR and 11 IR patients available for analysis. Pretreatment imaging characteristics between LR and IR patients were similar. Patients with LR disease exhibited a larger reduction in maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) compared with IR patients (P<0.05). Cluster analysis defined 2 cohorts that exhibited a similar intratreatment response. Cluster 1 contained 7 of 7 LR patients and 8 of 11 IR patients. Cluster 2 contained 3 of 11 IR patients. Cluster 2 exhibited significant differences compared with cluster 1 in the change in primary tumor peak SUV and largest lymph node median SUV. CONCLUSIONS We identified that IR p16-positive oropharynx cancers exhibit heterogeneity in their PET/MRI response to chemoradiotherapy. These data support further study of intratreatment imaging response as a potential mechanism to identify patients with IR oropharynx cancer suitable for treatment deintensification.","output":"Prospective Study of PET/MRI Tumor Response During Chemoradiotherapy for Patients With Low-risk and Intermediate-risk p16-positive Oropharynx Cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The proceedings contain 35 papers.

months 1 While COVID-19 is commonly linked to severe pneumonia often progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a new feature of the disease has come to light 2 A remarkably high number of COVID-19 patients are presenting with a deranged coagulation profile resulting in a hypercoagulable state 1-10 The coagulation defect noted in this population has been linked to an increased risk of thrombotic complications as well as poor prognosis 2,4,6,7 Proposed mechanisms behind the coagulopathy include severe inflammation, hypoxia, immobilization, and diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) In a study from China by Tang et al , coagulation tests were retrospectively reviewed in 183 consecutive patients infected with COVID-19 4 Findings revealed that non-survivors of the disease had significantly higher D-dimer, fibrin degradation products (FDPs), and longer prothrombin times (PT) compared to those of survivors on admission 4 The authors state that the use of these conventional coagulation tests may be beneficial in guiding treatment and that they may be directly related to patient prognosis 4 Additional findings included significantly lower fibrinogen and antithrombin (AT) levels during late hospitalization 4 It was also noted that 71 4% of non-survivors met criteria for overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), making it a common feature of severe disease in this cohort 4 Physicians at a hospital in Milan, Italy observed a number of patients developing deep vein thromboses (DVTs) and pulmonary embolisms (PEs), while lacking the presence of DIC as described by Tang et al 4,6 Panigada et al decided to create their own study utilizing a thromboelastography (TEG) point of care device as well as conventional coagulation testing 6 The study included 24 intubated COVID-19 patients who were randomly selected from those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 6 Collective TEG results revealed a significant state of hypercoagulability, which may provide explanation for the frequency of DVTs and PEs seen within their facility Thromboelastometry profiles were similar to those observed by Panigada et al , as faster clot formation times and higher maximum clot firmness seen were consistent with a hypercoagulable state 6,7 Spieza et al mentions 23% of the patients in the study developed DVTs, even while being treated with prophylactic anticoagulation 7 While neither of these studies support the notion of consumption coagulopathy as described by Tang et al , they do share the finding of markedly high D-dimer levels, supporting the conclusion that elevated D-dimer is an independent risk factor for severe disease 4,6,7 The hypercoagulability described in both reports may also support the use of antithrombotic drugs in this population as a method to prevent thromboembolic complications 6,7 Han et al sought to evaluate the differences among blood coagulation parameters between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls in order to provide insight into their ability to predict progression of the disease 10 The study involved 94 patients from a Wuhan China hospital with positive COVID-19 diagnosis and 40 healthy patients for the control group 10 Compared to the control group, COVID-19 patients presented with significantly lower AT values and significantly higher FDP and D-dimer values 10 After confirming findings from previous studies, the cohort of COVID-19 positive patients was split into three groups classified as ordinary, severe, or critical states of disease 4,6,7,10 D-dimer and FDP values were found to be significantly higher in the severe disease group when compared to the mild disease group 10 This finding highlights potential benefits of D-dimer and FDP monitoring in predicting the progression of COVID-19 disease 10 Fogarty et al considers how ethnicity plays a significant role in coagulation, and that Chinese are 3-4 times less likely to experience venous thromboembolism (VTE) when compared to Caucasians 2 In fact, VTE prophylaxis is far less prevalent in China for this reason 2 Researchers designed a study to determine whether coagulopathic features differ between Chinese and Caucasian patients 2 The cohort consisted of 83 COVID-19 positive patients recruited from St James Hospital in Dublin, Ireland Eighty-one percent of patients were Caucasian, 12% Asian, and 6% African 2 Blood tests were performed on admission revealing significantly increased D-dimer, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein levels 2 The cohort was next divided into two groups based on patients who were discharged and those requiring ICU admission 2 D-dimer, CRP, and fibrinogen levels on admission were found to be significantly higher in the groups requiring ICU level care 2 Unlike Tang et al , DIC was not identified within the cohort and platelet levels remained within a normal range 4,2 The lack of DIC development is hypothesized to be related to the use of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis, which was utilized in all patients within this cohort 10 Significant hypercoagulability related to severity of disease was, however, similar to that seen in Chinese

far-reaching and devastating, especially in Black populations. Vaccination is a critical part of controlling community spread, but vaccine acceptance has varied, with some research reporting that Black individuals in the US are less willing to be vaccinated than other racial/ethnic groups. Medical mistrust informed by experiences of racism may be associated with this lower willingness. Objective: To examine the association between race/ethnicity and rejection of COVID-19 vaccine trial participation and vaccine uptake and to investigate whether racial/ethnic group-based medical mistrust is a potential mediator of this association. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional survey study was conducted from June to December 2020 using a convenience sample of 1835 adults aged 18 years or older residing in Michigan. Participants were recruited through community-based organizations and hospital-academic networks. Main Outcomes and Measures: Separate items assessed whether respondents, if asked, would agree to participate in a research study to test a COVID-19 vaccine or to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Participants also completed the suspicion subscale of the Group-Based Medical Mistrust Scale. Results: Of the 1835 participants, 1455 (79%) were women, 361 (20%) men, and 19 (1%) other gender. The mean (SD) age was 49.4 (17.9) years, and 394 participants (21%) identified as Black individuals. Overall, 1376 participants (75%) reported low willingness to participate in vaccine trials, and 945 (52%) reported low willingness to be vaccinated. Black participants reported the highest medical mistrust scores (mean [SD], 2.35 [0.96]) compared with other racial/ethnic groups (mean [SD] for the total sample, 1.83 [0.91]). Analysis of path models revealed significantly greater vaccine trial and vaccine uptake rejection among Black participants (vaccine trial: B [SE], 0.51 [0.08]; vaccine uptake: B [SE], 0.51 [0.08]; both P < .001) compared with the overall mean rejection. The association was partially mediated by medical mistrust among Black participants (vaccine trial: B [SE], 0.04 [0.01]; P = .003; vaccine uptake: B [SE], 0.07 [0.02]; P < .001) and White participants (vaccine trial: B [SE], -0.06 [0.02]; P = .001; vaccine uptake: B [SE], -0.10 [0.02]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study of US adults, racial/ethnic group-based medical mistrust partially mediated the association between individuals identifying as Black and low rates of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine trial participation and actual vaccination. The findings suggest that partnerships between health care and other sectors to build trust and promote vaccination may benefit from socially and culturally responsive strategies that acknowledge and address racial/ethnic health care disparities and historical and contemporary experiences of racism.","output":"Factors Associated With Racial/Ethnic Group-Based Medical Mistrust and Perspectives on COVID-19 Vaccine Trial Participation and Vaccine Uptake in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of T cells in the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been underestimated in favor of neutralizing antibodies.

METHODS: We estimated the risk for prevalent hypertension with incident respiratory diseases over mean follow-up of 8 years among 377,143 British participants in the UK Biobank. Mendelian randomization of blood pressure on pneumonia was implemented using 75 independent, genome-wide significant variants associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressures among 299,024 individuals not in the UK Biobank. Secondary analyses with pulmonary function tests were performed. FINDINGS: In total, 107,310 participants (30%) had hypertension at UK Biobank enrollment, and 9,969 (3%) developed pneumonia during follow-up. Prevalent hypertension was independently associated with increased risk for incident pneumonia (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.29C1.43; p < 0.001), as well as other incident respiratory diseases. Genetic predisposition to a 5 mm Hg increase in blood pressure was associated with increased risk for incident pneumonia for systolic blood pressure (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.04C1.13; p < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (HR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.03C1.20; p = 0.005). Additionally, consistent with epidemiologic associations, increased blood pressure genetic risk was significantly associated with reduced performance on pulmonary function tests (p < 0.001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 126 crowns with four identical buccal surfaces were fabricated using seven different CAD/CAM materials: CEREC Blocs unglazed (CBU), CEREC Blocs glazed (CBG), IPS Empress CAD (EMP), IPS e.max CAD (EMA), VITA SUPRINITY PC (SUP), inCoris TZI (TZI) and VITA ENAMIC (ENA). A total of 504 APC Flash-Free (APC FF)-precoated brackets were bonded applying three surface treatments: (1) MI; (2) MEP and (3) 9.6% HF. SBS was performed after 24 h and TC. Results were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests (p < 0.05). RESULTS: MEP conditioning yielded lower SBS results compared with MI and 9.6% HF for CBG (24 h and TC) and EMA (TC) materials. EMP conditioning with MEP after 24 h obtained lower SBS values compared with MI; however, after TC, SBS was similar to MI group and higher than with 9.6% HF. After TC for TZI ceramic, MI protocol (sandblasting) obtained higher SBS scores than MEP, but similar than 9.6% HF. Treatment of ENA with MI and MEP produced higher results than 9.6% HF after TC. SBS results were similar for CBU and SUP, regardless of the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although each CAD/CAM material requires specific surface treatment to obtain the highest SBS of APC FF brackets, the treatment with MEP is a valid orthodontic alternative for most of the materials tested. TC significantly decreased SBS for most of the materials.

Results Of the total 327 participants in the study, 34% had stated that they were suffering from respiratory symptoms even after 2 months of COVID\\\\19. The study demonstrated that patient oxygen saturation level SpO2 (P = .03), D\\\\dimer (P = .001), serum ferritin (P = .006), and the presence and severity of dyspnea are significantly correlated. In addition to that, patient smoking history (P = .012) and comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (P = .021) were found to be statistically significant among groups.

Recent focus has been on emerging zoonoses and on identifying common patterns and drivers of emerging diseases. However, no overarching framework exists to integrate knowledge on all emerging infectious disease events. Here, we propose such a conceptual framework based on changes in the interplay of pathogens, hosts and environment that lead to the formation of novel disease patterns and pathogen genetic adjustment. We categorize infectious disease emergence events into three groups: (i) pathogens showing up in a novel host, ranging from spill-over, including zoonoses, to complete species jumps; (ii) mutant pathogens displaying novel traits in the same host, including an increase in virulence, antimicrobial resistance and host immune escape; and (iii) disease complexes emerging in a new geographic area, either through range expansion or through long distance jumps. Each of these categories is characterized by a typical set of drivers of emergence, matching pathogen trait profiles, disease ecology and transmission dynamics. Our framework may assist in disentangling and structuring the rapidly growing amount of available information on infectious diseases. Moreover, it may contribute to a better understanding of how human action changes disease landscapes globally.","output":"PathogenChostCenvironment interplay and disease emergence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Junin virus (JUNV) is the etiological agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF), a human disease with a high case-fatality rate. It is widely accepted that arenaviral infections, including JUNV infections, are generally non-cytopathic. In contrast, here we demonstrated apoptosis induction in human lung epithelial carcinoma (A549), human hepatocarcinoma and Vero cells upon infection with the attenuated Candid#1 strain of, JUNV as determined by phosphatidylserine (PS) translocation, Caspase 3 (CASP3) activation, Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and/or chromosomal DNA fragmentation. Moreover, as determined by DNA fragmentation, we found that the pathogenic Romero strain of JUNV was less cytopathic than Candid#1 in human hepatocarcinoma and Vero, but more apoptotic in A549 and Vero E6 cells. Additionally, we found that JUNV-induced apoptosis was enhanced by RIG-I signaling. Consistent with the previously reported role of RIG-I like helicase (RLH) signaling in initiating programmed cell death, we showed that cell death or DNA fragmentation of Candid#1-infected A549 cells was decreased upon siRNA or shRNA silencing of components of RIG-I pathway in spite of increased virus production. Similarly, we observed decreased DNA fragmentation in JUNV-infected human hepatocarcinoma cells deficient for RIG-I when compared with that of RIG-I-competent cells. In addition, DNA fragmentation detected upon Candid#1 infection of type I interferon (IFN)-deficient Vero cells suggested a type I IFN-independent mechanism of apoptosis induction in response to JUNV.

To date, the use of Pes in the clinical setting is limited, and it is often seen as a research tool only. METHODS This is a review of the relevant technical, physiological and clinical details that support the clinical utility of Pes. RESULTS After appropriately positioning of the esophageal balloon, Pes monitoring allows titration of controlled and assisted mechanical ventilation to achieve personalized protective settings and the desired level of patient effort from the acute phase through to weaning. Moreover, Pes monitoring permits accurate measurement of transmural vascular pressure and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure and facilitates detection of patient-ventilator asynchrony, thereby supporting specific diagnoses and interventions. Finally, some Pes-derived measures may also be obtained by monitoring electrical activity of the diaphragm. CONCLUSIONS Pes monitoring provides unique bedside measures for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of acute respiratory failure patients.

While valuable guidance on interventions to improve maternal and neonatal health in both non-crisis and crisis settings exists, guidance on how best to deliver these interventions in crisis settings, and especially in conflict settings, is still limited. This systematic review aimed to synthesise the available literature on the delivery on maternal and neonatal health interventions in conflict settings. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases using terms related to conflict, women and children, and maternal and neonatal health. We searched websites of 10 humanitarian organisations for relevant grey literature. Publications reporting on conflict-affected populations in low-income and middle-income countries and describing a maternal or neonatal health intervention delivered during or within 5 years after the end of a conflict were included. Information on population, intervention, and delivery characteristics were extracted and narratively synthesised. Quantitative data on intervention coverage and effectiveness were tabulated but no meta-analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: 115 publications met our eligibility criteria. Intervention delivery was most frequently reported in the sub-Saharan Africa region, and most publications focused on displaced populations based in camps. Reported maternal interventions targeted antenatal, obstetric and postnatal care; neonatal interventions focused mostly on essential newborn care. Most interventions were delivered in hospitals and clinics, by doctors and nurses, and were mostly delivered through non-governmental organisations or the existing healthcare system. Delivery barriers included insecurity, lack of resources and lack of skilled health staff. Multi-stakeholder collaboration, the introduction of new technology or systems innovations, and staff training were delivery facilitators. Reporting of intervention coverage or effectiveness data was limited. DISCUSSION: The relevant existing literature focuses mostly on maternal health especially around the antenatal period. There is still limited literature on postnatal care in conflict settings and even less on newborn care. In crisis settings, as much as in non-crisis settings, there is a need to focus on the first day of birth for both maternal and neonatal health. There is also a need to do more research on how best to involve community members in the delivery of maternal and neonatal health interventions.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of psychological issues and identify the factors associated with the psychological impact of COVID-19 during the first nationwide lockdown among the general population in Vietnam. METHODS: We employed a cross-sectional study design with convenience sampling. A self-administered, online survey was used to collect data and assess psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress of participants from April 10 to 15, 2020. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were utilized to assess psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress of participants during COVID-19 social distancing.

There were 35.9%, 23.5%, 14.1%, and 22.3% who suffered from psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Those respondents who evaluated their physical health as average had higher IES-R score, DASS-21 depression, anxiety and stress than those in good/very good health status (beta-coefficient regression (B) = 9.16, 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 6.43 to 11.89), B = 5.85, 95% CI, 4.49 to 7.21, B = 3.64, 95% CI, 2.64 to 4.63, and B = 5.19, 95% CI, 3.83 to 6.56, respectively). Those who were in bad or very bad health condition suffered more severe depression, anxiety and stress (B = 9.57, 95% CI, 4.54 to 14.59, B = 7.24, 95% CI, 3.55 to 10.9, and B = 10.60, 95% CI, 5.56 to 15.65, respectively). Unemployment was more likely associated with depression and stress (B = 3.34, 95% CI, 1.68 to 5.01, and B = 2.34, 95% CI, 0.84 to 3.85). Regarding concerns about COVID-19, more than half (54.5%) expressed concern on their children aged below 18 years, which increased their IES-R score and DASS-21 stress score (B = 7.81, 95% CI, 4.98 to 10.64, and B = 1.75, 95% CI, 0.27 to 3.24, respectively).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate ethnic disparities in mortality among critically ill adults with COVID-19 enrolled in the Study of the Treatment and Outcomes in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19 (STOP-COVID). METHODS: Multicenter cohort study of adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units (ICU) at 67 U.S. hospitals from March 4 to May 9, 2020. Multilevel logistic regression was used to evaluate 28-day mortality across racial/ethnic groups. RESULTS: A total of 2153 patients were included (994 [46.2%] Hispanic and 1159 [53.8%] non-Hispanic White). The median (IQR) age was 62 (51C71) years (non-Hispanic White, 66 [57C74] years; Hispanic, 56 [46C67] years), and 1462 (67.9%) were men. Compared with non-Hispanic White patients, Hispanic patients were younger; were less likely to have hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, or heart failure; and had longer duration of symptoms prior to ICU admission. During median (IQR) follow-up of 14 (7C24) days, 785 patients (36.5%) died.

By contrast, an exaggerated antiinflammatory response has also been described following cardiac arrest, which may be mediated by downregulation of antigen presentation receptor HLA-DR. We report the composition of monocyte subpopulations and the expression of CD14 and HLA-DR following cardiac arrest. Blood specimens were collected from 32 patients at three timepoints in the first 48 h after cardiac arrest. Monocyte subset composition was determined by flow cytometry based on the expression of CD14, CD16, and HLA-DR. Monocyte subset composition and the expression of CD14 and HLA-DR were correlated with patient outcomes. The results were compared to 19 patients with coronary artery disease. Cardiac arrest patients showed a significant decline in the percentage of nonclassical monocytes. Monocyte CD14 expression was upregulated after 24 h and correlated with the time to return of spontaneous circulation. Downregulation of HLA-DR expression was observed mainly among classical monocytes and significantly correlated with the dose of norepinephrine used to treat shock. Downregulation of HLA-DR among nonclassical and intermediate monocytes was significantly associated with disease severity. Our data demonstrate the disturbance of monocyte subset composition with a significant decline in nonclassical monocytes at an early stage following cardiac arrest.

In the present work we investigated the experience of families without specific elements of social or health vulnerability during the quarantine period that occurred in the spring of 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between May and July 2020, 22 primary care pediatricians belonging to AUSL Romagna administered to a number of families a questionnaire to detect changes that occurred, during the lockdown, in family environment, school attendance and personal attitudes. RESULTS: A total of 721 questionnaires were collected, analyzing the associations between variables relating to home environment, daily rhythms, school and warning signs in relation to the age of children. As a result of the lockdown, family habits changed in 31% of cases, with a greater presence of the reference figure in 68% of these. Three out of four families reported they had sufficient domestic spaces, and nine out of ten had access to an outdoor, private or condominium space. Daily rhythms were preserved in 56.7% of cases; mood disorders appeared in 30% of adolescent children, followed by sleep, appetite and psychosomatic disorders. One in three children has made progress in terms of evolution and behavior, and one in 5 children has seen their relationships improve. The overall resilience of families during the lockdown period was considered good in 66.3%, sufficient in 31.3% and not satisfactory in only 2.4% of cases.

The most common symptom clusters, dyspnea (shortness of breath) and fatigue, can contribute to physical decline, reductions in quality of life, and a higher risk of comorbidities and mortality. Dyspnea is a primary limiter of exercise capacity in individuals with lung cancer, resulting in exercise avoidance and an accelerated physical decline. As such, designing resistance training with cluster sets to mitigate symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue may result in improved exercise tolerance. Thus, maintaining the exercise stimulus via cluster sets, combined with improved tolerance of the exercise, could result in the maintenance of physical function and quality of life. The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a hybrid-delivery home-based cluster-set resistance training program in individuals with NSCLC. METHODS: Individuals with NSCLC (n = 15), within 12 months of completion of treatment, will be recruited to participate in this single-arm feasibility trial. Participants will complete 8 weeks of home-based resistance training designed to minimize dyspnea and fatigue.

Although at first glance, they appear to be completely unrelated, they share striking commonalities. Both are caused by human behaviors, and some of those behaviors contribute to both pandemics at the same time. Both illustrate the fact that isolation is not an option; these are global issues that inescapably affect all persons and all nations. Both incur prodigious current and anticipated costs. Both have similar societal impacts, and disproportionately harm those with lesser resources, widening the gap between the 'haves and the have-nots.'

Macrophages are crucial components of the host innate immune system and serve as the first line of defense against HTNV infection. Previous studies indicated that the viral replication efficiency in macrophages determines hantavirus pathogenicity, but it remains unknown which factor manipulates the macrophage activation pattern and the virus-host interaction process. Here, we performed the transcriptomic analysis of HTNV-infected mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and identified the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1), especially the isoform NEAT1-2, as one of the lncRNAs that is differentially expressed at the early phase. Based on coculture experiments, we revealed that silencing NEAT1-2 hinders inflammatory macrophage activation and facilitates HTNV propagation, while enhancing NEAT1-2 transcription effectively restrains viral replication. Furthermore, sterol response element binding factor-2 (SREBP2), which controls the cholesterol metabolism process, was found to stimulate macrophages by promoting the production of multiple inflammatory cytokines upon HTNV infection. NEAT1-2 could potentiate SREBP2 activity by upregulating Srebf1 expression and interacting with SREBP2, thus stimulating inflammatory macrophages and limiting HTNV propagation. More importantly, we demonstrated that the NEAT1-2 expression level in patient monocytes was negatively correlated with viral load and HFRS disease progression. Our results identified a function and mechanism of action for the lncRNA NEAT1 in heightening SREBP2-mediated macrophage activation to restrain hantaviral propagation and revealed the association of NEAT1 with HFRS severity.","output":"LncRNA NEAT1 Potentiates SREBP2 Activity to Promote Inflammatory Macrophage Activation and Limit Hantaan Virus Propagation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating effect on the nursing homes for dependent older people.

Chemotherapy or interferon  is used for patients with extensive cutaneous or visceral Kaposi sarcoma, but tolerance might be poor and long-term remission is rare. We aimed to evaluate the activity of pembrolizumab in classic and endemic Kaposi sarcoma with cutaneous extension requiring systemic treatment. METHODS: We did a multicentre, single-arm, proof-of-concept, phase 2 trial in adults aged 18 years or older with histologically proven classic or endemic Kaposi's sarcoma with progressive cutaneous extension requiring systemic treatment and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 in three hospitals in France. The patients were treated with 200 mg pembrolizumab intravenously every 3 weeks for 6 months (eight cycles) or until severe toxicity. The primary endpoint was the best overall response rate within the 6-month timeframe, defined by the occurrence of a complete response or partial response and assessed by an investigator using the modified AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) criteria. Three or more responses among a total 17 patients were needed for the primary endpoint to be met, using a Simon's two-stage optimal design assuming a 30% response rate as desirable. For this final study analysis, all patients were included following the intention-to-treat principle. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03469804, and is closed to new participants. FINDINGS: 30 patients were screened for eligibility and 17 patients (eight [47%] with classic and nine [53%] with endemic Kaposi's sarcoma) were enrolled between July 2, 2018, and Dec 16, 2019. The median follow-up was 204 months (IQR 181-241). Two (12%) patients had a complete response, ten (59%) had a partial response, and five (29%) had stable disease as the best response within the 6-month treatment timeframe, with a best overall response rate of 71% (95% CI 44-90), meeting the predefined primary outcome (ie, exceeding a response rate of 30%). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 13 (76%) of 17 patients, including two grade 3 adverse events (one [6%] acute cardiac decompensation and one [6%] granulomatous reaction). Treatment was prematurely discontinued in two (12%) patients due to grade 3 acute reversible cardiac decompensation and grade 2 pancreatitis, and one other patient had a grade 3 granulomatous reaction in mediastinal lymph nodes requiring steroids and methotrexate treatment. There were no serious adverse events or treatment-related deaths. INTERPRETATION: In this prospective trial, which to our knowledge is the first to assess the role of PD-1 blockade in patients with classic and endemic Kaposi's sarcoma, pembrolizumab showed promising anti-tumour activity with an acceptable safety profile. If this result is supported by further studies, treatment with anti-PD-1 could be part of the therapeutic armamentarium for patients with classic and endemic Kaposi's sarcoma.

Here, we compare and discuss the diagnostic performance of a range of different molecular assays designed to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with suspected COVID-19. Using findings from a systematic review of 103 studies, we categorised COVID-19 molecular assays into 12 different test classes, covering point-of-care tests, various alternative RT-PCR protocols, and alternative methods such as isothermal amplification. We carried out meta-analyses to estimate the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of each test class. We also estimated the positive and negative predictive values of all diagnostic test classes across a range of prevalence rates. Using previously validated RT-PCR assays as a reference standard, 11 out of 12 classes showed a summary sensitivity estimate of at least 92% and a specificity estimate of at least 99%. Several diagnostic test classes were estimated to have positive predictive values of 100% throughout the investigated prevalence spectrum, whilst estimated negative predictive values were more variable and sensitive to disease prevalence. We also report the results of clinical utility models that can be used to determine the information gained from a positive and negative test result in each class, and whether each test is more suitable for confirmation or exclusion of disease. Our analysis suggests that several tests exist that are suitable alternatives to standard RT-PCR and we discuss scenarios in which these could be most beneficial, such as where time to test result is critical or, where resources are constrained. However, we also highlight methodological concerns with the design and conduct of many included studies, and also the existence of likely publication bias for some test classes. Our results should be interpreted with these shortcomings in mind. Furthermore, our conclusions on test performance are limited to their use in symptomatic populations: we did not identify sufficient suitable data to allow analysis of testing in asymptomatic populations.","output":"How to best test suspected cases of COVID-19: an analysis of the diagnostic performance of RT-PCR and alternative molecular methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main objective of this paper is to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on customer loyalty factors in the Russian e-commerce market.

In May 2020, BSGAR and SCoR issued guidelines outlining steps for conduct of CTC in the early recovery phase. We evaluated the implementation of these in four English hospital trusts. METHODS: Ethical permission was not required for this multicentre service evaluation. We identified patients undergoing CTC over a 2-month period from May to July 2020 at four Trusts. We recorded demographics, scan indications, colonic findings, and incidental lung base changes compatible with COVID-19. A subset of patients were contacted via telephone to document new symptoms 2 weeks following their scan. Staff were contacted to determine if any acquired COVID-19 during the period. RESULTS: 224 patients (118 male, 52.7%) were scanned during the period. In 55 patients (24.6%), CTC showed a 6 mm polyp. 33 of 224 (14.7%) scans showed incidental lung base changes felt unrelated to COVID-19, and only one patient had changes indeterminate for COVID-19; no classic COVID-19 pulmonary changes were found. Of 169 patients with telephone follow-up, none reported any new symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, fever, anosmia, ageusia) within 14 days of CTC. None of the 86 staff contacted developed COVID-19.

The effect of thoracoscopic CO2-insufflation on cerebral oxygenation (rScO2) during the consecutive thoracoscopic procedures in repair of LGEA was evaluated. METHODS Prospective case series of five infants, with in total 16 repetitive thoracoscopic procedures. A CO2-pneumothorax was installed with a pressure of maximum 5 mmHg and flow of 1 L/min. Parameters influencing rScO2 were monitored. For analysis 10 time periods of 10' during surgery and in the perioperative period were selected. RESULTS Median gestational age was 35+3 [range 33+4 to 39+6] weeks; postnatal age at time of first procedure 4 [2-53] days and time of insufflation 127[22-425] min. Median rScO2 varied between 55 and 90%. Transient outliers in cerebral oxygenation were observed in three patients. In Patient 2 oxygenation values below 55% occurred during a low MABP and Hb < 6 mmol/L. The rScO2 increased after erythrocytes transfusion. Patient 5 also showed a rScO2 of 50% with a Hb <6 mmol/L during all procedures, except for a substantial increase during a high paCO2 of 60 mmHg. Patient 4 had a rScO2 > 85% during the first procedure with a concomitant high FiO2 > 45%. All parameters recovered during the surgical course. CONCLUSIONS This prospective case series of NIRS during consecutive thoracoscopic repair of LGEA showed that cerebral oxygenation remained stable. Transient outliers in rScO2 occurred during changes in hemodynamic or respiratory parameters and normalized after interventions of the anesthesiologist. This study underlines the importance of perioperative neuromonitoring and the close collaboration between pediatric surgeon, anesthesiologist and neonatologist.","output":"Brain Oxygenation During Thoracoscopic Repair of Long Gap Esophageal Atresia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pada 30 Januari 2020 telah menetapkan COVID-19 sebagai kedaruratan Kesehatan masyarakat yang meresahkan dunia.

Those critical of social media research often cite that it may be unrepresentative of the population; however, the suitability of social media data in digital epidemiology is more nuanced. Identifying the demographics of social media users can help establish representativeness. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the different approaches or combination of approaches to extract race or ethnicity from social media and report on the challenges of using these methods. METHODS: We present a scoping review to identify methods used to extract the race or ethnicity of Twitter users from Twitter data sets. We searched 17 electronic databases from the date of inception to May 15, 2021, and carried out reference checking and hand searching to identify relevant studies. Sifting of each record was performed independently by at least two researchers, with any disagreement discussed. Studies were required to extract the race or ethnicity of Twitter users using either manual or computational methods or a combination of both. RESULTS: Of the 1249 records sifted, we identified 67 (5.36%) that met our inclusion criteria. Most studies (51/67, 76%) have focused on US-based users and English language tweets (52/67, 78%). A range of data was used, including Twitter profile metadata, such as names, pictures, information from bios (including self-declarations), or location or content of the tweets. A range of methodologies was used, including manual inference, linkage to census data, commercial software, language or dialect recognition, or machine learning or natural language processing. However, not all studies have evaluated these methods. Those that evaluated these methods found accuracy to vary from 45% to 93% with significantly lower accuracy in identifying categories of people of color. The inference of race or ethnicity raises important ethical questions, which can be exacerbated by the data and methods used. The comparative accuracies of the different methods are also largely unknown. CONCLUSIONS: There is no standard accepted approach or current guidelines for extracting or inferring the race or ethnicity of Twitter users. Social media researchers must carefully interpret race or ethnicity and not overpromise what can be achieved, as even manual screening is a subjective, imperfect method. Future research should establish the accuracy of methods to inform evidence-based best practice guidelines for social media researchers and be guided by concerns of equity and social justice.","output":"Methods to Establish Race or Ethnicity of Twitter Users: Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are many known hazards, including natural, man-made, and intentional.

The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics, outcomes, and risk factors for in-hospital death of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the ICUs of a University Hospital in Egypt. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted between April 28 and July 29, 2020 to two ICUs dedicated to the isolation and treatment of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Cairo University Hospitals. Diagnosis was confirmed in all patients using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on respiratory samples and radiologic evidence of pneumonia. RESULTS: Of the 177 patients admitted to the ICUs during the study period, 160 patients had COVID-19 pneumonia and were included in the analysis (mean age: 60  14 years, 67.5% males); 23% of patients had no known comorbidities.

The public diagnostic effort is particularly important among the most vulnerable socioeconomic districts where the state is the sole health provider, such as Sao Paulo state, the Brazilian epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We developed an RT-PCR testing intensity effort index (RT-PCR TIEI) composed of seven indicators to assess the intensity testing efforts in the state of Sao Paulo. Each Regional Health Department (RHD) was scored using anonymized public data. We used dynamic time-series cross-sectional models to analyze the association between the RT-PCR TIEI in Sao Paulo state and its 17 RHDs from epidemiological weeks 10 to 35, and the proportion of the population living under a high level of socioeconomic vulnerability, dependent on public health service (SUS), per capita income, and population density. The regression models included an intercept and the lag of the RT-PCR TIEI, and standard errors were clustered by RHD. Findings On average, the RT-PCR TIEI score was 23.50. The maximum (47.06) was reached in week 11 and declined in subsequent weeks. The lowest score (17.65) was reached in week 25. In the long-run, socioeconomic vulnerability is negatively associated with RT-PCR TIEI (p-value=0.000, 95% CI -0.896, -0.816), with a higher proportion of the population dependent on SUS (p-value= 0.000, 95% CI -0.877, 0.808) and with population density (p-value=0.000, 95% CI -0.857; -0.806). Conclusion There was a decline in the state's testing intensity as the pandemic advanced, and the most socioeconomic vulnerable RHDs showed the lowest values where local public laboratory presence is a predictor of a higher RT-PCR TIEI score. Thus, the low RT-PCR TIEI and local laboratory capacity inequality may affect surveillance capability, especially for the most socioeconomic vulnerable population.","output":"Socioeconomic Vulnerabilities and the Intensity of RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 Testing Efforts in the Public Health System in Sao Paulo State"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are frequently utilized in the treatment of symptomatic vertebral body fractures. While prior studies have demonstrated disparities in the treatment of back pain and care for osteoporotic patients, disparities in spine augmentation have not been investigated. We investigated racial and health insurance status differences in the use of spine augmentation for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2005 to 2010, we selected all discharges with a primary diagnosis of vertebral fracture (International Classification of Diseases-9 code 733.13). Patients who received spine augmentation were identified by using International Classification of Diseases-9 procedure code 81.65 for vertebroplasty and 81.66 for kyphoplasty. Patients with a diagnosis of cancer were excluded. We compared usage rates of spine augmentation by race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander) and insurance status (Medicare, Medicaid, self-pay, and private). Comparisons among groups were made by using (2) tests. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was fit to determine variables associated with spine augmentation use. RESULTS A total of 228,329 patients were included in this analysis, of whom 129,206 (56.6%) received spine augmentation. Among patients with spine augmentation, 97,022 (75%) received kyphoplasty and 32,184 (25%) received vertebroplasty; 57.5% (92,779/161,281) of white patients received spine augmentation compared with 38.7% (1405/3631) of black patients (P < .001). Hispanic patients had significantly lower spine augmentation rates compared with white patients (52.3%, 3777/7222, P < .001) as did Asian/Pacific Islander patients (53.1%, 1784/3361, P < .001). The spine augmentation usage rate was 57.2% (114,768/200,662) among patients with Medicare, significantly higher than that of those with Medicaid (43.9%, 1907/4341, P < .001) and those who self-pay (40.2%, 488/1214, P < .001).

International resuscitation guidelines state that extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) may have a role in selected patients suffering refractory cardiac arrest. Identifying these patients is challenging. This project systematically reviewed the evidence comparing the outcomes of ECPR over conventional-CPR (CCPR), before examining resuscitation-specific parameters to assess which patients might benefit from ECPR. Method Literature searches of studies comparing ECPR to CCPR and the clinical parameters of survivors of ECPR were performed. The primary outcome examined was survival at hospital discharge or 30 days. A secondary analysis examined the resuscitation parameters that may be associated with survival in patients who receive ECPR (no-flow and low-flow intervals, bystander-CPR, initial shockable cardiac rhythm, and witnessed cardiac arrest). Results Seventeen of 948 examined studies were included. ECPR demonstrated improved survival (OR 0.40 (0.27-0.60)) and a better neurological outcome (OR 0.10 (0.04-0.27)) over CCPR during literature review and meta-analysis. Characteristics that were associated with improved survival in patients receiving ECPR included an initial shockable rhythm and a shorter low-flow time. Shorter no-flow, the presence of bystander-CPR and witnessed arrests were not characteristics that were associated with improved survival following meta-analysis, although the quality of input data was low.

These patients were more than 6 years younger than other subgroups and more likely were men (ML-K: 59% and ML-S: 60%). The majority of patients in this subgroup suffered from an embolic-appearing stroke on imaging (ML-K: 83% and ML-S: 85%) and had about 50% risk of large vessel occlusions (ML-K: 50% and ML-S: 53%). In addition, there were two cohorts of patients with large-artery atherosclerosis (ML-K: 30% and ML-S: 43% of patients) and cardioembolic strokes (ML-K: 34% and ML-S: 15%) with consistent comorbidity and imaging patterns. Binominal logistic regression demonstrated that ischemic heart disease (odds ratio (OR), 4.9; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.6-14.7), atrial fibrillation (OR, 14.0; 95% CI, 4.8-40.8), and active neoplasm (OR, 7.1; 95% CI, 1.4-36.2) were associated with cardioembolic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Although a cohort of young and healthy men with cardioembolic and large vessel occlusions can be distinguished using both clinical sub-grouping and unsupervised clustering, stroke in other patients may be explained based on the existing comorbidities.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Is a Culprit for Some, but Not All Acute Ischemic Strokes: A Report from the Multinational COVID-19 Stroke Study Group"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 36-year-old African American man with no medical history presented with a recent history of cough and dyspnoea.

The absence of cardiovascular risk factors in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients who suffer a stroke supports a causal relationship as shown in the following report.

Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging( )(MRI) showed a corresponding, small, subacute, ischemic lesion in the left periventricular white matter and a microbleed in the left thalamus. Under dual platelet aggregation inhibitor therapy, the neurological deficits regressed almost completely within three weeks. If one considers that classic cardiovascular risk factors were missing, a causal link between the SARS-CoV-2 infection and the stroke becomes likely. Vasculopathy, coagulopathy, and cardiac disease caused by the virus or the immune response against it serve as pathophysiological explanations for the cerebral lesions. It is concluded that ischemic stroke can occur during infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Many of these flaws are attributed to the current workflow: LaTeX to PDF to reviewers to camera ready PDF.

However, this venture fails to address the origins of these inadequacies in the contemporary paper workflow. The paper, being the basic unit of academic research, is merely how problems in the publication and research ecosystem manifest; but is not itself responsible for them. Not only will simply replacing or augmenting papers with different formats not fix existing problems; when used as a band-aid without systemic changes, will likely exacerbate the existing inequities. In this work, we argue that the root cause of hindrances in the accessibility of machine learning research lies not in the paper workflow but within the misaligned incentives behind the publishing and research processes.

Viral infectivity with SARS-CoV-2 lasts eight days, unlike viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab tests which can persist for as long as seven weeks. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody becomes detectable from 11 days after infection. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies are usually neutralising against the virus and their direct antiviral activity was partially demonstrated in 33,000 patients with COVID-19 treated with convalescent plasma in the USA. So, a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody is a much more accurate determination of infectiousness than a repeat PCR which is only 70% sensitive.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the choices societies made to protect their community members from the virus could have created contexts of child neglect. With the closure of services and institutions, societies were no longer available to help meet the needs of children. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine parents reports on the response their children received to their needs during the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: During the period of the spring 2020 lockdown, 414 parents in the province of Quebec, Canada, completed an online questionnaire about the impact of the crisis on the response their children received to their needs. RESULTS: Compared to parents of younger children, parents of older children reported less fulfillment of their childs needs in three measured domains, namely cognitive and affective, security, and basic care needs. CONCLUSION: These results are discussed in light of the policies and the resources societies have put in place during the crisis to help families meet the needs of their children. Societies must learn from this crisis to put children at the top of their priorities in the face of a societal crisis.

The model of chronic care must be based on productive interaction between the health care team and the patient. Due to the Covid19 Pandemic we have transformed the face to face support and treatment of the Obesity patient into a virtual model. Digital model can turns the patient into an active patient who participates in making decisions about their own health. Objetives: Describe digital transformation for the virtual management of obese and overweight patients. Material-Methods: We have re-engineered the process of diagnosis, care and treatment of the obese patient in order to integrate telemedicine. The clinical programme described in Figure 1 achieves a complete diagnosis of obesity and associated comorbidities and provides the patient with all the necessary tools for dietary modifications, physical exercise and emotional control during one year. The contact with the patient is mainly virtual through the patient's hospital website. Before medical appointments at 0, 6 and 12 months the programme request complementary tests (Bioelectrical impedance, blood test and abdominal ultrasounds) and asks patient to fill in online forms on personal history, cardiovascular risk factors, treatment, family history, weight history, dietary habits, tests of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, RAPA test for physical exercise, Golberg and EDI scales to examine psychological condition, tests of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, Life Quality Questionnaire(IWQOL-Lite) and Epworth sleepiness scale for SHAS screening. The programme has automatic calculators for Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) screen (NAFLD fibrosis score/FIB4 Index), cardiovascular risk and Frindisk test for Diabetes risk. System automatic requests a home polysomnography if the Epworth score is greater than 8 and also screens for Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) using NAFLD score, FIB4 index and abdominal ultrasound and requests Fibroscan if necessary. If EDI and Golberg scales are pathological, the system activates online psychological support. When the patient comes to the medical appointment, the doctor has full information to make an accurate diagnosis. After, the patient undergoes a monthly therapeutic educational group programme and fill in the online Weight and Waist Circumference booklet and podometer record monthly. The patient receives individually tailored nutritional recommendations and physical exercise. Managing obesity with learning Empowers the patient. The aim is to train the patient to become autonomous in the management of the disease. Results: The digital clinical pathway has been activated in December 2020. Conclusions:-Telemedicine enables an intensive, immediate and fluid intervention that allows the patient to actively participate in their own health process, fostering the self-efficacy and responsibility so necessary in the management of chronic diseases.-The IT development of the clinical pathway has allowed us to be more efficient in terms of time and resources by automating procedures like screening of SHAS and NAFLD.","output":"Digital transformation for the virtual management of Obesity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is now available in the UK. However, some men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to use HIV post-exposure prophylaxis following sexual exposure (PEPSE) and are not using PrEP. It is important to characterize MSM having condomless anal sex who are not using PrEP. METHODS In a cross-sectional analysis, we compared the characteristics of MSM who used PEPSE in 2021 with MSM using PEPSE in 2017. RESULTS Overall, 126 MSM used PEPSE in January to June 2017 and 28 MSM used PEPSE in January to June 2021, a 78% decline in PEPSE use. Those MSM using PEPSE in 2021 were significantly younger (27 vs. 35 years, p < 0.01), more likely to identify as black or from another minority ethnic group [29% (8/28) vs. 8% (10/126); p < 0.01], more likely to attend as a result of a group sex encounter [35% (10/28) vs. 16% (10/126); p = 0.03], more likely to attend following sex involving recreational drug use [32% (9/28) vs. 13% (16/126); p = 0.02], and more likely to initiate PEPSE in the emergency department [35% (10/28) vs. 19% (24/126); p = 0.04] compared with MSM attending in 2017.

Materials and Methods Patients with novel coronavirus (COVID-19) who referred to Masih Daneshvari and Noor-Afshar Hospitals in Tehran were included in the study after providing full explanations and obtaining written consent. Patients were then randomly divided into three groups: morphine, fentanyl and control. Patients in the morphine group received 3 mg of morphine intravenously every 6 hours for 5 days, whereas in the fentanyl group, 1.5 mcg / kg / h of fentanyl was infused for 2 hours on 5 consecutive days. The results were evaluated based on the design of the questionnaire and its completion using t-test and SPSS25 software. Results A total of 127 participants responded to the survey between 20 April and 20 June 2020, of whom 90 (70.86%) with the average age 65.2 years, provided complete data on variables included in the present analyses. 53 (58.33%) of all individuals were men and 37 (41.12%) were women.

Recently, it has been shown that autophagy is a critical mechanism underlying the interaction between influenza A virus and its host. Autophagy can be induced by the infection with influenza A virus, which is considered as a necessary process for the viral proliferation, including the accumulation of viral elements during the replication of influenza A virus. On the other hand, influenza A virus can inhibit the autophagic formation via interaction with the autophagy-related genes (Atg) and signaling pathways. In addition, autophagy is involved in the influenza virus-regulated cell deaths, leading to significant changes in host apoptosis.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of Lactobacillus from yaks on the intestinal microbial community in a mouse model and determine whether Lactobacillus supplementation contributed in alleviating diarrhea by modulating gut microbiota. A total of 12 ileac samples from four groups were collected for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of V3-V4 region. Results revealed that although Lactobacillus supplementation did not change the diversity of gut microbiota in mice, the proportion of some intestinal microbiota significantly changed. Specifically, the proportion of Lactobacillus and Sphingomonas in the Lactobacillus treated-group (L-group) were increased as compared to control group (C-group), whereas Pantoea, Cutibacterium, Glutamicibacter, Turicibacter, Globicatella, Microbacterium, Facklamia, unidentified_Corynebacteriaceae, Brachybacterium, and Staphylococcus were significantly decreased in the L-group. In contrast, Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection significantly decreased the proportion of beneficial bacteria such as Globicatella, Acinetobacter, Aerococcus, and Comamonas, while loads of pathogenic bacteria significantly increased including Roseburia and Megasphaera.

The healthcare workers who were posted in COVID-19 duties showed 4.8% positivity in the holding area (waiting area with the treatment of patients till their RT PCR report comes) and 5.7% in other COVID-19 areas related to laboratory work. Healthcare workers doing duties in COVID-19 areas showed 2.7% positivity, while those doing duties in non-COVID-19 emergency areas showed a positivity of 2.2%. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the prevalence of detectable antibodies was low in the general population in India and many patients were asymptomatic as seen in the blood donors, especially the labor class. Maximum exposure was present in young healthy males of labor class who remained asymptomatic. The healthcare workers were more exposed to COVID-19 as compared to the general population probably due to lack of precaution and awareness. Those doing non-COVID-19 duties were also exposed appreciably and needed to take all the precautions required for COVID-19 duties.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 IgG Surveillance in Asymptomatic Blood Donors and Health Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the response process of the Laboratory Analysis Task Force (LATF) for Unknown Disease Outbreaks (UDOs) at the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) during January 2020 to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which developed as a UDO in Korea.

The interrelations between multiple immune cells and stromal cells participate in the pathogenesis of ILDs. While fibroblasts contribute to the development of ILDs through secreting extracellular matrix and proinflammatory cytokines upon activation, T cells are major mediators of adaptive immunity, as well as inflammation and autoimmune tissue destruction in the lung of ILDs patients. Fibroblasts play important roles in modulating T cell recruitment, differentiation and function and conversely, T cells can balance fibrotic sequelae with protective immunity in the lung. A more precise understanding of the interrelation between fibroblasts and T cells will enable a better future therapeutic design by targeting this interrelationship. Here we highlight recent work on the interactions between fibroblasts and T cells in ILDs, and consider the implications of these interactions in the future development of therapies for ILDs.","output":"Interrelation Between Fibroblasts and T Cells in Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The gut microbiome regulates a number of homeostatic mechanisms in the healthy host including immune function and gut barrier protection. Loss of normal gut microbial structure and function has been associated with diseases as diverse as Clostridioides difficile infection, asthma, and epilepsy. Recent evidence has also demonstrated a link between the gut microbiome and sepsis. In this review, we focus on three key areas of the interaction between the gut microbiome and sepsis. First, prior to sepsis onset, gut microbiome alteration increases sepsis susceptibility through several mechanisms, including (a) allowing for expansion of pathogenic intestinal bacteria, (b) priming the immune system for a robust pro-inflammatory response, and (c) decreasing production of beneficial microbial products such as short-chain fatty acids. Second, once sepsis is established, gut microbiome disruption worsens and increases susceptibility to end-organ dysfunction. Third, there is limited evidence that microbiome-based therapeutics, including probiotics and selective digestive decontamination, may decrease sepsis risk and improve sepsis outcomes in select patient populations, but concerns about safety have limited uptake. Case reports of a different microbiome-based therapy, fecal microbiota transplantation, have shown correlation with gut microbial structure restoration and decreased inflammatory response, but these results require further validation. While much of the evidence linking the gut microbiome and sepsis has been established in pre-clinical studies, clinical evidence is lacking in many areas. To address this, we outline a potential research agenda for further investigating the interaction between the gut microbiome and sepsis.","output":"The gut microbiomes role in the development, maintenance, and outcomes of sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To describe the first Australian cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) disease (COVID-19) pneumonia treated with the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab. METHODS: Retrospective, open-label, real-world, uncontrolled, single-arm case series conducted in 2 tertiary hospitals in NSW, Australia and 1 tertiary hospital in Victoria, Australia. Five adult male patients aged between 46 and 74 years with type 1 respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and biochemical evidence of systemic hyperinflammation (C-reactive protein greater than 100 mg/L; ferritin greater than 700 g/L) were administered variable-dose tocilizumab. RESULTS: At between 13 and 26 days follow-up, all patients are alive and have been discharged from ICU. Two patients have been discharged home. Two patients avoided endotracheal intubation. Oxygen therapy has been ceased in three patients. Four adverse events potentially associated with tocilizumab therapy occurred in three patients: ventilator-associated pneumonia, bacteremia associated with central venous catheterization, myositis and hepatitis. All patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics, 4 received corticosteroids and 2 received both lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine. The time from first tocilizumab administration to improvement in ventilation, defined as a 25% reduction in fraction of inspired oxygen required to maintain peripheral oxygen saturation greater than 92%, ranged from 7 hours to 4.6 days.

In anti-COVID-19, our study suggests that low to moderate dose radiation of < 1.5 Gy can inhibit the induction of inflammatory cytokine and attenuate the ACE2 depression induced by spike protein in human bronchial epithelial cells in COVID-19 infection. Our study provided further mechanistic evidence to support LDRT as a cost-effective treatment for COVID-19 to relieve the severe inflammatory reaction and lung injury. Methods and materials: A cellular model was created by treating human bronchial epithelial cells (BEP2D) with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We used the qRT-PCR and ELISA analysis to identify the production of inflammatory cytokines. The BEP2D control cells and the spike-treated cells were irradiated using a single low to moderate dose radiation of 0.5 Gy, 1 Gy, and 1.5 Gy. The inflammatory cytokines and ACE2 expression were detected at different time points. Results: The soluble SARS-CoV-2 spike protein stimulated the formation of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF- while reducing the ACE2 protein expression in human bronchial epithelial cells. A single low to moderate dose exposure of 0.5 Gy, 1 Gy, and 1.5 Gy could attenuate the IL-6 and TNF- induction and rescue the depression of ACE2 by spike protein. Moreover, the spike protein increased the proteolytic degradation of ACE2 protein by promoting NEDD4-mediated ubiquitination of ACE2. Conclusions: The low-dose radiation can attenuate ACE2 depression and inflammatory response produced in the targeted human bronchial epithelial cells by spike protein.

Many successful patient-level interventions to prevent chronic disease progression and complications have used automated telephone self-management support, which relies on patient activation and communication to achieve improved health outcomes. It is not clear whether these interventions are similarly applicable to patients with LEP compared to patients with English proficiency. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were as follows: (1) To examine the impact of LEP on patient engagement (primary outcome) with a 12-month language-concordant self-management program that included automated telephone self-management support, designed for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). (2) To assess the impact of LEP on change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and albuminuria (secondary outcomes) resulting from the self-management program. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of the Kidney Awareness Registry and Education (KARE) pilot trial (NCT01530958) which was funded by the National Institutes of Health in August 2011, approved by the University of California Institutional Review Board in October 2011 (No. 11-07399), and executed between 2013 and 2015. Multivariable logistic and linear models were used to examine various facets of patient engagement with the CKD self-management support program by LEP status. Patient engagement was defined by patients use of educational materials, completion of a health coaching action plan, and degree of participation with automated telephone self-management support. Changes in SBP and albuminuria at 12 months by LEP status were determined using multivariable linear mixed models. RESULTS: Of 137 study participants, 53 (38.7%) reported LEP, of which 45 (85%) were Spanish speaking and 8 (15%) Cantonese speaking. While patients with LEP and English proficiency similarly used the programs educational materials (85% [17/20] vs 88% [30/34], P=.69) and completed an action plan (81% [22/27] vs 74% [35/47], P=.49), those with LEP engaged more with the automated telephone self-management support component. Average call completion was 66% among patients with LEP compared with 57% among those with English proficiency; patients with LEP requested more health coach telephone calls (P=.08) and had a significantly longer average automated call duration (3.3 [SD 1.4] min vs 2.2 [1.1 min], P<.001), indicating higher patient engagement. Patients with LEP randomized to self-management support had a larger, though nonstatistically significant (P=.74), change in SBP (C4.5 mmHg; 95% CI C9.4 to 0.3) and albuminuria (C72.4 mg/dL; 95% CI C208.9 to 64.1) compared with patients with English proficiency randomized to self-management support (C2.1 mmHg; 95% CI C8.6 to 4.3 and C11.1 mg/dL; 95% CI C166.9 to 144.7). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LEP with CKD were equally or more engaged with a language-concordant, culturally appropriate telehealth intervention compared with their English-speaking counterparts. Augmented telehealth may be useful in mitigating communication barriers among patients with LEP.

In view of an aforesaid conundrum, here we present a rationale for withering away a plausible Antibiotic-Resistant Bacterial Pathogen (ARBP) elicited pandemic. Herd immunity is defined as when ~70% to 90% of a population is immune to an infectious disease providing indirect protection to those who are immunocompetent (herd protection) and to those who are not immune to that specific pandemic event(disease(s)). R0 is an estimate of contagiousness which is derived from human behavior and biological characteristics of pathogens and time. However, it is not a measure of the severity of an infectious disease or dissemination of a pathogen's spread through a population. R0 value(s) for the same disease from the past endemic or epidemic or pandemic events is not valid for a current event(s) as aforesaid metrics are subject to time, location, population metrics and genotype/phenotype of the pathogen(s), modes of transmission, and sessional variations.

An outbreak of infectious disease is expected to prevail if R0 is &gt;1 and ebb if R0 is&lt;1 (J Math Biol. 1990;28:365). The primary factors that define R0 value are: a. the time duration of contagiousness (transmissibility of the diseases by direct or indirect contact with an infected person) after an individual is infected, b. the likelihood of infection per contact between a susceptible person and c. the rate of contact (number of times of an infectious person or vector (a live organism(s) or inanimate object as a tool to transfer the pathogen) with another person (St. Meth.

To explore trust in key professionals among the Italian population, we focused on perceived change in trust during the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN Nationwide online cross-sectional survey (called COCOS). METHODS COCOS was conducted in Italy in two periods: the end of the first lockdown (T1: April-May 2020) and the end of 2020 (T2: November-December 2020). Descriptive analyses and multivariable logistic regressions were performed (sample size = 2673). RESULTS Trust in healthcare workers (HCWs) was reduced in 1.5% of participants (T1) and 2.8% (T2). Trust in scientists/researchers was reduced in 5.8% (T1) and 7.6% (T2). Trust in politicians was reduced in 37.6% (T1) and 52.3% (T2). Trust in journalists was reduced in 41.7% (T1) and 48.3% (T2). Considering multivariable models, participants of the second period, participants who were HCWs, participants with anxiety symptoms, and those experiencing economic struggle due to the pandemic had a higher likelihood of having a reduced trust. The period had the strongest association with reduced trust. CONCLUSIONS We argue that a central role might be played by the pandemic fatigue. We suggest leading figures should be more aware of the relationship between communication and trust. The pandemic is a real-world experiment in reshaping mediated communication and, although social media play an important role, other approaches might be successful. As a notable part of the population is trusting politicians and media less and less, Italian key professionals should implement initiatives to reinvigorate public support.","output":"Is the pandemic leading to a crisis of trust?

To better recognise the trends and characteristics of toxocariasis research, this study is a bibliometric analysis of the global toxocariasis research. METHODS: Searches were completed on April 5, 2016, using the Scopus database. A search without any language restriction was performed to extract publications dealing with toxocariasis. Terms related to toxocariasis were used to perform a title keyword search. RESULTS: A total of 2765 publications comprising 11 document types and published between 1932 and 2015 were included in the analysis. Articles were the most popular document form, accounting for 83.62% of all publications, followed by letters (3.80%) and reviews (3.4%). The annual number of research publications increased from 30 in 1980 to 111 in 2015, indicating that the number of publications on toxocariasis has increased slowly over the past 35 years. The United States of America and Japan are the predominant countries of origin, with 303 articles and 207 articles, respectively, followed by Brazil and the United Kingdom, with 180 (6.5%) each. The h-index for all the publications was 60. The highest h-index were for publications from the United Kingdom (h-index value = 43) and the United States (h-index value = 39); these two countries were also involved with the highest number of international collaborations, with 27 and 28 countries, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Developed countries, including the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy, are the worlds leaders in toxocariasis research, contributing to more than 34% of the total published literature. In addition, developing countries, such as Brazil, Poland, Argentina and India, showed a noticeable increase in published papers on toxocariasis research in recent years. A push for more collaboration is needed to achieve a superior research strategy related to toxocariasis at the global level from the viewpoint of epidemiological data, clinical aspects, medical ecology, molecular aspects and treatment practices associated with toxocariasis.","output":"Global toxocariasis research trends from 1932 to 2015: a bibliometric analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Beauty and the Beast: Music from the Motion Picture Soundtrack Gee, Officer Krupke, From West Side Story: For Concert Band The Billboard Hot 100 50th Anniversary Songbook (Contains a selection by Blitzstein) MADELYN BYRNE In a Winter Landscape for Standard or Bass Flute and Computer-Generated Track","output":"Music Received"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Graphical abstract A mouse model to study uterine specific contributions to pregnancy.Maternal environmental exposures can exert impacts on the ability of the uterus to sustain healthy pregnancy. To establish an in vivo model to study this, we designed an ovariectomized mouse embryo transfer model. The rationale being future studies could expose recipient female mice to variables such as altered diet, drug, temperature, air, or activity exposure among others to define their impacts on the uterine contribution to pregnancy. Ovariectomy ensures the extent of the variable is limited to exploring outcomes on uterine but not ovarian function. Embryo transfer from healthy, unexposed donor mice guarantees that any impacts of the variable are attributed to the maternal uterine but not the embryonic state. Pregnancy outcomes including pregnancy success (number of implantation sites) and viability (number of viable vs resorbing implantation sites) can be investigated. Numerous functional outcomes can be assessed, including developmental competence encompassing decidual, placental, fetal, and vascular morphology and/or function (e.g. measured using Doppler ultrasound, comparisons of fetal growth, or molecular or histological characterization of the decidua, placenta, and fetal tissues). Lay summary Many pregnancy complications occur because of problems in the womb (uterus), specifically the womb lining.

A strategy for improved drug therapy is to increase levels of endogenous reactive metabolites for selective toxicity to SARS-CoV-2 by preferential damage to the viral proteome. Key reactive metabolites producing major quantitative damage to the proteome in physiological systems are: reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reactive glycating agent methylglyoxal (MG); cysteine residues and arginine residues are their most susceptible targets, respectively. From sequenced-based prediction of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, we found 0.8-fold enrichment or depletion of cysteine residues in functional domains of the viral proteome; whereas there was a 4.6-fold enrichment of arginine residues, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 is resistant to oxidative agents and sensitive to MG. For arginine residues of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus predicted to be in functional domains, we examined which are activated toward modification by MG C residues with predicted or expected low pK(a) by neighboring group in interactions. We found 25 such arginine residues, including 2 in the spike protein and 10 in the nucleoprotein. These sites were partially conserved in related coronaviridae: SARS-CoV and MERS. Finally, we identified drugs which increase cellular MG concentration to virucidal levels: antitumor drugs with historical antiviral activity, doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Our findings provide evidence of potential vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 to inactivation by MG and a scientific rationale for repurposing of doxorubicin and paclitaxel for treatment of COVID-19 disease, providing efficacy and adequate therapeutic index may be established.","output":"Vulnerabilities of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus to ProteotoxicityOpportunity for Repurposed Chemotherapy of COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pneumatocele is a cavity, which may develop rarely as a complication of pneumonia.

METHODS: Cross-sectional online survey of parents with children < 18 years old in Chicago and Cook County, Illinois, in June 2020. We used logistic regression to determine the odds of parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (VH) for racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups, controlling for sociodemographic factors and the sources where parents obtain information regarding COVID-19. RESULTS: Surveys were received from 1702 parents and 1425 were included in analyses. Overall, 33% of parents reported VH for their child. COVID-19 VH was higher among non-Hispanic Black parents compared with non-Hispanic White parents (Odds Ratio (OR) 2.65, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): (1.99C3.53), parents of publicly insured children compared with privately insured (OR 1.93, (1.53C2.42)) and among lower income groups. Parents receive information about COVID-19 from a variety of sources, and those who report using family, internet and health care providers as information sources (compared to those who dont use each respective source) had lower odds of COVID-19 VH for their children.

During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, ECT services have come under pressure or needed to close because of redirected resources and safety reasons. We investigated the impact of C/M-ECT discontinuation on relapse in patients with unipolar depressive disorder in Flanders, Belgium. METHODS: Between March 30 and June 18, 2020, all patients receiving C/M-ECT in 2 ECT centers were included. Continuation or maintenance electroconvulsive therapy was discontinued in 33 patients and continued in 4 patients. Relapse was defined as the need to restart ECT or the need for hospitalization. Depressive symptoms were assessed every 3 weeks using the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Clinical Global Impression Scale, and 2 additional patient-rated questions. RESULTS: Relapse in the discontinuation group was 60.6%. All 4 patients who continued ECT remained remitted. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed significantly shorter relapse rates for patients receiving bitemporal and/or frequent C/M-ECT (1- to 2-week intervals). Patients older than 60 years showed longer survival rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm earlier prospective and retrospective data regarding the efficacy and importance of C/M-ECT as relapse prevention. After treatment discontinuation, close monitoring of early warning signs for relapse is crucial, especially in the first few months.

The purpose of this study was to establish the effect of physical education programs on the physical activity and emotional well-being of primary school children. (2) Methods: The experimental group comprised 45 girls and 44 boys aged 6C7 years (First Grade) and 48 girls and 46 boys aged 8C9 years (Second Grade), while the control group comprised 43 girls and 46 boys aged 6C7 years (First Grade) and 47 girls and 45 boys aged 8C9 years (Second Grade). All children attended the same school. The Childrens Physical Activity Questionnaire was used, which is based on the Childrens Leisure Activities Study Survey questionnaire, which includes activities specific to young children (e.g., playing in a playhouse). Emotional well-being status was explored by estimating three main dimensions: somatic anxiety, personality anxiety, and social anxiety. The Revised Childrens Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) was used. (3) Results: When analysing the pre-test results of physical activity of the 6C7- and 8C9-year-old children, it turned out that both the First Grade (92.15 MET, min/week) and Second Grade (97.50 MET, min/week) participants in the experimental group were physically active during physical education lessons. When exploring the results of somatic anxiety in EG (4.95  1.10 points), both before and after the experiment, we established that somatic anxiety in EG was 4.55  1.00 points after the intervention program, demonstrating lower levels of depression, seclusion, somatic complaints, aggression, and delinquent behaviours (F = 4.785, p < 0.05, P = 0.540).

METHODS Using Monitoring the Future data (N = 1244 young adults, modal age: 19, Fall 2020 supplement), we examined internalizing symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 separately), dividing the sample into those without clinically significant scores, significant scores but minimal pandemic-attributed symptoms, and significant scores with substantial pandemic-attributed symptoms. Logistic regression analyses linked demographic factors, pandemic-related experiences, and coping methods to symptom groups. RESULTS Internalizing symptoms were highly prevalent, with many occurring among a majority at least several days over the past 2 weeks. Major changes in education, employment, and resource availability predicted elevated symptom risk (e.g., lacking a place to sleep or money for rent, gas, or food led to 4.43 [95% confidence interval: 2.59-7.55] times the risk of high depressive symptoms significantly attributed to the pandemic). High internalizing symptoms were linked to underutilization of healthy coping behaviors, substance use overutilization, and dietary changes. High depressive and anxious symptoms attributed to the pandemic were marked by high levels of taking breaks from the news/social media and contacting healthcare providers.

This paper focuses on barriers recognised in wellbeing-related travel by addressing two research questions: 1) Who agree that their wellbeing would increase if they could make more trips? and 2) What are the transport-related barriers identified in making trips important to wellbeing? The analyses are based on a survey conducted in Tampere, Finland in autumn 2020. 484 responses were collected from adults aged 18 and older. The results indicate that having a car and having access to use a car play an important role in wellbeing-related travel. Having a driving licence did not have a similar effect suggesting that driving licence ownership may be more voluntary compared to car ownership or access to car. Many barriers, such as cost of travel, travel time and location of destinations, were identified by those who agree that their wellbeing would increase if they were able to make more trips compared to those who disagreed with the statement. This implies that those who think that their wellbeing could increase with more travel encounter many barriers in travel. It is noted that the survey was planned before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Screening of the 3 libraries resulted in the identification of several novel compounds that effectively inhibited the CPE of SARS CoV in vitrocompounds which will serve as excellent lead candidates for further evaluation. At a 10-M concentration, 3 compounds with selective indexes (SI50) of > 53 were discovered.","output":"Development and Validation of a High-Throughput Screen for Inhibitors of SARS CoV and Its Application in Screening of a 100,000-Compound Library"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the world was facing a rapidly progressing COVID-19 second wave, a policy paradox emerged. On the one side, much more was known by Autumn 2020 about the mechanisms underpinning the spread and lethality of Sars-CoV-2. On the other side, how such knowledge should be translated by policymakers into containment measures appeared to be much more controversial and debated than during the first wave in Spring. Value-laden, conflicting views in the scientific community emerged about both problem definition and subsequent solutions surrounding the epidemiological emergency, which underlined that the COVID-19 global crisis had evolved towards a full-fledged policy wicked problem. With the aim to make sense of the seemingly paradoxical scientific disagreement around COVID-19 public health policies, we offer an ethical analysis of the scientific views encapsulated in the Great Barrington Declaration and of the John Snow Memorandum, two scientific petitions that appeared in October 2020. We show that how evidence is interpreted and translated into polar opposite advice with respect to COVID-19 containment policies depends on a different ethical compass that leads to different prioritization decisions of ethical values and societal goals. We then highlight the need for a situated approach to public health policy, which recognizes that policies are necessarily value-laden, and need to be sensitive to context-specific and historic socio-cultural and socio-economic nuances.","output":"The COVID-19 wicked problem in public health ethics: conflicting evidence, or incommensurable values?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to societal grand challenges, professors have unique opportunities to effect change, repurposing their expertise to deploy relevant, timely, practical, and research-backed knowledge for the betterment of communities.

These changes may have had negative ramifications on anxiety and both physical and psychological readiness to return to sport in youth athletes. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: Our purpose was to investigate the relationships between the physical and mental health ramifications on youth athletes during restricted sport activities that resulted from COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. Our hypothesis was that youth athletes who participated in a similar or greater volume of organized sports would have less anxiety during the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders compared with those who reported a decrease in organized sport volume. METHODS: Our cross-sectional study evaluated male and female athletes who competed in club sports (e.g., non-school sponsored) at the time of questionnaire completion. All participants completed an online questionnaire between July 15, 2020 and August 10, 2020. We asked participants to report the average hours/week they spent in organized sports or physical activity unrelated to their sport prior to COVID-19 and currently. We grouped participants on whether they had a decrease or increase/no change in their reported activity level. Participants also completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 192 participants (13.02.2 years of age; range= 6-18 years, 56% female) completed the study. On average, participants reported 2.3 (SD+5.2) fewer hours of sport training per week during the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders compared to prior. Over half (56%) of participants reported a decreased training volume during stay-at-home orders, and 44% reported a similar or increased training volume (Table 1). The respondents reporting decreased training volumes had significantly greater anxiety scores than those who reported similar training volumes (Figure 1). After adjusting for the potential confounders of age, sex, and body size, decreased training volumes during stay-at-home orders were significantly associated with higher anxiety levels ( coefficient = 2.02; 95% confidence interval = 0.64, 3.41; p = 0.005). Those with decreased training volumes were more likely to report feeling undertrained (72% vs 30%, p<0.001) and less physically ready to return to sport (56% vs 88%, p<0.001) compared to those with similar/increased training volumes (Table 1). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in decreased training volumes and higher anxiety scores (mean difference= 1.9 GAD-7 points, 95% confidence interval= 0.6, 3.2) compared with athletes who reported similar/increased training volumes. Lastly, those in the decreased training cohort felt both under-trained and less physically ready to return to sports.","output":"Sports and Physical Activity Attenuate the Emotional Toll of the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleic acid vaccines have become a revolutionary technology to give a fast, safe, cost-effective and efficient response against viral infections, such as SARS-CoV-2 or Human papillomavirus (HPV). However, to ensure their effectiveness, the development of adequate methods to protect, carry, and deliver nucleic acids is fundamental. In this work, nanoparticles (NPs) of chitosan (CS)-tripolyphosphate (TPP)-plasmid DNA (pDNA) were thoroughly modulated and characterized, by measuring the charge and size through dynamic light scattering (DLS) and morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Stability, cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of NPs were also evaluated. Finally, the effect of polyplexes on the expression of HPV E7 antigen in human fibroblast and RAW cells was investigated through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR. The results showed NPs with a spherical/oval shape, narrow size distribution <180 nm and positive zeta potentials (>20 mV) and good stability after one month of storage at 4 C in formulation buffer or when incubated in culture medium and trypsin. In vitro studies of NPs cytotoxicity revealed that the elimination of formulation buffers led to an improvement in the rate of cell viability. The E7 antigen transcription was also increased for NPs obtained with high pDNA concentration (60 g/mL).

To date, there are no clinical studies comparing TB and other energy sources, such as standard electrosurgery (ES), ultrasonic coagulating shears (US) and electrothermal bipolar vessel sealers (EBVS) in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection (LCR). The aim of this study was to compare outcomes and costs in patients undergoing LCR with TB, US, EBVS, or ES for both benign and malignant colorectal diseases. METHODS This study is a retrospective analysis of a prospective database of patients undergoing LCR. Unselected consecutive patients who had the laparoscopic dissection conducted by using TB were compared with consecutive patients undergoing LCR with US, EBVS, or ES. RESULTS Mean operative time did not significantly differ between the groups (P = .947). Estimated blood loss was significantly higher in the ES group (P < .001). Device-related complications occurred in 2.5% of ES patients, in 2.5% of US patients, and in 5% of EBVS patients, while no complications occurred in TB patients (P = .768). No significant differences were observed in postoperative complication rates between the groups. Mean postoperative hospital stay was similar in the groups.

Aerosols can settle in reasonable distance when they are over 10m. For aerosols less than 10m, they take progressively longer time for the aerosol to settle. For aerosols less than 5 m, they are practically unsettleable. For aerosols less than 1m (i.e., submicron aerosols), they practically stay airborne indefinitely, and people can easily inhale these submicron aerosols through the respiratory system. By virtue of their small size, they can pass to the vascular circulation to different organs causing potential chronic and acute diseases. This is even more so for nanoaerosols (NAs), less than 100nm. Unfortunately, we are surrounded by submicron aerosols and nanoaerosols in our daily environment. In indoors, a common source of these tiny aerosols can be found in cooking simple breakfast, such as toasting bread, to more sophisticated broiling and frying. Tobacco smoking, burning candles and incense, using cleaning detergents, and wearing perspiration suppresser can release these tiny aerosols in the air. In outdoors, these aerosols can be present in high concentrations from emissions of road traffic, power plants, biomass plants, and commercial kitchen exhaust to incineration plants. Not only these submicron aerosols and nanoaerosols might have harmful chemical ingredients but they can also carry viruses and tiny bacteria. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and its variants (such as Delta variant which are highly contagious and infectious) are good examples showing wide-spread human-to-human infection as a result of airborne transmission of the virus. Unfortunately, this aspect has escaped attention by the public authorities in early part of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and even to some extent as of today. In environment with low relative humidity, the liquid content from droplet aerosol can further evaporate resulting in much smaller size for the aerosols that can be airborne even farther.

While Agambens comments have been criticized as exaggerated and conspiratorial, they arise from the conceptual constellation that he has developed starting from the first volume of his Homo Sacer series. At the centre of this constellation is the relation between the concepts of sovereign power and bare life, whose articulation in the figure of homo sacer Agamben traces from the Antiquity to the present. We shall demonstrate that any such articulation is impossible due to the belonging of these concepts to different planes, respectively empirical and transcendental, which Agamben brings together in a problematic fashion. His account of the sovereign state of exception collapses a plurality of empirical states of exception into a zone of indistinction between different exceptional states and the normal state and then elevates this very indistinction to the transcendental condition of intelligibility of politics as such. Conversely, the notion of bare life, originally posited as the transcendental condition of possibility of positive forms of life, is recast as an empirical figure, whose sole form is the absence of form. We conclude that this problematic articulation should be abandoned for a theory that rather highlights the non-relation between sovereign power and bare life, which conditions the possibility of resistance and transformation that remains obscure in Agambens thought.","output":"A Farewell to Homo Sacer?

METHODS: In 2007, the Kenyan Ministry of Health with technical support from the CDC-Kenya established a national sentinel surveillance system for influenza. At 11 hospitals, for every hospitalized patient with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), and for the first three outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) per day, we collected both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. Beginning in 2008, we conducted in-hospital follow-up for SARI patients to determine outcome. Specimens were tested by real time RT-PCR for influenza A and B. Influenza A-positive specimens were subtyped for H1, H3, H5, and (beginning in May 2009) A(H1N1)pdm09. RESULTS: From July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2013, we collected specimens from 24,762 SARI and 14,013 ILI patients. For SARI and ILI case-patients, the median ages were 12 months and 16 months, respectively, and 44% and 47% were female. In all, 2,378 (9.6%) SARI cases and 2,041 (14.6%) ILI cases were positive for influenza viruses. Most influenza-associated SARI cases (58.6%) were in children <2 years old. Of all influenza-positive specimens, 78% were influenza A, 21% were influenza B, and 1% were influenza A/B coinfections. Influenza circulated in every month. In four of the six years influenza activity peaked during JulyCNovember. Of 9,419 SARI patients, 2.7% died; the median length of hospitalization was 4 days. CONCLUSIONS: During six years of surveillance in Kenya, influenza was associated with nearly 10 percent of hospitalized SARI cases and one-sixth of outpatient ILI cases. Most influenza-associated SARI and ILI cases were in children <2 years old; interventions to reduce the burden of influenza, such as vaccine, could consider young children as a priority group.","output":"Results From the First Six Years of National Sentinel Surveillance for Influenza in Kenya, July 2007CJune 2013"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sugammadex is a synthetic -cyclodextrin derivative designed to selectively bind to steroidal neuromuscular blocking agents and reverse their effects. Although many cases of sugammadex-induced anaphylaxis have been reported, few studies have investigated the underlying mechanism. CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old Japanese man underwent a laryngectomy under general anesthesia. One month before laryngectomy, he had undergone laryngoscopy under general anesthesia and received sugammadex administration without causing hypersensitivity. He had no history of allergies. The operation was finished without complications. Shortly after sugammadex administration, his blood pressure dropped to approximately 70 mmHg, and his heart rate increased to 110 beats/minute with systemic erythema. Suspecting anaphylaxis, he was treated with the intravenous injection of phenylephrine, d-chlorpheniramine, and hydrocortisone. After these treatments, his cardiovascular condition stabilized. Eight months after the event, skin prick tests and intradermal tests with all agents used during general anesthesia were performed. Intradermal tests showed positive results only for sugammadex. Subsequently, basophil activation tests with CD203c were performed using sugammadex, -cyclodextrin, and positive controls (anti-immunoglobulin-E and formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine). In addition to both controls, sugammadex, but not -cyclodextrin, induced significant upregulation of CD203c expression. We performed additional basophil activation tests with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, to investigate the mechanism underlying sugammadex-induced basophil activation. The inhibitory effect of wortmannin on basophil activation due to sugammadex was similar to that of anti-immunoglobulin-E, suggesting an immunoglobulin-E-dependent mechanism. Although the patient showed no hypersensitivity after the first exposure of sugammadex, anaphylaxis appeared after the second administration. Because most cases of sugammadex-induced anaphylaxis reportedly appeared after first administration, this seems to be a rare case. CONCLUSIONS: In the present case, sugammadex-induced anaphylaxis might have occurred through an immunoglobulin-E-dependent mechanism and not involve -cyclodextrin as an epitope. Physicians should pay attention to the occurrence of sugammadex-induced anaphylaxis even when the patient has a history of safe administration of sugammadex.","output":"Possible immunoglobulin-E-dependent sugammadex-induced anaphylaxis caused by an epitope other than -cyclodextrin: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of COVID-19, a novel respiratory infection, has become one of the most significant events in the history of infectious diseases over the past 100 years.

These children are at an increased risk of developing a mental illness themselves (1) as well as a physical illness (2). While research has identified numerous evidence-based family-oriented interventions, little is known about how to implement such interventions effectively and efficiently in clinical practice in Germany. This implementation study (ci-chimps) evaluates three clinical implementation projects with three different implementation interventions for the optimal implementation of the tailored family-oriented preventive and therapeutic interventions in the CHIMPS-NET (children of mentally ill parentsresearch network) with an implementation model for children of mentally ill parents. METHODS: A two-group randomized controlled multicenter trial will examine changes in family-oriented practice and aspects of implementation at baseline as well as at 12- and 24-months follow-up. The CHIMPS-Network consists of 20 clinical centers. The centers in the intervention group receive the support of all of the three implementation interventions: (1) optimal pathways to care, (2) education and a training program for professionals, and (3) systematic screening for children. The centers in the control group do not receive this specific implementation support. DISCUSSION: While we know that children of mentally ill parents are an important target group to be addressed by preventive and therapeutic interventions, there is often a lack of structured implementation of family-oriented interventions in clinical practice in Germany. Using a randomized controlled multicenter trial design with a large and wide-ranging sample (clinics for adult psychiatry and clinics for child and adolescent psychiatry, university clinics and clinics at the real health care) will provide a robust understanding of implementing family-oriented changes in German clinical practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The CHIMPS-NET-study was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register on 2019-12-19 (DRKS00020380) and with Clinical Trials on 2020-4-30 (NCT04369625), the ci-chimps-study was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00026217) on 2021-08-27, the Clinical Trials registration is in review process.","output":"Clinical Implementation and Evaluation of Three Implementation Interventions for a Family-Oriented Care for Children of Mentally Ill Parents (ci-chimps): Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Multicenter Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has put a great strain on the physical and mental health of health care workers across the globe.

Introduction: Complications following COVID-19 are starting to emerge; neurological disorders are already described in the literature. Case report: This case is about a 20-year old male with a severe COVID-19, hospitalized in a Reanimation and Intensive Care Unit with an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, thromboembolic complication and secondary bacterial infection. This patient had a non-specific neurological disorder with a pseudobulbar palsy, (MRI, ENMG and lumbar puncture were normal), associated 4 months later with persistent left shoulder motor deficit and respiratory failure. Respiratory and neurological check-up led to a diagnosis of the Parsonage-Turner syndrome or neuralgic amyotrophy affecting C5-C6 nerve roots, the lateral pectoral and phrenic nerves at the origin of the scapular belt, amyotrophy and left diaphragm paralysis. Conclusions: This case shows that persistant dyspnoea after COVID 19 infection should lead to a search for a diaphragmatic cause which is not always the result of Reanimation Neuropathy but may also indicate a neuralgic amyotrophy. It is the fourth case of neuralgic amyotrophy following COVID-19. This brings the medical community to consider the risk of diaphragm paralysis apart from critical illness polyneuropathy.

Over the years this prescription tool was updated several times: starting from a paper form without any template (\\"paper TP\\") to a template defined by AIFA to collect specific clinical information, up to a web-based form to collect all information into a database. Over time-critical issues concerning its usefulness have been raised, especially when AIFA established several extensions for TP validity to ensure the social distancing required by the covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, after several years from their establishment, pending adoption of necessary implementing of Ministerial Decree of 25th March 2020, a check of the actual impact of TPs is required, in order to plan their review. This study provide a detailed overview of all TPs active in Italy at the 11th May 2020. From Farmadati database, all drugs reimbursed by the National Health Service (class A drugs) and requiring TP were selected. The consumption of these drugs has been derived from OsMed Reports that make available data of medicines consumption and expenditure in the general population in Italy. The analysis showed that TP is required for the prescription of 935 medicinal products (9.6% of class-A drugs) and 147 different active substances (belonging to 34 different Therapeutic Groups and 66 subgroups). Out of these, 67 (46%) required a paper TP without any template, 72 (49%) a paper TP on AIFA template, and 8 (5%) a web-based TP. The Therapeutic Group with the largest number of active ingredients with TP were antidiabetics (19.7%), followed by immunomodulating and immunosuppressants (9.5%) and medications for asthma and COPD (6.8%). Consumption analysis of drugs with TP showed that this prescription tool covers 943,899,598 r year, equal to 2,586,026 /daThis means that TPs have a very high impact in terms of the prevalence of patients treated on the entire care process. Of all annual s presbed on TP, 46.8% concerned drugs with TP on template AIFA, 34.5% drugs with web-based TP, while the remaining 18.7% drugs with paper TP without a template. This analysis may provide the basis for an analytical case-by-case review of TP maintenance needs, trying to maximize the benefits of this tool and to reduce its possible adverse effects. This review could be helpful to ensure the appropriateness in the drug uses, to enhance the role of general medicine, and to simplify the pathways of millions of patients ensuring the continuity of their care.","output":"[Therapeutic drug plans: how many and which ones?

the long-term. We estimate predictors of four domains of negative attitudes towards vaccines and identify groups most at risk of uncertainty and unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in a large sample of UK adults. Methods: Data were cross-sectional and from 32,361 adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. Ordinary least squares regression analyses examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors on four types of negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial regression examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors, negative vaccine attitudes, and prior vaccine behaviour on uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Findings: 16% of respondents displayed high levels of mistrust about vaccines across one or more domains. Distrustful attitudes towards vaccination were higher amongst individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds, with lower levels of education, lower annual income, poor knowledge of COVID-19, and poor compliance with government COVID-19 guidelines. Overall, 14% of respondents reported unwillingness to receive a vaccine for COVID-19, whilst 23% were unsure. The largest predictors of both COVID-19 vaccine uncertainty and refusal were low-income groups (&lt; 16,000, a year), having not received a flu vaccine last year, poor adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines, female gender, and living with children. Amongst vaccine attitudes, intermediate to high levels of mistrust of vaccine benefit and concerns about future unforeseen side effects were the most important determinants of both uncertainty and unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19. Interpretation: Negative attitudes towards vaccines are a major public health concern in the UK. General mistrust in vaccines and concerns about future side effects in particular will be barriers to achieving population immunity to COVID-19 through vaccination. Public health messaging should be tailored to address these concerns and specifically to women, ethnic minorities, and people with lower levels of education and incomes.

In this study, we focused on finding preoperative MR imaging differences between BRAF p. V600E mutant and wild-type in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma and anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with pathologically confirmed pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma or anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed from January 2015 to December 2020. They were divided into a BRAF p. V600E-mutant group (including 6 pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas and 5 anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas) and a wild-type group (including 8 pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas and 4 anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas). The preoperative MR imaging characteristics of these groups were statistically compared. RESULTS: The wild-type pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma group presented with more aggressive conventional and advanced MR imaging features than the mutant pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma group, including greater mean maximum tumor diameter (3.1 [SD, 0.9] cm versus 1.7 [SD, 0.4 ] cm, P < .05), more frequent heterogeneous contrast enhancement of solid portions (100% versus 0%, P < .001), more obvious peritumoral edema (mean, [2.1 SD, 0.7] cm versus 0.6 [SD, 0.2] cm, P < .01), and lower mean minimum relative ADC (896 [SD, 86] versus 988 [SD, 73], P < .05) and mean relative ADC (1060 [SD, 159] versus 1248 [SD, 116], P < .05) on DWI. However, there was no significant difference in either conventional or advanced MR imaging features between the wild-type anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma group and the mutant anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma group.

Host responses against S. pneumoniae are regulated in part by neutrophils and platelets, both individually and in cooperative interaction. Previous studies have shown that PLY can target both neutrophils and platelets, however, the mechanisms by which PLY directly affects these cells and alters their interactions are not completely understood. In this study, we characterize the effects of PLY on neutrophils and platelets and explore the mechanisms by which PLY may induce neutrophilCplatelet interactions. In vitro studies demonstrated that PLY causes the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from both human and murine neutrophils. In vivo, neutrophil EV (nEV) levels were increased in mice infected with S. pneumoniae. In platelets, treatment with PLY induced the cell surface expression of P-selectin (CD62P) and binding to annexin V and caused a significant release of platelet EVs (pl-EVs). Moreover, PLY-induced nEVs but not NETs promoted platelet activation. The pretreatment of nEVs with proteinase K inhibited platelet activation, indicating that the surface proteins of nEVs play a role in this process. Our findings demonstrate that PLY activates neutrophils and platelets to release EVs and support an important role for neutrophil EVs in modulating platelet functions in pneumococcal infections.","output":"Neutrophil-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Activate Platelets after Pneumolysin Exposure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The goals of this scoping literature review are to (1) aggregate the current research involving socially assistive robots in the setting of geriatric psychiatry and (2) examine the outcome measures used in these studies and determine where the gaps and needs are.

Many questions remain about asymptomatic or atypical infections and transmission dynamics. We used comprehensive contact tracing of the first 2 confirmed patients in Illinois with COVID-19 and serologic SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing to determine whether contacts had evidence of undetected COVID-19. METHODS Contacts were eligible for serologic follow-up if previously tested for COVID-19 during an initial investigation or had greater-risk exposures. Contacts completed a standardized questionnaire during the initial investigation. We classified exposure risk as high, medium, or low based on interactions with 2 index patients and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Serologic testing used a SARS-CoV-2 spike enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on serum specimens collected from participants approximately 6 weeks after initial exposure to either index patient. The 2 index patients provided serum specimens throughout their illness. We collected data on demographic, exposure, and epidemiologic characteristics. RESULTS Of 347 contacts, 110 were eligible for serologic follow-up; 59 (17% of all contacts) enrolled. Of these, 53 (90%) were health care personnel and 6 (10%) were community contacts. Seventeen (29%) reported high-risk exposures, 15 (25%) medium-risk, and 27 (46%) low-risk. No participant had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The 2 index patients had antibodies detected at dilutions >1:6400 within 4 weeks after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS In serologic follow-up of the first 2 known patients in Illinois with COVID-19, we found no secondary transmission among tested contacts.

The content analysis indicates that student teachers understand that there is an environmental problem in relation to water caused by human behaviour, and that its effects have an impact on other areas that are related to the SDGs included in the 2030 Agenda.","output":"Perceptions of Teachers in Training on Water Issues and Their Relationship to the SDGs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of effective and safe vaccines is the ultimate way to efficiently stop the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Built on the fact that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the association of its Spike (S) protein with the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to invade host cells, we computationally redesigned the S protein sequence to improve its immunogenicity and antigenicity. Toward this purpose, we extended an evolutionary protein design algorithm, EvoDesign, to create thousands of stable S protein variants that perturb the core protein sequence but keep the surface conformation and B cell epitopes. The T cell epitope content and similarity scores of the perturbed sequences were calculated and evaluated. Out of 22,914 designs with favorable stability energy, 301 candidates contained at least two pre-existing immunity-related epitopes and had promising immunogenic potential. The benchmark tests showed that, although the epitope restraints were not included in the scoring function of EvoDesign, the top S protein design successfully recovered 31 out of the 32 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -II T cell promiscuous epitopes in the native S protein, where two epitopes were present in all seven human coronaviruses. Moreover, the newly designed S protein introduced nine new MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes that do not exist in the wildtype SARS-CoV-2. These results demonstrated a new and effective avenue to enhance a target protein's immunogenicity using rational protein design, which could be applied for new vaccine design against COVID-19 and other human viruses.","output":"Computational Design of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoproteins to Increase Immunogenicity by T Cell Epitope Engineering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Responses to the COVID-19 emergency have exposed break-points at the interface of science, media, and policy We summarize five lessons that should be heeded if climate change ever enters a state of emergency perceived to warrant stratospheric aerosol injection","output":"Pandemic politicslessons for solar geoengineering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food microbiology is deluged by a vastly growing plethora of analytical methods. This review endeavors to color the context into which methodology has to fit and underlines the importance of sampling and sample treatment. The context is that the highest risk of food contamination is through the animal and human fecal route with a majority of foodborne infections originating from sources in mass and domestic kitchens at the end of the food-chain. Containment requires easy-to-use, failsafe, single-use tests giving an overall risk score in situ. Conversely, progressive food-safety systems are relying increasingly on early assessment of batches and groups involving risk-based sampling, monitoring environment and herd/flock health status, and (historic) food-chain information. Accordingly, responsible field laboratories prefer specificity, multi-analyte, and high-throughput procedures. Under certain etiological and epidemiological circumstances, indirect antigen immunoaffinity assays outperform the diagnostic sensitivity and diagnostic specificity of e.g., nucleic acid sequence-based assays. The current bulk of testing involves therefore ante- and post-mortem probing of humoral response to several pathogens. In this review, the inclusion of immunoglobulins against additional invasive micro-organisms indicating the level of hygiene and ergo public health risks in tests is advocated. Immunomagnetic separation, immunochromatography, immunosensor, microsphere array, lab-on-a-chip/disc platforms increasingly in combination with nanotechnologies, are discussed.

As there was no strong evidence to favor high-fidelity over low-fidelity simulation, and because simulation centers can be very costly to set up with limited resources, we chose SBE mainly in the form of low-fidelity and in situ simulation. We also identified an important developmental goal to train Malaysian instructors on structured debriefing, a critical activity for learning in SBE. Currently, debriefing is often carried out in our centers at an ad hoc basis because of time limitation and the lack of personnel trained.

Going forward, we believe that the use of penumbral imaging with validated MRI techniques, as well as the currently less well-validated computed tomography (CT) perfusion approach, will maximize benefit and reduce the risk of adverse events and poor outcomes when used both early after stroke onset and at later time points. New trials that feature diffusion/perfusion MRI or CT perfusion-based patient selection for treatment with intravenous tPA and or endovascular therapies versus nonreperfused control groups are planned or in progress.

To address this, we conducted an impact evaluation of an ongoing HSS initiative in rural Madagascar, combining data from a longitudinal cohort and primary health centres. METHODS: We carried out a district representative household survey at the start of the HSS intervention in 2014 in over 1500 households in Ifanadiana district, and conducted follow-up surveys at 2 and 4 years. At each time point, we estimated maternal, newborn and child health coverage; economic and geographical inequalities in coverage; and child mortality rates; both in the HSS intervention and control catchments. We used logistic regression models to evaluate changes associated with exposure to the HSS intervention. We also estimated changes in health centre per capita utilisation during 2013 to 2018. RESULTS: Child mortality rates decreased faster in the HSS than in the control catchment. We observed significant improvements in care seeking for children under 5 years of age (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.44) and individuals of all ages (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.58), but no significant differences in maternal care coverage. Economic inequalities in most coverage indicators were reduced, while geographical inequalities worsened in nearly half of the indicators. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate improvements in care seeking and economic inequalities linked to the early stages of a HSS intervention in rural Madagascar. Additional improvements in this context of persistent geographical inequalities will require a stronger focus on community health.","output":"District-level health system strengthening for universal health coverage: evidence from a longitudinal cohort study in rural Madagascar, 2014-2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the past 20 years, a vast amount of research has shown that Augmented and Mixed Reality applications can support physical exercises in medical rehabilitation.

Although several measures can help prevent influenza, vaccination is considered the most effective. This study aimed to assess influenza vaccine uptake among elderly with chronic diseases in Tunisia during the 2018C2019 influenza season, and to identify knowledge, attitudes and barriers associated with influenza vaccine uptake. METHODS: During influenza season of 2018C2019, we conducted a national cross-sectional study among elderly with chronic disease who were attending primary and secondary health care facilities in Tunisia. We collected data regarding practices, general knowledge and attitudes related to influenza and influenza vaccine, using a standardized questionnaire. A multivariate analysis by logistic regression was performed to assess the factors influencing willingness to receive influenza vaccine. RESULTS: Among the 1191 surveyed elderly, 19.4% (95%CI 14.1C21.9) were vaccinated during the 2018C2019 influenza season and 64.7% (61.9C67.3) expressed willingness to be vaccinated in the next season regardless of vaccination status in the 2018C2019 season. Previous vaccination in the 2018C2019 influenza season was the most significantly associated factor with willingness to receive influenza vaccine (adjusted OR = 16.5 [3.7C72.4]). Significant associations were also observed between knowledge of influenza severity for the elderly as well as for those with chronic diseases and willingness to be vaccinated (p < 0.01). Likewise, participants who were convinced by flu vaccine effectiveness and those who were not concerned about vaccine side effects were more likely to be vaccinated (p < 0.001). The main reason that may lead to vaccine acceptance was a doctors recommendation (41.1%), while the two main reasons that may lead to vaccine refusal were concerns about side effects (71.5%) and a belief that vaccine was ineffective in averting influenza illness (33.9%). Doctors were the most trusted source for information about influenza vaccine (91.5%). CONCLUSION: Our study revealed low influenza vaccination coverage among Tunisian elderly with chronic diseases believed to be at higher risk for severe acute respiratory infections and death if infected with influenza.

This essay recounts the emergence of ARDS and places it in the context of the technological transformation of modern hospital care-particularly the emergence of intensive care after the 1952 Copenhagen polio epidemic. The polio epidemic seemed to show the value of manual positive-pressure ventilation, leading to the proliferation of mechanical ventilators and the expansion of intensive care units in the 1960s. This created the conditions of possibility for ARDS to be described and institutionalized within modern intensive care. Yet the centrality of the ventilator to descriptions and definitions of ARDS quickly made it difficult to conceive of the disorder outside the framework of mechanical ventilation and blood gas levels, or to acknowledge the degree to which the ventilator was a source of iatrogenic injury and complications. Moreover, the imperative to understand and treat ARDS with mechanical ventilation set the stage for the early confusion about whether patients with COVID-19 should receive mechanical ventilation. This history offers many crucial lessons about how new technologies can lead to new and valuable therapies but can also subtly shape and constrain medical thinking.

Phleboviruses and other bunyaviruses use their envelope proteins, Gn and Gc, for entry into target cells and for assembly of progeny particles in infected cells. Thus, binding of Gn and Gc to cell surface factors promotes viral attachment and uptake into cells and exposure to endosomal low pH induces Gc-driven fusion of the viral and the vesicle membranes. Moreover, Gn and Gc facilitate virion incorporation of the viral genome via their intracellular domains and Gn and Gc interactions allow the formation of a highly ordered glycoprotein lattice on the virion surface. Studies conducted in the last decade provided important insights into the configuration of phlebovirus Gn and Gc proteins in the viral membrane, the cellular factors used by phleboviruses for entry and the mechanisms employed by phlebovirus Gc proteins for membrane fusion.

Because of the high conservation between these two species and the ability of human cells to fully support CCMV replication, CCMV holds great potential as a model system for HCMV. To make the CCMV genome available for precise and rapid gene manipulation techniques, we captured the genomic DNA of CCMV strain Heberling as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Selected BAC clones were reconstituted to infectious viruses, growing to similar high titers as parental CCMV. DNA sequencing confirmed the integrity of our clones and led to the identification of two polymorphic loci and a deletion-prone region within the CCMV genome. To re-evaluate the CCMV coding potential, we analyzed the viral transcriptome and proteome and identified several novel ORFs, splice variants, and regulatory RNAs. We further characterized the dynamics of CCMV gene expression and found that viral proteins cluster into five distinct temporal classes. In addition, our datasets revealed that the host response to CCMV infection and the de-regulation of cellular pathways are in line with known hallmarks of HCMV infection. In a first functional experiment, we investigated a proposed frameshift mutation in UL128 that was suspected to restrict CCMVs cell tropism. In fact, repair of this frameshift re-established productive CCMV infection in endothelial and epithelial cells, expanding the options of CCMV as an infection model.

METHODS: Data were obtained from the COVID-19 National Data Registry of Mexico, which is an ongoing prospective cohort of people of any age with clinically suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and admitted to 475 monitoring hospitals. This study included pregnant and non-pregnant women of reproductive age (15-45 years) with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. To adjust for underlying risk factors, propensity score matching was conducted for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, smoking, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, chronic renal disease, immunosuppression, age, language, nationality and level of health insurance. The primary outcome was death. Secondary outcomes were pneumonia, intubation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 5183 pregnant and 175 905 non-pregnant women with COVID-19. The crude (unmatched) rates of death, pneumonia, intubation and ICU admission in pregnant compared with non-pregnant women were 1.5% vs 1.5%, 9.9% vs 6.5%, 8.1% vs 9.9% and 13.0% vs 6.9%, respectively. After propensity score matching (5183 pregnant and 5183 non-pregnant matched women), pregnant women had a higher odds of death (odds ratio (OR), 1.84; 95% CI, 1.26-2.69), pneumonia (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.60-2.16) and ICU admission (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.41-2.45) than non-pregnant women, but similar odds of intubation (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.70-1.25).

The primary research purpose was to determine whether yoga improved anatomy exam performance by comparing four anatomy exam scores between the two groups. The secondary research purposes included the following: to determine whether yoga classes including anatomy teaching still conferred acute and long-lasting stress relief by, respectively, comparing a students own pre- and post-yoga stress level and self-perceived stress levels between the two groups; and to determine if a students confidence in anatomy was improved after a yoga session. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in anatomy exam performance between students who received yoga and those on the waitlist (all p > 0.05). For students who received yoga, their average self-reported stress levels decreased after each yoga session, their average DASS (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale) score decreased after a yoga session, but they were not significantly less stressed than their waitlist peers prior to an exam, and their self-reported confidence in anatomy material related to the back, upper extremity, head and neck, and abdomen/pelvis increased. CONCLUSION: With this sample, there was no evidence that yoga sessions paired with anatomy lecture material improved overall anatomy exam performance, as opposed to only the musculoskeletal portion which other studies have looked at. However, yoga acutely reduced stress levels, and subjective feelings of knowledge improvement were noted by participants. Both of these can provide benefits to medical students.","output":"Yoga as an adjunct activity for medical students learning anatomy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) remains the gold standard for confirmation of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) despite having many disadvantages. Here, we investigated the diagnostic performance of chest computed tomography (CT) as an alternative to RT-PCR in patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 27824 patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 infection who underwent unenhanced low-dose chest CT from 20 February, 2020 to 21 May, 2020 were evaluated. Patients were recruited from seven specifically designated hospitals for patients with COVID-19 infection affiliated to Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. In each hospital, images were interpreted by two independent radiologists. CT findings were considered as positive/negative for COVID-19 infection based on RSNA diagnostic criteria. Then, the correlation between the number of daily positive chest CT scans and number of daily PCR-confirmed cases and COVID-19-related deaths in Tehran province during this three-month period was assessed. The trends of admission rate and patients with positive CT scans were also evaluated. RESULTS: A strong positive correlation between the numbers of daily positive CT scans and daily PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases (r=0.913, p < 0.001) was observed. Furthermore, in hospitals located in regions with a lower socioeconomic status, the admission rate and number of positive cases within this three-month period was higher as compared to other hospitals. CONCLUSION: Low-dose chest CT is a safe, rapid and reliable alternative to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in high-prevalence regions. In addition, our study provides further evidence for considering patients socioeconomic status as an important risk factor for COVID-19.","output":"Correlation between Low-Dose Chest Computed Tomography and RT-PCR Results for the Diagnosis of COVID-19: A Report of 27824 Cases in Tehran, Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID) 2019 constitutes a global public health issue. Regarding the emerging importance of the gut-lung axis in viral respiratory infections, analysis of the gut microbiotas composition and functional activity during a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection might be instrumental in understanding and controling COVID 19. We used a nonhuman primate model (the macaque), that recapitulates mild COVID-19 symptoms, to analyze the effects of a SARS-CoV-2 infection on dynamic changes of the gut microbiota. 16S rRNA gene profiling and analysis of  diversity indicated significant changes in the composition of the gut microbiota with a peak at 10C13 days post-infection (dpi). Analysis of bacterial abundance correlation networks confirmed disruption of the bacterial community at 10C13 dpi. Some alterations in microbiota persisted after the resolution of the infection until day 26. Some changes in the relative bacterial taxon abundance associated with infectious parameters. Interestingly, the relative abundance of Acinetobacter (Proteobacteria) and some genera of the Ruminococcaceae family (Firmicutes) was positively correlated with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract. Targeted quantitative metabolomics indicated a drop in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and changes in several bile acids and tryptophan metabolites in infected animals. The relative abundance of several taxa known to be SCFA producers (mostly from the Ruminococcaceae family) was negatively correlated with systemic inflammatory markers while the opposite correlation was seen with several members of the genus Streptococcus.

The first is National Socialism in Germany, which emerged by suppressing both entrepreneurship and democracy. The second is the rise of the Trusts, or dominant large corporations and concomitant decline of small business in the United States at the end of the nineteenth century. Finally, both measurement and perception suggest a decline in democracy as well as entrepreneurship in the contemporary era. These concerns are only exacerbated in the current Covid-19 crisis.

Many previous studies on determinants of educational ICT focus on higher education in developed countries, while it remains unclear whether existing models explain ICT use by instructors in developing countries. This study reports the findings of a qualitative study conducted in three public universities of Ethiopia in order to elaborate determinants of instructors educational use of ICT. First, it presents a conceptual framework of factors that explain instructors ICT use based on literature. Second, based on empirical evidence collected from instructors, it assesses their experiences and opinions in relation to the proposed framework components. In-depth data were collected through focus group discussions from twenty-one instructors. The data were analyzed thematically with ATLAS.ti software. The results confirmed that the institutional, individual and infrastructure-related determinants of the framework are perceived to be relevant in determining instructors ICT use. Moreover, the study revealed the necessity of extending the proposed framework through aspects of management support, course-related factors, students ICT competence and access to ICT infrastructure as new determinants of instructors educational ICT use.

However, predictors of decreased humoral response in patients after heart transplantation remain elusive. Methods In 68 HT recipients who previously received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG (anti-spike IgG) were quantified (LIAISON? SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay) during routine visits. IgG concentrations at or above 33.8 BAU/ml were considered positive, as defined by the manufacturer. Clinical characteristics including the immunosuppressive regimen were assessed. We performed regression analyses to identify predictors of humoral response. Results Of 68 HT recipients (44 (65%) male, median age 54 years (IQR 41-64), median time since HT 7.4 years (1.7-13.0)), 56 patients (82%) were treated with calcineurin-inhibitors, 35 (51%) with mycophenolate mofetil, 47 (69%) with everolimus, and 33 (49%) with prednisolone. 60 patients (88%) received two doses of an mRNA vaccine (50 patients BNT162b2, 10 mRNA-1273) and 8 patients (12%) two doses of the vector vaccine AZD1222. Two patients (2.9%) reported a prior COVID-19 infection. The median interval between the two vaccine shots was 41.5 days (35.0, 42.0). A positive humoral response 40 days after the second dose was detected in 26 patients (38%). Comparing the two types of vaccines used, antibody positivity rates were not significantly different (p = 0.10). Upon multivariate analysis, older patient age (p=0.006), shorter time since HT (p=0.022), male sex in combination with time since HT (p=0.023 for interaction effect), and use of prednisolone (p<0.001 in a tobit linear regression) were associated with lower log-transformed COVID-19 antibody titers. There was no detectable effect of vaccine type or of other immunosuppressive agents. Conclusion Older age, shorter time since transplantation, and treatment with prednisolone appear to be associated with lower anti-spike IgG concentrations after COVID-19 vaccination in HT patients. Overall humoral response rates were low (38%), regardless of the type of vaccine used or type of non-prednisolone immunosuppressive agent.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study that retrospectively analyzed clinical records of health professionals who spontaneously sought the occupational health service of a university hospital center from March to August 2020 for presenting with symptoms and/or for having had high risk contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 and who, in this context, underwent the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2. Results: COVID-19 was confirmed in 27 of the 420 symptomatic professionals vs. three of the 193 asymptomatic professionals (p = 0.009). Of the 371 professionals with respiratory symptoms, 19 were positive for COVID-19 vs. 11 among the 242 with no respiratory symptoms (p = 0.750).

We evaluated a RT-qPCR pooling strategy either as a simplex and multiplex assay, as well as performed in-silico statistical modeling analysis validated with specimen samples obtained from a mass testing program of Industry Federation of the State of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Although the sensitivity reduction in samples pooled with 32 individuals in a simplex assay was observed, the high-test sensitivity was maintained even when 16 and 8 samples were pooled. This data was validated with the results obtained in our mass testing program with a cost saving of 51.5% already considering the expenditures with pool sampling that were analyzed individually. We also demonstrated that the pooling approach using 4 or 8 samples tested with a triplex combination in RT-qPCR is feasible to be applied without sensitivity loss, mainly combining Nucleocapsid (N) and Envelope (E) gene targets. Our data shows that the combination of pooling in a RT-qPCR multiplex assay could strongly contribute to mass testing programs with high-cost savings and low-reagent consumption while maintaining test sensitivity.

Methods: A newly developed [6] mathematical modeling of Epidemics is applied together with a day by day normalization correction accounting for the different number of tests. Results: The new infection cases per day are reasonably described before and around the peak maximum. There are indications that the decreasing part may be well described too. The position of the calculated peaks in time within the Omicron waves indicates everywhere a transition only from the 3 th to the 4 th generation of infected people. The small impact of the next, 5 th generation and the decrease of the new cases per day seem to be related to the combined effect of vaccination and the acquired immunity in a very large part of the population due to Omicron in a short period of time. The calculated cumulative curves support such interpretation. Conclusions: The tracking model describes well the Omicron wave after normalization. The results suggest that a very large part of the population in the three countries have (will have) got some protection against the virus.

Convalescent plasma may offer treatment, but efficacy and safety are not established. Measuring seroprevalence in donors would inform public health policy. Here, we survey blood services around the world to assess the different research programmes related to COVID-19 planned or in progress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood collection services were surveyed in June 2020 to determine whether they were participating in serosurveys or convalescent plasma collection and clinical trials. RESULTS: A total of 48 countries (77% of those contacted) responded. Seroprevalence studies are planned or in progress in 73% of countries surveyed and in all continents, including low- and middle-income countries. Most aimed to inform public health policy. Convalescent plasma programmes have been initiated around the globe (79% of surveyed), about three quarters as clinical trials in high-, middle- and low-income countries. CONCLUSION: Blood services around the world have drawn upon their operational capacity to provide much-needed seroprevalence data to inform public health. They have rapidly implemented preparation of potential treatment when few treatments are available and mostly as clinical trials. At the same time, they must continue to provide blood products for recipients despite challenges of working in a state of emergency.

To determine the best action, we matched exposure information from COVID-19 case investigations with reported test results and calculated the secondary attack rates (SARs) after masked and unmasked exposures. Mask use by both parties reduced the SAR by half, from 25.6% to 12.5%. Longer exposure duration significantly increased SARs. Masks significantly reduced virus transmission when worn by both the case-patient and the contact, but SARs for each group were higher than anticipated.

At the same time, a fraction of the G2 protein, possibly produced independently of the G1 protein, is assembled into G2 homodimers. Kinetic analysis indicates that heterodimerization occurs between newly synthesized G1 and G2 within 3 min after protein synthesis, and that the G1 and G2 glycoproteins are associated as dimeric forms both during transport and after accumulation in the Golgi complex. Analysis of a G1-truncated G2 mutant, which is also targeted to the Golgi complex, showed that these molecules also assemble into dimeric forms, which are linked by disulfide bonds. Both the G1-G2 heterodimer and the G2 homodimer were found to be able to exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. Differences in transport kinetics observed for the G1 and G2 proteins may be due to the differences in the transport efficiency between the G1-G2 heterodimer and the G2 homodimer from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex.

Findings The computational approach with four independent queries identified major drug families, most often and in overlapping fashion anti-infective, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, anti-histamine and neuroactive drugs. Azelastine, an histamine 1 receptor-blocker, was predicted in multiple screens, and based on its attractive safety profile and availability in nasal formulation, was selected for experimental testing. Azelastine significantly reduced cytopathic effect and SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of 6 M both in a preventive and treatment setting. Furthermore, azelastine in a commercially available nasal spray tested at 5-fold dilution was highly potent in inhibiting viral propagation in SARS-CoV-2 infected reconstituted human nasal tissue. Interpretations Azelastine, an anti-histamine, available in nasal sprays developed against allergic rhinitis may be considered as a topical prevention or treatment of nasal colonization with SARS-CoV-2. As such, it could be useful in reducing viral spread and prophylaxis of COVID-19. Ultimately, its potential benefit should be proven in clinical studies.

Here, we report a unique mode of cell migration elicited by the lability of integrin ligands. We found that stationary cells spontaneously turn migratory on substrates where integrin ligands are subject to depletion by cellular force. Using TGT, a rupturable molecular linker, we quantitatively tuned the rate of ligand rupture by cellular force and tested platelets (anucleate cells), CHO-K1 cells (nucleated cells), and other cell types on TGT surfaces. These originally stationary cells readily turn motile on the uniform TGT surface, and their motility is correlated with the ligand depletion rate caused by cells. We named this new migration mode ligand-depleting (LD) migration. Through both experiments and simulations, we revealed the biophysical mechanism of LD migration. We found that the cells create and maintain a gradient of ligand surface density underneath the cell body by constantly rupturing local ligands, and the gradient in turn drives and guides cell migration. This is reminiscent of the phenomenon that some liquid droplets or solid beads can spontaneously move on homogeneous surfaces by chemically forming and maintaining a local gradient of surface energy. Here, we showed that cells, as living systems, can harness a similar mechanism to migrate. LD migration is beneficial for cells to maintain adhesion on ligand-labile surfaces, and might also play a role in the migration of cancer cells, immune cells, and platelets that deplete adhesive ligands of the matrix.","output":"Cell Migration Driven by Self-Generated Integrin Ligand Gradient on Ligand-Labile Surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The limited variation observed among SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences makes it difficult to reconstruct transmission linkages in outbreak settings.

Methods: We performed tiled amplicon sequencing on 307 SARS-CoV-2 samples from four prospective studies and combined sequence data with household membership data, a proxy for transmission linkage. Results: Consensus sequences from households had limited diversity (mean pairwise distance, 3.06 SNPs; range, 0-40). Most (83.1%, 255/307) samples harbored at least one intrahost single nucleotide variant (iSNV; median: 117; IQR: 17-208), when applying a liberal minor allele frequency of 0.5% and prior to filtering. A mean of 15.4% of within-host iSNVs were recovered one day later.

Previously, we showed that, in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and -challenged mice with allergic airway inflammation, rhinovirus (RV) infection increases type 2 cytokine production from alternatively-activated (M2) airway macrophages, enhancing eosinophilic inflammation and airways hyperresponsiveness. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that IL-4 signaling determines the state of macrophage activation and pattern of RV-induced exacerbation in mice with allergic airways disease. METHODS: Eight week-old wild type or IL-4 receptor knockout (IL-4R KO) mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA and inoculated with RV1B or sham HeLa cell lysate. RESULTS: In contrast to OVA-treated wild-type mice with both neutrophilic and eosinophilic airway inflammation, OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice showed increased neutrophilic inflammation with few eosinophils in the airways. Like wild-type mice, IL-4R KO mice showed OVA-induced airway hyperreactivity which was further exacerbated by RV. There was a shift in lung cytokines from a type 2-predominant response to a type 1 response, including production of IL-12p40 and TNF-. IL-17A was also increased. RV infection of OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice further increased neutrophilic inflammation. Bronchoalveolar macrophages showed an M1 polarization pattern and ex vivo RV infection increased macrophage production of TNF-, IFN- and IL-12p40. Finally, lung cells from OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice showed reduced CD206+ CD301+ M2 macrophages, decreased IL-13 and increased TNF- and IL-17A production by F4/80+, CD11b+ macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice show neutrophilic airway inflammation constituting a model of allergic, type 1 cytokine-driven neutrophilic asthma. In the absence of IL-4/IL-13 signaling, RV infection of OVA-treated mice increased type 1 cytokine and IL-17A production from conventionally-activated macrophages, augmenting neutrophilic rather than eosinophilic inflammation. In mice with allergic airways inflammation, IL-4R signaling determines macrophage activation state and the response to subsequent RV infection.","output":"Macrophage activation state determines the response to rhinovirus infection in a mouse model of allergic asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus has recently gained attention of the global community after it was first reported from Wuhan, China It has been declared as global health emergency with implications to all people Droplets of bodily fluids, such as saliva or mucus, from an infected person are dispersed in the air or on surfaces by coughing or sneezing and could be the main source for the further spread of infection All healthcare professionals including Dental Surgeons should help to prevent transmission of this deadly virus It's a virus affecting both human and animals and spreads from animals and person to person in close proximity, similar to other respiratory illnesses, such as the flu This review article mainly highlights the types, epidemiology, transmission and addresses the implications of 2019 n-CoV from the health professionals perspective and discusses the necessary preventive precautions that should be strictly followed in a dental setup so as to prevent further spread of infection","output":"Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak- break the chain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic put governments under pressure to make radical and urgent decisions, and to implement new digital solutions to steer society and deliver public services.

This prospective cohort study of patients with acute stroke and atrial fibrillation, evaluated (1) the risk of recurrent ischemic event and severe bleeding; (2) the risk factors for recurrence and bleeding; and (3) the risks of recurrence and bleeding associated with anticoagulant therapy and its starting time after the acute stroke. METHODS The primary outcome of this multicenter study was the composite of stroke, transient ischemic attack, symptomatic systemic embolism, symptomatic cerebral bleeding and major extracranial bleeding within 90 days from acute stroke. RESULTS Of the 1029 patients enrolled, 123 had 128 events (12.6%): 77 (7.6%) ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack or systemic embolism, 37 (3.6%) symptomatic cerebral bleeding, and 14 (1.4%) major extracranial bleeding. At 90 days, 50% of the patients were either deceased or disabled (modified Rankin score 3), and 10.9% were deceased. High CHA2DS2-VASc score, high National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, large ischemic lesion and type of anticoagulant were predictive factors for primary study outcome. At adjusted Cox regression analysis, initiating anticoagulants 4 to 14 days from stroke onset was associated with a significant reduction in primary study outcome, compared with initiating treatment before 4 or after 14 days: hazard ratio 0.53 (95% confidence interval 0.30-0.93). About 7% of the patients treated with oral anticoagulants alone had an outcome event compared with 16.8% and 12.3% of the patients treated with low molecular weight heparins alone or followed by oral anticoagulants, respectively (P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS Acute stroke in atrial fibrillation patients is associated with high rates of ischemic recurrence and major bleeding at 90 days. This study has observed that high CHA2DS2-VASc score, high National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, large ischemic lesions, and type of anticoagulant administered each independently led to a greater risk of recurrence and bleedings. Also, data showed that the best time for initiating anticoagulation treatment for secondary stroke prevention is 4 to 14 days from stroke onset. Moreover, patients treated with oral anticoagulants alone had better outcomes compared with patients treated with low molecular weight heparins alone or before oral anticoagulants.","output":"Early Recurrence and Cerebral Bleeding in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke and Atrial Fibrillation: Effect of Anticoagulation and Its Timing: The RAF Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging infectious diseases such as coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), Ebola, influenza A, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in recent years have threatened the health and security of the global community as one of the greatest factors of mortality in the world.

The optimized DnbALFA has 10-fold the level of expression of the starting protein. Following this, different plasmids were developed to create a complex platform allowing a broad range of protein expression organizations and labeling strategies. Our platform showed up to five times better separation between nonexpressing and expressing cells compared with traditional pCTcon2 and c-myc labeling, allowing for fewer rounds of selection and achieving higher binding affinities. Testing 16 different proteins, the enhanced system showed consistently stronger expression signals over c-myc labeling. In addition to gains in simplicity, speed, and cost-effectiveness, new applications were introduced to monitor protein surface exposure and protein retention in the secretion pathway that enabled successful protein engineering of hard-to-express proteins. As an example, we show how we optimized the WD40 domain of the ATG16L1 protein for yeast surface and soluble bacterial expression, starting from a nonexpressing protein.

We examined how changes in food choice motives related to changes in nutritional quality during the lockdown compared to before. A convenience sample of 938 French adults completed online questionnaires on the Qualtrics platform at the end of April 2020. Participants were retrospectively asked about their food choice motives and food consumption during the month before and in the first month of the lockdown. The importance of nine food choice motives was assessed: health, convenience, sensory appeal, natural content, ethical concern, weight control, mood, familiarity, and price, scoring from 1 to 4. Food intakes were recorded using a food frequency questionnaire including 110 foods, 12 non-alcoholic beverages and 4 alcoholic beverages. Adherence to the French dietary recommendations before and during the lockdown was estimated using the simplified PNNS-GS2, scoring from ?17 to 11.5. The nutritional quality of diet was lower during the lockdown compared to before (?0.32, SD 2.28, p < 0.001). Food choice motives significantly changed and an increase in the importance of weight control was associated with increased nutritional quality ( = 0.89, p < 0.001, partial (2) = 0.032), whereas an increase in the importance of mood was associated with decreased nutritional quality ( = ?0.43, p = 0.021, partial (2) = 0.006). The lockdown period in France was related to a decrease in nutritional quality of diet on average, which could be partly explained by changes in food choice motives.

RESULTS: Prevalence of malignancies among hospitalized DM inpatients was 10.9%. Age > 40 years and female sex were significantly associated with increased malignancy risk in DM inpatients. Numerous malignancies were significantly more common in men with DM compared to women, including bronchial, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, head/neck, bladder, esophageal, kidney, and stomach. The most common malignancies in women with DM were breast and ovarian. Head/neck carcinomas were more common in hospitalized DM patients than previous cohorts evaluating outpatients. Socioeconomic characteristics differed between DM patients with/without malignancy. The presence of underlying malignancy did not affect hospitalization cost, length of stay, or mortality in the hospitalized DM population. The economic burden of hospitalized DM patients is increasing over time. CONCLUSIONS: DM inpatients with malignancy display numerous differences compared to DM inpatients without malignancy. Further research characterizing hospitalized DM patients is warranted in order to optimize work-up and treatment guidelines for these patients.","output":"Characteristics of hospitalized dermatomyositis patients with underlying malignancy: a nationally representative retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proteasome inhibitors (PIs) are currently used in the clinic to treat cancers such as multiple myeloma (MM). However, cancer cells often rapidly develop drug resistance towards PIs due to a compensatory mechanism mediated by nuclear factor erythroid 2 like 1 (NFE2L1) and aspartic protease DNA damage inducible 1 homolog 2 (DDI2). Following DDI2-mediated cleavage, NFE2L1 is able to induce transcription of virtually all proteasome subunit genes. Under normal condition, cleaved NFE2L1 is constantly degraded by proteasome, whereas in the presence of PIs, it accumulates and induces proteasome synthesis which in turn promotes the development of drug resistance towards PIs. Here, we report that Nelfinavir (NFV), an HIV protease inhibitor, can inhibit DDI2 activity directly. Inhibition of DDI2 by NFV effectively blocks NFE2L1 proteolysis and potentiates cytotoxicity of PIs in cancer cells. Recent clinical evidence indicated that NFV can effectively delay the refractory period of MM patients treated with PI-based therapy. Our finding hence provides a specific molecular mechanism for combinatorial therapy using NFV and PIs for treating MM and probably additional cancers.","output":"Nelfinavir inhibits human DDI2 and potentiates cytotoxicity of proteasome inhibitors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is already causing a serious disease burden worldwide, this paper analyzed data of a delta variant Covid-19 outbreak in Hunan, China, and proposed an optimal dose-wise dynamical vaccinating process based on local contact pattern and vaccine coverage that minimize the accumulative cases in a certain future time interval.

METHODS: We collected individual information and aggregated data on COVID-19 cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to April 17, 2020. We accounted for right-censoring to estimate the CFR and explored the risk factors for mortality. We fitted Weibull, gamma, and lognormal distributions to time-to-event data using maximum-likelihood estimation. RESULTS: We analyzed 82,719 laboratory-confirmed cases reported in mainland China, including 4,632 deaths, and 77,029 discharges. The estimated CFR was 5.65% (95%CI: 5.50%-5.81%) nationally, with highest estimate in Wuhan (7.71%), and lowest in provinces outside Hubei (0.86%). The fatality risk among critical patients was 3.6 times that of all patients, and 0.8-10.3 fold higher than that of mild-to-severe patients. Older age (OR 1.14 per year; 95%CI: 1.11-1.16), and being male (OR 1.83; 95%CI: 1.10-3.04) were risk factors for mortality. The time from symptom onset to first healthcare consultation, time from symptom onset to laboratory confirmation, and time from symptom onset to hospitalization were consistently longer for deceased patients than for those who recovered. CONCLUSIONS: Our CFR estimates based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained in mainland China suggest that COVID-19 is more severe than the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients, particularly in Wuhan. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the severity of the first wave of the pandemic in China.

Two thirds of these deaths are from preventable physical illnesses such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, which are worsened by weight gain. Antipsychotics are associated with significant weight gain. In REalist Synthesis Of non-pharmacologicaL interVEntions (RESOLVE), a realist synthesis, combining primary and secondary data, will be used to understand and explain how, why, for whom, and in what contexts non-pharmacological interventions can help service users to manage antipsychotic-induced weight gain. METHODS: A five-step approach will be used to develop guidance: 1. Developing the initial programme theory An initial (candidate) programme theory, which sets out how and why outcomes occur within an intervention, will be developed. 2. Developing the search The initial programme theory will be refined using academic and grey literature. The proposed initial sampling frame are as follows: Context: people living with SMI, taking antipsychotics, different types of SMI. Intervention: non-pharmacological interventions. Mechanisms: triggered by the intervention. Outcomes e.g. weight, metabolic adverse events, quality of life, adherence, burden, economic. Searching for relevant documents will continue until sufficient data is found to conclude that the refined programme theory is coherent and plausible. Lived experience (service users) and stakeholder (practitioners) groups will provide feedback. 3. Selection, appraisal and data extraction Documents will be screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria. The text extracted from these documents will be coded as contexts, mechanisms and their relationships to outcomes. 4. Primary data collection Realist interviews with up to 30 service users and informal carers, and 20 practitioners will gather data to support, refute or refine the programme theory. 5. Data analysis A realist logic of analysis will be used to develop and refine the programme theory from secondary and primary data. The analysis will aim to identify practical intervention strategies to change contexts so that key mechanisms are triggered to produce desired outcomes. Guidance will be produced based on these strategies. DISCUSSION: This realist synthesis aims to develop guidance for service users and practitioners on the most appropriate interventional strategies to manage and limit antipsychotic weight gain.

Along with urbanization, an extensive literature has developed that examines the presence of natural areas in urban settings for the benefit of urban dwellers. However, little is known about how much people perceive the presence of nature in different types of areas (such as city or countryside) and the places where they seek this presence. In this article, we present a study of these two questions through the interviews of 52 inhabitants from 13 municipalities (cities, suburbs and other areas) in Southern France. Through the quotes where nature was mentioned, we studied their perceptions of its presence in the different categories of areas they distinguish (city, countryside, mountain, seaside), as well as the various places where they established a contact with nature. Our results highlight the ranking of the areas where such a connection is pursued. Their interviews show both the importance of the residence itself as a place of contact with nature, and of the mobility patterns that make people feel closer to nature, such as relocation, multiple residences, short outings and longer trips.

In the first part of this study, we investigated the correlations among chicken dropping moisture content, environmental factors, and production performance. In the second part, we explored whether the addition of three types of additives added individually could reduce the dropping moisture content. The results showed that the dropping moisture level was not associated with production performance or any environmental factors at different locations at the same henhouse height. The probiotic additive (active yeast) significantly reduced the dropping moisture rate. These findings can improve strategies for dealing with high dropping moisture levels and contribute to the enhancement of chicken production. ABSTRACT: Dropping moisture (DM) refers to the water content in feces. High DM negatively affects poultry production, environment, production costs, and animal health. Heredity, nutrition, environment, and disease may affect DM level. DM has medium inheritability and is related to cage height in henhouses. We examined the relationship among DM level, production performance, and environmental factors at different locations at the same henhouse height and effects of three types of additives. We measured the correlation between environmental factors including temperature, humidity, CO(2) concentration, absolute pressure, and DM levels and laying performance of 934 Rhode Island Red hens. DM level was not significantly associated with environmental factors or production performance. We divided 64 persistently high DM hens into control and treatment groups supplied with different additives (probiotics, anisodamine, and antibiotics). DM levels, laying performance, egg quality, and serum biochemical indices were determined. Compared with the control and antibiotics, probiotics significantly reduced DM levels and eggshell strength while improving yolk color but did not significantly affect production performance. The additives reduced the b value of eggshell color; compared with probiotics, anisodamine decreased serum globulin levels. Exogenous active yeast supplementation can significantly reduce DM levels.","output":"Active Yeast but Not Henhouse Environment Affects Dropping Moisture Levels in Egg-Laying Hens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we describe the advances in the field of pediatrics that have been published in the Italian Journal of Pediatrics in 2020.

In the present study, we propose a compartmental epidemic model incorporating quarantine and isolation compartments to (i) describe the current transmission patterns of COVID-19 in India, (ii) assess the impact of currently implemented NPIs, and (iii) predict the future course of the pandemic with various scenarios of NPIs in India.

RESULTS: We prospectively examined 563 serial samples collected during the virus shedding periods of 50 patients: 150 deep throat saliva (DTS), 309 pooled-nasopharyngeal (NP) and throat swabs, and 104 sputum. Deep throat saliva had the lowest overall reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive rate (68.7% vs 89.4% [sputum] and 80.9% [pooled NP and throat swabs]) and the lowest viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) concentration (mean log copy/mL 3.54 vs 5.03 [sputum] and 4.63 [pooled NP and throat swabs]).

The use of technology to measure older adults' social networks, however, is primarily in an exploratory phase. Multidisciplinary collaborations are needed to overcome operational, analytical, and implementation challenges. Future studies should leverage technologies for addressing social isolation and care for older adults, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Using Technology to Measure Older Adults Social Networks for Health and Well-Being: A Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To counter the outbreak of COVID-19, the accurate diagnosis of suspected cases plays a crucial role in timely quarantine, medical treatment, and preventing the spread of the pandemic. Considering the limited training cases and resources (e.g, time and budget), we propose a Multi-task Multi-slice Deep Learning System (M3Lung-Sys) for multi-class lung pneumonia screening from CT imaging, which only consists of two 2D CNN networks, i.e., slice- and patient-level classification networks. The former aims to seek the feature representations from abundant CT slices instead of limited CT volumes, and for the overall pneumonia screening, the latter one could recover the temporal information by feature refinement and aggregation between different slices. In addition to distinguish COVID-19 from Healthy, H1N1, and CAP cases, our M 3 Lung-Sys also be able to locate the areas of relevant lesions, without any pixel-level annotation. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on a chest CT imaging dataset with a total of 734 patients (251 healthy people, 245 COVID-19 patients, 105 H1N1 patients, and 133 CAP patients). The quantitative results with plenty of metrics indicate the superiority of our proposed model on both slice- and patient-level classification tasks. More importantly, the generated lesion location maps make our system interpretable and more valuable to clinicians.","output":"M3Lung-Sys: A Deep Learning System for Multi-Class Lung Pneumonia Screening from CT Imaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dear Editor, I read with interest the review, Living with HIV in the time of COVID\\\\19: a glimpse of hope by Adadi et al. published in the Journal of Medical Virology.

Development of DV and influential factors were investigated with repeated measures ANOVAs and linear regression models. Results: Individuals with prior DV reported significantly higher DV than previously not affected individuals. However, a statistically significant decrease of DV was found in the group with prior DV. Past DV, childlessness and insecure attachment, but not COVID-19 related stressors predicted current DV.

Oral fluid is not commonly used for assessment of COVID-19 risk. Its molecular profile reflects both local state of the oral cavity, and individual organs and systems, thus suggesting a reliable diagnostic platform. Systemic inflammatory response is known to play a crucial role in development of the coronavirus infection;the cytokine storm determines severity of the disease. The saliva-based diagnostics of clinical course in COVID-19 patients includes determination of IL-6, IL-8, C-reactive protein in oral fluid, in order to assess severity of the inflammatory process. The present study was carried out at the Department of Fundamental and Clinical Biochemistry with Laboratory Diagnostics, and Department of Pediatric Infections at the Samara State Medical University. The study involved 122 persons: 67 clinically healthy individuals comprised the control group, and the group of comparison included 55 inpatients with moderate or severe coronavirus infection (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus as confirmed by PCR and/or ELISA testing. Development of the disease was accompanied by drastically increased contents of IL-6 and IL-8 in oral fluid of the patients relative to the indexes in healthy persons, i.e., several-fold for IL-6 (+ 650%) and even higher elevation of IL-8 levels (+ 26513%), as well as a 2-fold increase of C-reactive protein (+115%). When comparing the immune indexes of oral fluid in presence versus absence of respiratory insufficiency, a significant difference was found for salivary IL-6 (+173%) in the patients with grade 1-2 respiratory insufficiency as compared with patients free of respiratory disorders. Determination of these proinflammatory markers in patients with COVID-19 is of important prognostic significance when assessing development of the disease and its severity. Direct detection of their content in the oral fluid makes this method relevant, and potentially demanded for the outpatient diagnostics, being highly important during pandemics of coronavirus infection and limited medical resources. Examination of oral fluid at the pre-hospital stage is a resource-saving technology, since it does not require additional medical staff to take biomaterial, is non-invasive to the patient, and suggesting a wide range of research items, it can resolve a number of diagnostic issues, e.c., presence of specific genetic material or antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, severity of the inflammatory process and the risk of respiratory failure in the patient.","output":"PROINFLAMMATORY STATUS of ORAL FLUID in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Studies evaluating the natural history of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) are limited.

STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A geographic database from the Rochester Epidemiology Project was used to identify patients with hip pain between 2000 and 2016. Medical charts were reviewed to obtain characteristic information, physical examination findings, and imaging details. The patient data were randomly split into 2 mutually exclusive sets: train set (70%) for model development and test set (30%) for validation. The data were transformed via Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection and were clustered using Hierarchical Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. RESULTS: The study included 1071 patients with a mean follow-up period of 24.7  12.5 years. The patients were clustered into 5 subgroups based on train set results: patients in cluster 1 were in their early 20s (20.9  9.6 years), female dominant (84%), with low body mass index (<19 ); patients in cluster 2 were in their early 20s (22.9  6.7 years), female dominant (95%), and pincer-type FAI (100%) dominant; patients in cluster 3 were in their mid 20s (26.4  9.7) and were mixed-type FAI dominant (92%); patients in cluster 4 were in their early 30s (32.7  7.8), with high body mass index (29 ), and diabetes (17%); and patients in cluster 5 were in their early 30s (30.0  9.1), with a higher percentage of males (43%) compared with the other clusters and with limited internal rotation (14%).

Previously, we found that viremia caused by avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV\\\\J) was eliminated by 21 days post infection (DPI), accompanied by increased CD8+ T cell ratio in PBLs and low antibody levels. Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of PBLs in ALV-J infected and control chickens at 21 DPI to determine chicken PBL subsets and their specific molecular and cellular characteristics, before and after viral infection. Eight cell clusters and their potential marker genes were identified in chicken PBLs. T cell populations (clusters 6 and 7) had the strongest response to ALV-J infection at 21 DPI, based on detection of the largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). T cell populations of clusters 6 and 7 could be further divided into four subsets: activated CD4+ T cells (cluster A0), Th1-like cells (cluster A2), Th2-like cells (cluster A1), and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Hallmark genes for each T cell subset response to viral infection were initially identified. Furthermore, pseudotime analysis results suggested that chicken CD4+ T cells could potentially differentiate into Th1-like and Th2-like cells. Moreover, ALV-J infection probably induced CD4+ T cell differentiation into Th1-like cells in which the most immune related DEGs were detected. With respect to the control group, ALV-J infection also had an obvious impact on PBL cell composition. B cells showed inconspicuous response and their numbers decreased in PBLs of the ALV-J infected chickens at 21 DPI. Percentages of cytotoxic Th1-like cells and CD8+ T cells were increased in the T cell population of PBLs from ALV-J infected chicken, which were potentially key mitigating factors against ALV-J infection. More importantly, our results provided a rich resource of gene expression profiles of chicken PBL subsets for a systems-level understanding of their function in homeostatic condition as well as in response to viral infection.","output":"Chicken peripheral blood lymphocyte response to ALV-J infection assessed by single-cell RNA sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online-learning is a feasible alternative to in-person attendance during COVID-19 pandemic In this period, information technologies have allowed sharing experiences, but have also highlighted some limitations compared to traditional learning Learning is strongly supported by some qualities of consciousness such as flow (intended as the optimal state of absorption and engagement activity) and sense of presence (feeling of exerting control, interacting with and getting immersed into real/virtual environments), behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement, together with the need for social interaction During online learning, feelings of disconnection, social isolation, distractions, boredom, and lack of control exert a detrimental effect on the ability to reach the state of flow, the feeling of presence, the feeling of social involvement Since online environments could prevent the rising of these learning-supporting variables, this article aims at describing the role of flow, presence, engagement, and social interactions during online sessions and at characterizing multisensory stimulations as a driver to cope with these issues We argue that the use of augmented, mixed, or virtual reality can support the above-mentioned domains, and thus counteract the detrimental effects of physical distance Such support could be further increased by enhancing multisensory stimulation modalities within augmented and virtual environments","output":"Enhancing Qualities of Consciousness during Online Learning via Multisensory Interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Optimisation of dopaminergic therapy may alleviate fluctuation-related pain in Parkinsons disease (PD). Opicapone (OPC) is a third-generation, once-daily catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor shown to be generally well tolerated and efficacious in reducing OFF-time in two pivotal trials in patients with PD and end-of-dose motor fluctuations. The OpiCapone Effect on motor fluctuations and pAiN (OCEAN) trial aims to investigate the efficacy of OPC 50 mg in PD patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations and associated pain, when administered as adjunctive therapy to existing treatment with levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCi). METHODS: OCEAN is a Phase IV, international, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, interventional trial in PD patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations and associated pain. It consists of a 1-week screening period, 24-week double-blind treatment period and 2-week follow-up period. Eligible patients will be randomised 1:1 to OPC 50 mg or placebo once daily while continuing current treatment with levodopa/DDCi and other chronic, stable anti-PD and/or analgesic treatments. The primary efficacy endpoint is change from baseline in Domain 3 (fluctuation-related pain) of the Kings Parkinsons disease Pain Scale (KPPS). The key secondary efficacy endpoint is change from baseline in Domain B (anxiety) of the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored Non-Motor rating Scale (MDS-NMS). Additional secondary efficacy assessments include other domains and total scores of the KPPS and MDS-NMS, the Parkinsons Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8), the MDS-sponsored Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Parts III and IV, Clinical and Patients Global Impressions of Change, and change in functional status via Hausers diary. Safety assessments include the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. The study will be conducted in approximately 140 patients from 50 clinical sites in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. Recruitment started in February 2021 and the last patient is expected to complete the study by late 2022. DISCUSSION: The OCEAN trial will help determine whether the use of adjunctive OPC 50 mg treatment can improve fluctuation-associated pain in PD patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations.

Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that ck/CH/LZJ/111113 is of the 4/91 type; however, further extensive analyses of full-length genomes identified occurrence of recombination events. Therefore, ck/CH/LZJ/111113 originated from the recombination events between ck/CH/LDL/091022- and 4/91-like strains at three switch sites located upstream of the spike (S) glycoprotein gene, and the 3 ends of S1 and nuceocapsid (N) genes, respectively. The difference of serotypes and tissue tropisms in kidneys between ck/CH/LZJ/111113 and ck/CH/LDL/091022 may have been contributed by the uptake of the S1 gene by a ck/CH/LDL/091022-like virus from a 4/91-like strain.

We observed that the deposited Li propagates as a creeping solid in the CNTs, presenting an effective pathway for stress relaxation. When the stress-relaxation pathway is blocked, the Li deposition-induced stress reaches the gigapascal level and causes CNT fracture.

Degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx can thus promote vascular dysfunction, inflammation propagation, and organ injury. The endothelial glycocalyx and its role in vascular pathophysiology has gained increasing attention over the last decade.

We recruited 320 subjects (132 cases in sepsis group, 93 cases in nonsepsis group, and 95 cases in control group), then detected the serum GDF15 levels and laboratory indicators, and further investigated the correlation between GDF15 and laboratory indicators, and also analyzed the clinical value of GDF15 in sepsis diagnosis, severity assessment, and prognosis. In vitro, we used LPS to stimulate THP-1 and RAW264.7 cells to establish the inflammatory model, and detected the expression of GDF15 in the culture medium and cells under the inflammatory state. After that, we added GDF15 recombinant protein (rGDF15) pretreatment to explore its prospective regulatory effect on macrophage inflammation and its functions. The results showed that the serum GDF15 levels were significantly increased in the sepsis group, which was correlated with laboratory indexes of organ damage, coagulation indexes, inflammatory factors, and SOFA score. GDF15 also has a high AUC in the diagnosis of sepsis, which can be further improved by combining with other indicators. The dynamic monitoring of GDF15 levels can play an important role in the judgment and prognosis of sepsis. In the inflammatory state, the expression of intracellular and extracellular GDF15 increased. GDF15 can reduce the levels of cytokines, inhibit M1 polarization induced by LPS, and promote M2 polarization. Moreover, GDF15 also enhances the phagocytosis and bactericidal function of macrophages. Finally, we observed a decreased level of the phosphorylation of JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway and the nuclear translocation of NF-B p65 with the pretreatment of rGDF15.

RESULTS: Brazil reached its 50th confirmed case of COVID-19 in 11 March 2020 and, 63 days after that, on May 12, 177,589 cases had been confirmed. The trends for all regions and FU are upward. In the last segment, from the 31st to the 63rd day, Brazil presented a daily percentage change (DPC) of 7.3% (95%CI= 7.2;7.5). For the country the average daily percentage change (ADPC) was 14.2% (95%CI: 13.8;14.5). The highest ADPC values were found in the North, Northeast and Southeast regions. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our results show that all FUs in Brazil present upward trends of COVID-19. In some FUs, the slowdown in DPC in the last segment must be considered with caution. Each FU is at a different stage of the pandemic and, therefore, non-pharmacological measures should be adopted accordingly.","output":"COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil: Where are we at?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyze mobility changes following the implementation of containment measures aimed at mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in Bogot\\\\'a, Colombia.

In Ethiopia, although 39% of deaths are NCD related, the health system remains underprepared, highlighting the clear need for evidence on risk factor distributions to inform resource planning and the health response. Therefore, this review investigates prevalence distributions and sex and age variations of metabolic risk factors among Ethiopian adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This systematic review used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies published until 6 January 2021 were searched from PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest and Web of Science databases, reference lists of selected studies and grey literature. Studies reporting prevalence of metabolic risk factors: overweight/obesity, hypertension, impaired glucose homoeostasis and metabolic syndrome among Ethiopian adults were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. Two authors independently extracted data and used the Joanna Briggs Institute tool for quality appraisal. The random effects model was used to conduct meta-analysis using Stata V.16. Subgroup analyses examined prevalence differences by region, study year, sample size and settings. RESULTS From 6087 records, 74 studies including 104 382 participants were included. Most showed high prevalence of metabolic risk factors. Meta-analysis revealed pooled prevalence of metabolic risk factors from 12% to 24% with the highest prevalence observed for overweight/obesity (23.9%, 95% CI 19.9% to 28.0%) and hypertension (21.1%, 95% CI 18.7% to 23.5%), followed by metabolic syndrome (14.7%, 95% CI 9.8% to 19.6%) and impaired glucose tolerance (12.4%, 95% CI 8.7% to 16.1%). The prevalence of overweight/obesity was higher in women. All metabolic risk factors were higher among people aged above 45 years. CONCLUSIONS A signficant proportion of Ethiopian adults have at least one metabolic risk factor for NCDs. Despite heterogeneity of studies limiting the certainty of evidence, the result suggests the need for coordinated effort among policymakers, healthcare providers, non-governmental stakeholders and the community to implement appropriate preventive measures to reduce these factors.","output":"Metabolic risk factors for non-communicable diseases in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"͹״󱬷,ִϢЧչ߽ѧֵùע лѧγǻѧƵһҪ,ڵǰ,߽ѧڵƶ߽ѧЧԵΪҪ ˲λ,ȷγ̽ѧĿ;ݽѧĿĽѧ,ʵܽ,ǶȵĿϵ,ѧںϵȷʽ,ֵѧѧϰĻ,֤ѧϰЧ","output":"Practice and Exploration of Online Teaching of Organic Chemistry under the COVID Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused financial stress and disrupted daily life more quickly than any prior economic downturn and on a scale beyond any prior natural disaster. This study aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on psychological distress and identify vulnerable groups using longitudinal data to account for pre-pandemic mental health status. Clinically significant psychological distress was assessed with the Kessler-6 in a national probability sample of adults in the United States at two time points, February 2019 (T1) and May 2020 (T2). To identify increases in distress, psychological distress during the worst month of the past year at T1 was compared with psychological distress over the past 30-days at T2. Survey adjusted logistic regression was used to estimate associations of demographic characteristics at T1 (gender, age, race, and income) and census region at T2 with within-person increases in psychological distress. The past-month prevalence of serious psychological distress at T2 was as high as the past-year prevalence at T1 (10.9% vs. 10.2%). Psychological distress was strongly associated across assessments (X2(4) = 174.6, p < .0001). Increase in psychological distress above T1 was associated with gender, age, household income, and census region. Equal numbers of people experienced serious psychological distress in 30-days during the pandemic as did over an entire year prior to the pandemic.

Numerous ecological studies, plagued by methodological deficiencies, revealed a country-level association between BCG use and lower COVID-19 incidence and mortality. We aimed to determine whether BCG administered in early life decreased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adulthood and the severity of COVID-19. Methods This case-control study was conducted in Quebec, Canada. Cases were patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction assay performed at two hospitals between March?October 2020. Controls were identified among patients with non-COVID-19 samples processed by the same microbiology laboratories during the same period. Enrolment was limited to individuals born in Quebec between 1956 and 1976, whose vaccine status was accessible in a computerized registry of 4.2 million BCG vaccinations. Results We recruited 920 cases and 2123 controls. Fifty-four percent of cases (n=424) and 53% of controls (n=1127) had received BCG during childhood (OR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.89?1.21), while 12% of cases (n=114) and 11% of controls (n=235) had received two or more BCG doses (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.88?1.46). After adjusting for age, sex, material deprivation, recruiting hospital and occupation there was no evidence of protection conferred by BCG against SARS-CoV-2 (AOR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.84?1.21). Among cases, 77 (8.4%) needed hospitalization and 18 (2.0%) died. The vaccinated were as likely as the unvaccinated to require hospitalization (AOR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.62?1.67) or to die (AOR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.32?2.39).

Several authors highlighted the role of interleukin-1 (IL-1) as a mediator of inflammation in KD and suggested the possibility of using IL-1 or its receptor as a target of therapy. The use of IL-1 inhibitors in patients with KD has been reported in the scientific literature, but data are largely limited to individual case reports and small case series. We summarized the scientific literature related to the use of anakinra, analyzing preclinical and clinical data. Thirty-eight patients have been described so far, most of them with KD-related complications. Twenty-two were described in case reports and case series, while 16 were patients from the completed KAWAKINRA phase IIa study.

Special emphasis was given to clinical and diagnostic imaging findings, synovia sampling and the treatment regime. Lambs with only mild lameness, liquid serofibrinous joint effusion and lambs showing no bone involvement, as revealed by ultrasonography or radiography, were treated with systemically administered antibiotics selected from results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of E. rhusiopathiae isolated from synovial samples, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Lambs with severe lameness and severely swollen joints were euthanized, and routine necropsy was undertaken with a focus on the joints. Further, a herd-specific autogenous vaccine was produced by a specialized laboratory.

Such targeting is potentially contentious, so rigorously quantifying its benefits and downsides is critical for designing effective and equitable pandemic control policies. We propose a flexible modeling framework and a set of associated algorithms that compute optimally targeted, time-dependent interventions that coordinate across two dimensions of heterogeneity: population group characteristics and the specific activities that individuals engage in during the normal course of a day. We showcase a complete implementation in a case study focused on the Ile-de-France region of France, based on commonly available hospitalization, community mobility, social contacts and economic data. We find that optimized dual-targeted policies have a simple and explainable structure, imposing less confinement on group-activity pairs that generate a relatively high economic value prorated by activity-specific social contacts. When compared to confinements based on uniform or less granular targeting, dual-targeted policies generate substantial complementarities that lead to Pareto improvements, reducing the number of deaths and the economic losses overall and reducing the time in confinement foreach population group. Since dual-targeted policies could lead to increased discrepancies in the confinements faced by distinct groups, we also quantify the impact of requirements that explicitly limit such disparities, and find that satisfactory intermediate trade-offs may be achievable through limited targeting.","output":"Quantifying the Benefits of Targeting for Pandemic Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prolonging non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) used in the control of pandemics can cause a devastating effect on the overall economic and social welfare levels.

Diagnosis of suspected cases is confirmed by nucleic acid assays with real-time PCR, using respiratory samples. Serology tests are comparatively easier to perform, but their utility may be limited by the performance and the fact that antibodies appear later during the disease course. We aimed to describe the performance data on serological assays for COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of multiple reports and kit inserts on the diagnostic performance of rapid tests from various manufacturers that are commercially available were performed. Only preliminary data are available currently. RESULTS: From a total of nine rapid detection test (RDT) kits, three kits offer total antibody detection, while six kits offer combination SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG detection in two separate test lines. All kits are based on colloidal gold-labeled immunochromatography principle and one-step method with results obtained within 15 minutes, using whole blood, serum or plasma samples. The sensitivity for both IgM and IgG tests ranges between 72.7% and 100%, while specificity ranges between 98.7% to 100%. Two immunochromatography using nasopharyngeal or throat swab for detection of COVID-19 specific antigen are also reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: There is much to determine regarding the value of serological testing in COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring. More comprehensive evaluations of their performance are rapidly underway.

However, in industry, these more complex drug delivery systems such as liposomes require more material and time to develop. Here, we report a liposome and lipodisk decision tree with model compounds of diverse physicochemical properties to understand how to resourcefully optimize encapsulation efficiency (EE) for these lipid-based drug delivery systems. We have identified trends with physicochemical properties such as Log P, where higher Log P compounds such as curcumin were able to efficiently load into the lipid bilayer resulting in high EE with altering the drug/lipid (D/L) ratio. Moderate Log P compounds such as cyclosporine A and dexamethasone had significantly higher encapsulation in lipodisks, which contain higher amounts of PEG lipid compared to liposomes. The EE of negative Log P compounds, like acyclovir, remained low regardless of altering the D/L ratio and PEG concentrations. In this study, microfluidic techniques were employed to fabricate liposomes and lipodisks formulations allowing for a reproducible strategy for formulation development. Both liposome and lipodisk of curcumin demonstrated enhanced in vivo performance compared with a conventional formulation in the rat pharmacokinetic study. This combination of approaches with multiple model compounds and lipid-based drug delivery systems provides a systematic guidance to effective strategies to generate higher EE with minimal drug waste and expedite the process for preclinical development when applied to industry compounds.

Superantigen specificity for different V? chains results in V? skewing, whereby T cells with specific V? chains and diverse antigen specificity are overrepresented in the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Here, we characterized the TCR repertoire of MIS-C patients and found a profound expansion of TCR? variable gene 11-2 (TRBV11-2), with up to 24% of clonal T cell space occupied by TRBV11-2 T cells, which correlated with MIS-C severity and serum cytokine levels. Analysis of TRBJ gene usage and complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) length distribution of MIS-C expanded TRBV11-2 clones revealed extensive junctional diversity. Patients with TRBV11-2 expansion shared HLA class I alleles A02, B35, and C04, indicating what we believe is a novel mechanism for CDR3-independent T cell expansion. In silico modeling indicated that polyacidic residues in the V? chain encoded by TRBV11-2 (V?21.3) strongly interact with the superantigen-like motif of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, suggesting that unprocessed SARS-CoV-2 spike may directly mediate TRBV11-2 expansion.

Reverse vaccinology (RV) is a state-of-the-art technique to predict vaccine candidates from pathogen's genome(s). To promote vaccine development, we updated Vaxign2, the first web-based vaccine design program using reverse vaccinology with machine learning. Vaxign2 is a comprehensive web server for rational vaccine design, consisting of predictive and computational workflow components. The predictive part includes the original Vaxign filtering-based method and a new machine learning-based method, Vaxign-ML. The benchmarking results using a validation dataset showed that Vaxign-ML had superior prediction performance compared to other RV tools. Besides the prediction component, Vaxign2 implemented various post-prediction analyses to significantly enhance users' capability to refine the prediction results based on different vaccine design rationales and considerably reduce user time to analyze the Vaxign/Vaxign-ML prediction results. Users provide proteome sequences as input data, select candidates based on Vaxign outputs and Vaxign-ML scores, and perform post-prediction analysis. Vaxign2 also includes precomputed results from approximately 1 million proteins in 398 proteomes of 36 pathogens. As a demonstration, Vaxign2 was used to effectively analyse SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus causing COVID-19. The comprehensive framework of Vaxign2 can support better and more rational vaccine design.

We report a case of ADEM presenting with bilateral optic neuritis temporally associated with the ChAdOx1 vaccine against SARS-COVID19 virus. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old female presented with bilateral optic neuritis following her first dose of the ChAdOx1 vaccine. Initial MRI Brain showed evidence of demyelination within the subcortical white matter, with no radiological involvement of the optic nerves. Visual evoked potentials were consistent with bilateral optic neuritis which was confirmed radiologically on follow up MRI. She was treated with intravenous steroids with improvement both in symptoms and radiological appearance. A pseudo-relapse occurred which was treated with a further course of intravenous steroids followed by an oral taper. The clinical, radiological and serological results were most consistent with diagnosis of ADEM. CONCLUSIONS: ADEM is an exceedingly rare complication of ChAdOx1 vaccine despite millions of doses. While it is imperative clinicians remain aware of neurological complications of vaccines, the importance of vaccination to control a pandemic should not be undermined.

Animal models often fail to reflect a physiological status because of species tropism of virus infection. Conventional cell lines are usually genetically and phenotypically different from primary cells. Developing an in vitro physiological model to study the infection of emerging viruses will facilitate our understanding of virus-host cell interactions, thereby benefiting antiviral drug discovery. In the current work, we first established normal airway epithelial cells (upper and lower airway track) in 2D and 3D culture systems using conditional reprogramming (CR) and air-liquid interface (ALI) techniques. These long-term cultures maintained differentiation potential. More importantly, these cells express two types of influenza virus receptors, 2-6-Gal- and 2-3-Gal-linked sialic acids, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor for SARS-CoVs as well. These cells were permissive to the infection of pandemic influenza H1N1 (H1N1pdm). In contrast, the lung cancer cell line A549 and immortalized airway epithelial cells (16HBE) were not susceptible to H1N1 infection. A virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) on 2D CRC cultures developed in a time-dependent manner. The pathological effects were also readily observed spreading from the apical layer to the basal layer of the 3D ALI culture. This integrated 2D CRC and 3D ALI cultures provide a physiological and personalized in vitro model to study the infection of emerging viruses. This novel model can be used for studying virus biology and host response to viral infection and for antiviral drug discovery.","output":"Coupled CRC 2D and ALI 3D Cultures Express Receptors of Emerging Viruses and Are More Suitable for the Study of Viral Infections Compared to Conventional Cell Lines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the role of information and access in capacity-constrained selection problems with fairness concerns. We develop a theoretical framework with testable implications that formalizes the trade-off between the (potentially positive) informational role of a feature and its (negative) exclusionary nature when members of different social groups have unequal access to this feature. Our framework finds a natural application to recent policy debates on dropping standardized testing in college admissions. Our primary takeaway is that the decision to drop a feature (such as test scores) cannot be made without the joint context of the information provided by other features and how the requirement affects the applicant pool composition. Dropping a feature may exacerbate disparities by decreasing the amount of information available for each applicant, especially those from non-traditional backgrounds. However, in the presence of access barriers to a feature, the interaction between the informational environment and the effect of access barriers on the applicant pool size becomes highly complex. In this case, we provide a threshold characterization regarding when removing a feature improves both academic merit and diversity. Finally, using application and transcript data from the University of Texas at Austin, we illustrate that there exist practical settings where dropping standardized testing improves or worsens all metrics.","output":"Dropping Standardized Testing for Admissions Trades Off Information and Access"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We assessed COVID-19 pandemic impacts on accessing needed sexual health services, and acceptability of alternative service delivery models, among sexual health service clients in British Columbia (BC), Canada. METHODS: We administered an online survey on 21 JulyC4 August 2020 to clients using a provincial STI clinic or internet-based testing service, GetCheckedOnline, in the year prior to March 2020. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with having unmet sexual health needs (ie, not accessing needed services) during MarchCJuly 2020 and the likelihood of using various alternative service models, if available. RESULTS: Of 1198 survey respondents, 706 (59%) reported needing any sexual health service since March 2020; of these 706, 365 (52%) did not access needed services and 458 (66%) had avoided or delayed accessing services. GetCheckedOnline users (univariate OR (uOR)=0.62; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.88) or clients with more urgent needs (eg, treatment for new STI, uOR 0.40 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.7)) had lower odds of unmet sexual health needs. The most common factors reported for avoiding or delaying access were public messaging against seeking non-urgent healthcare (234/662, 35%), concern about getting COVID-19 while at (214/662, 32%) or travelling to (147/662, 22%) a clinic or lab and closure of usual place of accessing services (178/662, 27%). All factors were positively associated with having unmet sexual health needs, with public messaging showing the strongest effect (adjusted OR=4.27 (95% CI 2.88 to 6.42)). Likelihood of using alternative sexual health service models was high overall, with the most appealing options being home self-collection kits (634/706, 90%), receiving test kits or antibiotics at home (592/700, 85%) and express testing (565/706, 80%).

This draws from several lines of literature to set out a comprehensive framework to interrogate and contextualize the reasons teachers invest in creating and distributing YouTube content. The second part of our paper presents findings from an ongoing study of 115 teacher-produced YouTube video channels.

The effective reproductive number of XDR TB in KwaZulu-Natal may be around 2. Intensified community-based case finding and therapy appears critical to curtailing transmission. In the setting of delayed disease presentation and high system demand, improved diagnostic approaches may need to be employed in community-based programs rather than exclusively at tertiary hospitals.

Moderate amounts of exercise have been demonstrated to reduce psychological distress. Thus, the aim of the present study has been to analyse the relationship between psychological stress and exercise dependence symptoms in adolescent, concerning the COVID-19 period. Participants were 50 adolescents (aged 15-17) who trained twice a week for 90 minutes per session.

The physical activity program involved: joint mobility exercises, low-to-moderate intensity aerobic exercise, team-building activities, exercise stations, cardio workout. At baseline and after intervention programs we administered the Exercise Dependence Scale-21, a 21-items scale designed to assess exercise dependence symptoms, and the Perceived Stress Scale that measures the level at which situations in life are perceived as stressful (p < .01). The findings have suggested that after a 12-week recreational physical activity and food re-education, adolescents felt a greater sensation of psycho-physical well-being and that this phenomenon was closely linked to an improvement of the symptoms of exercise dependence.","output":"The exercise dependence at the time of COVID-19 pandemic: The role of psychological stress among adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims Synovial fluid white blood cell (WBC) count and percentage of polymorphonuclear cells (%PMN) are elevated at periprosthetic joint infection (PJI).

The main aim of our study was to compare the predictive performance of all three diagnostic tests in the detection of PJI. Methods Patients undergoing total hip or knee revision surgery were included. In the perioperative assessment phase, synovial fluid WBC count, %PMN, and IL-6 concentration were measured. Patients were labeled as positive or negative according to the predefined cut-off values for IL-6 and WBC count with %PMN. Intraoperative samples for microbiological and histopathological analysis were obtained.

The fact that women often report a negative experience with vaginal childbirth, with physical pain and feelings of unsafety, neglect, or abuse, may explain the high acceptability of elective cesarean sections. The recognition of information needs and of the right to informed choice during childbirth can help change this reality. The internet has been the main source of health information, but its quality is highly variable. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and evaluate an information and communication strategy through a smartphone app with respect to childbirth, to facilitate informed choices for access to safer and evidence-based care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial, with 2 arms (intervention and control) and a closed, blind, parallel design, will be conducted with a smartphone app designed for behavior and opinion research in Brazil, with women of reproductive age previously registered on the app. After completing an entry questionnaire to verify the eligibility criteria and obtaining ethical consent, approximately 20,000 participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention and control groups at a 1:1 ratio. Participants allocated to the intervention group will be invited to engage in a digital information and communication strategy, which is designed to expand evidence-based knowledge on the advantages and disadvantages of options for labor and childbirth and the safety of the care processes. The information is based on the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization for a positive childbirth experience and has been updated to include the new challenges and disruptions in maternity care within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The control group will receive information regarding disposable and reusable diapers as a placebo intervention. The groups will be compared in their responses in generating the birth plan and the entry and exit questionnaires, regarding responses less or more aligned with the guidelines for a positive childbirth experience. A qualitative component to map information needs is included. RESULTS: The digital trial started recruiting participants in late October 2020, and data collection has been projected to be complete by December 2020.

This paper summarizes the substantial methodological improvements and expanding scope of GBD work carried out by WHO over the next 25 years. METHODS: This review is based on a review of WHO and UN interagency work relating to Global Burden of Disease over the last 20 years, supplemented by a literature review of published papers and commentaries on global burden of disease activities and the production of global health statistics. RESULTS: WHO development of global burden of disease work in the Millenium Development Goal era resulted in regular publication of time series estimates of deaths by cause, age and sex at country level, consistent with UN population and life table estimates, and with cause-specific statistics produced across UN agencies and interagency collaborations. This positioned WHO as the lead agency to monitor many of the 43 health-related indicators for the UN Sustainable Development Goals. In 2007, the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) was established to conduct new global burden of disease and related work, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). WHO was a core collaborator in its first GBD2010 study, but withdrew prior to publication as it was unable to obtain full access input data and methods. The publication of global health statistics by IHME resulted in user confusion and in debate over differences and the reasons for them. The new WHO administration of Director General Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus has sought to make greater use of IHME outputs for its global health statistics and SDG monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: WHO work on global burden of disease has positioned it to be the lead agency for monitoring many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Current moves to use IHME analyses raises a number of issues for WHO and for Member States in relation to WHOs constitutional mandate, its accountability to Member States, the consistency of WHO and UN demographic and health statistics, and the ability of Member States to engage with the results of the complex and computer-intensive modelling procedures used by IHME. As new global health actors and funders have arisen in recent decades, and funding to carry out WHOs expanding mandate has declined, it is unclear whether WHO has the ability or desire to continue as the lead agency for global health statistics.","output":"History of global burden of disease assessment at the World Health Organization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a patient who developed acute bilateral corneal decompensation following COVID-19 pneumonia and prolonged intensive care unit ventilation.

To explore this balance, we focus on the popular Bag-of-Words (BoW) framework. Although computationally efficient, the BoW has weak classification power. Thus, many variants have been developed. These variants aim to increase classification power whilst maintaining computational efficiency; achieving the ideal cost-to-accuracy balance. Four factors affecting the computational cost vs accuracy balance were identified: Sampling strategy, Optical Flow algorithm, Saliency of extracted features and overall algorithm Flexibility. The practical effects of these factors were experimentally evaluated using the Dense Trajectories feature framework and the KTH and HMDB51 (a reduced version) datasets. The Saliency of extracted information is found to be the most vital factor - spending computational resources to process large amounts of non-salient information can decrease accuracy.","output":"Factors Affecting the Cost to Accuracy Balance for Real-Time Video-Based Action Recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of patients with bone metastasis increases as medical management and surgery improve the overall survival of patients with cancer. Bone metastasis can cause skeletal complications, including bone pain, pathological fractures, spinal cord or nerve root compression, and hypercalcemia.

It is essential to select surgical methods considering the patients prognosis, quality of life, postoperative function, and risk of postoperative complications. Therefore, bone metastasis treatment requires a multidisciplinary team approach, including radiologists, oncologists, and orthopedic surgeons. Recently, many novel palliative treatment options have emerged for bone metastases, such as stereotactic body radiation therapy, radiopharmaceuticals, vertebroplasty, minimally invasive spine stabilization with percutaneous pedicle screws, acetabuloplasty, embolization, thermal ablation techniques, electrochemotherapy, and high-intensity focused ultrasound.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Epistemonikos, Trip databases, websites of CPG developers, compilers of CPGs, scientific societies and ministries of health to identify documents with recommendations intended to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission during dental care. Reviewers independently and in duplicate assessed the included CPGs using the AGREE II instrument. We calculated the standardized scores for the six domains and made a final recommendation about each CPG. The inter-appraiser agreement was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: Twenty-three CPGs published were included. Most of the CPGs were from America (n=15) and Europe (n=6). The overall agreement between reviewers was very good (ICC = 0.93; 95%CI 0.87C0.95). The median score for each domain was the following: Scope and purpose 67% (IQR 20%); Stakeholder involvement 33% (IQR 14%); Rigour of development 13% (IQR 13%); Clarity of presentation 64% (IQR 31%); Applicability 19% (IQR 17%) and Editorial independence 8% (IQR 8%). Twenty two guidelines were not recommended by the reviewers. Only one of the CPGs was recommended with modifications. The median overall rate was 3 (IQR 1). All CPGs were classified as low quality.

RECENT FINDINGS: Diagnostic and treatment options for managing neurologic emergencies in pregnant patients have expanded with both greater understanding of the effects of imaging modalities and medications on pregnancy and application of standard treatments for non-pregnant patients to pregnant populations. Specifically, this includes cerebrovascular diseases (pregnancy-associated ischemic stroke, pregnancy-associated intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis), post-maternal cardiac arrest care, seizures and status epilepticus, myasthenia gravis, and fetal somatic support in maternal death by neurologic criteria. SUMMARY: With the exception of direct abdominal computed tomography (CT), most imaging studies are reasonably safe in pregnancy. When emergent imaging is needed to prevent maternal morbidity or mortality, any CT sequence with or without contrast is appropriate to pursue. Though new safety data on antiplatelets, antihypertensives, thrombolytics, and antiepileptic drugs have increased options for disease management in pregnancy, unfractionated and low-molecular weight heparin remain the safest options for anticoagulation. Early studies on hypothermia, ketamine, and immunomodulating therapies in pregnancy are promising. In myasthenia gravis, new data on adjunct devices may allow more patients to undergo safe vaginal delivery, avoiding cesarean section and the associated risk of crisis. When difficult decisions regarding preterm delivery arise, recent outcome studies can help inform discussion. Lastly, when the feared complication of maternal death by neurologic criteria occurs, fetal somatic support may help to save at least one life.","output":"Neurocritical Care of the Pregnant Patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Poor air quality affects the health and wellbeing of large populations around the globe. Although source controls are the most effective approaches for improving air quality and reducing health risks, individuals can also take actions to reduce their personal exposure by staying indoors, reducing physical activity, altering modes of transportation, filtering indoor air, and using respirators and other types of face masks. A synthesis of available evidence on the efficacy, effectiveness, and potential adverse effects or unintended consequences of personal interventions for air pollution is needed by clinicians to assist patients and the public in making informed decisions about use of these interventions. To address this need, the American Thoracic Society convened a workshop in May of 2018 to bring together a multidisciplinary group of international experts to review the current state of knowledge about personal interventions for air pollution and important considerations when helping patients and the general public to make decisions about how best to protect themselves. From these discussions, recommendations were made regarding when, where, how, and for whom to consider personal interventions. In addition to the efficacy and safety of the various interventions, the committee considered evidence regarding the identification of patients at greatest risk, the reliability of air quality indices, the communication challenges, and the ethical and equity considerations that arise when discussing personal interventions to reduce exposure and risk from outdoor air pollution.","output":"Personal Interventions for Reducing Exposure and Risk for Outdoor Air Pollution: An Official American Thoracic Society Workshop Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an outbreak, effective detection of the aetiological agent(s) involved using molecular techniques is key to efficient diagnosis, early prevention and management of the spread.

Especially, those living in informal settlements and slums worldwide have been profoundly impacted by this pandemic. Individuals living in these places are already leading underprivileged lives. Thus, the economic and mental health problems caused by the COVID-19 crisis have further exacerbated their living standards, which has resulted, for instance, in tragedies such as suicides. Objective: In this study, we have sought to identify those individuals most at risk of displaying high levels of fear of COVID-19 in an informal settlement located in the capital city of Peru. Methods: A questionnaire was administered to 449 inhabitants living in the Carmen Alto informal settlement. The questionnaire was made up of two parts: the first one inquired about demographic data and the second part consisted of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Results: The demographic variables of age, gender, marital status, educational level, occupation, whether a relative from the household was infected with COVID-19, and whether one of them died of this showed significant differences. It could be observed as well that the groups of females, stable workers, unemployed and those having completed a workforce education are at higher odds of displaying high levels of fear of COVID-19. As expected, the groups that had either a relative infected with COVID-19 or a relative death by this had the highest levels of fear towards the virus. Conclusion: The female participants are more likely to display higher levels of fear of COVID-19 due to the terrible effect that unfavorable events have on them. In the cases of the unemployed and stable workers, their proneness to show high levels of fear towards the virus is because they have lost their incomes, due to the loss of their jobs, and because of fear of infection, respectively. Hence, we hope that this work serves Peruvian (and other) health authorities to develop strategies that help individuals living in informal settlements and are in urgent need of mitigating mental health problems.","output":"Fear of covid-19 among peruvian people living in disadvantaged communities: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundVaccination is key to successful prevention of COVID-19 particularly nosocomial acquired infection in health care workers (HCWs). Vaccine hesitancy is common in the population and in HCWs, and like COVID-19 itself, hesitancy is more frequent in ethnic minority groups. UK-REACH (United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity and COVID-19 outcomes) is a large-scale study of COVID-19 in UK HCWs from diverse ethnic backgrounds, which includes measures of vaccine hesitancy. The present study explores predictors of vaccine hesitancy using a phenomic approach, considering several hundred questionnaire-based measures. MethodsUK-REACH includes a questionnaire study encompassing 12,431 HCWs who were recruited from December 2020 to March 2021 and completed a lengthy online questionnaire (785 raw items; 392 derived measures; 260 final measures). Ethnicity was classified using the Office for National Statistics five (ONS5) and eighteen (ONS18) categories. Missing data were handled by multiple imputation. Variable selection used the islasso package in R, which provides standard errors so that results from imputations could be combined using Rubins rules. The data were modelled using path analysis, so that predictors, and predictors of predictors could be assessed. Significance testing used the Bayesian approach of Kass and Raftery, a very strong Bayes Factor of 150, N=12,431, and a Bonferroni correction giving a criterion of p<4.02 x 10-8 for the main regression, and p<3.11 x 10-10 for variables in the path analysis. ResultsAt the first step of the phenomic analysis, six variables were direct predictors of greater vaccine hesitancy: Lower pro-vaccination attitudes; no flu vaccination in 2019-20; pregnancy; higher COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs; younger age; and lower optimism the roll-out of population vaccination. Overall 44 lower variables in total were direct or indirect predictors of hesitancy, with the remaining 215 variables in the phenomic analysis not independently predicting vaccine hesitancy. Key variables for predicting hesitancy were belief in conspiracy theories of COVID-19 infection, and a low belief in vaccines in general. Conspiracy beliefs had two main sets of influences: O_LIHigher Fatalism, which was influenced a) by high external and chance locus of control and higher need for closure, which in turn were associated with neuroticism, conscientiousness, extraversion and agreeableness; and b) by religion being important in everyday life, and being Muslim. C_LIO_LIreceiving information via social media, not having higher education, and perceiving greater risks to self, the latter being influenced by higher concerns about spreading COVID, greater exposure to COVID-19, and financial concerns. C_LI There were indirect effects of ethnicity, mediated by religion. Religion was more important for Pakistani and African HCWs, and less important for White and Chinese groups. Lower age had a direct effect on hesitancy, and age and female sex also had several indirect effects on hesitancy. ConclusionsThe phenomic approach, coupled with a path analysis revealed a complex network of social, cognitive, and behavioural influences on SARS-Cov-2 vaccine hesitancy from 44 measures, 6 direct and 38 indirect, with the remaining 215 measures not having direct or indirect effects on hesitancy. It is likely that issues of trust underpin many associations with hesitancy.

In this short review, we discuss the evidence for remote healthcare delivery in the context of osteoporosis. INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on the lives of people living with, and at risk of, osteoporosis and those caring for them. With osteoporosis outpatient and Fracture Liaison Services on pause, healthcare organisations have already moved to delivering new and follow-up consultations remotely, where staffing permits, by telephone or video. METHODS: In this review, we consider different models of remote care delivery, the evidence for their use, and the possible implications of COVID-19 on osteoporosis services. RESULTS: Telemedicine is a global term used to describe any use of telecommunication systems to deliver healthcare from a distance and encompasses a range of different scenarios from remote clinical data transfer to remote clinician-patient interactions. Across a range of conditions and contexts, there remains unclear evidence on the acceptability of telemedicine and the effect on healthcare costs. Within the context of osteoporosis management, there is some limited evidence to suggest telemedicine approaches are acceptable to patients but unclear evidence on whether telemedicine approaches support informed drug adherence. Gaps in the evidence pertain to the acceptability and benefits of using telemedicine in populations with hearing, cognitive, or visual impairments and in those with limited health literacy. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need for further health service evaluation and research to address the impact of remote healthcare delivery during COVID-19 outbreak on patient care, and in the longer term, to identify acceptability and cost- and clinical-effectiveness of remote care delivery on outcomes of relevance to people living with osteoporosis.","output":"Identifying and managing osteoporosis before and after COVID-19: rise of the remote consultation?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Delirium is associated with a wide range of adverse patient safety outcomes.

Natural compounds with antioxidant activity may provide a preventive measure against infection. Tea polyphenols were evaluated for their ability to inhibit enterovirus 71 (EV71) replication in Vero cell culture. Among the polyphenolic compounds tested, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and gallocatechin gallate (GCG) potently inhibited replication of EV71. EGCG and GCG reduced the titer of infectious progeny virus by 95%. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis also revealed that EGCG suppressed replication of genomic RNA. It was accompanied by an increased cytoprotective effect. EGCG and GCG caused 5-fold increase in the viability of EV71-infected cells. The viral inhibitory effect correlated well with the antioxidant capacity of polyphenol. Mechanistically, EV71 infection led to increased oxidative stress, as shown by increased dichlorofluorescein and MitoSOX Red fluorescence. Upon EGCG treatment, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was significantly reduced. Consistent with this, EV71 replication was enhanced in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient cells, and such enhancement was largely reversed by EGCG.

In this systematic review, we sought to evaluate time to relapse after the discontinuation of systemic treatment in psoriasis patients. METHODS: Systematic searches of PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were performed for randomized controlled studies reporting time to relapse after discontinuation of systemic drugs in psoriasis patients. In addition, pharmaceutical companies were contacted by the authors regarding missing data from the identified publications. In each publication, the time to psoriasis relapse and the timing of drug discontinuation were carefully assessed. The level of psoriasis control at the time of drug discontinuation and the definition used for psoriasis relapse were taken into account. RESULTS: Thirty articles published before April 2021 were included in the systematic review. Four articles focused on conventional systemic treatments with methotrexate and/or cyclosporine, nine focused on tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, eight focused on interleukin-17 (IL-17) antagonists, eight focused on IL-12/23 or IL-23 antagonists, and one focused on tofacitinib and apremilast. Different definitions were used to define psoriasis treatment success at the time of drug discontinuation. Similarly, heterogeneous criteria were used to define psoriasis relapse. Comparison between drugs was performed indirectly (i.e. across studies) for most drugs. Considering time of 50% loss of maximum Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) improvement, a shorter median time to psoriasis relapse was observed with traditional systemic treatment (~ 4 weeks) compared to biological agents (from 12 to ~ 34 weeks). When using stringent relapse criteria, such as loss of PASI 90, a longer time to relapse after treatment cessation was observed with IL-23 antagonists (21C42 weeks) versus IL-17 antagonists (7C24 weeks). CONCLUSION: Biological agents are associated with a longer time to relapse than oral systemic agents after drug discontinuation. Among biologicals, IL-23 antagonists are associated with the longest time to relapse.

Of 112 health care personnel (HCP) contacts of the index case, 22 (20%) had known unprotected exposures and 37 (30%) did not have known unprotected exposures but interacted with a patient or contaminated environment on multiple days. Transmission was confirmed in 2 HCP who had substantial interaction with the patient while wearing personal protective equipment. These HCP had 40 additional contacts. Of 20 community contacts of the index patient or the 2 HCP, 4 had high-risk exposures. Movement restrictions were extended to all 179 contacts; 7 contacts were quarantined. Seven percent (14 of 179) of contacts (1 community contact and 13 health care contacts) were evaluated for Ebola during the monitoring period. LIMITATION Data cannot be used to infer whether in-person direct active monitoring is superior to active monitoring alone for early detection of symptomatic contacts. CONCLUSION Contact tracing and monitoring approaches for Ebola were adapted to account for the evolving understanding of risks for unrecognized HCP transmission. HCP contacts in the United States without known unprotected exposures should be considered as having a low (but not zero) risk for Ebola and should be actively monitored for symptoms. Core challenges of contact tracing for high-consequence communicable diseases included rapid comprehensive contact identification, large-scale direct active monitoring of contacts, large-scale application of movement restrictions, and necessity of humanitarian support services to meet nonclinical needs of contacts.

Due to the large volume of content that medical students need to learn during gross anatomy courses, it is possible that anatomical self-efficacy may be a contributing factor to feelings of burnout. Anatomical self-efficacy is defined as a students judgment of their ability to execute tasks related to learning anatomy and perform course activities (e.g., dissection). First-year medical students were invited to provide basic demographic information at the beginning of the semester and to complete the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory-student version (OLBI-SS) and the Anatomical Self-Efficacy Instrument (ASEI); at the beginning, middle, and end of the semester, they were enrolled in gross anatomy. Typical descriptive statistics for the demographic information were conducted, as well as, correlational analyses assessing if the information had a relationship with either anatomical self-efficacy or burnout. Female students were more burnt out than male students. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed that students feelings of burnout significantly increased from the beginning of the semester to the midpoint and the end of the semester (p < 0.05). Linear regression demonstrated a predictive relationship between anatomical self-efficacy and burnout (p < 0.05) at all three measurement points in which lower self-efficacy was predictive of increased feelings of burnout.","output":"The Relationship Between Anatomical Self-efficacy and Feelings of Burnout in First-year Medical Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim and objective: This study aims to find out the frequency for touching the various surfaces including mucosal and non-mucosal as well as the use of preventive measures from coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) among individuals visiting the dental hospital in Gurugram, Haryana.

Environmental EDCs are implicated in a range of diseases/disorders with developmental origins, including neurodevelopment and behavior. EDCs are most often studied one by one; here, we assessed outcomes induced by a mixture designed to represent the real-world situation of multiple simultaneous exposures. The choice of EDCs, which we refer to as \\"NeuroMix,\\" was informed by evidence for neurobiological effects in single-compound studies and included bisphenols, phthalates, vinclozolin, and perfluorinated, polybrominated, and polychlorinated compounds. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were fed the NeuroMix or vehicle, and then offspring of both sexes were assessed for effects on postnatal development and behaviors and gene expression in the brain in adulthood. In order to determine whether early-life EDCs predisposed to subsequent vulnerability to postnatal life challenges, a subset of rats were also given a stress challenge in adolescence. Prenatal NeuroMix exposure decreased body weight and delayed puberty in males but not females. In adulthood, NeuroMix caused changes in anxiety-like, social, and mate preference behaviors only in females. Effects of stress were predominantly observed in males. Several interactions of NeuroMix and stress were found, especially for the mate preference behavior and gene expression in the brain. These findings provide novel insights into how two realistic environmental challenges lead to developmental and neurobehavioral deficits, both alone and in combination, in a sex-specific manner.","output":"Prenatal Exposure to an EDC Mixture, NeuroMix: Effects on Brain, Behavior, and Stress Responsiveness in Rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To prepare for potential human infection challenge studies (HICS) involving SARS-CoV-2, we convened a multidisciplinary working group to address ethical questions regarding whether and how much SARS-CoV-2 HICS participants should be paid.

Access to medical consultation became a challenge; hospitals were flooded with cases beyond their capacity and transport was halted due to lockdown. Global Health Directorate of The Indus Health Network supported the provincial government by rolling out several walk-in community-based testing initiatives across Karachi. Results were conveyed to the patients through each district government. With a disproportionate rise in cases, an increasing delay in reporting results was observed. Methods: To help the district government bridge this gap, two physicians were engaged to convey timely results to patients who tested positive, through a helpline. Subsequently, proactive teleconsultation was initiated. We present a retrospective review of data collected during teleconsultation for COVID-19 cases identified through community-based testing between April 5 and June 10, 2020. Results: A total of 4,279 tests were conducted, revealing a 28% positivity rate (1,196 cases). Out of these, 752 (62.9%) baseline positive patients were contactable. Most patients identified either a close contact (46.8%) or a household contact (30.1%) as the source of infection. 41.8% patients were asymptomatic, 52.9% had mild to moderate illness, and 1.1% needed referral to the emergency department. 82.7% patients reported no comorbidities. Conclusion: The rapid surge of cases could not be handled by a small team and an institutional strategy of integration into an existing call center service was adopted.

Vulnerable populations may be defined as those living in poverty, living with disability, and racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minorities. Additionally, as community psychologists we understand that the impact of inequities do not appear singlehandedly since as human beings we do not exist in a vacuum and there are multiple factors that create our level of health and well-being. Therefore, the idea of examining COVID-19 in a syndemic framework allows us to explore how a synergistic epidemic (i.e., the aggregation of two or more concurrent or sequential epidemics or disease clusters in a population with biological interactions) exacerbates the prognosis and burden of disease, which can impact vulnerable populations simultaneously.

METHODS: All presentations to University Hospital Galway with self-harm were assessed during the peak period of the coronavirus crisis in Ireland, over the 3 months from 1 March to 31 May 2020. These data were compared with presentations in the same months in the 3 years preceding (2017-2019). Data were obtained from the anonymised service database. RESULTS: This study found that in 2020, the rate of presentation with self-harm dropped by 35% from March to April and rose by 104% from April to May, peaking from mid-May. When trends over a 4-year period were examined, there was a significantly higher lethality of attempt (p < 0.001), and significant differences in diagnosis (p = 0.031) in 2020 in comparison with the three previous years. The increased lethality of presentations remained significant after age and gender were controlled for (p = 0.036). There were also significant differences in the underlying psychiatric diagnoses (p = 0.018), notably with a significant increase in substance misuse disorders presenting during the 2020 study period. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 showed a reduction in self-harm presentations initially, followed by a sharp increase in May 2020. If a period of economic instability follows as predicted, it is likely that this will further impact the mental health of the population, along with rates of self-harm and suicidal behaviours.

Using a longitudinal design, with data pre- and postevent, a bivariate latent change score model analyzed the covariance of the change in family well-being (FW) and in emotional difficulties (ED), testing if the longitudinal change in ED is a function of the starting level of FW, and vice-versa. Children's stress reactions to the pandemic and other related experiences were included as additional predictors. METHOD A total of 166 middle school students (86 females) with a mean age of 11.14 (SD = .47) completed two online questionnaires, in January 2020 (T0) and in June 2020 (T1). RESULTS Results showed that children's ED decreased significantly, on average, during the lockdown period, and FW remained constant. ED and FW change scores had a significant and negative covariation ( = - .46; p = .01). When family well-being increased emotional difficulties decreased, and vice versa. FW at T0 predicted no change in FW, nor did T0 scores of ED predict any change in FW. CONCLUSIONS The strong intercorrelated change between children's ED and FW during the lockdown does not seem influenced by preexisting levels of individual and family functioning.

The Australian Grace Risk score Intervention Study (AGRIS) explored the impact of the GRACE Risk Tool for stratification of ischaemic and bleeding risk in ACS. While hospitals in the active arm had a higher overall rate of invasive ACS management, there was neutral impact on important secondary prevention prescriptions/referrals, hospital performance measures, myocardial infarction and 12-month mortality leading to early trial cessation. Given the Grace Risk Tool is under investigation internationally, this process evaluation study provides important insights into the possible contribution of implementation fidelity on the AGRIS study findings. METHODS: Using maximum variation sampling, five hospitals were selected from the 12 centres enrolled in the active arm of AGRIS. From these facilities, 16 local implementation stakeholders (Cardiology advanced practice nurses, junior and senior doctors, study coordinators) consented to a semi-structured interview guided by the Theoretical Domains Framework. Directed Content Analysis of qualitative data was structured using the Capability/Opportunity/Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model. RESULTS: Physical capability was enhanced by tool usability. While local stakeholders supported educating frontline clinicians, non-cardiology clinicians struggled with specialist terminology. Physical opportunity was enhanced by the paper-based format but was hampered when busy clinicians viewed risk-stratification as one more thing to do, or when form visibility was neglected. Social opportunity was supported by a culture of research/evidence yet challenged by clinical workflow and rotating medical officers. Automatic motivation was strengthened by positive reinforcement. Reflective motivation revealed the GRACE Risk Tool as supporting but potentially overriding clinical judgment. Divergent professional roles and identity were a major barrier to integration of risk-stratification into routine Emergency Department practice. The cumulative result revealed poor form completion behaviors and a failure to embed risk-stratification into routine patient assessment, communication, documentation, and clinical practice behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous factors negatively influenced AGRIS implementation fidelity. Given the prominence of risk assessment recommendations in United States, European and Australian guidelines, strategies that strengthen collaboration with Emergency Departments and integrate automated processes for risk-stratification may improve future translation internationally.","output":"Objective risk assessment vs standard care for acute coronary syndromesThe Australian GRACE Risk tool Implementation Study (AGRIS): a process evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A Saccharomyces cerevisiae-expressed nucleocapsid (N) polypeptide of the M41 strain of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was used as antigen in a recombinant yeast-expressed N protein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Y-N-ELISA).

In the meantime, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak and the concern over pandemic influenza have stimulated considerable government and health care institutional efforts to improve infection control systems in Canada. METHODS: In 2006, a version of the RICH survey similar to the original RICH instrument was mailed to infection control programs in all Canadian acute care hospitals with 80 or more beds. We used (2), analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance analyses to test for differences between the 1999 and 2005 samples for infection control program components and ARO rates. RESULTS: 72.3% of Canadian acute care hospitals completed the RICH survey for 1999 and 60.1% for 2005. Hospital size was controlled for in analyses involving AROs and surveillance and control intensity levels. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rates increased from 1999 to 2005 (F = 9.4, P = .003). In 2005, the mean MRSA rate was 5.2 (standard deviation [SD], 6.1) per 1000 admissions, and, in 1999, it was 2.0 (SD, 2.9). Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea rates trended up from 1999 to 2005 (F = 2.9, P = .09). In 2005, the mean Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea rate was 4.7 (SD, 4.3), and, in 1999, it was 3.8 (SD, 4.3). The proportion of hospitals that reported having new nosocomial vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) cases was greater in 2005 than in 1999 ((2) = 10.5, P = .001). In 1999, 34.5% (40/116) of hospitals reported having new nosocomial VRE cases, and, in 2005, 61.0% (64/105) reported new cases. Surveillance intensity index scores increased from a mean of 61.7 (SD, 18.5) in 1999 to 68.1 (SD, 15.4) in 2005 (F = 4.1, P = .04). Control intensity index scores trended upward slightly from a mean of 60.8 (SD, 14.6) in 1999 to 64.1 (SD, 12.2) in 2005 (F = 3.2, P = .07). Infection control professionals (ICP) full-time equivalents (FTEs) per 100 beds increased from a mean of 0.5 (SD, 0.2) in 1999 to 0.8 (SD, 0.3) in 2005 (F = 90.8, P < .0001). However, the proportion of ICPs in hospitals certified by the Certification Board of Infection Control decreased from 53% (SD, 46) in 1999 to 38% (SD, 36) in 2005 (F = 8.7, P = .004). CONCLUSION: Canadian infection control programs in 2005 continued to fall short of expert recommendations for human resources and surveillance and control activities. Meanwhile, nosocomial MRSA rates more than doubled between 1999 and 2005, and hospitals reporting new nosocomial VRE cases increased 77% over the same period. Although investments have been made toward infection control programs in Canadian acute care hospitals, the rapid rise in ICP positions has not yet translated into marked improvements in surveillance and control activities. In the face of substantial increases in ARO rates in Canada, continued efforts to train ICPs and support hospital infection control programs are necessary.","output":"A comparison of infection control program resources, activities, and antibiotic resistant organism rates in Canadian acute care hospitals in 1999 and 2005: Pre- and post-severe acute respiratory syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence of risk factors for malnutrition has increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

A total of 42 patients (21 ENRIC) completed assessment one month after ICU discharge, and 24 (10 ENRIC) one year later. At one-month follow-up, ENRIC patients had better working memory scores (p = 0.009, d = 0.363) and showed up to 50% less non-specific anxiety (11.8% vs. 21.1%) and depression (5.9% vs. 10.5%) than TAU patients. A general linear model of repeated measures reported a main effect of group, but not of time or groupCtime interaction, on working memory, with ENRIC patients outperforming TAU patients (p = 0.008, (p)(2) = 0.282). Our results suggest that non-immersive VR-based neurocognitive stimulation may help improve short-term working memory outcomes in survivors of critical illness. Moreover, this advantage could be maintained in the long term. An efficacy trial in a larger sample of participants is feasible and must be conducted.","output":"Virtual Reality-Based Early Neurocognitive Stimulation in Critically Ill Patients: A Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid insurgence and spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exceeded the limit of the intensive care unit (ICU) contingency plan of the Maggiore della Carit University Hospital (Novara, Italy) generating a crisis management condition.

It is under-researched compared with other conditions of similar prevalence. OBJECTIVE To generate a top ten list of research priorities for the treatment and management of hyperhidrosis, with equal input from people with hyperhidrosis and healthcare professionals. METHODS A priority setting partnership was established and processes from the James Lind Alliance Handbook were followed. An online survey asked participants what questions they would like research to answer. These questions were grouped into 'indicative questions' which were ranked in a second survey of 45 indicative questions. The top 23 questions were taken to a final workshop event attended by key stakeholders, and ranked to generate the top ten list of research priorities. RESULTS There were 592 questions submitted by 268 respondents for the first survey. For the second survey, 286 participants ranked the indicative questions in order of priority. At the final workshop, the top ten list was generated. The top three priorities were; Are there any safe and effective permanent solutions for hyperhidrosis?, what is the most effective and safe oral treatment (drugs taken by mouth) for hyperhidrosis? and what are the most effective and safe ways to reduce sweating in particular areas of the body? CONCLUSIONS There are many unanswered research questions that people with hyperhidrosis and healthcare professionals would like to see answered. The results from this PSP will help to ensure future research funding can be directed to these areas of priority.","output":"Setting research priorities for management and treatment of hyperhidrosis: the results of the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: People using the Internet to find information on health issues, such as specific diseases, usually start their search from a general search engine, for example, Google. Internet searches such as these may yield results and data of questionable quality and reliability. Health Library is a free-of-charge medical portal on the Internet providing medical information for the general public. Physicians Databases, an Internet evidence-based medicine source, provides medical information for health care professionals (HCPs) to support their clinical practice. Both databases are available throughout Finland, but the latter is used only by health professionals and pharmacies. Little is known about how the general public seeks medical information from medical sources on the Internet, how this behavior differs from HCPs queries, and what causes possible differences in behavior. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate how the general publics and HCPs information-seeking trends from Internet medical databases differ seasonally and temporally. In addition, we aimed to evaluate whether the general publics information-seeking trends could be utilized for disease surveillance and whether media coverage could affect these seeking trends. METHODS: Lyme disease, serving as a well-defined disease model with distinct seasonal variation, was chosen as a case study. Two Internet medical databases, Health Library and Physicians Databases, were used. We compared the general publics article openings on Lyme disease from Health Library to HCPs article openings on Lyme disease from Physicians Databases seasonally across Finland from 2011 to 2015. Additionally, media publications related to Lyme disease were searched from the largest and most popular media websites in Finland. RESULTS: Both databases, Health Library and Physicians Databases, show visually similar patterns in temporal variations of article openings on Lyme disease in Finland from 2011 to 2015. However, Health Library openings show not only an increasing trend over time but also greater fluctuations, especially during peak opening seasons. Outside these seasons, publications in the media coincide with Health Library article openings only occasionally. CONCLUSIONS: Lyme diseaseCrelated information-seeking behaviors between the general public and HCPs from Internet medical portals share similar temporal variations, which is consistent with the trend seen in epidemiological data. Therefore, the general publics article openings could be used as a supplementary source of information for disease surveillance. The fluctuations in article openings appeared stronger among the general public, thus, suggesting that different factors such as media coverage, affect the information-seeking behaviors of the public versus professionals. However, media coverage may also have an influence on HCPs. Not every publication was associated with an increase in openings, but the higher the media coverage by some publications, the higher the general publics access to Health Library.","output":"Health InformationCSeeking Patterns of the General Public and Indications for Disease Surveillance: Register-Based Study Using Lyme Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, an overall survey regarding the determination of several bioactive compounds in olive fruit is presented. Two methodologies were developed, one UPLC-Q-TOF-MS method for the determination of olive fruit phenolic compounds and one HPLC-DAD methodology targeting the determination of pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids), tocopherols (-, , -, -) and squalene. Target and suspect screening workflows were developed for the thorough fingerprinting of the phenolic fraction of olives. Both methods were validated, presenting excellent performance characteristics, and can be used as reliable tools for the monitoring of bioactive compounds in olive fruit samples. The developed methodologies were utilized to chemical characterize the fruits of the Kolovi olive variety, originating from the island of Lesvos, North Aegean Region, Greece. Twenty-five phenolic compounds were identified and quantified in Kolovi olives with verbascoside, hydroxytyrosol, oleacein and oleomissional found in significantly high concentrations. Moreover, 12 new bioactive compounds were identified in the samples using an in-house suspect database. The results of pigments analysis suggested that Kolovi variety should be characterized as low pigmentation, while the tocopherol and squalene content was relatively high compared to other olive varieties. The characterization of Kolovi olive bioactive content highlighted the high nutritional and possible economic value of the Kolovi olive fruit.","output":"Development of Analytical Strategies for the Determination of Olive Fruit Bioactive Compounds Using UPLC-HRMS and HPLC-DAD.

As COVID-19 is highly contagious, early diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial for an effective treatment strategy. However, the RT-PCR test which is considered to be a gold standard in the diagnosis of COVID-19 suffers from a high false-negative rate. Chest X-ray (CXR) image analysis has emerged as a feasible and effective diagnostic technique towards this objective. In this work, we propose the COVID-19 classification problem as a three-class classification problem to distinguish between COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia classes. We propose a three-stage framework, named COV-ELM. Stage one deals with preprocessing and transformation while stage two deals with feature extraction. These extracted features are passed as an input to the ELM at the third stage, resulting in the identification of COVID-19. The choice of ELM in this work has been motivated by its faster convergence, better generalization capability, and shorter training time in comparison to the conventional gradient-based learning algorithms. As bigger and diverse datasets become available, ELM can be quickly retrained as compared to its gradient-based competitor models. The proposed model achieved a macro average F1-score of 0.95 and the overall sensitivity of \${0.94 \\\\pm 0.02} at a 95% confidence interval. When compared to state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, the COV-ELM is found to outperform its competitors in this three-class classification scenario. Further, LIME has been integrated with the proposed COV-ELM model to generate annotated CXR images. The annotations are based on the superpixels that have contributed to distinguish between the different classes. It was observed that the superpixels correspond to the regions of the human lungs that are clinically observed in COVID-19 and Pneumonia cases.","output":"COV-ELM classifier: An Extreme Learning Machine based identification of COVID-19 using Chest X-Ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past several years, the development and application of molecular diagnostic techniques has initiated a revolution in the diagnosis and monitoring of infectious diseases. Microbial phenotypic characteristics, such as protein, bacteriophage, and chromatographic profiles, as well as biotyping and susceptibility testing, are used in most routine laboratories for identification and differentiation. Nucleic acid techniques, such as plasmid profiling, various methods for generating restriction fragment length polymorphisms, and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are making increasing inroads into clinical laboratories. PCR-based systems to detect the etiologic agents of disease directly from clinical samples, without the need for culture, have been useful in rapid detection of unculturable or fastidious microorganisms. Additionally, sequence analysis of amplified microbial DNA allows for identification and better characterization of the pathogen. Subspecies variation, identified by various techniques, has been shown to be important in the prognosis of certain diseases. Other important advances include the determination of viral load and the direct detection of genes or gene mutations responsible for drug resistance. Increased use of automation and user-friendly software makes these technologies more widely available.

Pathogenesis of viral infection, co-morbidities, medical treatments, and psychosocial factors may contribute to COVID-19 related neuropsychological and psychiatric sequelae. This systematic review aims to synthesize available literature on psychiatric and cognitive characteristics of community-dwelling survivors of COVID-19 infection. RECENT FINDINGS: Thirty-three studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria for review. Emerging findings link COVID-19 to cognitive deficits, particularly attention, executive function, and memory. Psychiatric symptoms occur at high rates in COVID-19 survivors, including anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disruption, and to a lesser extent posttraumatic stress. Symptoms appear to endure, and severity of acute illness is not directly predictive of severity of cognitive or mental health issues. The course of cognitive and psychiatric sequelae is limited by lack of longitudinal data at this time. Although heterogeneity of study design and sociocultural differences limit definitive conclusions, emerging risk factors for psychiatric symptoms include female sex, perceived stigma related to COVID-19, infection of a family member, social isolation, and prior psychiatry history. SUMMARY: The extant literature elucidates treatment targets for cognitive and psychosocial interventions. Research using longitudinal, prospective study designs is needed to characterize cognitive and psychiatric functioning of COVID-19 survivors over the course of illness and across illness severity. Emphasis on delineating the unique contributions of premorbid functioning, viral infection, co-morbidities, treatments, and psychosocial factors to cognitive and psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 is warranted.","output":"A systematic review of neuropsychological and psychiatric sequalae of COVID-19: implications for treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date, the impacts of agriphotovoltaic (APV) condition on the production yield of crop have been studied; however, the effect of APV production on the sensorial quality and consumer acceptability of the produce remains unexplored.

Many patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the University Hospital Aachen during an outbreak that first struck the Heinsberg district in February 2020. METHODS: A comparative presentation of the clinical features of the first 50 COVID-19 patients with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who were hospitalized in the University Hospital Aachen. RESULTS: 24 intubated patients were treated in the intensive care unit for ARDS of varying degrees of severity, while 26 patients who were breathing spontaneously without ARDS, but nevertheless needed supplemental oxygen, were treated in a separate isolation ward. The median age of the patients was 65 (IQR 58-76). The median latency from symptom onset to hospitalization was four days (IQR 1-8). Patients with ARDS had preexisting respiratory diseases more commonly than patients without ARDS (58% [95% confidence interval: 39; 76] versus 42% [26; 61]) and were more commonly overweight or obese (83% [64; 93] versus 42% [26; 61]). The two groups did not differ in viral burden but displayed significant differences in laboratory findings: ARDS patients had persistently elevated values for leukocytes, interleukin-6, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and D-dimers over the period of observation. Patients without ARDS had persistently elevated inflammatory parameters and fever for at least one week, with an accompanying need for supplemental oxygen. Three of the patients with ARDS died of multiorgan failure, while four in the non-ARDS group died of respiratory insufficiency. CONCLUSION: This initial description of a cohort of COVID-19 patients with and without ARDS in Germany reveals that those with ARDS more commonly have preexisting respiratory diseases and obesity, as well as persistently elevated inflammatory markers. COVID-19 patients without ARDS may likewise require prolonged hospitalization because of persistently elevated inflammatory values with a simultaneous need for supplemental oxygen.","output":"The Characteristics of 50 Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients With and Without ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global concern in which the respiratory system is not the only one involved.

Half of these refugees are children, whose age and refugee status jeopardize their abilities to attain quality healthcare. Information on Syrian refugees' health in the U.S. is limited. This qualitative study sought to explore Syrian refugee parents' beliefs, perspectives, and practices regarding their children's health through in-depth interviews. METHODS Eighteen Syrian refugee parents residing in Cincinnati, Ohio were interviewed in Arabic by bilingual researchers using semi-structured in-depth interviews. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and translated. Three members of the research team independently coded each interview using an inductive thematic analysis approach. RESULTS Analysis identified four salient themes: stressors preclude health seeking behaviors, parents perceive health barriers, parents are dissatisfied with the healthcare system, and parents use resilience behaviors to overcome barriers. Stressors included poor housing and neighborhoods, reliving traumatic experiences, depression and anxiety, and social isolation. Dissatisfaction included emergency room wait times, lack of testing and prescriptions. Health barriers included missed appointments and inadequate transportation, translation services, health literacy and care coordination. Parents reported resilience through faith, by seeking knowledge, use of natural remedies, and utilizing community resources. CONCLUSION This qualitative study provides information on the beliefs, practices, and behaviors of Syrian refugee parents related to health care utilization of pediatric refugees in the United States. Psychosocial and environmental stressors as well as perceived systemic health barriers, hinder health seeking behaviors in Syrian refugee parents.

Furthermore, a non- clinical pharmacology studies of NV-CoV-2 (Polymer) and NV-CoV-2-R (Polymer encapsulated Remdesivir) in both NL-63 infected and uninfected rats were done. In an in vitro cell culture model experiment, antiviral activity of NV-CoV-2 and NV-CoV-2-R are also compared with RDV. The results are (i) NV-CoV-2 polymer encapsulation protects RDV from plasma- mediated catabolism in vitro and in vivo, too.

Many studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for anal fistula. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in the outcomes assessed and reported in these studies. This limits research quality and complicates evidence synthesis. A solution for heterogeneity in outcome reporting is the development of a Core Outcome Set (COS). This paper describes the protocol for the development of a European COS for Anal Fistula (AFCOS). METHODS The first step will be a systematic review of the literature to identify potential outcomes that may be included in the COS. Patient interviews will be conducted in The United Kingdom and The Netherlands to ensure that both clinician-important and patient-important outcomes are captured. The outcomes will be categorized using the COMET taxonomy and taken forward to a Delphi consensus exercise. In up to three web-based Delphi surveys the outcomes will be prioritized by patients, clinicians (surgeons, gastroenterologists, and radiologists), and (clinical) researchers. The responses will be summarized and reported anonymously in subsequent round(s) facilitating convergence to a consensus opinion.

Animal studies that are focused solely on translational potential, may not sufficiently document unexpected outcomes. Considerable amounts of data from such studies could be used to advance veterinary science. For example, sheep are increasingly being used as models of intensive care and therefore, data arising from such models must be published. In this study, the hypothesis is that there is little information describing cardiorespiratory physiological data from sheep models of intensive care and the author aimed to analyse such data to provide biological information that is currently not available for sheep that received extracorporeal life support (ECLS) following acute smoke-induced lung injury. Methods: Nineteen mechanically ventilated adult ewes undergoing intensive care during evaluation of a form of ECLS (treatment) for acute lung injury were used to collate clinical observations. Eight sheep were injured by acute smoke inhalation prior to treatment (injured/treated), while another eight were not injured but treated (uninjured/treated). Two sheep were injured but not treated (injured/untreated), while one received room air instead of smoke as the injury and was not treated (placebo/untreated). The data were then analysed for 11 physiological categories and compared between the two treated groups. Results: Compared with the baseline, treatment contributed to and exacerbated the deterioration of pulmonary pathology by reducing lung compliance and the arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO 2/FiO 2) ratio. The oxygen extraction index changes mirrored those of the PaO 2/FiO 2 ratio. Decreasing coronary perfusion pressure predicted the severity of cardiopulmonary injury.

Design/methodology/approach This study uses a sample of the stocks that constitute the Dow Jones Islamic Market Malaysia Titans 25 Index, over the period from 6 December 2017 to 12 March 2021. Findings This paper provides robust evidence on the contribution of the COVID-19 pandemic to the formation of herding behaviour in Shariah-compliant stocks. The findings also reveal that herding behaviour occurs only during falling market. Research limitations/implications The findings provide useful implications for policymakers and portfolio managers seeking to understand the behaviour of investors in Shariah-compliant stocks during turbulent periods. The presence of herding behaviour begs the question on the market efficiency and limits its potential to offer diversification benefits to investors. The findings suggest that policymakers and investors should mitigate misvaluations that occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak because the herding behaviour can drive stock prices away from their equilibrium values. Thus, regulators should adopt appropriate policies to enable the market to reach a more efficient level by monitoring and improving the quality of information and facilitate their transmission to the market. The misevaluation opportunity enables market timers to sell overpriced stocks and purchase underpriced stocks. The findings also imply that investors should implement effective hedging strategies to mitigate the downside risk. In addition, the results suggest that investors should devise their trading strategies in falling and rising markets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value There is meagre literature on the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on the formation of herding behaviour among investors.

The approach works by learning a latent space over X-ray image distribution from the ensemble of state-of-the-art convolutional-nets, and then linearly regressing the predictions from an ensemble of classifiers which take the latent vector as input. We experimented with publicly available datasets having three classes: COVID-19, normal and pneumonia yielding an overall accuracy and AUC of 0.91 and 0.97, respectively. Moreover, for robust evaluation, experiments were performed on a large chest X-ray dataset to classify among Atelectasis, Effusion, Infiltration, Nodule, and Pneumonia classes. The results demonstrate that the proposed model has better understanding of the X-ray images which make the network more generic to be later used with other domains of medical image analysis.","output":"AI-based diagnosis of COVID-19 patients using X-ray scans with stochastic ensemble of CNNs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We compared oropharyngeal swab test performance compared to nasopharyngeal testing for discontinuation of transmission-based COVID-19 precautions.

Using nasopharyngeal swabs as the reference standard, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of oropharyngeal swabs. We also calculated the kappa between the two tests. A total of 189 paired samples were collected from 74 patients. Oropharyngeal swab sensitivity was 38%, specificity was 87%, and negative predictive value was 70%. The kappa was 0.25.

We conducted an online survey of 29,708 Japanese adults in February 2021 and estimated the associations between COVID-19 risk perception and a broad array of individual factors. Two logistic regressions were constructed to estimate factors associated with the risk perception of COVID-19 (defined as responding that one might become infected within the next 6 months), and of severe illness among those who responded that they might become infected (defined as responding that one would become severely ill). After adjusting for covariates, those with a higher perceived risk of the COVID-19 vaccine had higher odds of risk perception for both infection and severe illness. Interestingly, those with higher odds of risk perception of being infected were more likely to report obtaining their information from healthcare workers whereas those with lower odds were more likely to report obtaining their information from the Internet or the government; those with higher odds of risk perception of being severely ill were more likely to report obtaining their information from the Internet. The higher the trust level in the government as a COVID-19 information source, the lower the odds of both risk perception of being infected and becoming severely ill. The higher the trust levels in social networking services as a COVID-19 information source, the higher the odds of risk perception of becoming severely ill.

However, the range of analytical procedures available to evaluate these profiles remains limited and are typically based on transesterification of the triglyceride fatty acid residues to methyl esters, followed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography (GC) coupled with flame ionization or mass spectrometry detection. Although robust and long-proven, these analytical methods tend to entail long chromatographic runs and are relatively insensitive. In order to expand the range of available techniques for the analysis of the fatty acid profile of triglycerides in vegetable oils, we report herein a novel method based upon a rapid and straightforward transesterification of the triglycerides with dimethylaminoethanol under alkaline conditions, followed by a \\"dilute-and-shoot\\" analysis by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The chromatographic analysis is accomplished in 1.5 min, affording a high throughput of samples compared to techniques based upon GC approaches. The method performance was assessed intra- and inter-day with 10 representative saturated and unsaturated fatty acids ranging from C8 to C18 and afforded fatty acid profile accuracies of 93-108% and imprecisions of only 0.3-2.0%. The limit of quantification of the method, estimated as the minimum amount of derivatized oil sample capable of affording less than 20% accuracy and precision error was determined to be approximately 0.5 pg on-column, making this new method potentially valuable for fields where high sensitivity, precision, and accuracy may be required, such as in toxicology studies, forensics, archeology, or art analysis.","output":"A rapid and highly sensitive UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method for the analysis of the fatty acid profile of edible vegetable oils."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Social distancing is a public health tool that seeks to reduce opportunities fo an infectious agent to spread among individuals.

The aim of this paper is to develop methods for estimating reproduction numbers which are simple enough that they could be applied with limited data or in real time during an outbreak. I present a new estimator for the individual reproduction number, which describes the state of the epidemic at a point in time rather than tracking individuals over time, and discuss some potential benefits. Then, to capture more of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important in outbreak dynamics, I analyse a model of transmission within and between households, and develop a method to estimate the household reproduction number, defined as the number of households infected by each infected household. This method is validated by numerical simulations of the spread of influenza and measles using historical data, and estimates are obtained for would-be emerging epidemics of these viruses. I argue that the household reproduction number is useful in assessing the impact of measures that target the household for isolation, quarantine, vaccination or prophylactic treatment, and measures such as social distancing and school or workplace closures which limit between-household transmission, all of which play a key role in current thinking on future infectious disease mitigation.","output":"Estimating Individual and Household Reproduction Numbers in an Emerging Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Frailty is a prevalent condition among Canadians; over one million are diagnosed as medically frail, and in the next ten years this number will double.

While multiple national- and state-level studies have highlighted the overwhelming impacts of the pandemic on the ECE sector, little has been reported about how much variation in impacts exists, and in what forms, within the ECE sector. Based on a statewide survey of 953 licensed care providers in California conducted in June 2020, this paper examines the impact of COVID-19 experienced by ECE providers, focusing on the variations between centers and family child care homes (FCCs) and among center-based programs. Results indicate that the challenges programs face differ greatly depending on program type and funding source. Compared to center-based programs, FCCs fared worse in most measures of economic hardship that directly impact individual providers with medium to large effect sizes. Centers were more likely than FCCs to struggle with reduced attendance and changes in program operations by medium to large effect sizes and report staffing challenges by small to medium effect sizes. Among the center-based programs, subsidized programs holding contracts with Head Start or the California Department of Education (such as state preschool programs) were more stable and better able to financially support their staff during the pandemic, with effect sizes ranging from medium to large. Centers receiving government subsidies in the form of vouchers were more likely to be negatively impacted by the pandemic compared to unsubsidized centers and Head Start and state-contracted centers. Implications for future research and policy are discussed in the context of addressing the complex delivery system of ECE services and supporting outcomes that are effective and equitable for children, families, and the ECE workforce.","output":"Impacts of COVID-19 on the Early Care and Education Sector in California: Variations Across Program Types"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Why you should read this article: ?

DESIGN Longitudinal observational study. SETTING Tertiary referral urogynecology center. POPULATION One hundred and five women with at least an anterior vaginal wall prolapse and concomitant SUI who underwent surgery. METHODS After reduction of prolapse elements, the intervention consisted of a non-absorbable monoprosthesis placement with two transobturator expansions and, if necessary, associated hysterectomy or infraccocygeal sacropexy. No specific procedure was performed for SUI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES All patients had a physical examination and a subjective symptoms assessment via questionnaire in the preoperative period and at one-year or more after surgery. The pelvic organ prolapse quantification system was used for anatomical results. For SUI, Ingelman-Sundberg classification and cough test were used. Loss of urine was measured by a one-hour pad test. Functional results were evaluated by visual analog scale, quality-of-life questionnaires, including the pelvic floor distress inventory and the pelvic floor impact questionnaire. RESULTS Median follow-up was 45 months (range: 12-72). A total of 102 women (97%) were cured of their prolapse, of whom 72 (69%) were cured of their SUI and 13 (12%) showed improvement.

It has great exploratory potentials for engineering abiotic stress tolerance in crops. Nitric oxide (NO), a redox-active gaseous signalling molecule, though present uniformly through the eukaryotes, maintain its specificity in plants with respect to its formation, signalling, and functions. Its cellular concentrations are decisive for its function, as a signalling molecule at lower concentrations, but triggers nitro-oxidative stress and cellular damage when produced at higher concentrations. Besides, it also acts as a potent stress alleviator. Discovered in animals as neurotransmitter, NO has come a long way to being a stress radical and growth regulator in plants. As a key redox molecule, it exhibits several key cellular and molecular interactions including with reactive chemical species, hydrogen sulphide, and calcium. Apart from being a signalling molecule, it is emerging as a key player involved in regulations of plant growth, development and plant-environment interactions. It is involved in crosstalk with stress regulators and is thus pivotal in these stress regulatory mechanisms. NO is getting an unprecedented attention from research community, being investigated and explored for its multifaceted roles in plant abiotic stress tolerance. Through this review, we intend to present the current knowledge and updates on NO biosynthesis and signalling, crosstalk with stress regulators, and how biotechnological manipulations of NO pathway are leading towards developing transgenic crop plants that can withstand environmental stresses and climate change.

Reports from early stages of the lockdown evidenced elevated emotional symptomatology. Aims: The aim of this study was to explore: 1) if the prolongation of the lockdown was associated with elevated emotional symptoms; 2) if the prolonged lockdown affected adherence, a phenomenon called 'behavioral fatigue'; and 3) how financial concerns in a developing country affected adherence to the lockdown and emotional status of the population. Method: A survey was designed to evaluate the psychological correlates of the pandemic after an average of 72 days of continuous lockdown in Argentina.. The survey included standardized questionnaires to assess the severity of depressive (PHQ-9) and anxious (GAD-7) symptoms, a questionnaire to evaluate mental fatigue, and several additional instruments to assess other variables of interest: risk perception, lockdown adherence, financial concerns, daily stress, loneliness, intolerance to uncertainty, negative repetitive thinking, and cognitive problems. Three LASSO regression analyses were carried to evaluate the predictive role of the different variables over depression, anxiety, and lockdown adherence Results: The survey was responded by 3617 individuals over the age of 18 (85.2% female) from all the provinces of Argentina. Using the Oxford stringency index, Argentina had one of the most stringent and prolonged lockdowns when the sample was collected with 63 to 77 continuous days with a stringency index of more than 85/100. 45.6% of the sample met the cut-off for depression and 27% for anxiety. Previous mental health treatment, low income, being younger, and being female were associated with higher levels of emotional symptoms. Mental fatigue, cognitive failures, and financial concerns were also associated with emotional and subjective complaints, but not with adherence to the lockdown. In the regression models, mental fatigue, cognitive failures, and loneliness were the most important variables to predict depression, meanwhile intolerance to uncertainty and lockdown difficulty were the most important in the case of anxiety. Perceived threat was the most important variable predicting lockdown adherence. Conclusions: Emotional symptoms persisted and even increased during the extended lockdown, but we found no evidence of behavioral fatigue. Instead, mental fatigue, cognitive difficulties, and financial concerns were expressions of the emotional side of the pandemic and the restrictive measures.","output":"Emotional symptoms, mental fatigue and behavioral adherence after 72 continuous days of strict lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Electronic cigarette (e-cig) vaping is increasing rapidly in the United States, as e-cigs are considered less harmful than combustible cigarettes. However, limited research has been conducted to understand the possible mechanisms that mediate toxicity and pulmonary health effects of e-cigs. We hypothesized that sub-chronic e-cig exposure induces inflammatory response and dysregulated repair/extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, which occur through the &#945;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR&#945;7). Adult wild-type (WT), nAChR&#945;7 knockout (KO), and lung epithelial cell-specific KO (nAChR&#945;7 CreCC10) mice were exposed to e-cig aerosol containing propylene glycol (PG) with or without nicotine. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) and lung tissues were collected to determine e-cig induced inflammatory response and ECM remodeling, respectively. Sub-chronic e-cig exposure with nicotine increased inflammatory cellular influx of macrophages and T-lymphocytes including increased pro-inflammatory cytokines in BALF and increased SARS-Cov-2 Covid-19 ACE2 receptor, whereas nAChR&#945;7 KO mice show reduced inflammatory responses associated with decreased ACE2 receptor. Interestingly, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP2, MMP8 and MMP9, were altered both at the protein and mRNA transcript levels in female and male KO mice, but WT mice exposed to PG alone showed a sex-dependent phenotype. Moreover, MMP12 was increased significantly in male mice exposed to PG with or without nicotine in a nAChR&#945;7-dependent manner. Additionally, sub-chronic e-cig exposure with or without nicotine altered the abundance of ECM proteins, such as collagen and fibronectin, significantly in a sex-dependent manner, but without the direct role of nAChR&#945;7 gene.

These measures may decrease people's sexual contacts and thus reduce the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmissible infections (STIs). We investigated the impact of physical distancing measures due to COVID-19 on the sexual behavior of gay and bisexual men in Australia. METHODS: Between April 4, 2020, and April 29, 2020, 940 participants in an ongoing cohort study responded to questions to measure changes in sexual behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Men reported the date they become concerned about COVID-19 and whether they engaged in sexual behavior with regular or casual partners or \\"fuckbuddies\\" in the 6 months before becoming concerned about COVID-19 (hereafter referred to as \\"before COVID-19\\"), and following the date, they become concerned about COVID-19 (hereafter referred to as \\"since COVID-19\\"). Before and since COVID-19 was based on individual participants' own perceived date of becoming concerned about COVID-19. RESULTS: The mean age of was 39.9 years (SD: 13.4). Most participants (88.3%) reported sex with other men during the 6 months before COVID-19. Of the 587 men (62.4%) who reported sex with casual partners before COVID-19, 93 (15.8%) continued to do so in the period since COVID-19, representing a relative reduction of 84.2%. CONCLUSION: Gay and bisexual men in Australia have dramatically reduced their sexual contacts with other men since COVID-19. These behavioral changes will likely result in short-term reductions in new HIV and STI diagnoses. If sexual health screenings are undertaken before resuming sexual activity, this could present a novel opportunity to interrupt chains of HIV and STI transmission.","output":"Physical Distancing Due to COVID-19 Disrupts Sexual Behaviors Among Gay and Bisexual Men in Australia: Implications for Trends in HIV and Other Sexually Transmissible Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Recently, weeks after the COVID-19 prevalence, there were reports of brain involvement and neurologic presentations in the COVID-19.

Metabolic adaptations have been shown to fuel therapy resistance; however, little is known regarding the generality of these changes and whether specific therapies elicit unique metabolic alterations.

Doxorubicin-resistant cells rely on glutamine to drive oxidative phosphorylation and de novo glutathione synthesis, while epirubicin-resistant cells display markedly increased bioenergetic capacity and mitochondrial ATP production. The dependence on these distinct metabolic adaptations is revealed by the increased sensitivity of doxorubicin-resistant cells and tumor xenografts to buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a drug that interferes with glutathione synthesis, compared with epirubicin-resistant counterparts that are more sensitive to the biguanide phenformin.

The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected mental health and increased parenting challenges impacting parent-child functioning. The aim of the current study was to examine the relationship between parent factors and child activities to identify parental needs. A convenience sample of parents (N = 708), primarily mothers (n = 610;87.4%) aged 35.59 years old (SD = 5.59;range = 21-72), with children ages 2-8 years completed an online questionnaire between April 14-June 1, 2020. Participants mostly resided in Canada and had an income of >$100,000. Parent-child activities were measured as total weekly time and combined time across activities within two categories: hands-on play and screen time. Bivariate correlations informed block-wise linear regression models. For families with childcare needs, parental anxiety was associated with higher total hands-on play (F(3,142) = 14.01, p <.001), combined hands-on play (F(2,85) = 6.82, p = .011), and combined screen time (F(2,82) = 6.25, p = .014). Families without childcare needs indicated parenting stress was associated with lower total hands-on play (F(3,212) = 7.95, p <.005) and combined hands-on play (F(2,110) = 5.67, p = .019), and higher supervised screen time (F(3,138) = 6.14, p = .014). Family structure and indices of socioeconomic status were also predictive of activities across childcare needs and child ages. To promote high-quality parent-child interactions and positive developmental outcomes in the pandemic, policy makers should support childcare needs, parent mental health and stress, and provide evidence-based guidelines for child screen time.","output":"Keeping Kids Busy: Family Factors Associated with Hands-on Play and Screen Time During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor via its receptor-binding domain (RBD), with the RBDCACE2 complex presenting an essential molecular target for vaccine development to stall the virus infection proliferation. The computational analyses at molecular, amino acid (AA), and atomic levels have been performed systematically to identify the key interacting AAs in the formation of the RBDCACE2 complex for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with its Alpha and Beta variants. Our study uses the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) method to predict the binding free energy (BFE) and to determine the actual interacting AAs, as well as two ab initio quantum chemical protocols based on the density functional theory (DFT) implementation. Based on MD results, Q(493), Y(505), Q(498), N(501), T(500), N(487), Y(449), F(486), K(417), Y(489), F(456), Y(495), and L(455) have been identified as hotspots in SARS-CoV-2 RBD, while those in ACE2 are K(353), K(31), D(30), D(355), H(34), D(38), Q(24), T(27), Y(83), Y(41), and E(35). RBD with Alpha and Beta variants has slightly different interacting AAs due to N501Y mutation.

It had been postulated that associated co-morbid conditions in COVID-19 patients increase the severity of COVID-19 which leads to six times more chances of hospitalisation than patients without co-morbid condition. Mortality is also 12 times higher in such patients. Aim: To find out the association between co-morbidities and mortalities due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods: A prospective, observational study was conducted in a tertiary teaching institute of North India which was designated Level 3 (L-3) facility for treatment of COVID-19 patients. All 109 COVID-19 patients confirmed by Reverse Transcriptase - Polymerase Chain Reaction(RT-PCR), admitted in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from 1st July 2020 to 30th November 2020 formed the sample of the study. Data were taken regarding past history, clinical histories and examinations and ICU care and treatments. Based on their final outcome at the end of ICU care, patients were divided into 2 groups-group 1 (Non-survivor or Expired) and group 2 (Survived) and intergroup differences were studied. results: COVID-19 infection was about three times more common in males. Severe category of COVID-19 patients had higher mortality (59.2 % of severe category expired during hospital course, 1.7% patients expired in moderate category group). Most common co-morbidities were hypertension (n=48, 46.8%) and diabetes (n=51, 44%). Multivariate analysis showed that co-morbidities in the form of chronic liver disease (OR -0.127(0.024-0.681, p-value 0.016)) and post tubercular sequel (OR 0.036(0.003-0.442, p-value 0.009)) were less likely to occur in COVID-19 patients who survived, thus making these co-morbidities significant contributor to the adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. More number of co-morbidities in a patient were associated with higher chance of mortality and this trend was significant statistically (p-value<0.001). conclusion: Patients with multiple co-morbidities, chronic liver disease and post tubercular sequel were associated with higher mortality in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Impact of Co-morbidities on outcome of COVID-19 patients: An observational study among patients admitted to intensive care unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease is a general concern for the development of vaccines and antibody therapies because the mechanisms that underlie antibody protection have the theoretical potential to amplify viral infections or trigger immunopathology. Observations relevant to the risks of ADE of disease require careful review at this critical point in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. At present, no clinical findings, immunologic assays or biomarkers are known to differentiate any severe viral infection from immune-enhanced disease, whether by antibodies, T cells or intrinsic host responses. In vitro systems and animal models do not predict the risk of ADE of disease, in part because protective and potentially detrimental antibody-mediated mechanisms are the same, and designing animal models depends on understanding how antiviral host responses may become harmful in people. The implications of our lack of knowledge are twofold. First, comprehensive studies are urgently needed to define clinical correlates of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Second, since we cannot predict ADE of disease reliably after either vaccination or treatment with antibodies, regardless of what virus is the causative agent, it will be essential to depend on careful analysis of safety in humans as immune interventions for COVID-19 disease move forward.","output":"A perspective on potential antibody-dependent enhancement of SARS-CoV-2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. At the current stage of COVID-19 pandemic, forecasts become particularly important regarding the possibility that the total incidence could reach the level where the disease stops spreading because a considerable portion of the population has become immune and collective immunity could be reached. Such forecasts are valuable because the currently undertaken restrictive measures prevent mass morbidity but do not result in the development of a robust collective immunity. Thus, in the absence of efficient vaccines and medical treatments, lifting restrictive measures carries the risk that a second wave of the epidemic could occur. Methods. We developed a heterogeneous model of COVID-19 dynamics. The model accounted for the differences in the infection risk across subpopulations, particularly the age-depended susceptibility to the disease. Based on this model, an equation for the minimal number of infections was calculated as a condition for the epidemic to start declining. The basic reproductive number of 2.5 was used for the disease spread without restrictions. The model was applied to COVID-19 data from Italy. Findings. We found that the heterogeneous model of epidemic dynamics yielded a lower proportion, compared to a homogeneous model, for the minimal incidence needed for the epidemic to stop. When applied to the data for Italy, the model yielded a more optimistic assessment of the minimum total incidence needed to reach collective immunity: 43% versus 60% estimated with a homogeneous model. Interpretation. Because of the high heterogeneity of COVID-19 infection risk across the different age groups, with a higher susceptibility for the elderly, homogeneous models overestimate the level of collective immunity needed for the disease to stop spreading. This inaccuracy can be corrected by the homogeneous model introduced here. To improve the estimate even further additional factors should be considered that contribute to heterogeneity, including social and professional activity, gender and individual resistance to the pathogen.","output":"Reaching collective immunity for COVID-19: an estimate with a heterogeneous model based on the data for Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical value of SARS-CoV2 IgM and IgG antibodies in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected cases by likelihood ratio METHODS: By reinterpreting data from a previous study, the positive likelihood ratio of IgM and IgG antibodies in COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis was calculated, and the posterior probability of IgM and IgG antibodies and their tandem detection was calculated finally RESULTS: The positive likelihood ratios of single IgM and IgG antibodies were 18 50 and 12 65, respectively, and the posterior probabilities were 90 18% and 86 26%, respectively However, the posterior probability of the two antibody-tandem test was 99 15%, which could give clinicians more quantitative confidence in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected cases According to the results of this study, combining the advantages and disadvantages of nucleic acid testing and antibody detection, a feasible clinical path was found for clinicians to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia from suspected cases CONCLUSION: For suspected cases, IgM- and IgG-antibody tests should first be done at the same time If all antibody tests are positive, COVID-19 pneumonia could be confirmed If not, nucleic acid detection (once or more) should be carried out, and in extreme cases high-throughput viral genome sequencing is required","output":"Clinical Value of SARS-CoV2 IgM and IgG Antibodies in Diagnosis of COVID-19 in Suspected Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As countries and associations, a similar continue contemplating the phenomenal troubles flung by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), a specific zone of concern has been the defenselessness incorporating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the overall similarly as Indian pharma industry agilely chains.

CHIKV is an enveloped virus belonging to the Togaviridae family and enters its host cell primarily via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Upon internalization, the endocytic vesicle containing the virus particle moves through the cell and delivers the virus to early endosomes where membrane fusion is observed. Thereafter, the nucleocapsid dissociates and the viral RNA is translated into proteins. In this study, we examined the importance of the microtubule network during the early steps of infection and dissected the intracellular trafficking behavior of CHIKV particles during cell entry. We observed two distinct CHIKV intracellular trafficking patterns prior to membrane hemifusion. Whereas half of the CHIKV virions remained static during cell entry and fused in the cell periphery, the other half showed fast-directed microtubule-dependent movement prior to delivery to Rab5-positive early endosomes and predominantly fused in the perinuclear region of the cell. Disruption of the microtubule network reduced the number of infected cells. At these conditions, membrane hemifusion activity was not affected yet fusion was restricted to the cell periphery. Furthermore, follow-up experiments revealed that disruption of the microtubule network impairs the delivery of the viral genome to the cell cytosol.

We found that RBD-specific IgG1 and IgG3 dominated the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2, were more abundant in severe patients, and positively correlated with several clinical parameters of inflammation. In contrast, a virus-specific IgA2 response skewed toward RBD rather than NP associated with a more favorable clinical course.

METHODS/DESIGN The CONTINT trial is a multicenter, open label, randomized controlled trial with a two-group parallel design. Patients undergoing a primary emergency midline laparotomy are enrolled in the trial. The two most commonly applied strategies of abdominal wall closure after midline laparotomy are compared: the continuous, all-layer suture technique using slowly absorbable monofilament material (two Monoplus loops) and the interrupted suture technique using rapidly absorbable braided material (Vicryl sutures). The primary endpoint within the CONTINT trial is an incisional hernia within 12 months or a burst abdomen within 30 days after surgery. As reliable data on this primary endpoint is not available for patients undergoing emergency surgery, an adaptive interim analysis will be conducted after the inclusion of 80 patients, allowing early termination of the trial if necessary or modification of design characteristics such as recalculation of sample size.

This syndrome presents in patients several weeks after infection with COVID-19 and is associated with thrombosis, elevated inflammatory markers, hemodynamic compromise and cardiac dysfunction. Treatment is often with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). The pathologic basis of myocardial injury in MIS-A, however, is not well characterized. In our case report, we obtained endomyocardial biopsy that revealed a pattern of myocardial injury similar to that found in COVID-19 cardiac specimens. CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old male presented with fevers, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea 5 weeks after his COVID-19 infection. His SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative and IgG was positive, consistent with prior infection. He was found to be in cardiogenic shock with biventricular failure, requiring inotropes and diuretics. Given concern for acute fulminant myocarditis, an endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) was performed, showing an inflammatory infiltrate consisting predominantly of interstitial macrophages with scant T lymphocytes. The histologic pattern was similar to that of cardiac specimens from COVID-19 patients, helping rule out myocarditis as the prevailing diagnosis. His case was complicated by persistent hypoxemia, and a computed tomography scan revealed pulmonary emboli. He received IVIg, steroids, and anticoagulation with rapid recovery of biventricular function. CONCLUSIONS: MIS-A should be considered as the diagnosis in patients presenting several weeks after COVID-19 infection with severe inflammation and multi-organ involvement.

A questionnaire addressing the perception of health threat-combination of perceived vulnerability (PV) and perceived seriousness (PS), and perceived efficacy-combinations of perceived response efficacy (PRE), perceived self-efficacy (PSE), and perceived collective efficacy (PCE). The data were analyzed using SPSS 21.0. Descriptive statistics were computed after the standardization of the scores. The scores for overall efficacy and threat were split by median value and response classifications were generated through threat by efficacy interactions. For statistical significance, 95% CI and p-value < 0.05 were used. RESULTS: A total of 929 respondents submitted their responses. Eight hundred and twenty-eight (89.1%) of the respondents were male and 753 (81.1%) were Christian. The perceived threat to COVID-19 was generally low (median = 58.3). The median score for overall efficacy, PRE, and PSE were 79.8, 87.5, and 80.0, respectively. However, the median value (66.7) for PCE was relatively low. Perceived threat significantly varied by age, education, occupation, and place of residence (p < 0.05). Perceived efficacy significantly differed by gender, residence, and use of some sources of information (p < 0.05). In terms of response to COVID-19, 290 (31.2%), 239 (25.7%), 175 (18.8%) and 225 (24.2%) of the respondents were in the responsive, pro-active, avoidant, and indifferent attitudinal categories, respectively.

Patient developed fever, severe cough, loss of smell, loss of taste, nasal block, anorexia, headache, body ache, chills, and fatigue and was hospitalised when she developed severe breathing difficulty. Later, she tested positive for COVID-19 by RT PCR. The patient sought Ayurvedic treatment voluntarily when her SPO2 remained at 80% even after being given oxygen support. The patient was administered Ayurvedic medicines while undergoing oxygen therapy at the hospital. The patient refused to take Fabiflu recommended by the treating physician and discontinued other allopathic drugs except for Vitamin C. The patient showed clinical improvement within a day of administration of Ayurvedic medicines and was able to talk, eat, and sit on the bed without breathing difficulty and her SPO2 became stable between 95 and 98%. In the next two days, she was asymptomatic without oxygen support and was discharged from the hospital in the following week. Since obesity and high plasma CRP indicated high risk for progression to severe disease, the favourable outcomes with Ayurvedic treatment in this patient is significant and warrants further studies.

Understanding their possible effect is key to prevent future disease spread. Using a modelling approach, this study intends to measure the impact of the COVID-19 Portuguese vaccination strategy on the effective reproduction number and explore three scenarios for vaccine effectiveness waning. Namely, the no-immunity-loss, 1-year and 3-years of immunity duration scenarios. We adapted an age-structured SEIR deterministic model and used Portuguese hospitalisation data for the model calibration. Results show that, although the Portuguese vaccination plan had a substantial impact in reducing overall transmission, it might not be sufficient to control disease spread. A significant vaccination coverage of those above 5 years old, a vaccine effectiveness against disease of at least 80% and softer non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as mask usage and social distancing, would be necessary to control disease spread in the worst scenario considered. The immunity duration scenario of 1-year displays a resurgence of COVID-19 hospitalisations by the end of 2021, the same is observed in 3-year scenario although with a lower magnitude. The no-immunity-loss scenario presents a low increase in hospitalisations. In both the 1-year and 3-year scenarios, a vaccination boost of those above 65 years old would result in a 53% and 38% peak reduction of non-ICU hospitalisations, respectively. These results suggest that NPIs should not be fully phased-out but instead be combined with a fast booster vaccination strategy to reduce healthcare burden.","output":"Measuring the impact of COVID-19 vaccination and immunity waning: a modelling study for Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on the lives of individuals, families, and communities around the world.

We sought to determine the age-specific rates of COVID-19 mortality at the population level. METHODS: We obtained information regarding the total number of COVID-19 reported deaths for six consecutive weeks beginning at the 50th recorded death, among 16 countries that reported a relatively high number of COVID-19 cases as of April 12, 2020. We performed an ecological study to model COVID-19 mortality rates per week by age group (54 years or younger, 55C64 years, and 65 years or older) and sex using a Poisson mixed effects regression model. RESULTS: Over the six-week period of data, there were 178,568 COVID-19 deaths from a total population of approximately 2.4 billion people. Age and sex were associated with COVID-19 mortality. Compared with individuals ages 54 years or younger, the incident rate ratio (IRR) was 8.1, indicating that the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 8.1 times higher (95%CI = 7.7, 8.5) among those 55 to 64 years, and more than 62 times higher (IRR = 62.1; 95%CI = 59.7, 64.7) among those ages 65 or older. Mortality rates from COVID-19 were 77% higher in men than in women (IRR = 1.77, 95%CI = 1.74, 1.79).

Due to various countermeasures, including lock\\\\downs, wearing masks, and increased hygiene, the virus has been controlled in some parts of the world. More recently, the availability of vaccines, based on RNA or adenoviruses, has greatly added to our ability to keep the virus at bay; again, however, in some parts of the world only. While available vaccines are effective, it would be desirable to also have more classical vaccines at hand for the future. Key feature of vaccines for long\\\\term control of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 would be inexpensive production at large scale, ability to make multiple booster injections, and long\\\\term stability at 4.

RESULTS: Using bacterial fermentation and continuous flow centrifugation for purification, the yield of the production process is estimated to be >2.5 million doses per 1000\\\\litre fermenter run. We demonstrate that the candidate vaccine is highly immunogenic in mice and rabbits and induces more high avidity antibodies compared to convalescent human sera. The induced antibodies are more cross\\\\reactive to mutant RBDs of variants of concern (VoC). Furthermore, antibody responses are neutralizing and long\\\\lived.

Food-contamination must be determined to maintain health and up-hold laws, as well as for ethical and cultural concerns. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a rapid and inexpensive quantitative method to detect the presence of targeted DNA-segments in samples, helps in determining both accidental and intentional adulterations of foods by biological contaminants. This review presents recent developments in theory, techniques, and applications of RT-PCR in food analyses, RT-PCR addresses the limitations of traditional food analyses in terms of sensitivity, range of analytes, multiplexing ability, cost, time, and point-of-care applications. A range of targets, including species of plants or animals which are used as food ingredients, food-borne bacteria or viruses, genetically modified organisms, and allergens, even in highly processed foods can be identified by RT-PCR, even at very low concentrations. Microfluidic RT-PCR eliminates the separate sample-processing step to create opportunities for point-of-care analyses.

The high transmission of this airborne virus has raised countless concerns regarding safety measures employed in the working conditions for medical professionals. Specifically, those who perform treatment procedures on patients which intrinsically create mists of fine airborne droplets, i.e., perfect vectors for this and other viruses to spread. The present study focuses on understanding the splatter produced due to a common dentistry technique to remove plaque buildup on teeth. This technique uses a high-speed dentistry instrument, e.g., a Cavitron ultrasonic scaler, to scrape along the surface of a patients teeth. This detailed understanding of the velocity and the trajectory of the droplets generated by the splatter will aid in the development of hygiene mechanisms to guarantee the safety of those performing these procedures and people in clinics or hospitals. Optical flow tracking velocimetry (OFTV) method was employed to obtain droplet velocity and trajectory in a two-dimensional plane. Multiple data collection planes were taken in different orientations around a model of adult mandibular teeth. This technique provided pseudo-three-dimensional velocity information for the droplets within the splatter developed from this high-speed dental instrument. These results indicated that within the three-dimensional splatter produced there were high velocities (1C2 m/s) observed directly below the intersection point between the front teeth and the scaler. The splatter formed a cone-shape structure that propagated 10C15 mm away from the location of the scaler tip. From the droplet trajectories, it was observed that high velocity isolated droplets propagate away from the bulk of the splatter. It is these droplets which are concerning for health safety to those performing the medical procedures. Using a shadowgraphy technique, we further characterize the individual droplets size and their individual velocity. We then compare these results to previously published distributions. The obtained data can be used as a first step to further examine flow and transport of droplets in clinics/dental offices.

Contact tracing and testing with isolated medical care of identified cases is a key strategy for interrupting chains of transmission of COVID-19 and reducing mortality associated with COVID-19.

The index patient infected 74 individuals who were close contacts that were identified through contact tracing, and exposed individuals were monitored in quarantine with daily polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. All individuals were asymptomatic initially, but all PCR-positive individuals eventually developed symptoms. Infectivity was documented up to 8 days before being confirmed as a symptomatic case, approximately 4 days before turning PCR positive. What are the implications for public health practice? During an outbreak, we suggest tracing close contacts from both PCR-positive individuals and suspected cases, rather than from suspected cases alone. Due to the long period of infectivity before turning PCR positive or developing symptoms, close contacts that had contact with a newly PCR positive case within 4 days should be judged as at risk of being infected; close contacts that had contact within 8 days of a newly symptomatic case should be judged as at risk being infected.","output":"Index and First-Generation Cases in a COVID-19 Outbreak  Jilin Province, China, 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cardiac involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) has been established.

As brain rather than body temperature reduction, theoretically, is the most important in cerebral protection, there is logic in targeting cooling at the brain. Selective brain cooling can, in theory, be obtained by cooling the skull or by heat loss from the upper airways. In this preliminary safety and efficacy study, we report clinical data from brain-injured patients who because of hyperthermia were treated with intranasal cooling. METHODS Nine intubated brain-injured patients with hyperthermia were treated using a prototype intranasal balloon system perfused with cold saline. Temperature in the cerebrum, esophagus, and bladder was monitored together with intracranial pressure. RESULTS In only two of nine patients, normothermia was reached in the esophagus and in only four of nine patients it was reached in the bladder. When normothermia was reached, the time to normothermia was delayed. In the brain, normothermia was reached in two of five patients after approximately 72 h. Median temperature curves from the first 72 h of cooling showed that normothermia was not reached in any of the three compartments. The temperature in the brain and bladder were on average 0.6 and 0.5 C higher than in the esophagus. ICP increased with increasing brain temperature. We found no signs of clinical important injury to the nasal mucosa from the cold saline or pressure in the balloons.

First, the authors build time series models that describe the evolution of markers and their correlation with crisis events. Second, the authors use the time series for forecasting markers and identifying high prevalence points for the estimated markers. Findings: The authors evaluated different forecasting strategies that yielded different performance and capabilities. In the best scenario, high prevalence periods of emotions and mental health issues can be satisfactorily predicted with a neural network strategy, even at early stages of a crisis (e.g. a training period of seven days). Practical implications: This work contributes to a better understanding of how psychological processes related to crises manifest in social media, and this is a valuable asset for the design, implementation and monitoring of health prevention and communication policies.

Using data from the combined 2018 and 2019 National Survey of Childrens Health, structural equation models tested direct and indirect relationships between neighborhood physical environment, neighborhood social cohesion, family resilience, and flourishing among 18,396 children and 24,817 adolescents. After controlling for multiple covariates that may influence flourishing, the models supported that higher levels of neighborhood social cohesion were directly associated with higher levels of flourishing adolescents, and indirectly by positive associations with family resilience for both children and adolescents. No indirect effects between neighborhood physical environments and flourishing were supported by the data for either children or adolescents. However, neighborhood physical environments were positively associated with adolescent flourishing. Understanding social environmental factors that strengthen and enhance child and adolescent flourishing are critical toward designing prevention, intervention, and policy efforts that can build on the existing strengths of families and their communities.","output":"Supportive Neighborhoods, Family Resilience and Flourishing in Childhood and Adolescence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resveratrol, the most widely studied natural phytochemical, has been shown to interact with different target proteins.

We utilized molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to reveal how resveratrol and structurally similar compounds bind to various nucleotide-dependent enzymes, specifically, DNA polymerases, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, and ribonucleotide reductase. The results show that resveratrol and its analogs exert their inhibitory effects by competing with the substrate dNTPs in these enzymes and blocking elongation of chain polymerization.

In particular, conspiracy theories argued on the effect of specific new technologies like 5G and misinformation tarnished the reputation of brands like Huawei. Language plays a crucial role in understanding the motivational determinants of social media users in sharing misinformation, as people extract meaning from information based on their discursive resources and their skillset. In this paper, we analyze textual and non-textual cues from a panel of 4923 tweets containing the hashtags #5G and #Huawei during the first week of May 2020, when several countries were still adopting lockdown measures, to determine whether or not a tweet is retweeted and, if so, how much it is retweeted. Overall, through traditional logistic regression and machine learning, we found different effects of the textual and non-textual cues on the retweeting of a tweet and on its ability to accumulate retweets. In particular, the presence of misinformation plays an interesting role in spreading the tweet on the network. More importantly, the relative influence of the cues suggests that Twitter users actually read a tweet but not necessarily they understand or critically evaluate it before deciding to share it on the social media platform.","output":"Linguistic drivers of misinformation diffusion on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ascoviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses that mainly infect noctuid larvae, and are transmitted by the parasitoid wasp Microplitis similis Lyle.

METHODS The electronic health records of adult CKD patients admitted between August 2018 and February 2020 were retrospectively reviewed to identify CKD patients with >1 hospitalisation and length of hospital stay 4 days. Outcome measures were mortality and the duration of hospitalisation. We also assessed the utility of the Cohen's model to predict 6-month mortality among CKD patients. RESULTS A total of 442 patients (mean age 68.6 years) with median follow-up of 15.3 months were identified. The mean (standard deviation) Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI] was 6.82.0 with 48.4% on chronic dialysis. The overall mortality rate until August 2020 was 36.7%. Mortality was associated with age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-1.77), CCI7 (1.58, 1.08-2.30), lower serum albumin (1.09, 1.06-1.11), readmission within 30-day (1.96, 1.43-2.68) and CKD non-dialysis (1.52, 1.04-2.17). Subgroup analysis of the patients within first 6-month from index admission revealed longer hospitalisation stay for those who died (CKD-non dialysis: 5.5; CKD-dialysis: 8.0 versus 4 days for those survived, P<0.001). The Cohen's model demonstrated reasonable predictive ability to discriminate 6-month mortality (area under the curve 0.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.87). Only 24 (5.4%) CKD patients completed advanced care planning.

This study assessed the infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) contaminating surfaces and objects in two hospital isolation units and a quarantine hotel. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 virus stability and infectivity on non-porous surfaces was tested under controlled laboratory conditions. Surface and air sampling were conducted at two COVID-19 isolation units and in a quarantine hotel. Viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR and infectivity was assessed by VERO E6 CPE test. RESULTS: In laboratory-controlled conditions, SARS-CoV-2 gradually lost its infectivity completely by day 4 at ambient temperature, and the decay rate of viral viability on surfaces directly correlated with increase in temperature. Viral RNA was detected in 29/55 surface samples (52.7%) and 16/42 surface samples (38%) from the surroundings of symptomatic COVID-19 patients in isolation units of two hospitals and in a quarantine hotel for asymptomatic and very mild COVID-19 patients. None of the surface and air samples from the three sites (0/97) were found to contain infectious titres of SARS-Cov-2 on tissue culture assay.

To address this, we evaluated serological responses to COVID-19 vaccination with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) mRNA BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (NIH-Moderna) vaccines in IBD patients enrolled in an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 sero-survey at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Design We obtained sera from 48 patients who had undergone vaccination with one or two vaccine doses. Sera were tested for SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD total immunoglobulins and IgG (Siemens COV2T and sCOVG assays), anti-Spike IgG (in-house ELISA), and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies (Roche). Results All IBD patients (15/15) who completed two-dose vaccine schedules achieved seroconversion to high levels. Two IBD patients with history of COVID-19 infections and who were seropositive at baseline seroconverted to high levels after the first dose. Concurrent biologic use was 85% (41/48), including 33% of patients (16) on TNF antagonist monotherapy, 42% (17) on vedolizumab monotherapy, 6% (3) on vedolizumab combination therapy with thiopurine, and 8% (4) ustekinumab; 1 patient was receiving guselkumab for psoriasis. Three patients (6%) were on oral steroids at the time of vaccination. Conclusion IBD patients receiving biologics can seroconvert with robust serological responses after complete Pfizer-BioNTech and NIH-Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. In IBD-patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion, a single dose of either vaccine can induce high index values, mirroring findings from the general population.","output":"Serological response to COVID-19 vaccination in IBD patients receiving biologics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ran-Lew Dairy quickly adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic, a time when many grocers suddenly faced shortages due to disruptions in their supply chains.

Packed schedules and little rest time may make student-athletes more susceptible to mental health issues than the general population, but few athletes are fully aware of the effects that nutrition can have on their mental health. While collegiate athletic programs are beginning to recognize the individual contributions of nutrition and mental health to performance and are hiring sport dietitians and psychologists for their athletes, it is unclear whether these topics are ever discussed within the same context. The goal of this study was to understand the perspectives of different athletic personnel on the relationship between nutrition and mental health. 17 athletic personnel (11 Female, 6 Male) from 6 NCAA Division I universities were recruited for a 30C45-min semi-structured WebEx interview. Participants included athletic trainers, coaches, dietitians, sport psychologists, strength and conditioning coaches, and sports medicine physicians. Participants were asked questions about their educational backgrounds, resources, and perspectives on the integration of nutrition and mental health in their programs. Transcribed responses were sorted into four themes: (1) Resources, (2) Education, (3) Department Integration or Collaboration, and (4) Student and Coach Engagement. All participants reported a need for greater monetary resources and staffing. Around 59% of the participants felt they had little more than general or personal interest-level knowledge on topics pertaining to nutrition or mental health, with the exception of sports dietitians or psychologists. Each school varied in the degree to which their athletic staff regularly communicated about their work and athlete health statuses. Athletes were reportedly more or less likely to utilize the resources provided depending on coach attitudes toward nutrition or mental health. Regardless of size, reputation and annual spending, each university was reported to be in the early stages of integrating nutrition and mental health programs into their existing athletic departments.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used data from the sixth National Health Survey, carried out between September 2019 and December 2019, for the subgroup of people aged between 25 and 79 years old (n = 12 052). We considered the comorbidities with demonstrated link to COVID-19 mortality: asthma, chronic bronchitis, cardiovascular (CVD) and cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic renal disease (CRD), and obesity. The inequality, stratified by sex, was measured in terms of education and income, using logistic regression (odds ratios and relative index of inequality). RESULTS: Compared to men with the lowest level of formal education, we measured a risk reduction, among men with tertiary education, of CVD (-90%), chronic bronchitis (-75%), stroke (-70%), diabetes (-62%), hypertension (-41%), and obesity (-43%). Among tertiaryeducated women, we observed a reduced risk of CRD (-77%), hypertension, diabetes, stroke (-70%), obesity (-64%), and CVD (-55%).

We designed and tested a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) as a cost-effective alternative to real-time PCR and cell culture based detection for HMPV and HRSV. The newly developed PCR was used to screen nasal/throat swab samples from 356 patients with suspected acute respiratory infection attending the Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. The method was compared with a commercially available kit employing real time PCR, for its sensitivity and specificity. 53 (14.9 %) samples were positive for at least one tested pathogen by mRT-PCR. All except one among the positive samples showed similar pathogen profile when tested using real time PCR. 8 (15.1 %) among these 53 were positive for HRSVA, 33 (62.3 %) positive for HRSVB and 12 (22.6 %) were positive for HMPV. 17 (32.7 %) samples showed co-infections in them.

OBJECTIVE: The study intended to understand the effect of COVID-19 on western Indian elderly care homes, the actions taken by the administration, and the challenges faced during and post-lockdown period. METHOD: A total of 44 care homes across three states of western India were contacted for data collection during the period of September-December 2020. Semi-structured interviews of the administrators were taken to gather the required information to achieve the study objectives. RESULTS: Out of 44 care homes, ten care homes reported 169 cases of coronavirus infection and seven deaths. Hence, the rate of reported COVID-19 cases was found to be 1074 per 10,000 residents. DISCUSSION: Results of the study indicated the significant steps taken by these old-age care homes to stave off the infection spread among the occupants. It was observed that an average of 26% of the occupants was sent back to their home/relative's home before the lockdown to decongest the care homes. Care homes in western India seemed to have a very low infection rate and a very low number of deaths as compared to the Global Scenario.

METHODS Fifty-eight patients from the Excellence in Peripheral Artery Disease (XLPAD) registry (NCT01904851) were treated between April 2010 and November 2013 with the Viance device. The procedural and 30-day clinical outcomes were collected. RESULTS Mean age was 65.5  8.7 years and 55.1% had diabetes mellitus. Most lesions (n = 58) were TASC classification type C (n = 16; 27.6%) and D (n = 16; 27.6%), with mean lesion length 140.0  71.0 mm; 93.1% of lesions were de novo and 81.0% were severely calcified. Technical success (crossing without the use of a reentry device) was achieved in 87.9% of cases and procedural success was obtained in 86.2%; 51.7% of lesions received stents, with the remaining treated with balloon angioplasty and/or atherectomy. Average fluoroscopy time was 39.1  21.2 min, with 187.8  72.0 mL of contrast and 210.0  212.0 Gy cm2 radiation dose-area product. There was 1 periprocedural complication (access-site hematoma treated conservatively without blood transfusion). At 30 days post procedure, there was significant improvement in ankle-brachial index (0.72  0.30 to 0.84  0.16; P=.01) and Rutherford class (3.33  0.81 to 1.54  1.47; P<.001). Clinically-indicated target vessel revascularization, surgical intervention or amputation at 30 days was 5.2%. CONCLUSION Use of Viance to cross infrainguinal arterial CTO was associated with high success, low complication rates, and significant symptom improvement.","output":"Crossing of infrainguinal peripheral arterial chronic total occlusion with a blunt microdissection catheter."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) are monoclonal antibodies that have been shown to be effective in reducing both LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) values and major cardiovascular events in patients at high cardiovascular risk. Adherence to PCSK9i is critical for the success of the treatment. The aim of the present study is to evaluate patients adherence to PCSK9i during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients referred to the Cardiac Diagnostic Unit of the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli Naples, taking PCSK9i, and who missed the cardiological follow-up visit during the first national COVID-19 lockdown (9 MarchC17 May 2020), were included. Each patient underwent medical teleconsultation to collect current clinical conditions, adherence to drug treatments, and lipid profile laboratory tests. Among 151 eligible patients, 20 were excluded for missing or untraceable telephone numbers and one for refusing to join the interview. The selected study population consisted of 130 patients (64  9 years, 68% males), of whom 11 (8.5%) reported a temporary interruption of the PCSK-9 therapy for a mean period of 65  1.5 days. The non-adherent patients showed a marked increase in LDL-C than in the pre-pandemic period (90.8  6.0 vs. 54.4  7.7 mg/dL, p < 0.0001), and 82% of patients moved out of the LDL-C therapeutic range. The non-adherent group was more likely to have a very high cardiovascular risk compared to the adherent group (81.8 vs. 33.6%, p < 0.001). Causes of interruption included drug prescription failure (63.6%) due to temporary interruption of the non-urgent outpatient visits and failure in drug withdrawal (36.4%) due to patients fear of becoming infected during the pandemic. The COVID-19 lockdown caused a remarkable lack of adherence to PCSK9i therapy, risking negative implications for the health status of patients at high cardiovascular risk. Facilitating patients access to PCSK9i and enhancing telemedicine seem to be effective strategies to ensure the continuity of care and appropriate management of these patients.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Patients Adherence to PCSK9 Inhibitors Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More deadly than the First World War, the global outbreak of influenza in 1918 terrified populations and tested governments.

Although prion infections do not stimulate adaptive immune responses in infected individuals, the actions of certain immune cell populations can have a significant impact on disease pathogenesis. After infection, the targeting of peripherally-acquired prions to specific immune cells in the secondary lymphoid organs (SLO), such as the lymph nodes and spleen, is essential for the efficient transmission of disease to the brain. Once the prions reach the brain, interactions with other immune cell populations can provide either host protection or accelerate the neurodegeneration. In this review, we provide a detailed account of how factors such as inflammation, ageing and pathogen co-infection can affect prion disease pathogenesis and susceptibility. For example, we discuss how changes to the abundance, function and activation status of specific immune cell populations can affect the transmission of prion diseases by peripheral routes. We also describe how the effects of systemic inflammation on certain glial cell subsets in the brains of infected individuals can accelerate the neurodegeneration. A detailed understanding of the factors that affect prion disease transmission and pathogenesis is essential for the development of novel intervention strategies.","output":"The Effects of Immune System Modulation on Prion Disease Susceptibility and Pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary: of clinical characteristics of 25 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in children aged between 2 and 15 years, with at least one infected member in their family, are reported and discussed herein.

We write this prospective observational study to ascertain the feasibility and safety of this technique in patients otherwise requiring two operations. Five patients who underwent double procedures with a single-port device were reviewed: Case 1, a transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair and gastric wedge resection; Case 2, cholecystectomy and diaphragmatic hernia repair; Case 3, oophorectomy and incisional hernia repair; Case 4, anterior resection of the rectum and hepatic segmentectomy; and Case 5, left adrenalectomy and cholecystectomy. Patient demographics, type of port used, operative time, complications and incision length were collected. Mean operative time for the cases ranged from 100 to 315 min. Incision length for the single-port device was 2 cm. In Case 2, an additional 5-mm port was used and an intraoperative complication involving a laceration of the liver occurred during the suturing of the gallbladder fundus. An additional 8-cm lower abdominal incision (Pfannenstiel) was required in Case 4 to complete the colonic anastomosis and for specimen retrieval. Single-port endo-laparoscopic surgery is a feasible and safe technique for approaching double procedures. It drastically reduces the number of scars that a double procedure creates, and if difficulty arises, another port can always be added to ease the operation. It can also potentially reduce the number of admissions and anesthesia that a patient undergoes.","output":"Single-port endo-laparoscopic surgery in combined abdominal procedures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious intestinal infectious disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which is characterized by a high mortality rate in piglets. Since 2012, a remarkable growth in PED outbreaks occurred in many pig farms in China, landing a heavy blow on the pig industry. In order to develop a new effective vaccine for the current PEDV, oral vaccines were generated by transferring eukaryotic expression recombinant plasmids carrying the S1 and S2 (antigenic sites of the S protein) epitopes of PEDV into a swine-origin Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus). After oral immunization of the BALB/c mice, higher levels of anti-PEDV specific IgG and SIgA antibodies and cellular immune responses were detected in mice orally administered with the recombinant L. acidophilus-S1 compared to the L. acidophilus-S2. Furthermore, L. acidophilus-S1 was used to inoculate the pregnant sows orally and the results showed that the recombinant L. acidophilus-S1 could elicit a specific systemic and mucosal immune response. In summary, our study demonstrated that oral immunization with L. acidophilus-S1 could improve the humoral and mucosal immune levels in sows and would be a promising candidate vaccine against PEDV infection in piglets.","output":"Recombinant Lactobacillus acidophilus expressing S1 and S2 domains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus could improve the humoral and mucosal immune levels in mice and sows inoculated orally"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New York City Transit operates one of the world?s largest transit systems, and it can be difficult for the agency?s communications team to keep track of the numerous service disruptions that need to be communicated to customers This paper introduces the Transit Visualization tool, which processes real-time train location data to automatically identify areas of the system where service may not be living up to customers? expectations Specifically, the Transit Visualization is set up to identify areas of the system where trains are operating at lower-than-normal speeds and areas of the system where there are atypically long gaps between trains Any occurrence of slow speeds or long gaps is assigned a severity level (Moderate, Severe, or Very Severe) to indicate the magnitude of the problem An overview of any problems the application identifies is shown on an interactive web map, as well as on several easy-to-digest summary tables The map also displays real-time locations of trains and buses throughout the transit system The Transit Visualization has been successfully rolled out to the subways communications team and has become a mission-critical tool for communicating delays to customers, especially during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Using Real-Time Data to Detect Delays and Improve Customer Communications at New York City Transit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a devastating impact on human health across the globe, and people are still observing face-masking as a preventive measure to contain the spread of COVID-19. Coughing is one of the major transmission mediums of COVID-19, and early cough detection could play a significant r ole i n p reventing t he s pread o f t his life-threatening virus. Many approaches have been proposed for developing systems to detect coughing and other respiratory symptoms in literature, but earable devices are not well-studied and investigated for respiratory symptom detection. In this work, we posited an acoustic research prototype (earable device) - eSense that has acoustic and IMU sensors embedded into user-convenient earbuds to address the following issues: (i) feasibility of the earables in detecting respiratory symptoms, and (ii) scalability of trained machine learning models in the presence of unseen data samples. We performed experimentation with both shallow and deep learning models on the eSense collected data samples. We observed that the deep learning model outperforms the shallow learning models achieving 97% accuracy. Furthermore, we investigated the scalability of the deep learning model on unseen datasets and noticed that the performance of the deep learning model deteriorates when trained on a particular dataset and tested on an unseen dataset. To mitigate such challenges, we postulated an adversarial domain adaptation technique that helps improve the performance of our respiratory symptoms detection framework by a substantial margin. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"A Scalable and Domain Adaptive Respiratory Symptoms Detection Framework using Earables"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report on the direct experimental evidence of hydrogen migration in triply charged acetylene.
