We find that Black and Latino clustered ZIP codes are less likely to have vaccine distribution sites and that this disparity is partially explained by the lack of hospitals and physicians' offices in these areas. Moreover, Black clustering is also negatively related to the number of allocated vaccine doses, and again, this is largely explained by the unequal distribution of health care resources. These results suggest that extant disparities in service provision are key to understanding racial-ethnic inequality in an acute crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Racial-Ethnic Residential Clustering and Early COVID-19 Vaccine Allocations in Five Urban Texas Counties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Acute respiratory tract infections are the most common illnesses in all individuals, regardless of age or gender.

RESULTS: Thematic analysis revealed 4 main themes relating to the nurses role: 1) protector 2) challenges to human quality of care 3) vulnerability and 4) resilience. The measures taken as protector were described as compromising the human qualities of care fundamental to their role. This tension, together with other new challenges, heightened feelings of vulnerability. Concurrently, nurses identified role resilience, including resourcefulness and peer support, which allowed them to navigate the global pandemic. CONCLUSION: By identifying global challenges and strategies to overcome these, neonatal nurses may be better equipped as the pandemic continues.

Here, we analyzed the impact of COVID-19 infection in renal patients to assess the time to viral clearance, together with the production and persistence of IgG and IgM antibody response, in consideration of the altered immune capacity of this fragile population. METHODS: Viral clearance and antibody kinetics were investigated in 49 renal patients recovered from COVID-19 infection: 7 of them with chronic decompensated renal failure, 31 under dialysis treatment, and 11 kidney transplant recipients. RESULTS: The time span between the diagnosis of infection and recovery based on laboratory testing (2 negative nasopharyngeal swabs in consecutive days) was 31.7  13.3 days. Three new positive cases were detected from 8 to 13 days following recovery. At the first serological determination after swab negativization, all the patients developed IgG and IgM antibodies. The semiquantitative analysis showed a progressive increase in IgG and a slow reduction in IgM. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: In subjects with decompensated chronic kidney disease, under dialysis and in transplant recipients, viral clearance is lengthened compared to the general population.

We found that positive updating after reactivation was equivalent to neutral updating in altering true memories of the aversive story, but introduced more false memory. Moreover, an additional 12 hours of sleep reconsolidation did not further enlarge true memory differences, but attenuated the effect of reactivation and updating on false memory. Interestingly, the neutral rather than the positive updating reduced the emotional arousal of the aversive memory 24 hours later.

The urgent need for COVID-19 research created new ethical, regulatory, and practical challenges. The next public health emergency could be worse than COVID-19. We must learn about these challenges from the experiences of researchers and Research Ethics Committee professionals responsible for these COVID-19 studies to prepare for the next emergency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an online survey to identify the ethical, oversight, and regulatory challenges of conducting COVID-19 research during the early pandemic, and proposed solutions for overcoming these barriers. Using criterion-based, convenience sampling, we invited researchers who proposed or conducted COVID-19 research to complete an anonymous, online survey about their experiences. We administered a separate but related survey to Institutional Review Board (IRB) professionals who reviewed COVID-19 research studies. The surveys included open-ended and demographic items. We performed inductive content analysis on responses to open-ended survey questions. RESULTS: IRB professionals (n = 143) and researchers (n = 211) described 19 types of barriers to COVID-19 research, related to 5 overarching categories: policy and regulatory, biases and misperceptions, institutional and inter-institutional conflicts, risks of harm, and pressure of the pandemic. Researchers and IRB professionals described 8 categories of adaptations and solutions to these challenges: enacting technological solutions; developing protocol-based solutions; disposition and team management; establishing and communicating appropriate standards; national guidance and leadership; maintaining high standards; prioritizing studies before IRB review; and identifying and incorporating experts. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This inventory of challenges represents ongoing barriers to studying the current pandemic, and they represent a risk to research during future public health emergencies. Delays in studies of a pandemic during a pandemic threatens the health and safety of the public. We urge the development of a national working group to address these issues before the next public health emergency arises.","output":"Ethical, regulatory, and practical barriers to COVID-19 research: A stakeholder-informed inventory of concerns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although recognized as effective measures to curb the spread of the COVID19 outbreak, social distancing and home confinement have generated a mental health burden with older adults who are considered to be more vulnerable to psychosocial strains To date, the application of digital technologies in response to COVID-19 pandemic has been narrowed to public-health needs related to containment and mitigation However, information and communications technology (ICT)-based initiatives directed toward prediction and prevention of psychosocial support are still limited Given the power of digital health solutions to allow easy and accurate characterization and intervention for health and disease, as well as to flatten the COVID19 incidence curves in many countries, our ECLB-COVID19 consortium is highlighting the importance of providing innovative ICT-based solutions (ICT-COVID-Companion) to improve elderly physical and mental health, thereby preventing/dampening psychosocial strain during pandemics Based on innovative approaches (e g , emotional/social computing, open social platform, interactive coaching, gamification, fitness-tracker, internet of things) and smart digital solutions (smartwatch/smartphone), smart companions must provide safe personalised physical, mental and psychosocial health surveillance Additionally, by delivering personalised multi-dimension crisis-oriented health recommendations, such innovative crisis-oriented solutions would help (i) facilitate a user's adherence to active and healthy confinement lifestyle (AHCL), (ii) achieve a rapid psychosocial recovery in case of depression issues and (iii) enhance preparedness for eventual future pandemics","output":"Applying digital technology to promote active and healthy confinement lifestyle during pandemics in the elderly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has significantly impacted endonasal surgery, and recent experimentation has demonstrated that sinonasal drilling and cautery have significant propensity for airborne particulate generation immediately adjacent to the surgical field. In the present investigation, we assessed nasopharyngeal suctioning as a mitigation strategy to decrease particulate spread during simulated endonasal surgical activity. METHODS: Airborne particulate generation in the 1-m to 10-m range was quantified with an optical particle sizer in real-time during cadaveric-simulated anterior and posterior endonasal drilling and cautery conditions. To test suction mitigation, experiments were performed both with and without a rigid suction placed in the contralateral nostril, terminating in the nasopharynx. RESULTS: Both anterior (medial maxillary wall and nasal septum) and posterior (sphenoid rostrum) drilling produced significant particulate generation in the 1-m to 10-m range throughout the duration of drilling (p < 0.001) without the use of suction, whereas nasopharyngeal suction use eliminated the detection of generated airborne particulate. A similar effect was seen with nasal cautery, with significant particle generation (p < 0.001) that was reduced to undetectable levels with the use of nasopharyngeal suction. CONCLUSION: The use of nasopharyngeal suctioning via the contralateral nostril minimizes airborne particulate spread during simulated sinonasal drilling and cautery.

These facilities were modeled on multi-trillion-dollar lending facilities set up by the Federal Reserve in 2008 in response to the prior economic crisis. These Federal Reserve lending facilities are extraordinary in size but also extraordinary because they involve lending to firms that are not banks. Federal Reserve lending over the first hundred years of its history was almost exclusively limited to banks. Congress put in place statutory limits on this extraordinary lending authority in the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 to limit the Federal Reserves discretion and minimize the risk that generous lending by the Federal Reserve would encourage excessive risk taking. Those limits prohibit the Fed from supporting insolvent firms, from propping up individual firms like it did with AIG in 2008, includes a number of other prescriptive measures to ensure the Federal Reserve takes reasonable risk management practices even in extraordinary times.

Nevertheless, the acceptance of an implant is affected by its inflammatory potency caused by surface-induced modification. Therefore, in this work, three types of nano-micro squared wells like PVDF structures (i.e., reversed pyramidal shape with depths from 0.8 to 2.5 microns) were obtained by replication, and the influence of their characteristics on the inflammatory response of human macrophages was investigated in vitro. FTIR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirmed the maintaining chemical structures of the replicated surfaces, while the topographical surface characteristics were evaluated by AFM and SEM analysis. Contact angle and surface energy analysis indicated a modification from superhydrophobicity of casted materials to moderate hydrophobicity based on the structures depth change. The effects induced by PVDF casted and micron-sized reversed pyramidal replicas on macrophages behavior were evaluated in normal and inflammatory conditions (lipopolysaccharide treatment) using colorimetric, microscopy, and ELISA methods.

Views on the frequency of availability for measurement, the format, type and purpose of measurement, and with whom well-being should be discussed were measured. When an outcome was scored 7C9 on a 9-point Likert scale of agreement by 75% of participants it was considered critical. Inductive thematic analysis was undertaken on the interview transcripts. SETTING: All medicine programmes at University of Southampton. PARTICIPANTS: Medical students from all years took part in the survey (n=118) and interviews (n=16). RESULTS: Most participants (94%) felt able to give 5 min to measure their well-being at least once per month. Research, governance and individual feedback were all considered critically important. Only subjective assessments undertaken by the individual in real-time were rated critically important (78.1%) measurement tools. Students selected that they would discuss their well-being with other medical students (n=87) nearly as often as they selected a member of the faculty (n=104). Five interview themes further explained these findings: (1) well-being is mental well-being; (2) exercise and support from friends and family are most important; (3) isolation and the design of the medicine programme are detrimental to well-being; (4) there are advantages to surveys, and conversations; (5) personal academic tutors and medical students in later years are the best to discuss well-being with.

METHODS: In 184 serum samples from 130 COVID-19 patients and 54 SARS-CoV-2 negative subjects, the analytical and clinical performances of four commercially available chemiluminescent assays (Abbott SARS-Cov-2 IgG, Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2, Ortho SARS-CoV-2 total and IgG) and one enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Diesse ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 IgG) were evaluated and compared with the neutralization activity achieved using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). FINDINGS: Precision results ranged from 0.9% to 11.8% for all assays. Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated linearity of results at concentrations within the cut-off value. Overall, sensitivity ranged from 78.5 to 87.7%, and specificity, from 97.6 to 100%. On limiting the analysis to samples collected 12 days after onset of symptoms, the sensitivity of all assays increased, the highest value (95.2%) being obtained with VITRO Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total and Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The strongest PRNT50 correlation with antibody levels was obtained with ENZY-Well SARS-CoV-2 IgG (R2adj = 0.569). INTERPRETATION: The results confirmed that all immunoassays had an excellent specificity, whereas sensitivity varied across immunoassays, depending strongly on the time interval between symptoms onset and sample collection.

METHODS: Using the descriptive results recently reported by the Chinese CDC, we compare the percentage of infected healthcare workers in severe conditions over time and across three areas in China, and the fatality rate of infected healthcare workers with all the infected individuals in China aged 22-59 years. RESULTS: Among the infected Chinese healthcare workers whose symptoms onset appeared during the same ten-day period, the percentage of those in severe conditions decreased significantly from 19.7% (Jan 11-20) to 14.4% (Jan 21-31) to 8.7% (Feb 1-11). Across the country, there was also a significant difference in the disease severity, with Wuhan being the most severe (17.3%), followed by Hubei Province (10.2%), and the rest of China (6.6%). The case fatality rate for the 1,688 infected Chinese healthcare workers was significantly lower than that for the 29,798 infected patients aged 20-59 years-0.3% (5/1,688) vs. 0.65% (193/29,798), respectively.

The clinical outcomes of infected Chinese healthcare workers may represent a more accurate estimation of the severity of COVID-19 for those who have access to quality healthcare.","output":"Geo-temporal distribution of 1,688 Chinese healthcare workers infected with COVID-19 in severe conditions-A secondary data analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"NTRODUCTION: Anticoagulant treatment approach in patients with COVID-19 is not well studied and not standardized. We aimed to compare the effects of standard prophylactic and pre-emptive therapeutic Low-Molecular-weight Heparin (LMWH) treatment approaches on mortality in patients with COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective and single-centre study includes patients aged  18 years, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and treated with LMWH during the hospital stay. Therapeutic dose of LMWH was defined as 1 mg/kg subcutaneously twice daily and prophylactic dose of LMWH was defined as 40 mg subcutaneously once daily. RESULTS: Among the 336 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia, 115 patients, who received LMWH were included in the study. The mean age was 58.6  13.3 and 58 (50.4 %) of the patients were male. Sixty-nine (60 %) of the patients were treated with prophylactic and 46 (40 %) therapeutic LMWH.In-hospital mortality was not different between patients treated therapeutic LMWH and prophylactic LMWH by the multivariate regression analysis (OR=2.187, 95% CI 0.484-9.880, p=0.309) and the propensity score modelling (OR=1.586, 95% CI 0.400-6.289, p=0.512.)CONCLUSION: Clinicians should consider the potential risks and benefits of standard prophylactic and pre-emptive therapeutic LMWH.

The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) for early gastric cancer in elderly patients. METHODS We retrospectively investigated 221 consecutive patients who underwent LG for early gastric cancer during a 5-year period (January 2010 to December 2014). We divided the patients into two groups: elderly patients (75 years old) and younger patients (<75 years old). We compared these two groups with respect to clinical characteristics, histopathological findings, intraoperative factors, and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS The preoperative characteristics were similar in both groups. Except for the number of harvested lymph nodes (42.0 vs 34.9; P = 0.0016), the short-term operative outcomes, including postoperative complications and histopathological findings, were comparable between the two groups. Although significantly fewer lymph nodes were harvested in the elderly group, the overall survival and relapse-free survival rates did not significantly differ between the groups. Postoperative complications, such as acute cholecystitis and internal hernia, occurred during the long-term postoperative period after LG, and these unexpected complications were more frequently observed in elderly patients. All elderly patients required additional emergent surgeries for delayed complications. CONCLUSION The outcomes of LG for early gastric cancer in elderly patients seem to be reasonable. Aggressive lymph node dissection may be omissible in elderly patients with acceptable results. LG can be a safe and feasible procedure in elderly patients. However, the higher rate of delayed but urgent complications during the long-term postoperative period must be considered.","output":"Safety and feasibility of laparoscopic gastrectomy accompanied by D1+ lymph node dissection for early gastric cancer in elderly patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Capsular injuries can occur during multiple shoulder dislocations. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the location and magnitude of glenohumeral capsular injury following multiple dislocations. We hypothesized that the magnitude of capsular injury would increase and the location of peak injury would vary depending on the number of dislocations. Seven fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were used. A 7  11 grid of strain markers was affixed to the anteroinferior capsule. Each joint was then mounted to a six degree-freedom robotic testing system. Marker tracking was performed following 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10 dislocations to determine the nonrecoverable strain as capsular injury. Following each dislocation, the magnitude of the maximum principal strain representing the nonrecoverable strain in the inferior glenohumeral capsule was quantified by comparing the strain marker positions following each dislocation. The peak value of nonrecoverable strain statistically increased with the number of dislocations in five of seven specimens (p = .0007). The capsular location that had the peak value of nonrecoverable strain varied according to the number of dislocations, and from specimen to specimen. The nonrecoverable strain was identified in the posterior capsule and anterior axillary pouch, which increased with the number of dislocations compared to the other regions of the capsule (p = .001-.012) by up to 16%. Clinical significance: While plication of the anterior axillary pouch is important following multiple dislocations, a more extensive anterior capsular shift may be necessary with an increased number of dislocations in addition to a posterior capsular shift when appropriate.","output":"Location and magnitude of capsular injuries varies following multiple anterior dislocations of the shoulder: Implications for surgical repair"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10 1210/jendso/bvaa102 ]","output":"Corrigendum to \\"Prevalence of Diabetes and Hypertension and Their Associated Risks for Poor Outcomes in Covid-19 Patients\\""},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This systematic review and meta-analysis of intervention studies aims to evaluate the effect of preoperative and/or post-operative support for adults who elect bariatric surgery delivered by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) on post-operative body composition, mental health, co-morbidities, quality of life, and side effects.

MethodsThis is a prospective cohort study of adult aged 18-59 years who received 2-dose SV at 14-35 days apart for more than 2 months. Participants received ID AZD1222 at fractional low dose(1x1010 viral particles,0.1ml). Antibody responses were evaluated by surrogate virus neutralization test(sVNT) against wild type and delta variant and anti-spike-receptor-binding-domain immunoglobulin G(anti-S-RBD IgG) at prior, day14 or 28, and day90 post booster. Solicited reactogenicity was collected during 7 days post-booster. Primary endpoint was the differences of sVNT against delta strain []80%inhibition at day14 and 90 compared with the parallel cohort study of 0.5-ml intramuscular(IM) route. ResultsFrom August2021, 100 adults with median(IQR) age of 46(41-52) years participated. At baseline, geometric means(GMs) of sVNT against delta strain prior to booster were 22.4%inhibition(95%CI 18.7-26.9) and of anti-S-RBD IgG were 109.3(95.4-125.1)BAU/ml.

In case of hospital admission, continuation of therapy in patients undergoing chronic NIV is necessary and several protective circuit configurations have been recommended to reduce the risk of aerosol dissemination. However, all these configurations increase instrumental dead space. We therefore designed this study to evaluate their effects on the tidal volume (VT(E)) required to preserve stable end-tidal CO(2) partial pressure (P(ET)CO(2)) with constant respiratory rate. METHODS: A bench consisting of a test lung connected to an adult-sized mannequin head was set up. The model was ventilated through usual domiciliary configuration (single limb circuit with facial vented mask) which was used as reference. Then, five different circuit configurations including non-vented facial mask with viral/bacterial filter, modification of leak position, and change from single to double-limb circuit were evaluated. For each configuration, pressure support (PS) was gradually increased to reach reference P(ET)CO(2). Resulting VT(E) was recorded as primary outcome. RESULTS: Reference P(ET)CO(2) was 38(0) mmHg, with a PS set at 10 cmH(2)O, resulting in a VT(E) of 432(2) mL. Compared to reference, all the configurations evaluated required substantial increase in VT(E) to preserve alveolar ventilation, ranging from +79(2) to +216(1) mL. CONCLUSIONS: Modifications of NIV configurations in the context of COVID-19 pandemic result in substantial increase of instrumental dead space.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of gilts in the swIAV transmission dynamics, and to evaluate the impact of different control measures such as quarantine and gilt vaccination. METHODS: The study was conducted as a cross-sectional study in ten Danish sow herds, including five swIAV vaccinated and five unvaccinated herds. Blood- and nasal swab samples of gilts, first parity sows and their piglets were collected at different stages in the production system (quarantine in/out, mating, gestation and farrowing) and analyzed for the presence of swIAV and swIAV antibodies. Associations between the detection of swIAV, seroprevalence, antibody levels, sow and gilt vaccination strategy and quarantine biosecurity were thereafter investigated to identify possible risk factors for swIAV introductions and persistence within the herds. RESULTS: Nine of the ten herds of the study had swIAV circulation and swIAV was detected in the quarantine, mating- and farrowing unit. The prevalence of seropositive gilts and first parity sows was significantly higher in the vaccinated herds, but swIAV was still present in nasal swabs from both gilts, first parity sows and piglets in these herds. Quarantine gilt vaccination and all-in/all-out management resulted in a significant reduction of swIAV positive gilts at the end of the quarantine period. CONCLUSION: The results underline that herd vaccination and/or quarantine facilities are crucial to avoid swIAV introductions into sow herds.

Because the previous peak covered the initial increase in the epidemic, K did not increase as much as expected; rather, the difference in the basic reproduction number R0 appeared in the slope of increasing K. Additionally, the mean infectious time{tau} appeared in the negative peaks of K. By using the R0 and{tau} estimated from the changes in K, changes in the number of patients could be approximated using the SIR model. This supports the appropriateness of the model for evaluating COVID-19 epidemics. By using the model, the distributions of the parameters were identified. On average, an epidemic started every eleven days in a country. The worldwide mean R0 was 2.9; however, this value showed an exponential character and could thus increase explosively. In addition, the average{tau} was 12 days; this is not the native value but represents a shortened period because of the isolation of patients. As{tau} represents the half-life, the infectious time varies among patients; hence, prior testing should be performed before isolation is lifted. The changes in K represented the state of epidemics and were several weeks to a month ahead of the changes in the number of confirmed cases. In the actual data, when K was positive on consecutive days, the number of patients increased a few weeks later. In addition, if the negative peaks of K could not be reduced to as small as 0.1, the number of patients remained high. Thus, the number of K-positive days and mean infectious time had a clear correlation with the total number of patients. In such cases, mortality, which was lognormally distributed, with a mean of 1.7%, increased. To control the epidemic, it is important to observe K daily, not to allow K to remain positive continuously, and to terminate a peak with a series of K-negative days. To do this, it was necessary to shorten{tau} by finding and isolating a patient earlier. The effectiveness of the countermeasures is apparent in{tau} . The effect of vaccination, in terms of controlling the epidemic, was limited.","output":"COVID-19 epidemics monitored through the logarithmic growth rate and SIR model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This review provides the first meta-analysis of the impact of physically active lessons on lesson-time and overall physical activity (PA), as well as health, cognition and educational outcomes. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled studies. Six meta-analyses pooled effects on lesson-time PA, overall PA, in-class educational and overall educational outcomes, cognition and health outcomes. Meta-analyses were conducted using the metafor package in R. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool for risk of bias. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC and Web of Science, grey literature and reference lists were searched in December 2017 and April 2019. STUDIES ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Physically active lessons compared with a control group in a randomised or non-randomised design, within single component interventions in general school populations. RESULTS 42 studies (39 in preschool or elementary school settings, 27 randomised controlled trials) were eligible to be included in the systematic review and 37 of them were included across the six meta-analyses (n=12 663). Physically active lessons were found to produce large, significant increases in lesson-time PA (d=2.33; 95% CI 1.42 to 3.25: k=16) and small, increases on overall PA (d=0.32; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.46: k=8), large, improvement in lesson-time educational outcomes (d=0.81; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.14: k=7) and a small improvement in overall educational outcomes (d=0.36; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.63: k=25). No effects were seen on cognitive (k=3) or health outcomes (k=3). 25/42 studies had high risk of bias in at least two domains. CONCLUSION In elementary and preschool settings, when physically active lessons were added into the curriculum they had positive impact on both physical activity and educational outcomes. These findings support policy initiatives encouraging the incorporation of physically active lessons into teaching in elementary and preschool setting.

Only 4% of the population of low-income countries has received a full primary vaccine series, compared to over 70% of the population of high-income nations. Methods: We used economic and epidemiologic models, parameterized with public data on global vaccination and COVID-19 deaths, to estimate the potential benefits of scaling up vaccination programs in low and lower-middle income countries (LIC/LMIC) in 2022 in the context of global spread of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV2. Outcomes were expressed as number of avertable deaths through vaccination, costs of scale-up, and cost per death averted. We conducted sensitivity analyses over a wide range of parameter estimates to account for uncertainty around key inputs. Findings: Global scale up of vaccination to provide two doses of mRNA vaccine to everyone in LIC/LMIC would cost $35.5 billion and avert 1.3 million deaths from COVID-19, at a cost of $26,900 per death averted. Scaling up vaccination to provide three doses of mRNA vaccine to everyone in LIC/LMIC would cost $61.2 billion and avert 1.5 million deaths from COVID-19 at a cost of $40,800 per death averted. Lower estimated infection fatality ratios, higher cost-per-dose, and lower vaccine effectiveness or uptake lead to higher cost-per-death averted estimates in the analysis. Interpretation: Scaling up COVID-19 global vaccination would avert millions of COVID-19 deaths and represents a reasonable investment in the context of the value of a statistical life (VSL). Given the magnitude of expected mortality facing LIC/LMIC without vaccination, this effort should be an urgent priority.","output":"Model-based estimates of deaths averted and cost per life saved by scaling-up mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in low and lower-middle income countries in the COVID-19 Omicron variant era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The following sections are included: ?

There are risks and benefits associated with both the type of interventions. Hence, this review was conducted to compare outcomes of immediate and delayed induction of labour among women with hypertensive disorder of pregnancy based on disease severity and gestational age. METHODS We conducted systematic searches in various databases including Medline, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), Scopus, and Embase from inception until October 2019.Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the quality of published trials. A meta-analysis was performed with random-effects model and reported pooled Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS Fourteen randomized controlled trials with 4244 participants were included. Majority of the studies had low or unclear bias risks. Amongst late onset mild pre-eclampsia patients, the risk of renal failure was significantly lower with immediate induction of labour (pooled RR: 0.36; 95%CI: 0.14 to 0.92). In severe pre-eclampsia patients, immediate induction of labour significantly reduced the risk of having small-for-gestational age babies compared to delayed induction of labour (pooled RR: 0.49; 95%CI: 0.29-0.84).Delayed induction was found to significantly reduce the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome risk among late onset mild pre-eclampsia patients (pooled RR: 2.15; 95%CI: 1.14 to 4.06) None of the other outcomes demonstrated statistically significant difference between the two interventions. CONCLUSION Delayed induction of labour with expectant monitoring may not be inferior to immediate induction of labour in terms of neonatal and maternal outcomes. Expectant approach of management for late onset mild pre-eclampsia patients may be associated with decreased risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, while immediate induction of labour among severe pre-eclampsia patients is associated with reduced risk of small-for-gestational age babies and among mild pre-eclampsia patients, it is associated with reduced risk of severe renal impairment.","output":"Immediate versus delayed induction of labour in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bisphosphonates (BP's), biologically stable analogs of naturally occurring pyrophosphates, became the treatment of choice for pathologic conditions characterized by increased osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, namely Paget's disease, osteoporosis and tumor bone disease.

Facebook entails numerous factors that increase the risk for disordered eating attitudes and behaviors (e.g., use time and Facebook activities such as social grooming and photo sharing). This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale (BFAS) among patients with eating disorders (EDs) given lack of validation of Facebook addiction measures in this population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving 123 inpatient and outpatient women with EDs (Mean age = 27.3, SD = 10.6, range = 14C59 years) used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), multigroup CFA, structural equation modeling (SEM), Spearmans rho Spearmans analysis, McDonald's Omega (), Cronbachs alpha (), and item-total correlations to examine the structure, invariance, criterion validity, reliability, and discriminant validity of the BFAS. RESULTS: Correlating the residuals of items 2, 3, and 5 resulted in an excellent fit of a one-factor structure of the BFAS ((2)(7) = 8.515, p = .289, CFI = .998, TLI = .996, RMSEA = .042, SRMR = .0099). The BFAS was invariant at the configural, metric, and scalar levels across groups of EDs, age, education, and marital status. High values of  and  (.96) as well as item-total correlations (.851C.929) indicated excellent reliability and high discrimination index of the BFAS. Criterion validity is noted by strong positive correlation with the Six-item Internet Addiction Test (S-IAT, r = .88) and SEM using the S-IAT to predict the BFAS (2(49) = 103.701, p = .001, CFI = .975, TLI = .966, RMSEA = .096, SRMR = .0317).. CONCLUSION: The BFAS is a reliable unidimensional measure. Its high discrimination index and invariance across different groups make it useful for detecting Facebook addiction among patients with ED.

We explored 47 different isatin-based derivatives (IBDs) for other potential biological activities using in silico tools and found them to possess anti-viral activity. Using AutoDock tools, the binding site, binding energy, inhibitory constant/K i and receptor-ligand interactions for each of the compounds were analyzed against SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The partition coefficient (logP) values were predicted using MedChem Designer tool. Based on the best K i, binding energy and the ideal range of logP (between 1.0 and 3.0), 10 out of total 47 compounds were deemed to be prospective RdRp inhibitors. Some of these compounds gave better K i, binding energy and logP values when compared to standard RdRp inhibitors, such as remdesivir (REM) (K i = 15.61 M, logP = 2.2; binding energy = -6.95), a clinically approved RdRp inhibitor and nine other RdRp inhibitors. The results showed that the 10 selected IBDs could be further explored.

Methods: In 6-month-old (6MO) and 15-month-old ([15MO]; reproductively senescent) female SHRSP, systolic BP (SBP), GFR, and proteinuria were measured before and after 4 weeks of treatment with vehicle (Veh), RLX (0.5 mg/kg per day s.c.), or RLX+PD123319 (AT2R antagonist; 3 mg/kg per day s.c.). Aortic endothelium-dependent relaxation and fibrosis of the kidney, heart, and aorta were assessed. Results: In 6MO SHRSP, RLX significantly enhanced GFR by approximately 25% (P=0.001) and reduced cardiac fibrosis (P=0.01) as compared with vehicle-treated counterparts. These effects were abolished or blunted by PD123319 coadministration. In 15MO females, RLX reduced interstitial renal (P=0.02) and aortic (P=0.003) fibrosis and lowered SBP (133 mm Hg; P=0.04) relative to controls. These effects were also blocked by PD123319 cotreatment (all P=0.05 versus RLX treatment alone). RLX also markedly improved vascular function by approximately 40% (P<0.001) in 15MO SHRSP, but this was not modulated by PD123319 cotreatment. Conclusions: The antifibrotic and organ-protective effects of RLX, when administered to a severe model of hypertension, conferred cardiorenal protection in adult and reproductively senescent female rats to a great extent via an AT2R-mediated mechanism.","output":"Relaxin Attenuates Organ Fibrosis via an Angiotensin Type 2 Receptor Mechanism in Aged Hypertensive Female Rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In some individuals who smoke the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an increase in the motivation to quit smoking, due to the higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection. However, this change is not universal, and the motivation to quit appears dependent upon factors such as fear of COVID-19 and perceived risk from COVID-19. In the current investigation, both COVID-19 severity and infection probability beliefs were measured to isolate which beliefs correlated with the motivation to quit smoking. Methods: UK-based smokers (N = 243) completed an online survey between September and October 2020, in which they reported their current motivation to quit smoking, fear of COVID-19, and their beliefs about how severe COVID-19 infection would be and how probable COVID-19 infection was. Results: The only significant predictor of the motivation to quit smoking was the perceived probability of COVID-19 infection,  = .22, p <.001, 95CI[.10, .34]. This relationship remained when controlling for the general perceived probability and severity of other smoking-related health conditions,  = .20, p = .002, 95CI[.08,.32], suggesting a COVID-19-specific effect. Further, perceived probability of COVID-19 infection mediated the positive impact of fear of COVID-19 on motivation,  = .07, p = .006, 95CI[.03,.13]. Conclusions: The result places the perceived probability of COVID-19 infection as a central predictor of motivation to quit during the pandemic. Based on this evidence, messaging aiming to facilitate smoking cessation during the pandemic should focus on the highly contagious nature of the virus to increase the motivation to quit.","output":"The relationship between COVID-19-specific health risk beliefs and the motivation to quit smoking: a UK-based survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"B cells are essential for antiviral immune defence because they produce neutralizing antibodies, present antigen and maintain the lymphoid architecture.

The aim of this surveillance was to describe the epidemiology of patients in hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in a network of Canadian acute care hospitals between Mar. 1 and Aug. 31, 2020. METHODS: Through prospective surveillance, we identified adult and pediatric patients in hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 using a standard definition between Mar. 1 and Aug. 31, 2020, through the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP), a network of 78 hospitals. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics and data on treatment, interventions and outcomes were reviewed and described. RESULTS: As of Aug. 31, 2020, the CNISP had received data for 1906 patients in hospital with COVID-19 in 49 sentinel hospitals in 9 provinces. The majority of patients in hospital with COVID-19 were older (median age 71 yr) and had underlying medical conditions (85.8%). Few children with COVID-19 were admitted to a participating hospital (n = 37, 1.9%). Acquisition of COVID-19 in hospitals was infrequent (6.4% of all cases). A total of 32.8% of patients were admitted from a long-term care facility or retirement home. Health care workers constituted 10.6% of adult patients aged 18-65 years in hospital with COVID-19. Thirty-day attributable mortality was 16.2%. Hospital admission rates peaked in mid-April and were highest in Ontario and Quebec. INTERPRETATION: Surveillance findings indicate that a high proportion of Canadian patients in hospital with COVID-19 during the first 6 months of the pandemic were older adults with underlying medical conditions. Active surveillance of patients in hospital with COVID-19 is critical to enhancing our knowledge of the epidemiology of COVID-19 and to identifying populations at risk for severe outcomes, which will help guide Canada's response in the coming months.","output":"Patients in hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in a network of Canadian acute care hospitals, Mar. 1 to Aug. 31, 2020: a descriptive analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present the case of a young obese patient with recent COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) who developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) 1 month after spontaneous resolution.

METHODS: An online survey was performed between May and July 2020 among 529 Polish, Arabic, Somali, Tamil, and Spanish-speaking migrants in Norway. For each outcome presented in the aims, unweighted and weighted descriptive analyses were performed for all migrants together and for each language group. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of migrants perceived their health as excellent or very good, with the lowest value (42%) in the Tamil group and the highest among Somalians (85%). The majority of respondents (82%) felt they had received sufficient information. Press conferences from the government, health authorities websites, and Norwegian news media were the preferred channels of information for all groups. Most migrants reported a high level of adherence to preventive measures (88%) and trust in Norwegian authorities (79%). However, there were variations among groups regarding the importance of sources of information and level of trust, which was lowest for the Polish group.

Intersectoral collaboration has been clearly shown to be a crucial tool in the prevention and control of emerging zoonotic diseases. A One Health strategy has been implemented under the concept of Healthy animal-Healthy food-Healthy people. An intersectoral coordination mechanism established between the veterinary and public health sectors has expanded its function to incorporate more work on food safety, emergency management, and effects of climate change on zoonotic diseases. Its membership includes the human health sector, the veterinary sector, the national emergency management agency, the environment sector, emergency management and inspection authorities, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The main outputs of the coordination mechanism have been strengthened surveillance and response activities and laboratory capacities. The coordination mechanism has also strengthened the surveillance and response capacity of neglected zoonotic diseases, such as brucellosis, anthrax, and tick-borne diseases. Through regular meetings and brainstorming sessions, both sectors have developed joint operational plans, a long-term risk reduction plan 2011C2015, initiated a prioritization exercise and risk assessment for 29 zoonotic diseases, and reviewed and revised standards, procedures, and communication strategies.

Timely microbiologic surveillance and assessment of antimicrobial resistance is important for dealing with nosocomial infections. This retrospective review was conducted to evaluate the microbiologic spectrum and susceptibility pattern in the pediatric intensive care unit from 2001 to 2006. METHODS The microbiologic data and antimicrobial susceptibility of all clinical isolates in the pediatric intensive care unit between 2001 and 2006 were reviewed. The incidence and distribution of nosocomial infections and the associated pathogens were also analyzed. RESULTS 1163 clinical isolates were analyzed. The frequencies of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were 30.4% and 56.2%, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate among the Gram-positive organisms, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the 3 leading Gram-negative isolates. The proportion of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) to all S. aureus was 65.2%. Six vancomycin-resistant enterococci were isolated in 2003. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing K. pneumoniae accounted for 20% of K. pneumoniae isolates since 2005. Carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa accounted for 34% of P. aeruginosa isolates. The nosocomial infection rate was not reduced after moving to a new hospital building in 2003. Urinary tract infection (30.2%) was the most common nosocomial infection, followed by bloodstream infection (26.5%) and lower respiratory tract infection (25.3%).

In a first experiment, we presented human observers with disparity-defined faces and non-faces, and observers were asked to judge the depth position of the target under signal-noise and clear (fine) task conditions. In the second experiment, we concurrently measured behavioural and fMRI responses to depth. We found that behavioural performance varied across stimulus conditions such that they were significantly worse for the upright face than the inverted face and the random shape in the SNR task, but worse for the random shape than the upright face in the feature task. Pattern analysis of fMRI responses revealed that activity of FFA was distinctly different during depth judgments of the upright face versus the other two stimuli, with its responses (and to a stronger extent, those of V3) appearing functionally-relevant to behavioural performance. We speculate that FFA is not only involved in object analysis, but exerts considerable influence on stereoscopic mechanisms as early as in V3 based on a broader appreciation of the stimulus' behavioural relevance.Significance StatementWe asked how disparity sensitivity is modulated by object (biological) relevance using behavioural and neuroimaging paradigms. We show that behavioural sensitivity to depth-position changes in biological (face) vs non-biological (random surface) contexts, and that these changes are task-dependent. Imaging results highlight a potentially key role of the fusiform region for governing the modulation of stereo encoding by object relevance. These findings highlight powerful interactions between object recognition mechanisms and stereoencoding, such that the utility of disparity information may be up/down weighed depending on the biological relevance of the object.","output":"Modulations of depth responses in the human brain by object context: Does biological relevance matter?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Delay differential equations are of great importance in science, engineering, medicine and biological models.

METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, a total of 40 healthy adults aged between 18 and 60 years old were selected to wear two kinds of common swimming goggles (ocular socket and orbital goggles). Intraocular pressure and anterior segment biometry were evaluated before wearing, at 2 and 5 min of wearing, and at 5 min after removing the goggles. Intraocular pressure (IOP), corneal front keratometry values (K1, K2, Km), central corneal thickness (CCT), central anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior chamber volume (ACV), and anterior chamber angle (ACA) were measured. RESULTS: The IOP at 2 min (21.0  2.2 mmHg) and 5 min (21.2  2.3 mmHg) was significantly higher than before wearing goggles (17.7  2.1 mmHg). The IOP after the goggles were removed and at 5 min after the goggles were removed was 18.4  2.3 mmHg and 17.7  2.1 mmHg, respectively. ACV, ACD, and ACA values all decreased while the googles were worn. After the goggles were removed, these changes gradually returned to baseline values, with no significant difference in the values before and after. CONCLUSION: This study proves that wearing orbital goggles can lead to an acute increase in IOP and a slight decrease in ACV, ACD, and ACA. However, once the goggles are removed, these indicators return to baseline levels, showing that wearing orbital goggles has no significant lasting effect on IOP and anterior segment parameters.

FLW are in need of self-care programs to support their mental health. METHODS: Quasi-experimental study to assess the impact of a simple mental well-being and emotional regulation training, the Community Resiliency Model (CRM), using a convenience sample of FLW. Baseline scores of mental well-being and stress measures were compared with follow-up scores at 3 time points. Outcomes were psychological wellness (World Health Organization-5 Well-being Index); resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10); traumatic stress (Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale); physical symptoms (Somatic Symptom Scale-8). RESULTS: Of the 104 participants who enrolled and attended the CRM training, 73 (70.2%) completed at least 1 posttest. Well-being scores increased at 1 year with a small-moderate effect size (Cohen d=0.32). Resilience scores increased with a small-moderate effect size by 1 year (Cohen d=0.36). Secondary traumatic stress scores declined, with the largest effect at 1 week (Cohen d=0.49). Somatic symptoms decreased at each posttest, with the largest change occurring from baseline to 1 week (d=0.39). Participants reported an awareness of body sensations helped them when overwhelmed as a means of calming themselves. CONCLUSIONS: After a 3-hour CRM training, participants reported improved mental well-being and decreased secondary traumatic stress and somatic symptoms.

The modified amino acid N-acetyl-leucine has been associated with positive symptomatic and neuroprotective, disease-modifying effects in observational case studies and animal and cellular models of NPC. Therefore, the effects of the active L-enantiomer, N-acetyl-L-leucine (NALL, Sponsor Code IB1001) were evaluated in pediatric and adult patients with NPC. Methods We conducted a 9-center, multinational, open-label, rater-blinded Phase 2 study to assess the safety and efficacy of NALL for the treatment of pediatric (6 years and older) and adult patients with NPC (IB1001-201 clinical trial). Eligible patients were assessed during three study phases: a baseline period (with or without a study run-in), a 6-week treatment period (dosage of NALL 4 g/d in patients aged 13 years and older; weight tiered doses for patients aged 6-12 years based on approximately 0.1 g/kg/day), and a 6-week post-treatment washout period. The primary outcome was based on the Clinical Impression of Change in Severity (CI-CS) assessment (assessed on a 7-point Likert scale) performed by blinded, centralized raters who compared videos of patients performing a pre-defined primary anchor test - either the 8-Meter Walk Test (8MWT) or 9-Hole Peg Test of the Dominant Hand (9HPT-D) - at different study periods. Secondary outcomes included the cerebellar function evaluations, namely the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), the Spinocerebellar Ataxia Functional Index (SCAFI), and the Clinical Global Impression Scales (CGI) as well as the EuroQol-5D/VAS. Results Thirty-three subjects aged 7 to 64 years with a confirmed diagnosis of NPC were enrolled according to the trial protocol between 04 September 2019 and 30 January 2020. Thirty-two patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. IB1001 met its CI-CS primary endpoint (mean difference 0.86 ((90% CI 0.25,1.75, p=0.029). IB1001 also met secondary endpoints, including improvement during treatment on the SARA scale (mean difference -1.19, 90% CI -1.8, -0.5, p=0.001), investigators CGI-C assessment (mean difference from baseline to the end of treatment 0.6, 90% CI 0.5, 1.0, p<0.001), clinically worsening over the washout period on the SARA (mean difference 1.45, 90% CI 0.5, 2.0, p=0.002) and investigators CGI-C assessment (washout mean difference -0.5, 90% CI -1.0, 0.0, p=0.006). IB1001 was well-tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse reactions occurring. Conclusions Consistent with its pharmacological action, IB1001 rapidly improved symptoms, functioning, and quality of life in 6-weeks, the clinical effect of which was lost after the 6-week, post-treatment washout period. High consistency and statistical significance between the primary and secondary endpoints demonstrate a clear, clinically meaningful improvement with IB1001.

The first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 and also the first death associated with the disease in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh (UP) was reported from Basti on March 31, 2020. The present study describes a cluster of 17 cases including one death of confirmed COVID-19 in Basti, UP, India. Methods: A 25 year old male from Basti, UP, India, who died of respiratory failure was diagnosed post-mortem as SARS-CoV-2 positive. Contact tracing carried out by the district administration found 16 cases positive among tested contacts. A detailed retrospective investigation in the form of one-to-one interview was carried out with 16 recovered individuals to understand the transmission dynamics and clinical characteristics. Results: The findings showed that the cluster transmission occurred at three levels: first was direct contact with the index case which resulted in two secondary cases. Second, at a household level where four of the seven susceptible contacts got infected, and the third was an event (funeral) where 50 individuals participated and this resulted in seven SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals in whom infection could be directly linked to a funeral gathering. The index case had associated comorbidities and succumbed to death. Most of the cases were asymptomatic except two individuals, who developed mild symptoms. The mean duration of quarantine facility was 21.67.3 days, and the average time taken for the first negative test after testing positive to COVID-19 was 124.1 days. Interpretation & conclusions: The funeral acted as a super-spreader event for the transmission of infection among family members, relatives and others. Active contact tracing and confirmation of infection among the contacts led to the isolation of 16 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and hence the limited spread of the disease. Asymptomatic carriers and super-spreader events are among the major challenges in the control and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Early testing, quarantine and social distancing may play key role in breaking the chain of transmission.","output":"A preliminary study on contact tracing & transmission chain in a cluster of 17 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in Basti, Uttar Pradesh, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To assess the C Reactive protein level as early predictor of Covid -19 Patients Methodology: COVID-19 patients were admitted in LG Hospital Lahore.

However, insufficient support to build, manage and optimize human resources for health (HRH) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) results in inadequate health workforce performance, perpetuating health inequities and low-quality health services. METHODS: The USAID-funded Human Resources for Health in 2030 Program (HRH2030) conducted a systematic review of studies documenting supervision enhancements and approaches that improved health worker performance to highlight components associated with these interventions effectiveness. Structured by a conceptual framework to classify the inputs, processes, and results, the review assessed 57 supervision studies since 2010 in approximately 29 LMICs. RESULTS: Of the successful supervision approaches described in the 57 studies reviewed, 44 were externally funded pilots, which is a limitation. Thirty focused on community health worker (CHW) programs. Health worker supervision was informed by health system data for 38 approaches (67%) and 22 approaches used continuous quality improvement (QI) (39%). Many successful approaches integrated digital supervision technologies (e.g., SmartPhones, mHealth applications) to support existing data systems and complement other health system activities. Few studies were adapted, scaled, or sustained, limiting reports of cost-effectiveness or impact. CONCLUSION: Building on results from the review, to increase health worker supervision effectiveness we recommend to: integrate evidence-based, QI tools and processes; integrate digital supervision data into supervision processes; increase use of health system information and performance data when planning supervision visits to prioritize lowest-performing areas; scale and replicate successful models across service delivery areas and geographies; expand and institutionalize supervision to reach, prepare, protect, and support frontline health workers, especially during health emergencies; transition and sustain supervision efforts with domestic human and financial resources, including communities, for holistic workforce support. In conclusion, effective health worker supervision is informed by health system data, uses continuous quality improvement (QI), and employs digital technologies integrated into other health system activities and existing data systems to enable a whole system approach. Effective supervision enhancements and innovations should be better integrated, scaled, and sustained within existing systems to improve access to quality health care.

This study further explores the benefits of AatmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyan for the betterment of the livelihood of the COVID-19Chit handloom weavers and allied workers. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 400 handloom weavers and allied workers from ten cities of Uttar Pradesh were contacted through telephone. Descriptive statistics were applied to measure the awareness about the government welfare schemes and the benefits of these schemes. Furthermore, satisfaction and opinion of the handloom weavers and allied workers regarding the benefits and sufficiency of the funds received under these schemes have also been measured. Findings: Based on the results, the least awareness has been noted about government welfare schemes. However, a small number of weavers and allied workers were found beneficiaries of the schemes. Additionally, the majority of the respondents were found dissatisfied with the benefits. The COVID-19 pandemic is an addendum to the plight of handloom weavers and allied workers. The measures of AatmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyan could be used to aid weavers and allied workers to restore their lost revenue. Research limitations/implications: This study has limitations. Firstly, the research is limited to the handloom industry of Uttar Pradesh. Future researchers could consider the handloom sector of other states like Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, known for hand-woven clothes. Secondly, this study aims to analyse the role of AatmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyan in improving the living conditions of handloom weavers and allied workers and not to measure the impact of the Abhiyan on handloom weavers or the handloom sector. Researchers could measure the impact in future studies. Thirdly, the authors have not applied any behavioural theory or marketing models such as the Theory of Reasoned Action or the Blackwell model, which may be applied to study the attitude of handloom weavers towards welfare schemes. This may prove to be a potential direction for future research. Additionally, master weavers and handloom cooperatives societies were excluded while collecting the data. Future researchers could consider them to examine the role of the governments welfare schemes for uplifting the socio-economic condition of the handloom weavers, allied workers, master weavers and the business of cooperative societies. Finally, due to lockdown and travel ban, the authors were forced to limit their survey to telephone only because of which they could not get the qualitative information in full. Researchers for future studies could visit the handloom concentrated areas personally or take the help of an enumerator for data collection. Practical implications: The research holds significance for the young and competent designers, handloom weavers and allied workers. Designers could work with and hire handloom weavers of Uttar Pradesh. If designers and weavers work together, it will help them restore their business and generate revenue that they have lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, policymakers can collaborate with designers, which will help enhance the socio-economic condition of handloom weavers and allied workers, which has deteriorated due to the COVID-19 crisis.

RESULTS Six general practitioners and eight practice nurses were recruited from diverse locations across Australia. Participants generally reported having the capability, opportunity and motivation to effectively deliver influenza vaccination to high-risk adults. Perceived barriers included time pressures, complexity of patient consultations, difficulty reaching high-risk younger adults, issues related to optimal timing of influenza vaccination, inconsistent vaccine supply and pharmacist involvement in vaccination.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional observational study. An online questionnaire was digitally addressed to 725 outpatients in Brazil who reported partial or total sudden loss of the sense of smell from March to April 2020. RESULTS: Total or partial sudden loss of the sense of smell showed high positive predictive value for COVID-19 diagnosis, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil (88.8%). There were no differences between groups tested positive and negative in regard to demographic and clinical characteristics such as presence of allergy, rhinitis, neither to olfactory recovery time.

Considering the limited access to diagnostic investigations in primary care practice, chest X-ray remains the imaging modality of choice. The current study assessed the competency of family medicine residents in the interpretation of chest X-rays for emergency conditions and to compare it with that of diagnostic radiology residents, general practitioners, and medical interns. METHODS: An online survey was distributed to 600 physicians, including family medicine residents, medical interns, general practitioners, and diagnostic radiology residents. The study included some background information such as gender, years in practice, training type, interest in pulmonary medicine and diagnostic radiology, and having adequate training on the interpretation of chest X-rays. The survey had 10 chest X-ray cases with brief clinical information. Participants were asked to choose the most likely diagnosis and to rate their degree of confidence in the interpretation of the chest X-ray for each case. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 205 physicians (response rate = 34.2%). The overall diagnostic accuracy was 63.1% with a significant difference between family medicine and radiology residents (58.0% vs. 90.5%; P < 0.001). The COVID-19 pneumonia (85.4%) and pneumoperitoneum (80.5%) cases had the highest diagnostic accuracy scores. There was a significant correlation between the diagnostic confidence and accuracy (rs = 0.39; P < 0.001).

However, the inference of outbreak transmission histories remains challenging due to various factors such as within-host pathogen diversity and multi-strain infections.

These genetic differences can be infrequent or laborious to characterize; however, many of them leave distinctive marks on the SNPs across the genome allowing their study in large population samples. Consequently, several methods have been developed over the last decade to detect and analyze different genomic structures using SNP arrays, to complement genome-wide association studies and determine the contribution of these structures to explain the phenotypic differences between individuals. We present an up-to-date collection of available bioinformatics tools that can be used to extract relevant genomic information from SNP array data including population structure and ancestry; polygenic risk scores; identity-by-descent fragments; linkage disequilibrium; heritability and structural variants such as inversions, copy number variants, genetic mosaicisms and recombination histories.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a validated questionnaire disseminated to oncologists by SurveyMonkey. The tool had 42 questions that captured participants' knowledge, attitude, and practice; their experiences; and the pandemic's impact on various aspects of their lives. Participants from Middle East and North African countries, Brazil, and the Philippines completed the electronic survey between April 24 and May 15, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 1,010 physicians who participated in the study, 54.75% were male and 64.95% were medical or clinical oncologists. The level of knowledge regarding the prevention and transmission of the virus was good in 52% of participants. The majority (92%) were worried about contracting the virus either extremely (30%) or mildly (62%), and 84.85% were worried about transmitting the virus to their families. Approximately 76.93% reported they would take the COVID 19 vaccine once available, with oncologists practicing in Brazil having the highest odds ratio of intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (odds ratio, 11.8, 95% CI, 5.96 to 23.38, P < .001).

The use of an inverted syringe to evert the nipples was successful in achieving high rates of infant latching and exclusive breastfeeding in case series but has not been tested in clinical trials. This open label, parallel group, randomized clinical trial investigated whether the use of the inverted syringe technique in women with inverted nipples would increase exclusive breastfeeding rate at one month, as compared to standard care. METHODS/DESIGN: Between June 2018 and January 2020, healthy pregnant women (N=54) with grades 1 or 2 inverted nipples were randomly allocated to standard care or to an experimental group that used the inverted syringe technique to evert the inverted nipple prior to every breastfeeding. The primary outcome measure was the rate of exclusive breastfeeding at one month. Secondary outcomes included the rates of exclusive breastfeeding at three and six months, any breastfeeding at one, three, and six months, nipple eversion, successful infant latching, breastfeeding-associated complications, maternal satisfaction with breastfeeding, maternal quality of life, and adverse events. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were conducted according to the intention to treat principle. RESULTS: Participants in the experimental group were less likely to be exclusively breastfeeding at one (RR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.95; n = 47), and at three months (RR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.91; n = 45), or to practice any breastfeeding at six months (RR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.87; n = 44). Only 14.3% of women in the experimental group complied with the use of the inverted syringe during the first month.

Virus-infected MA-104 cell cultures were studied in the presence of Act D at concentrations of 1.25 and 2.5 microg/ml.

Viral RNA labeled with 3H-uridine in the presence of the drug was separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Viral RNA replication was not affected by Act D, but increased 3H-uridine uptake was demonstrable by infected cells in the presence of the drug. This possibly was due to the inhibition of cellular RNA synthesis by Act D, which thus enhances incorporation of the radionuclide into the viral RNA. Act D reduced the number of infected cells presenting virus-specific fluorescence 48 h post-infection by more than 50%.

Today we understand much about the metabolism of drugs and many aspects of safety assessment in the context of a relatively small number of human P450s.

Unlike other regions, the median onset-to-door time increased significantly in the D-G region (361 min vs. 526.5 min, p = 0.016), and longer onset-to-door times were common for patients with mild symptoms and who were in their 60s or 70s. The number of patients who underwent intravenous thrombolysis also decreased during the COVID-19 period, although the treatment times were not significantly different between the 2 periods.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the role of grip strength measurement at admission for predicting disease severity in COVID-19. METHODS: Demographic data, smoking status, comorbidities, COVID-19 related symptoms, grip strength, laboratory and computed tomography (CT) findings at admission were all noted. Using a Smedley hand dynamometer, the maximum grip strength value (kg) after three measurements on the dominant side was recorded. Low grip strength was defined as two standard deviations below the mean value of the healthy young adults (<32 kg for males, <19 kg for females). Patients were categorized into three groups according to clinical and CT findings. Severe illness group had pneumonia with a respiratory rate >30/min, oxygen saturation 90%, or extensive lung involvement in CT. Moderate illness group had pneumonia with CT score 11. Mild illness group had normal CT findings. RESULTS: The study population included 312 patients (140 F, 172 M). The distribution of mild, moderate and severe disease groups were 36.9%, 51.0% and 12.2%, respectively. Cough, fever, dyspnea, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were most frequent, and C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, and neutrophil levels were highest in the severe group (all p<.05). Absolute grip strength values were lowest and the frequency of having low grip strength were highest in the severe group (both p<.01). Since we found that the significant differences were stemming from the severe group, we combined the mild and moderate group as non-severe, and compared severe vs. non-severe groups with binary logistic regression analyses. When age, gender, body mass index, smoking status, presence of comorbidities and low grip strength, and abnormal laboratory findings were taken into analyses; age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.054 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.020-1.089]), obesity (OR: 2.822 [95% CI: 1.143-6.966]), COPD (OR: 5.699 [95 %CI: 1.231-26.383]), CRP level (OR: 1.023 [95% CI: 1.010-1.036]) and low grip strength (OR: 3.047 [95% CI: 1.146-8.103]) were observed to be independent predictors for severe COVID-19 disease (all p<.05).

The anti-retroviral therapy failure rate and the risk of HIV vertical transmission to infants from women with failed treatment during pregnancy also largely remains unevaluated. METHODS: This is a prospective, observational and follow-up study of 18 months to determine the association of ART failure in pregnant women and the subsequent risk of HIV transmission to their infants. A total of 81 mothers were evaluated for ART success/failure by analysing their viral loads. RESULTS: Analyses revealed that a high percentage (19.75%) of women on ART had high viral loads, while the overall HIV transmission rate to the infants was 8.64%. The rate of transmission from women with high viral load was significantly high compared to women with low viral load (37.5% vs. 1.54%; p = 0.0015). CD4 level was not associated with HIV transmission. However, CD4 levels in women, who had successful or failed ART, were significantly different (p = 0.0031). Factors such as mother's age, baby's sex and weight as well as delivery mode were not associated with HIV transmission, however, breastfeeding and viral loads were found to be independently associated with HIV transmission to the neonates. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that a significant proportion of women on ART had impaired viral load control. The rate of HIV transmission to infants was also significantly high among these women.

Many research laboratories are conducting clinical trials with different drugs, among which some became quite interestingly effective against this pandemic. Our aim is to investigate the potentiality of the pre-existing drugs and get a clear understanding of their effects on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the SARS-CoV-2. Methods: : Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) alogwith molecular phylogeny analysis were performed using homologous sequences to identify the mutations within RdRp and evolutionary relationship. Based on the published literatures, we have chosen eight drug molecules like Ribavirin, Tenofovir, Sofosbuvir, IDX-184, YAK, Setrobuvir, Remdesivir and Galidesivir. Series of molecular docking studies between template RNA and RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 has been performed in absence or presence of those drugs and cofactors nsp7 and nsp8. Results: : From MSA 13 exclusive mutations identified within RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 and phylogeny reveals its close relation with Bat coronavirus RaTG13. The interaction affinities and interacting residues as obtained from systematic molecular docking study led to a conclusion that the chosen drugs can prove to be effective against this pandemic partially. Conclusion: Therefore, designing of inhibitors which will specifically act against nsp12 and lower the binding affinity of nsp12 towards RNA template is necessary. In this article we additionally focus on the nsp7-8 hexadecameric complex and had suggested a list of amino acid residues of nsp12 and nsp7-8 complex to develop far-reaching effective drugs.","output":"In silico analysis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the SARS-CoV-2 and potentiality of the pre-existing drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) is highest in young adulthood, an effect that has been magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, individuals with MDD are at a greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Accumulating evidence supports immune system dysregulation as a major contributor to the elevated CVD risk in older adults with MDD; however, whether this is present in young adults with MDD without comorbid disease remains unclear. Interestingly, recent data suggest augmented T-cell mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (T-cell mitoROS) as a potent driver of immune dysregulation in animal models of psychiatric disease. With this background in mind, we tested the hypothesis that young adults with MDD would have augmented T-cell mitoROS and circulating proinflammatory cytokines compared with healthy young adults without MDD (HA). Whole blood was drawn from 14 young adults with MDD (age: 23  2 yr) and 11 HA (age: 22  1 yr). T-cell mitoROS (MitoSOX red; total: CD3+, T-helper: CD4+, T cytotoxic: CD8+) and serum cytokines were assessed by flow cytometry. Total T-cell mitoROS was significantly greater in adults with MDD compared with HA [median: 14,089 arbitrary units (AU); median: 1,362 AU, P = 0.01]. Likewise, both T-helper and T-cytotoxic cell mitoROS were significantly greater in adults with MDD compared with HA (both: P < 0.05). There were no differences in circulating cytokines between groups (all cytokines: P > 0.05). Collectively, these findings suggest that elevated T-cell mitoROS may represent an early marker of immune system dysregulation in young, otherwise healthy, adults with MDD.NEW & NOTEWORTHY To our knowledge, we provide the first evidence of augmented T-cell mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (T-cell mitoROS) in young, otherwise healthy adults with MDD.

Methods A literature search was performed using PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane databases between 1975 and December 16, 2019. Search terms included \\"posterior cruciate ligament,\\" \\"peel-off injury,\\" \\"avulsion,\\" \\"PCL,\\" \\"pediatric,\\" \\"skeletally immature,\\" and \\"adolescent.\\" Included were studies on pediatric patients with PCL injuries managed operatively. Exclusion criteria included case reports, studies not reporting clinical results, reviews, abstract or conference papers, or papers not in the English language. Quality assessment was performed on all included studies using the MINORS (Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies) criteria. Results Four articles comprising 43 knees in 42 patients met the criteria and were included. Motor vehicle accidents were the most common mechanism of injury (39.5%; n = 17/43), followed by sports-related injuries (35%; n = 15/43). All studies commented on tear pattern, with the following distribution: 42% (n = 18/43) midsubstance tears, 37% (n = 16/43) tibial avulsions, and 21% (n = 9/43) femoral avulsions. Overall, good patient-reported outcomes (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and Pediatric International Knee Documentation Committee, Tegner, and Lysholm scores) and return to activity, as well as satisfactory posterior stability (KT-1000 arthrometer, posterior drawer test, and kneeling radiographs) and range of motion, were reported. There was no significant leg-length discrepancy or angular deformity reported. Arthrofibrosis was reported in 7% of postoperative knees and was the most commonly reported complication. Osteoarthritis was reported in 21% (n = 9/43) of knees. The average MINORS score was 7 (range, 6-8) for noncomparative studies and 10 for comparative studies. Conclusion Good patient-reported outcomes and return to activity can be obtained using repair or reconstruction.

All relevant data were reviewed, and the clinical characteristics of RSV-related infection were compared to those of others. RESULTS Of 224 patients, 160 (71 %) were positive for at least one potentially causative agent. Of them, 65 % had RSV, and 15 % had more than on ecausative agent (co-infection). The RSV group had more the findings of respiratory distress (p< 0.01), abnormal chest radiography (p< 0.01), need for intensive care (p< 0.01), and duration of oxygen requirement (p< 0.01) but less fever on admission and duration of antibiotic use (for both, p< 0.01), and no longer hospital stay. Need of intensive care nursery was more common in patients with co-infection than others (25 % vs. 6.5 %, p< 0.01).

In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of PRRSV-2 and swine influenza H3N2 virus co-infection on the efficacy of PRRSV modified live virus (MLV) vaccination, which is widely used in the field. Following simultaneous challenge with contemporary PRRSV-2 and H3N2 field isolates, we found that the protective effect of PRRS MLV vaccination on clinical disease and pathology was abrogated, although viral load was unaffected and antibody responses were enhanced. In contrast, co-infection in non-immunized animals reduced PRRSV-2 viremia and H3N2 virus load in the upper respiratory tract and potentiated T cell responses against both PRRSV-2 and H3N2 in the lung. Further analysis suggested that an upregulation of inhibitory cytokines gene expression in the lungs of vaccinated pigs may have influenced responses to H3N2 and PRRSV-2. These findings provide important insights into the effect of viral co-infections on PRRS vaccine efficacy that may help identify more effective vaccination strategies against PRDC in the field.","output":"Simultaneous Infection With Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome and Influenza Viruses Abrogates Clinical Protection Induced by Live Attenuated Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic poses a significant challenge to healthcare professionals and health systems around the world, most notably the disruption of its service delivery.

To narrow down the nature of this inhibition, the isolated C-terminal domain of Hsp90 was also tested. These results were used to build a model of the mechanism of inhibition, in which ORF9b efficiently targets two sites of interaction between TOM70 and Hsp90.

The success of CDCL solvers is owed to the design of clever heuristics that enable the tight coupling of different components. One of the core components is phase selection, wherein the solver, during branching, decides the polarity of the branch to be explored for a given variable. Most of the state-of-the-art CDCL SAT solvers employ phase-saving as a phase selection heuristic, which was proposed to address the potential inefficiencies arising from far-backtracking. In light of the emergence of chronological backtracking in CDCL solvers, we re-examine the efficiency of phase saving. Our empirical evaluation leads to a surprising conclusion: The usage of saved phase and random selection of polarity for decisions following a chronological backtracking leads to an indistinguishable runtime performance in terms of instances solved and PAR-2 score. We introduce Decaying Polarity Score (DPS) to capture the trend of the polarities attained by the variable, and upon observing lack of performance improvement due to DPS, we turn to a more sophisticated heuristic seeking to capture the activity of literals and the trend of polarities: Literal State Independent Decaying Sum (LSIDS).

The results indicate that a low 25(OH)D concentration is a contributing factor to COVID-19 severity, which, combined with previous studies, provides a convincing set of evidence.","output":"Autumn COVID-19 surge dates in Europe correlated to latitudes, not to temperature-humidity, pointing to vitamin D as contributing factor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: A significant proportion of COVID-19 transmission occurs silently during the presymptomatic and asymptomatic stages of infection. Children, although important drivers of silent transmission, are not included in the current COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the benefits of identifying silent infections among children as a proxy for their vaccination. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study used an age-structured disease transmission model, parameterized with census data and estimates from published literature, to simulate the estimated synergistic effect of interventions in reducing attack rates during the course of 1 year among a synthetic population representative of the US demographic composition. The population included 6 age groups of 0 to 4, 5 to 10, 11 to 18, 19 to 49, 50 to 64, and 65 years or older based on US census data. Data were analyzed from December 12, 2020, to February 26, 2021. EXPOSURES: In addition to the isolation of symptomatic cases within 24 hours of symptom onset, vaccination of adults was implemented to reach a 40% to 60% coverage during 1 year with an efficacy of 95% against symptomatic and severe COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The combinations of proportion and speed for detecting silent infections among children that would suppress future attack rates to less than 5%. RESULTS: In the base-case scenarios with an effective reproduction number R(e) = 1.2, a targeted approach that identifies 11% of silent infections among children within 2 days and 14% within 3 days after infection would bring attack rates to less than 5% with 40% vaccination coverage of adults. If silent infections among children remained undetected, achieving the same attack rates would require an unrealistically high vaccination coverage (81%) of this age group, in addition to 40% vaccination coverage of adults. The estimated effect of identifying silent infections was robust in sensitivity analyses with respect to vaccine efficacy against infection and reduced susceptibility of children to infection. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this simulation modeling study of a synthetic US population, in the absence of vaccine availability for children, a targeted approach to rapidly identify silent COVID-19 infections in this age group was estimated to significantly mitigate disease burden. These findings suggest that without measures to interrupt transmission chains from silent infections, vaccination of adults is unlikely to contain the outbreaks in the near term.","output":"Simulated Identification of Silent COVID-19 Infections Among Children and Estimated Future Infection Rates With Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recent data demonstrate potentially protective pre-existing T cells reactive against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in samples of healthy blood donors, collected before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Whether pre-existing immunity is also detectable in immunosuppressed patients is currently not known. METHODS: Fifty-seven patients were included in this caseCcontrol study. We compared the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in the samples of 20 renal transplant (RTx) patients to 20 age/gender matched non-immunosuppressed/immune competent healthy individuals collected before the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Seventeen coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients were used as positive controls. T cell reactivity against Spike-, Nucleocapsid-, and Membrane- SARS-CoV-2 proteins were analyzed by multi-parameter flow cytometry. Antibodies were analyzed by neutralization assay. RESULTS: Pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells were detected in the majority of unexposed patients and healthy individuals. In RTx patients, 13/20 showed CD4(+) T cells reactive against at least one SARS-CoV-2 protein. CD8(+) T cells reactive against at least one SARS-CoV-2 protein were demonstrated in 12/20 of RTx patients. The frequency and Th1 cytokine expression pattern of pre-formed SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells did not differ between RTx and non-immunosuppressed healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the magnitude and functionality of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cell in transplant patients is non-inferior compared to the immune competent cohort. Although several pro-inflammatory cytokines were produced by the detected T cells, further studies are required to prove their antiviral protection.

OAS1 polymorphisms have been associated with increased susceptibility to various diseases. We investigated the association of polymorphisms in OAS1 with tuberculosis (TB). METHODS: A total of 1215 TB cases and 1114 healthy controls were enrolled from two independent studies. Genotyping was conducted using the improved multiplex ligase detection reaction (iMLDR) method. Associations between OAS1 polymorphisms (rs2240190, rs1131454, 10,774,671 and 11,066,453) and TB risk were established based on distributions of allelic frequencies using different genetic models. RESULTS: Significant association was observed between rs10774671, rs1131454 and TB. In the initial study, the G allele of rs10774671 was a significantly protective factor against TB (P = 0.006) and the genotype of GG differed significantly between TB patients and controls under the codominant model (P = 0.008) after Bonferroni correction. In the validation study, we also observed that the rs10774671 G allele (P = 0.001) and GG genotype (P = 0.001) were associated with TB. In addition, we found that the rs1131454 G allele (P = 0.004) and GG genotype (P = 0.001) were protective against TB in the Chinese Han population.

To identify the molecular mechanism by which PV replication is limited, PV RNA synthesis was analysed by estimating the relative level of genomic (plus-strand) and complementary (minus-strand) PV RNA in the CNS of persistently infected mice. PV RNA replication decreased during the 6 months following onset of paralysis, due mainly to inhibition of plus-strand RNA synthesis. Thus, restriction of PV RNA synthesis may contribute to persistence by limiting virus replication in the mouse CNS. Interestingly, viral RNA replication was similarly inhibited in neuroblastoma IMR-32 cell cultures persistently infected with PV.

ITE engagement in the pre-CLP involved using project-based learning (PBL) with technology and continuous, practise-based professional development for teachers focusing on integrating constructivist use of technology in their curriculum and pedagogy. A survey and interviews of teachers revealed that teachers with higher ITE engagement in the pre-CLP were more likely to use PBL with technology during the CLP. Students' interviews indicated that this PBL involved deep research and technical skills that were also practised during the CLP using distance technologies. Thus, the study demonstrated adaptation of ITE innovation into a distance mode; the introduction of WebQuests during the CLP improved the likelihood of teachers engaging in project-based teaching and PBL during the CLP. Policymakers, practitioners and researchers are recommended to adopt and continue to study the sustainability of ITE approach in new contexts such as the CLP.","output":"Constructivist teaching and learning with technologies in the COVID-19 lockdown in Eastern India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: COVID-19 has had a significant impact on otolaryngology surgery. There are new requirements to prepare patients for theatre however the impact on theatre productivity is unknown. This study aims to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on elective theatre productivity. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective evaluation of elective otolaryngology theatre lists. Ten consecutive theatre lists beginning on the final week of November 2019 and November 2020 were analysed. Dedicated emergency operation lists were excluded. RESULTS: There were fewer operating lists per working day in 2020 (0.9) compared to 2019 (2.0) and a higher percentage of operations cancelled (2020: 15.4%, 2019: 8.6%). Theatre lists finished significantly earlier in 2020 than in 2019 (2020 median: 97.5 minutes, 2019 median: 15.5 minutes; p = 0.00018). The percentage of theatre lists finishing over 60 minutes early was substantially greater than the national average of 23% (2020: 75%, 2019: 30%). The median pre-list delay was higher in 2020 than 2019 (2019: 20.5 minutes, 2020: 31.5 minutes; p = 0.14) whilst the median total delay was higher in 2019 compared to 2020 (2019: 20.5 minutes, 2020: 18 minutes; p = 0.21). Both results were not statistically significant. The commonest reason for delay in 2020 were COVID-19 related reasons such as awaiting test results, in 2019 the commonest reason was patient not being ready for theatre such as consent not completed. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has had a significant impact on theatre productivity and is currently the commonest cause of theatre list delay. The early theatre finishing time suggest that improvements can be made to improve theatre productivity.","output":"454 Impact Of COVID-19 Pandemic on Elective Theatre Productivity in Otolaryngology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The adaptive immune system was sculpted to protect individuals, societies, and species since its inception, developing effective strategies to cope with emerging pathogens.

Focusing on the UK, this paper asks how that can be achieved for medical AI research, that is, for research involving the training of AI on data from medical research databases. Public governance of medical AI research in the UK is generally achieved in three ways, namely, via lay representation on data access committees, through patient and public involvement groups, and by means of various deliberative democratic projects such as citizens juries, citizen panels, citizen assemblies, etc.what we collectively call citizen forums. As we will show, each of these public involvement initiatives have complementary strengths and weaknesses for providing oversight of medical AI research. As they are currently utilized, however, they are unable to realize the full potential of their complementarity due to insufficient information transfer across them. In order to synergistically build on their contributions, we offer here a multi-scale model integrating all three. In doing so we provide a unified public governance model for medical AI research, one that, we argue, could improve the trustworthiness of big data and AI related medical research in the future.","output":"Public governance of medical artificial intelligence research in the UK: an integrated multi-scale model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute ischaemic stroke is a major public health priority and will become increasingly relevant to neurologists of the future.

The aim of treatment is to achieve recanalisation and reperfusion of the ischaemic penumbra with intravenous thrombolysis and/or endovascular thrombectomy in appropriately selected patients. All patients should be admitted directly to an acute stroke unit for close monitoring for early neurological deterioration and prevention of secondary complications.

The most serious impacts of climate change are anticipated in grazing systems because of their dependence on climatic conditions and the natural resource base, and their limited adaptation opportunities. Impacts are expected to be most severe in arid and semi-arid grazing systems at low latitudes, where higher temperatures and lower rainfall are expected to reduce yields on range lands and increase land degradation. The dual pathways of responses between climate change and livestock production activities were depicted in this review. It is of note that climate change as a natural phenomenon works on the principle of causes and effect. The actions and in-actions of man will dictate the type of results obtainable in his immediate environment. Means by which livestock farmers can mitigate the GHGs and adapt to the effect of climate changes were discussed in this paper. Concerted efforts at ameliorating the effect of climate change on livestock production are needed. The smart options for rearing livestock are capable of mitigating the attendant effect of production activities of the stocks, reducing the stress obtainable from altered environment and ensuring food security. Nigeria as a country will need to evolve policies that will ensure promotion and subsequent adoptions of technologies that are smart in terms of increasing productivity of farm animals, reducing emissions of GHG and positively altering the effect of climate change.","output":"Climate-smart livestock production: options for Nigerian farmers.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of combined interferon beta-1b, lopinavirCritonavir, and ribavirin for treating patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a multicentre, prospective, open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial in adults with COVID-19 who were admitted to six hospitals in Hong Kong. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to a 14-day combination of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h, ribavirin 400 mg every 12 h, and three doses of 8 million international units of interferon beta-1b on alternate days (combination group) or to 14 days of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h (control group). The primary endpoint was the time to providing a nasopharyngeal swab negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RT-PCR, and was done in the intention-to-treat population. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04276688. FINDINGS: Between Feb 10 and March 20, 2020, 127 patients were recruited; 86 were randomly assigned to the combination group and 41 were assigned to the control group. The median number of days from symptom onset to start of study treatment was 5 days (IQR 3C7). The combination group had a significantly shorter median time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab (7 days [IQR 5C11]) than the control group (12 days [8C15]; hazard ratio 437 [95% CI 186C1024], p=00010). Adverse events included self-limited nausea and diarrhoea with no difference between the two groups. One patient in the control group discontinued lopinavirCritonavir because of biochemical hepatitis. No patients died during the study. INTERPRETATION: Early triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavirCritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Future clinical study of a double antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b as a backbone is warranted.

Among asymptomatic persons, the percent positive rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) tests in the region did not appear to justify this practice. Instead of universal preoperative COVID-19 testing, the authors elected to mitigate risk by implementing a preoperative program including 14 days of recommended patient self-quarantine and social distancing.

The ANOVA and post hoc ANOVA results revealed significant disparities in terms of IQ, RESOGV, and RES among countries with different levels of economic development, regions, and sector (mining or petroleum). Moreover, the fixed effects (FE) and ordinary least square (OLS) results confirmed that IQ marginally influenced RES.

We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia in critically ill patients. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of peer-reviewed publications in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library up to 15th August 2020. Preprints and reports were also included if they met the inclusion criteria. Study eligibility criteria were full-text prospective, retrospective or registry-based publications describing outcomes in patients admitted to the ICU for COVID-19, using a validated test. Participants were critically ill patients admitted in the ICU with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: From 32 articles included, a total of 69 093 patients were admitted to the ICU and were evaluated. Most patients included in the studies were male (76 165/128 168, 59%, 26 studies) and the mean patient age was 56 (95%CI 48.5-59.8) years. Studies described high ICU mortality (21 145/65 383, 32.3%, 15 studies). The median length of ICU stay was 9.0 (95%CI 6.5-11.2) days, described in five studies. More than half the patients admitted to the ICU required mechanical ventilation (31 213/53 465, 58%, 23 studies) and among them mortality was very high (27 972/47 632, 59%, six studies). The duration of mechanical ventilation was 8.4 (95%CI 1.6-13.7) days.

Meanwhile, Latino vaccination rates remain lower than those of non-Hispanic Whites. COVID-19 vaccine nonintent, defined as intent not to vaccinate for COVID-19, among Latino individuals continues to be an issue in the state of California. Methods: Families from three Latino longitudinal mother child cohorts previously recruited in the San Francisco Bay Area were surveyed telephonically from February to July 2021 to assess attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination and prior vaccination, in general, for themselves and their children. Risk for vaccine nonintent was assessed using Mann-Whitney rank sum non-parametric test for continuous predictors and chi-squared tests for categorical ones. Results: Three hundred and eighteen families were surveyed from the Telomere at Birth (TAB), Hispanic Eating and Nutrition (HEN) and Latino Eating and Diabetes Cohort (LEAD). Approximately 36% from TAB and 28% from HEN/LEAD indicated COVID-19 vaccine nonintent for themselves and/or their children. Risk factors for vaccine nonintent included lower maternal age (p=0.01), concern about vaccine side effects (p<0.01) and prior history of a household members being infected with COVID-19 (p<0.01) and indexes of household crowding including number of people sharing a bathroom (p=0.048). Vaccine intent was also associated with receiving vaccine input from friends (p=0.03), family (p<0.01) and/or coworkers (p=0.02) compared with those who were not planning on getting COVID-19 vaccination. It is possible that those with non-intent have received limited input from families, friends and/or coworkers. Discussion: Latino families living in crowded living situations who may not have received any COVID-19 advice family, coworkers or friends are at particular risk for COVID-19 vaccine nonintent.

However, excessive involvement in watching TV series has recently become a subject of scholarly concern as it may represent an emerging form of addictive behavior with the features of what has been labeled as \\"binge-watching\\" (i.e., watching multiple episodes of TV series in a single session). The current study aimed to assess TV series watching behaviors and related motivations, as well as their relationships with depression, stress and anxiety, in a sample of Italian adults during the COVID-19 lockdown. Specifically, we aimed to explore which patterns of motivations and emotional states influenced either a high but healthy engagement in watching TV series, or promoted problematic and uncontrolled watching behavior under such circumstances. A total of 715 adults (M = 31.70, SD = 10.81;71.5% female) from all over Italy were recruited (from 1st to 30th April 2020) through advertisements via social media platforms of Italian university communities and other online groups. Two multiple hierarchical regression analyses were performed with non-problematic and problematic TV series watching set as dependent variables. Results showed that people spent more time watching TV series during the pandemic lockdown, especially women who also reported higher levels of anxiety and stress than men.

Finally, our findings also suggest that enrichment motives may protect from uncontrolled and potentially addictive watching behaviors.

The study does identify limitations and flaws associated with designing policies based on a work-as-imagined philosophy and demonstrates how the use of maturity modelling can explore how exploitation, corruption and organised crime is framed and can become more formalised over time.","output":"Forgotten children: a socio-technical systems analysis of the 2004 and 2015 forced child labour reports from Indian cottonseed farms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has radically changed the world, and promising vaccine trials are currently underway. The immune responses in asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are still under investigation, and data are evolving. While it is known that humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 are elicited, it is uncertain whether these responses protect against reinfection or that they provide definitive evidence of viral clearance. Very few cases have been reported in the literature regarding reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. CASE REPORT We present a case of a middle-aged man with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection who later developed mild symptomatic COVID-19 after a period of 3 months. The source of reinfection was likely from the community, which had a soaring burden of infection with the highest number of COVID-19 cases per million in the world at that time. The patient had 2 negative COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests 2 weeks after the initial infection. During the second infection, a nasopharyngeal reverse-transcription PCR test and tests for the presence of COVID-19 immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG antibodies were all positive. CONCLUSIONS Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is a strong possibility. This case raises concerns that asymptomatic infections may not provide long-term protective immunity to all patients, which could make them susceptible to reinfection. Possible explanations for reinfection include an interval decrease in protective antibodies titers after SARS-CoV-2 infection that may be more prevalent in patients who had an asymptomatic infection. Other possibilities include viral reactivation after a prolonged carriage of the virus or delayed immune response.","output":"A Patient with Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection Who Presented 86 Days Later with COVID-19 Pneumonia Possibly Due to Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS?) is a potentially less invasive approach than standard laparoscopy (LAP). However, SILS? may not allow the same level of manual dexterity and technical performance compared to LAP. We compared the performance of standardized tasks from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) program using either the LAP or the SILS? technique. METHODS Medical students, surgical residents, and attending physicians were recruited and divided into inexperienced (IE), laparoscopy-experienced (LE), and SILS?-experienced (SE) groups. Each subject performed standardized tasks from FLS, including peg transfer, pattern cutting, placement of ligating loop, and intracorporeal suturing using a standard three-port FLS box-trainer with standard laparoscopic instruments. For SILS?, the subjects used an FLS box-trainer modified to accept a SILS Port? with two working ports for instruments and one port for a 30 5-mm laparoscope. SILS? tasks were performed with instruments capable of unilateral articulation. SILS? suturing was performed both with and without an articulating EndoStitch? device. Task scores, including cumulative laparoscopic FLS score (LS) and cumulative SILS? FLS score (SS), were calculated using standard time and accuracy metrics. RESULTS There were 27 participants in the study. SS was inferior to LS in all groups. LS increased with experience level, but was similar between LE and SE groups. SS increased with experience level and was different among all groups. SILS? suturing using the articulating suturing device was superior to the use of a modified needle driver technique. CONCLUSIONS SILS? is more technically challenging than standard laparoscopic surgery. Using currently available SILS? platforms and instruments, even surgeons with SILS? experience are unable to match their overall LAP performance.

The fistulous connection occurs within intraosseous diploic or transosseous emissary veins causing dilated intraosseous vascular pouches. To the authors' knowledge, this report describes the first percutaneous transfacial direct embolization of an intraosseous DAVF. CLINICAL PRESENTATION A man in his 50s with blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome presented with headaches, imbalance, decreased visual acuity bilaterally, and left eye proptosis and chemosis. Imaging demonstrated an extensive intraosseous DAVF with dilated intraosseous vascular pouches throughout his cranial base and intraorbital venous congestion. He underwent staged endovascular treatment with the goal to improve his ocular symptoms. Transarterial and transvenous approaches failed to provide adequate access to the intraosseous vascular pouches. A direct, percutaneous transfacial approach was used to access the pouches for embolization with coils and liquid embolic material. Postoperative angiography demonstrated successful embolization of the pouch within the left pterygoid wing, reduced opacification of the intraosseous fistula, and elimination of intraorbital venous congestion. At 9-month follow-up, the patient's headaches had resolved, and his ocular symptomatology had improved. CONCLUSION Endovascular access to an intraosseous DAVF is limited by the size and location of the intraosseous vascular pouches. In this case, a direct transfacial approach under image guidance facilitated access and embolization, which led to an improvement in the patient's symptoms. This technique is a novel approach for DAVF management.","output":"Percutaneous transfacial direct embolization of an intraosseous dural arteriovenous fistula."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The complexity of handheld steerable laparoscopic instruments (SLI) may impair the learning curve compared to conventional instruments when first utilized. This study aimed to provide the current state of interest in the use of SLI, the current use of these in daily practice and the type of training which is conducted before using SLI in the operating room (OR) on real patients. An online survey was distributed by European Association of Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) Executive Office to all active members, between January 4th and February 3rd, 2020. The survey consisted of 14 questions regarding the usage and training of steerable laparoscopic instruments. A total of 83 members responded, coming from 33 different countries. Twenty three percent of the respondents using SLI, were using the instruments routinely and of these 21% had not received any formal training in advance of using the instruments in real patients. Of all responding EAES members, 41% considered the instruments to potentially compromise patient safety due to their complexity, learning curve and the inexperience of the surgeons. The respondents reported the three most important aspects of a possible steerable laparoscopic instruments training curriculum to be: hands-on training, safe tissue handling and suturing practice. Finally, a major part of the respondents consider force/pressure feedback data to be of significant importance for implementation of training and assessment of safe laparoscopic and robotic surgery. Training and assessment of skills regarding safe implementation of steerable laparoscopic instruments is lacking.

A handful of static structures now provide molecular insights into how SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV interact with its host target, which is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Molecular recognition, binding and function are dynamic processes. To evaluate this, multiple 500 ns or 1 s all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed to better understand the structural stability and interfacial interactions between the receptor binding domain of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bound to ACE2. Several contacts were observed to form, break and reform in the interface during the simulations. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV utilizes unique strategies to achieve stable binding to ACE2. Several differences were observed between the residues of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV that consistently interacted with ACE2. Notably, a stable salt bridge between Lys417 of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and Asp30 of ACE2 as well as three stable hydrogen bonds between Tyr449, Gln493 and Gln498 of SARS-CoV-2 and Asp38, Glu35 and Lys353 of ACE2 were observed, which were absent in the ACE2CSARS-CoV interface. Some previously reported residues, which were suggested to enhance the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2, were not observed to form stable interactions in these simulations. Molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area based free energy of binding was observed to be higher for SARS-CoV-2 in all simulations. Stable binding to the host receptor is crucial for virus entry. Therefore, special consideration should be given to these stable interactions while designing potential drugs and treatment modalities to target or disrupt this interface.","output":"Dynamics of the ACE2CSARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV spike protein interface reveal unique mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic significantly increased the workload for the Italian Health Service.

To determine the basis for this difference in neurovirulence we have studied the acute central nervous system (CNS) infection of these two viruses by in situ hybridization. Both viruses infected the same, specific neuroanatomical areas, predominantly neurons, and spread via the cerebrospinal fluid, along neuronal pathways and between adjacent cells. The neuronal nuclei infected and the spread of virus within the brain are described. The main difference between the parental and variant viruses was the rate at which the infection spread. MHV-4 spread rapidly, destroying large numbers of neurons and the animals died within 4 days of infection. The variant virus spread to the same areas of the brain but at a slower rate. This difference in the rate of virus spread was also apparent from the brain virus titers. The slower rate of spread of the variant virus appears to allow intervention by the immune response. Consistent with this, the variant virus spread slowly in athymic nu/nu mice, but in the absence of an intact immune response, infection and destruction of neurons eventually reached the same extent as that of the parental virus and the mice died within 6 days of infection. We conclude that the V5A13.1 variant of MHV-4 is neuroattenuated by its slower rate of spread in the CNS.","output":"The V5A13.1 envelope glycoprotein deletion mutant of mouse hepatitis virus type-4 is neuroattenuated by its reduced rate of spread in the central nervous system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED The insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) is a new target for the treatment of breast cancer.

The study focuses on the organisational setting and how it did or did not support the nurses in their work. METHODS: A qualitative explorative design was used in interviewing 23 nurses who had worked at a COVID-19 ward in one of three hospitals. Data were collected in the summer of 2020, and the analysis was inspired by Paul Ricoeurs theory of narratives and interpretation. RESULTS: The presence of managers in the wards helped the nurses in the form of psychological and practical support. Working within an organisation that provides a safe environment was essential for nurses. The experience of a safe environment allowed nurses to ask questions, which supported them in finding solutions to specific tasks in the new and critical working environment. Barriers to handling the new situation were an absence of managers and a lack of a sense of belongingness and trust. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the need for management to be present in the ward and for organisational support to be available to nurses so they can provide optimal treatment and care when working in new and unknown conditions during a pandemic. Practical assistance from managers to ease the job is beneficial. Furthermore, the presence of management is essential to provide psychological support and create a safe environment because this allows nurses to ask questions about how to better manage new and critical tasks.","output":"How did nurses cope with the fast, comprehensive organisational changes at Danish hospital wards during the COVID-19 pandemic?

The disease is directly connected to the nutritional status of patients and a well-balanced diet is recommended by official sources. Recently, the role of platelet activating factor (PAF) was suggested in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In the present review several micronutrients (vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin D, selenium, omega-3 fatty acids, and minerals), phytochemicals and Mediterranean diet compounds with potential anti-COVID activity are presented. We further underline that the well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic actions of the investigated nutrients and/or holistic dietary schemes, such as the Mediterranean diet, are also mediated through PAF. In conclusion, there is no single food to prevent coronavirus Although the relationship between PAF and COVID-19 is not robust, a healthy diet containing PAF inhibitors may target both inflammation and thrombosis and prevent the deleterious effects of COVID-19.

Although it has not been widely used in outpatient neurosurgery settings, the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has necessitated a broader adoption. Our goal is to show the level of patient satisfaction with their telemedicine care. METHODS: We prospectively studied consecutive telemedicine patients who scheduled outpatient neurosurgery visits from May 15 to June 8, 2020. Patients were seen by the surgeon via real-time video conferencing using Google Meet, and then completed a telemedicine satisfaction survey. Our primary outcome was telemedicine satisfaction scores. We compared satisfaction scores between new and established patients and between patients within and outside of a 15-mile radius of the nearest clinic location. Sensitivity analyses were performed to account for the nonrespondents. Descriptive and univariate analyses were performed. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Five-hundred and ninety patients completed a telemedicine visit during the study period. One patient from out of state was excluded. Three-hundred and ten patients (52.6%) responded. The average age was 60.9  13.60 years; 59% were female, 20.6% were new patients; the average distance to the clinic was 28.03  36.09 km (17.42  22.43 miles).

By virtue of this method, we can explain the evolutionary relationships, but further explanations are not possible unless sequences are studied through the chemical nature of individual amino acids. Here we develop a new methodology to characterize the protein sequences on the basis of the chemical nature of the amino acids. We design various algorithms for studying the variation of chemical group transitions and various chemical group combinations as patterns in the protein sequences. The amino acid sequence of conventional myosin II head domain of 14 family members are taken to illustrate this new approach. We find two blocks of maximum length 6 aa as FPKATD and Y/FTNEKL without repeating the same chemical nature and one block of maximum length 20 aa with the repetition of chemical nature which are common among all 14 members. We also check commonality with another motor protein sub-family kinesin, KIF1A. Based on our analysis we find a common block of length 8 aa both in myosin II and KIF1A. This motif is located in the neck linker region which could be responsible for the generation of mechanical force, enabling us to find the unique blocks which remain chemically conserved across the family. We also validate our methodology with different protein families such as MYOI, Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase.

We have used this protein as a model to study the structural requirements for O-glycosylation. We show that MHV M is modified by the addition of a single oligosaccharide side chain at the cluster of 4 hydroxylamino acids present at its extreme amino terminus and identified Thr at position 5 as the functional acceptor site. The hydroxylamino acid cluster, which is quite conserved among O-glycosylated coronavirus M proteins, is not in itself sufficient for O-glycosylation. Downstream amino acids are required to introduce a functional O-glycosylation site into a foreign protein. In a mutagenic analysis O-glycosylation was found to be sensitive to some particular changes but no unique sequence motif for O-glycosylation could be identified. Expression of mutant M proteins in cells revealed that substitution of any 1 residue was tolerated, conceivably due to the occurrence of multiple UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc transferases). Indeed, MHV M served as a substrate for GalNac-T1, -T2, and -T3, as was demonstrated using an in situ glycosylation assay based on the co-expression of endoplasmic reticulum-retained forms of the GalNAc transferases with endoplasmic reticulum-resident MHV M mutants. The GalNAc transferases were found to have largely overlapping, but distinct substrate specificities. The requirement for a threonine as acceptor rather than a serine residue and the requirement for a proline residue three positions downstream of the acceptor site were found to be distinctive features.","output":"Structural requirements for O-glycosylation of the mouse hepatitis virus membrane protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major non-communicable disease with an increasing prevalence. Undiagnosed DM is not uncommon and can lead to severe complications and mortality. Identifying high-risk individuals at an earlier disease stage, that is, pre-diabetes (pre-DM), is crucial in delaying progression. Existing risk models mainly rely on non-modifiable factors to predict only the DM risk, and few apply to Chinese people. This study aims to develop and validate a risk prediction function that incorporates modifiable lifestyle factors to detect DM and pre-DM in Chinese adults in primary care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A cross-sectional study to develop DM/Pre-DM risk prediction functions using data from the Hong Kong's Population Health Survey (PHS) 2014/2015 and a 12-month prospective study to validate the functions in case finding of individuals with DM/pre-DM. Data of 1857 Chinese adults without self-reported DM/Pre-DM will be extracted from the PHS 2014/2015 to develop DM/Pre-DM risk models using logistic regression and machine learning methods. 1014 Chinese adults without a known history of DM/Pre-DM will be recruited from public and private primary care clinics in Hong Kong. They will complete a questionnaire on relevant risk factors and blood tests on Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) on recruitment and, if the first blood test is negative, at 12 months. A positive case is DM/pre-DM defined by OGTT or HbA1c in any blood test. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the models in detecting DM/pre-DM will be calculated.

External validity refers to how generalisable interventions are to populations or settings beyond those in the original study. The degree to which external validity elements are reported in such studies is unclear however. This systematic review aimed to determine the extent to which childhood obesity interventions delivered by health professionals during the first 1,000 days report on elements that can be used to inform generalizability across settings and populations. Methods: Eligible studies meeting study inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified through a systematic review of 11 databases and three trial registers. An assessment tool based on the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework was used to assess the external validity of included studies. It comprised five dimensions: reach and representativeness of individuals, reach and representativeness of settings, implementation and adaptation, outcomes for decision making maintenance and/or institutionalisation. Two authors independently assessed the external validity of 20% of included studies; discrepancies were resolved, and then one author completed assessments of the remaining studies. Results: In total, 39 trials involving 46 interventions published between 1999 and 2019 were identified. The majority of studies were randomized controlled trials (n=24). Reporting varied within and between dimensions. External validity elements that were poorly described included: representativeness of individuals and settings, treatment receipt, intervention mechanisms and moderators, cost effectiveness, and intervention sustainability and acceptability. Conclusions: Our review suggests that more emphasis is needed on research designs that consider generalisability, and the reporting of external validity elements in early life childhood obesity prevention interventions. Important gaps in external validity reporting were identified that could facilitate decisions around the translation and scale-up of interventions from research to practice.

Obesity confers poor outcomes in younger (<60 years) patients, an age-group considered low-risk for complications, a privilege that is negated by obesity. Findings are consistent, the higher the body mass index (BMI) the worse the outcomes. Ectopic (visceral) obesity also promotes proinflammatory, prothrombotic, and vasoconstrictive states, thus enhancing the deleterious effects of COVID-19 disease. Less, albeit robust, evidence also exists for a higher risk of COVID-19 infection incurred with underweight. Thus, the relationship of COVID-19 and BMI has a J-curve pattern, where patients with both overweight/obesity and underweight are more susceptible to the ailments of COVID-19. The pathophysiology underlying this link is multifactorial, mostly relating to the inflammatory state characterizing obesity, the impaired immune response to infectious agents coupled with increased viral load, the overexpression in adipose tissue of the receptors and proteases for viral entry, an increased sympathetic activity, limited cardiorespiratory reserve, a prothrombotic milieu, and the associated comorbidities. All these issues are herein reviewed, the results of large studies and meta-analyses are tabulated and the pathogenetic mechanisms and the BMI relationship with COVID-19 are pictorially illustrated.","output":"COVID-19 Infection and Body Weight: A Deleterious Liaison in a J-Curve Relationship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For rebooting business and academic activities in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic scenario, it is important to pay detailed attention to all forms of infection transfer mechanisms during interaction of people in enclosed environments.

We expand on the well-known theory of Poisson fluctuations which acts as statistical barrier against formation of virusols. Analysis suggests that for viral loads of less than 2x10 5 RNA copies/mL, often corresponding to mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19, droplets of diameter <20 micron are unlikely to be of consequence in carrying infections. Cut-off diameters below which droplets will be practically free of contamination, are presented as a function of viral loading. The median diameters of virus laden droplet distributions will be 1.5 to 20 times higher depending upon the Geometric Standard Deviation of the droplet size distributions.

METHOD: Multi-method process evaluation embedded within a mixed-method feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial in two district general hospitals in England. Data were collected using (i) focus groups with health professionals (HPs), (ii) semi-structured interviews with patients and/or carers, (iii) non-participant observations of multi-disciplinary team meetings and (iv) patient clinical note review. Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics, with interpretation guided by NPT components (coherence; cognitive participation; collective action; reflexive monitoring). Data triangulated across sources. RESULTS: Two focus groups (26 HPs), nine non-participant observations, 12 interviews (two patients, 10 relatives), 29 clinical note reviews were conducted. While coherence was evident, with HPs recognising the value of the AMBER care bundle, cognitive participation and collective action presented challenges. Specifically: (1) HPs were unable and unwilling to operationalise the concept of risk of dying intervention eligibility criteria (2) integration relied on a champion to drive participation and ensure sustainability; and (3) differing skills and confidence led to variable engagement with difficult conversations with patients and families about, for example, nearness to end of life. Opportunities for reflexive monitoring were not routinely embedded within the intervention. Reflections on the use of the AMBER care bundle from HPs and patients and families, including recommended modifications became evident through this NPT-driven analysis. CONCLUSION: To be successfully normalised, new clinical practices, such as the AMBER care bundle, must be studied within the wider context in which they operate. NPT can be used to the aid identification of practical strategies to assist in normalisation of complex interventions where the focus of care is on clinical uncertainty in acute hospital settings.","output":"Implementation of a complex intervention to improve care for patients whose situations are clinically uncertain in hospital settings: A multi-method study using normalisation process theory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We explored whether children could apply linguistic strategies for lying, i.e., manipulating linguistic content of speech to mislead others.

Meanwhile, behind the participants, a video was playing images that ostensibly corresponded to the sounds being played. In fact, this was not necessarily the case, i.e., some items cannot be solved because the sounds played are not from any animal but machine-synthesized. Participants were instructed not to look back at the video. However, 51 children peeked at the video for the unsolvable items, although the peeking behavior decreased with age. Moreover, when explaining how they correctly guessed the unsolvable items, children as young as 6 years old were able to apply a linguistic strategy (i.e., capability attribution) for lying. Besides capability attribution, Children also applied fortune attribution and topic shift for lying. Finally, fortune attribution and topic shift increased with age. Therefore, educators need to be aware that children are able to apply verbal strategies for lying that could involve truthful statements (i.e., topic shift) or statements that are difficult to be proved as untruthful (i.e., fortune attribution).","output":"Truthful but Misleading: Advanced Linguistic Strategies for Lying Among Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After covering the political context and chronology, this chapter recounts the disciplined campaign and network of narratives delivered to the Iranian public via official news agencies and governmental interventions, especially the State TV, during COVID-19 outbreak.

The daily emergence of advice and guidelines was necessary to ensure the safety of patients and staff. To this effect, all elective services came to a halt to preserve hospitals capacity for dealing with the sickest. This retrospective, descriptive review aims to assess the volume and timing of the advice released specifically relevant to UK ENT specialists. METHODS: Two separate searches were performed. One involved online advice published in English by international, national and ENT\\\\specific organisations between January 1 and May 31. The date, title, source, type of advice and link to the advice were recorded in Excel. The resources were analysed per week of publication.

AIM: Characterize patterns of and factors associated with decisions to forgo resuscitative efforts, as measured by do-not-resuscitate orders, during critical illness with Covid-19. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort with medical record abstraction. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients diagnosed with SARS-Cov-2 virus via polymerase chain reaction and admitted to the intensive care unit at an academic hospital, which cares for the city's underserved communities, between March 1 and June 7, 2020 who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours. RESULTS: In this cohort (n = 155), 45% were black people, and 51% spoke English as their primary language. Median time to first goals-of-care conversation was 3.9 days (IQR 1.9-7.6) after intensive care unit admission. Overall 61/155 patients (39%) transitioned to do-not-resuscitate status, and 50/62 (82%) patients who died had do-not-resuscitate orders. Multivariate analysis shows age and palliative care involvement as the strongest predictors of decision to instate do-not-resuscitate order. There was no association between race, ethnicity, or language and decisions to forego resuscitation. CONCLUSIONS: During this time of crisis and uncertainty with limited resources and strained communication, time to first goals of care conversation was shorter than in pre-pandemic studies, but rates of foregoing resuscitation remained similar, with no differences observed by race, ethnicity, or language.

METHODS: This was a cross sectional analytical study done at a tertiary care teaching hospital in India including patients with RMDs who were not on biological diseases modifying agents. Assessment of disease status, socioeconomic status and economic impact of COVID-19 was done via tele-consultation. RESULTS: Out of the 680 patients satisfying inclusion criteria, 373 completed the study. The format was found easy by 334 (89.6%) of them and 284 (76.1%) considered tele-rheumatology better than in-person consultation. During the pre-COVID months, the median monthly per capita income of the families of our patients and cost of illness was Indian rupees (INR) 2000 (US$ 26) and INR 1685 (US$ 21.91), respectively.

A total of 1,952 middle and high school students as eligible participants at baseline (pre-COVID-19, Wave 1; response rate: 98.79%), 1,831 eligible students were followed up at Wave 2 (October 2019 to December 2019, pre-COVID-19; retention rate: 93.80%), and 1,790 completed the follow-up at Wave 3 (during the COVID-19; retention rate: 97.80%). The mean age of the baseline students was 13.56 (SD: 1.46) years. The differences in anxiety and depressive symptoms between Wave 1, Wave 2, and Wave 3 were not statistically significant. The proportion of students with poor sleep quality increased over time, from Wave 1 (21.0%) to Wave 3 (26.0%, OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.17C1.60, P = 0.001) and from Wave 2 (21.9%) to Wave 3 (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.11C1.51, P < 0.001). The cross-lagged generalized linear mixed models revealed that the concurrent and cross-lagged associations of poor sleep quality with anxiety symptoms across the three waves were significant (P < 0.05) and vice versa. Only a marginally significant positive cross-lagged association between poor sleep quality at Wave 2 and depressive symptoms at Wave 3 was found (standardized  estimate = 0.044, SE = 0.022, P = 0.045).

A retrospective trend analysis was performed to assess demographic data of all laboratory-confirmed MERS and COVID-19 cases. Patients' charts were reviewed for data on demographics, mortality, citizenship, sex ratio, and age groups with descriptive and comparative statistics; the data were analyzed using a non-parametric binomial test and chi-square test. Of all COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia,78%were male patients and 22% were female patients. This proportion of male COVID-19 patients was similar to that of male MERS patients, which also affected male patients more frequently than female patients. The number of COVID-19-positive Saudi cases was lower than that of non-Saudi cases, which were in contrast to that of MERS; COVID-19 appeared to be remarkably similar to MERS with respect to recovered cases. However, the numbers of critical and dead COVID-19 patients have been much lower than those of MERS patients. The largest proportion of COVID-19 and MERS cases (44.05% and 40.8%, respectively) were recorded in the Western region.

We characterize the mechanism of inhibition of type I IFN production in primary human MDDCs by this viral factor. Using different human and mouse primary cells lacking STING, we show enhanced DENV replication. Conversely, mutated versions of STING that cannot be cleaved by the DENV NS2B3 protease induced higher levels of type I IFN after infection with DENV.

The main reasons for orthodontic treatment were mandibular retrognathia, Class II distal bite, deep bite and crowding. At the end of a retention phase (Examination 1), the quality of treatment outcome was assessed using the occlusal morphology and function index (OMFI) and patients were asked about treatment satisfaction. Stability of occlusal traits and patient satisfaction were re-evaluated after a two-year follow-up (Examination 2). Occlusal characteristics descriptive statistics were performed. RESULTS At Examination 1, all six morphological criteria for acceptability were fulfilled by 76% and all functional criteria by 82% of the patients. All OMFI criteria were met by 67% of the patients. At Examination 2, 68% of the patients fulfilled all morphological and 82% all functional criteria of acceptability.

All-cause, COVID-19-related and the following cardiovascular deaths have been studied: pulmonary embolism, hypertensive disease, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and cerebrovascular diseases. RESULTS: In 2020, a total of 56,412 deaths were recorded, corresponding to a 16% (n = 7806) increase compared to the period 2018C2019. The relative percentage increase during the so-called first and second waves was 19% and 44%, respectively. Of 7806 excess deaths, COVID-19 codes were reported in 90% of death certificates. The percentage increase in pulmonary embolism-related deaths was 27% (95%CI 19C35%), 1018 deaths during the year 2020, compared to 804 mean annual deaths in the period 2018C2019. This was more evident among men, who experience an absolute increase of 147 deaths (+45%), than in women (+67 deaths; +14%). The increase was primarily driven by deaths recorded during the second wave (+91% in OctoberCDecember). An excess of deaths, particularly among men and during the second wave, was also observed for other cardiovascular diseases, notably hypertensive disease, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease, and ischemic heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a considerable increase of all-cause mortality during the year 2020. This was mainly driven by COVID-19 and its complications. The relative increase in the number of pulmonary embolism-related deaths was more prominent during the second wave, suggesting a possible underdiagnosis during the first wave.","output":"Deaths related to pulmonary embolism and cardiovascular events before and during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic: An epidemiological analysis of data from an Italian high-risk area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic conditions (CCs) management during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the pandemic on patient activation (PA) and health locus of control (HLOC) remain unknown This cross-sectional online survey study examined the role of COVID-19 pandemic-related worry or fear in PA and HLOC among patients with CCs Individuals with CCs (n = 300) were recruited through MTurk Amazon The questionnaire included sociodemographic questions, the Patient ActivationMeasure, and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control-Form B Out of the 300 participants, 9 7% were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 7 3% were hospitalized Patients with cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, drug abuse/substance abuse, and stroke reported significant difficulties in managing their CCs due to worry or fear because of COVID-19 More than half of the sample (45 7%) reported COVID-19-related worry or fear about managing their CCs, and these patients had lower PA and lower external HLOC compared to patients not affected by COVID-19-related worry or fear Health professionals should provide more support for patients facing difficulties in managing their CCs during the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Self-Reported Management of Chronic Conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Syndemic Theory (ST) provides a framework to examine mutually enhancing diseases/health issues under conditions of social inequality and inequity.

In addition to the consequences for the patient, these revisits have a negative impact on a health systems finances in a value-based care or global budget environment. LifeBridge Health, a community health system in Maryland, United States, implemented an automated mobile patient engagement application as part of our enterprise-wide digital health strategy to improve patient engagement and reduce revisits to the ED. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to evaluate the effectiveness of a customized automated digital patient engagement application (GetWell Loop) to reduce 30-day revisits after home discharge from an ED. METHODS: The LifeBridge Health Innovation Department and ED staff from 2 participating health system hospitals collaborated with GetWellNetwork to customize their patient engagement application with automated check-in questions and other on-demand resources (eg, streaming content explaining aspects of self-care during COVID-19). An application link was emailed to adult patients discharged home from the ED. A study of ED visits for patients treated for general medicine and cardiology conditions between August 1, 2018, and July 31, 2019, was conducted using CRISP (Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients), Marylands state-designated health information exchange. We also used data within GetWell Loop (GetWellNetwork) to track patient activation and engagement. The primary outcome was the number of ED patients who experienced a 30-day revisit and who did or did not activate their GetWell Loop account. Secondary outcomes included the overall activation rate and the rate of engagement as measured by the number of logins, alerts, and comments generated by patients through the application. Bivariate analysis comparing outcomes among patients who activated the GetWell Loop application to patients who did not was conducted using the Fisher exact test. Multivariate logistic regression modeling with elastic net regularization was also performed to account for potential confounders and potential collinearity of covariates. RESULTS: During this 1-year study, 1062 (27.4%) of 3866 of all emergency patients treated for general medicine or cardiology conditions, who received an invite to use the digital application, activated their account. The patients discharged from the ED, who were treated for general medicine conditions (n=2087) and who activated their GetWell Loop account, experienced a 30-day revisit rate of 17.3% (n=101) compared with 24.6% (n=369) for those who did not activate their account (P<.001). Of the patients treated for cardiology conditions (n=1779), 12.8% (n=61) of those who activated their GetWell account experienced a 30-day revisit compared with 17.7% (n=231) of those who did not activate their account (P=.01). The significance of these findings persisted after adjustment for confounding variables including age, race, sex, and payor in logistic regression modeling (adjusted odds ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.92; P=.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a significant percentage of patients are willing to utilize a digital application following ED discharge to better engage in their own care, and that usage of such digital applications may significantly reduce 30-day revisit rates. LifeBridge Healths experience demonstrates that health care systems can leverage automated mobile apps to improve patient engagement and successfully impact clinical outcomes at scale.","output":"The Effect of an Automated Mobile Patient Engagement Application on Emergency Department Revisits: Prospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread to all 7 continents.

We evaluated the occurrence, clinical characteristics and outcome of SLD in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Clinical course and laboratory was analyzed from all patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICU of the university hospital. SLD was defined as: bilirubin  2 mg/dl or elevation of aminotransferase levels (> 20-fold ULN). RESULTS: 72 critically ill patients were identified, 22 (31%) patients developed SLD. Presenting characteristics including age, gender, comorbidities as well as clinical presentation regarding COVID-19 overlapped substantially in both groups. Patients with SLD had more severe respiratory failure (paO(2)/FiO(2:) 82 (58C114) vs. 117 (83C155); p < 0.05). Thus, required more frequently mechanical ventilation (95% vs. 64%; p < 0.01), rescue therapies (ECMO) (27% vs. 12%; p = 0.106), vasopressor (95% vs. 72%; p < 0.05) and renal replacement therapy (86% vs. 30%; p < 0.001). Severity of illness was significantly higher (SAPS II: 48 (39C52) vs. 40 (32C45); p < 0.01). Patients with SLD and without presented viremic during ICU stay in 68% and 34%, respectively (p = 0.002). Occurrence of SLD was independently associated with presence of viremia [OR 6.359; 95% CI 1.336C30.253; p < 0.05] and severity of illness (SAPS II) [OR 1.078; 95% CI 1.004C1.157; p < 0.05]. Mortality was high in patients with SLD compared to other patients (68% vs. 16%, p < 0.001). After adjustment for confounders, SLD was independently associated with mortality [HR3.347; 95% CI 1.401C7.999; p < 0.01]. CONCLUSION: One-third of critically ill patients with COVID-19 suffer from SLD, which is associated with high mortality. Occurrence of viremia and severity of illness seem to contribute to occurrence of SLD and underline the multifactorial cause.

There have been few systematic studies that examined the prevalence and transition of suicidal ideation classes in young adults and the factors associated with the transition. METHODS: This two-wave survey recruited 1269 young adults (Mean age = 24.0 years, 70.1% males) in Hong Kong. The participants completed the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale, Chinese Health Questionnaire, and help-seeking behaviors in 2018 and 2019. Latent profile analysis was used to classify the participants into latent classes of suicidal ideation with substantive checking under the 3-step approach. Latent transition analysis with measurement invariance examined the transition among the latent classes from 2018 to 2019 and the associations with help-seeking behaviors and change in psychological distress. RESULTS: Three latent classes of suicidal ideation were identified and over two-thirds of the participants belonged to the Low-risk class with minimal suicidal ideation. The prevalence of the High-risk class dropped from 10.2 to 7.2%, while that of the Moderate-risk class remained stable from 2018 to 2019. Increases in psychological distress predicted higher probabilities to remain at or transit into more risky classes. Engagement in help-seeking behaviors showed differential transitions in suicidal ideation across time. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest three latent classes of suicidal ideation with distinct profiles among the young adults.

The purpose of this article is to evaluate whether digital mammography (DM) is associated with persistent increased detection of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or has altered the upgrade rate of DCIS to invasive cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS. An institutional review board-approved retrospective search identified DCIS diagnosed in women with mammographic calcifications between 2001 and 2014. Ipsilateral cancer within 2 years, masses, papillary DCIS, and patients with outside imaging were excluded, yielding 484 cases. Medical records were reviewed for mammographic calcifications, technique, and pathologic diagnosis. Mammograms were interpreted by radiologists certified by the Mammography Quality Standards Act. The institution transitioned from film-screen mammography (FSM) to exclusive DM by 2010. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square test. RESULTS. Of 484 DCIS cases, 158 (33%) were detected by FSM and 326 (67%) were detected by DM. The detection rate was higher with DM than FSM (1.4 and 0.7 per 1000, respectively; p < .001). The detection rate of high-grade DCIS doubled with DM compared with FSM (0.8 and 0.4 per 1000, respectively; p < .001). The prevalent peak of DM-detected DCIS was 2.7 per 1000 in 2008. Incident DM detection remained double FSM (1.4 vs 0.7 per 1000). Similar proportions of high-grade versus low- to intermediate-grade DCIS were detected with both modalities. There was no significant difference in the upgrade rate of DCIS to invasive cancer between DM (10%; 34/326) and FSM (10%; 15/158) (p = .74). High-grade DCIS led to 71% (35/49) of the upgrades to invasive cancer. CONCLUSION. DM was associated with a significant doubling in DCIS and high-grade DCIS detection, which persisted after prevalent peak. The majority of upgrades to invasive cancer arose from high-grade DCIS.

We correlated the remote sensing based observations of meteorological parameters and air quality parameters with COVID-19 cases from 657 districts all over the country and found that air quality parameters are playing very crucial role along with a few meteorological parameters for this outbreak. We observed that air temperature, and wind speed were significantly and positively correlated with COVID-19 cases but precipitation and humidity were negatively correlated with confirmed cases. Cloudiness had no significant relation in this aspect. Among the air pollutants, O 3 was better correlating with COVID-19 cases. AOD representing the particulate matter concentration also significantly correlated with such cases majorly over Indo-Gangetic plain region. The carbon-pollutants CO was also very high over the same region.

Results: 64% of participants reported being likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19; 27% were unsure and 9% reported being unlikely to be vaccinated. Personal and clinical characteristics, previous influenza vaccination, general vaccination beliefs, and beliefs and attitudes about COVID-19 and a COVID-19 vaccination explained 77% of the variance in vaccination intention. Intention to be vaccinated was associated with more positive general COVID-19 vaccination beliefs and attitudes, weaker beliefs that the vaccination would cause side effects or be unsafe, greater perceived information sufficiency to make an informed decision about COVID-19 vaccination, greater perceived risk of COVID-19 to others but not oneself, older age, and having been vaccinated for influenza last winter (2019/20). Conclusions: Despite uncertainty around the details of a COVID-19 vaccination, most participants reported intending to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Actual uptake will likely be lower. Vaccination intention reflects general vaccine beliefs and attitudes. Campaigns and messaging about a COVID-19 vaccination should emphasize the risk of COVID-19 to others and necessity for everyone to be vaccinated.","output":"COVID-19 vaccination intention in the UK: Results from the COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptability Study (CoVAccS), a nationally representative cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to provide the anatomic rationale for a transnasal approach to the orbital apex and cavernous sinus, and to evaluate its applicability and efficiency. METHODS One hundred patients with lesions of the orbital apex, cavernous sinus, optic nerve, clivus, parapharyngeal space, infratemporal fossa, or pterygopalatine fossa were reviewed over a 10-year period. All patients underwent an endoscopic transnasal approach to the orbital apex and cavernous sinus. The surgical technique required a standard endoscopic sinus surgery set. The possible complications were recorded and classified as intraoperative or postoperative. RESULTS There were complications in 8 cases: 4 intraoperative and 4 postoperative. The intraoperative complications included rupture of the internal carotid artery in 1 patient and cerebrospinal fluid leak in 3 patients. All intraoperative complications were resolved during surgery. The postoperative complications were transitory eyelid ptosis in 2 patients (resolved in 6 months) and transitory diplopia with immediate deficit of the medial rectus muscle in 2 patients (completely resolved in 1 month). CONCLUSIONS With the use of this technique, the surgeon can precisely identify the position of the surgical instrument without losing his or her way, thereby significantly reducing the rate of complications.","output":"Transnasal approach to the orbital apex and cavernous sinus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Admitting male and female patients to the same room compromises the safety of female patients and violates the rights of all patients.

To the best of our knowledge, no study quantified the changes on moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behaviors (SB) and its correlates in Brazilians. This study aimed to (i) evaluate the changes (pre versus during pandemic) in time spent in MVPA and SB in self-isolating Brazilians during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (ii) to explore correlates. METHODS: A cross-sectional, retrospective, self-report online web survey, evaluating the time spent in MVPA and SB pre and during the COVID-19 pandemic in self-isolating people in Brazil. Sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical measures, and time in self-isolation were also obtained. Changes in MVPA and SB and their correlates were explored using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Models were adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: A total of 877 participants (72.7% women, 53.7% young adults [18C34 years]) were included. Overall, participants reported a 59.7% reduction (95% CI 35.6C82.2) in time spent on MVPA during the pandemic, equivalent to 64.28 (95% CI 36.06C83.33) minutes per day. Time spent in SB increased 42.0% (95% CI 31.7C52.5), corresponding to an increase of 152.3 (95% CI 111.9C192.7) minutes per day. Greater reductions in MVPA and increases in SB were seen in younger adults, those not married, those employed, and those with a self-reported previous diagnosis of a mental disorder. CONCLUSIONS: People in self-isolation significantly reduced MVPA levels and increased SB. Public health strategies are needed to mitigate the impact of self-isolation on MVPA and SB.

Methods Serological responses were compared after BNT162b2 and AZD1222 vaccination with varying intervals in uninfected and previously-infected adults aged 50-89 years. These findings are evaluated against real-world national vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates against COVID-19 in England. Results We recruited 750 participants aged 50-89 years, including 126 (16.8%) with evidence of previous infection; 421 received BNT162b2 and 329 and AZD1222. For both vaccines, over 95% had seroconverted 35-55 days after dose one, and 100% seroconverted 7+ days after dose 2. Following a 65-84 day interval between two doses, geometric mean titres (GMTs) at 14-34 days were 6-fold higher for BNT162b2 (6703; 95%CI, 5887-7633) than AZD1222 (1093; 806-1483), which in turn were higher than those receiving BNT162b2 19-29 days apart (694; 540 - 893). For both vaccines, VE was higher across all age-groups from 14 days after dose two compared to one dose, but the magnitude varied with interval between doses. Higher two-dose VE was observed with >6 week intervals between BNT162b2 doses compared to the authorised 3-week schedule, including []80 year-olds. Conclusion Our findings support the UK approach of prioritising the first dose of COVID-19 vaccines, with evidence of higher protection following extended schedules.

IPD trends from 2000/01 to 2019/20 were analysed and cases between 01 February and 30 June 2020 were linked with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections.Findings: IPD incidence in 2019/20 (7.6/100,000;3,964 cases) was 30% (IRR 0.70, 95%CI, 0.18-2.67) lower compared to 2018/19 (10.9/100,000, 3,964 cases) with large reductions observed across all age-groups during March-June 2020. The serotypes responsible for IPD during 2019/20 were similar to previous years. There were 160,886 SARS-CoV-2 infections and 1,159 IPD cases between February and June 2020, including 40 IPD/SARS-CoV-2 coinfections (0.025% [95%CI, 0.018-0.034] of SARS-CoV-2 infections;3.5% [95%CI, 2.5-4.8] of IPD cases), 21 with COVID-19 diagnosed 3-28 days after IPD and 27 who developed COVID-19 >28 days after IPD.

Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is among one of the most important TLR proteins of innate immunity that is responsible for broad antiviral response and immune system control. TLR7 agonists, as both vaccine adjuvants and immune response modulators, are among the top drug candidates for not only our contemporary viral pandemic but also other diseases. The agonists of TLR7 have been utilized as vaccine adjuvants and antiviral agents. In this study, we hybridized a statistical learning-based QSAR model with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation to extract new antiviral drugs by drug repurposing of the DrugBank database. First, we manually curated a dataset consisting of TLR7 agonists. The molecular descriptors of these compounds were extracted, and feature engineering was done to restrict the number of features to 45. We applied a statistically inspired modification of the partial least squares (SIMPLS) method to build our QSAR model. In the next stage, the DrugBank database was virtually screened structurally using molecular docking, and the top compounds for the guanosine binding site of TLR were identified. The result of molecular docking was again screened by the ligand-based approach of QSAR to eliminate compounds that do not display strong EC(50) values by the previously trained model. We then subjected the final results to molecular dynamics simulation and compared our compounds with imiquimod (an FDA-approved TLR7 agonist) and compound 1 (the most active compound against TLR7 in vitro, EC(50) = 0.2 nM). Our results evidently demonstrate that cephalosporins and nucleotide analogues (especially acyclic nucleotide analogues such as adefovir and cidofovir) are computationally potent agonists of TLR7.

We sought to summarize the limited body of literature regarding PM and PTX in patients with COVID-19 and characterize the presentation and clinical outcomes in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-COV-2 pneumonia at our institution to better define the incidence, prognosis, and available treatment for this condition. METHODS: The study is a retrospective analysis of radiology records and chart review that was conducted for a total of 1394 patients identified with Covid pneumonia from which 1.4% patients, admitted from March 1st 2020 to March 1st 2021, were found with pneumomediastinum and/or pneumothorax. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were collected and descriptive statistics were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty patients met inclusion criteria. The majority of the patients were males (75%) and the remaining females (25%). The mean age was 66.1  13.05 for males and 67  13.95 for females. Over the course of the hospitalization, 55% were intubated, 25% remained on nasal cannula, 15% were on a combination of bilevel positive airway pressure and high flow nasal cannula and 5% did not require any supplement oxygenation. The incidence of PM and PTX develops approximately at a mean of 12.6  9.72 day of admission. Improvement was seen in 60% of the patients, whereas death was seen in 40%. The clinical outcome of the 60% with improvement is unknown after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax, although rare phenomenon's, were more prevalent in COVID-19 patients compared with historical patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome.The etiology of this condition may be attributed to higher susceptibility of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to a combination of barotrauma and airway injury. In patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, the development of acute or worsening dyspnea with rapid deterioration of clinical status is suspicious for the presence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.

The objectives of this study were (1) to identify common mental health symptoms among Latin American, US Hispanic, and Spanish college students, and (2) to identify clinical features predictive of higher post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among this population. The study sample included 1,113 college students from the USA, Mexico, Chile, Ecuador, and Spain who completed an online survey containing demographic questions and mental health screeners. Findings revealed higher scores of depression, suicidality, and PTSS compared to pre-pandemic levels and current scores by non-Spanish speaking college students; however, less than 5% of participants endorsed clinical levels of anxiety. After controlling for demographic profiles and sociocultural values, clinical symptoms of depression, loneliness, perceived stress, anxiety, and coping strategies explained 62% of the PTSS variance. Age, history of mental illness, perceived social support, and familism were not significant predictors. This sample of college students revealed higher mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. The high prevalence of PTSS highlights the need to develop pragmatic, cost-effective, and culturally sensitive prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate these symptoms.

Por lo tanto, hemos evaluado que COVID-19 puede caracterizarse como una pandemia (OPS, 2020). Ante esta declaratoria, la ahora categora de pandemia supona un estado de alarma a escala global que, por lo tanto, tendra serias implicaciones para la humanidad en todos sus mbitos de relacionamiento e interaccin como sociedad. Por ello, y frente a todo lo que represent afrontar los cuidados y mecanismos de bioseguridad, el mundo entr en un estado de suspensin de todas las labores o tareas que implicasen un contacto entre individuos, llevando de este modo a una recesin total de la economa en sus diferentes industrias y mercados. Partiendo de lo anterior, y haciendo mencin al panorama presentado en Colombia, se puede afirmar que el mayor embate econmico a nivel de empresas lo sufrieron las PYMES que, de acuerdo a (Hoyos y Sastoque, 2020) mencionan que La pandemia del Covid C 19, ha desestabilizado el sistema socioeconmico del pas, principalmente afectado a las Pymes, siendo 28% del PIB, el 67% del empleo y el 37% de la produccin nacional. (p.39). De modo que, teniendo una representacin tan alta y participacin en mltiples sectores de la economa, adems de ser reconocidas por su generacin de empleo;la pandemia y sus contingencias llevaron a que se presentara una crisis generalizada con consecuencias a nivel socioeconmico, adems de la prdida de bienestar y calidad de vida para las personas que tenan en estas empresas el sustento para sus familias. No obstante, los a?os 2020 y 2021, representaron los picos ms latos en mortalidad, lo que a su vez oblig a los gobiernos a una ampliacin de las medidas de confinamiento y distanciamiento social;las organizaciones como principal motor de la economa debieron replantear su situacin en un mundo paralizado y detectar cmo poder seguir participando en los mercados y generando desde un espacio diferente, mrgenes de ventas que les permitiera seguir a flote a pesar del inhspito escenario. En este contexto, es donde el Marketing Digital cobra relevancia en el mbito organizacional, surgiendo con una tctica de salvamento y un puente para conectarse con sus clientes, a travs de la funcionalidad, rapidez y simplicidad de un clic. De modo que, las empresas lograron identificar como estos espacios virtuales se convertan en los canales directos para llegar a sus consumidores, mediante un contacto permanente y la posibilidad de satisfacer sus necesidades, expectativas y deseos. Por consiguiente, y en cuanto a las bondades que ofrece la adopcin del Marketing Digital para las empresas, (Ochoa Guevara et al., 2020) expresan que: La incorporacin de herramientas tecnolgicas y digitales permite lograr identificar, compartir, generar, retener y aplicar un nuevo conocimiento en el desarrollo e innovacin de productos o servicios y, as, poder reducir la brecha digital estando a la vanguardia de las tecnologas, retroalimentndose con constante capacitacin, esto les facilitar a las empresas estar inmersas en procesos de mejora continua. (p.136). Lo anterior, debido a que durante las fases de confinamiento se detect que las familias pasaron un mayor nmero de horas dedicadas a la conectividad en espacios virtuales, ya fuese por causa de teletrabajo, educacin en modalidad remota o por ocio. En ese sentido, la alta tendencia hacia el uso de internet y sus diversas aplicaciones, infiri en el comportamiento de los consumidores;tal y como se?ala (Gallero, 2018), quien afirma que Los medios digitales estn influyendo y generando cambios significativos en las personas, incidi ndo adems en su transformacin cultural, as como la manera en que esas personas se relacionan con las diferentes, marcas producto y servicios (p.21);esto ha conllevado a que las empresas destinen sus recursos hacia un mayor involucramiento en estos espacios, donde la competitividad tiene una alta dinmica y la percepcin y/o aceptacin de los usuarios se puede medir en tiempo real. Ante esto, la encuesta trimestral de desempe?o empresarial llevada a cabo por la Asociacin Colombiana de las Micro, Peque?as y Medianas Empresas (ACOPI), consult entre las organizaciones si a raz de la coyuntura econmica que se viva debido a la COVID-19, consideraron implementar el uso herramientas tecnolgicas para reforzar las actividades de la empresa;de acuerdo a los resultados el 78% de pymes y el 82% de microempresas consider adoptar herramientas tecnolgicas no solo para la etapa de reactivacin econmica, sino para articularse de manera paulatina con la cuarta revolucin industrial y respecto al rea de la empresa en la que aplicaran el uso de herramientas tecnolgicas, el informe se?ala que el departamento objetivo para esta aplicacin sera ventas y mercadotecnia (52% pymes y 69% microempresas);donde el principal aspecto se enfocara en reforzar todo lo concerniente a los servidores virtuales. (ACOPI, 2020). Esta tendencia que se ha mantenido a pesar de la flexibilizacin en las medidas de bioseguridad y distanciamiento social, permiten vislumbrar que la digitalizacin es un fenmeno social que ha incidido en los procesos de las empresas, llevndolas a asumir los retos que trae consigo la incorporacin de planes y programas en medios virtuales. De modo que, y a partir de lo planteado en los estudios de (Panandiker et al. 2018), donde destacan que La digitalizacin se debera utilizar para poder penetrar nuevos mercados eficientemente y para adoptar nuevos modelos de negocio digitales, que pueden abrir nuevas oportunidades de negocio. (p.15);por tanto, el empleo del Marketing Digital para las empresas, les permite operar en un espacio virtual que de manera sinrgica complemente las actividades tradicionales o en medios fsicos, trascendiendo incluso las fronteras actuales y llegando a mercados internacionales. Si bien, se espera que paulatinamente la humanidad pueda volver a un proceso de normalizacin conforme se supere la pandemia;el Marketing Digital como herramienta o tctica lleg para quedarse y hacer parte de las acciones estratgicas de las organizaciones;puesto que la actual situacin trajo consigo una aceleracin y dependencia de las personas por interactuar en la virtualidad de los espacios que surgen continuamente y donde las empresas compiten para ganar un espacio de reconocimiento y posicionamiento en la mente, deseos y necesidades de sus segmentos de mercado. De manera que, toda esta revolucin tecnolgica es una gran apuesta para las organizaciones que quieran hacer parte de la globalizacin de los mercados y que ven en el Marketing Digital la posibilidad de generar propuestas de valor que se complementen con las acciones desarrolladas en espacios fsicos;de modo que, se puedan potenciar los recursos humanos, tcnicos, operativos y financieros hacia un modelo de participacin integral que est a la par de un mundo cambiante, resiliente y futurista.","output":"El Marketing Digital para las Pymes en tiempos de pandemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and efficacy of an oleanolic acid (OA)-containing toothpaste in reducing gingival inflammation and plaque in patients with gingivitis. METHODS: This proof-of-concept parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial included 99 patients. Following a 1-week washout, patients were randomized into three groups: OA group (fluoride toothpaste containing 0.1% OA and placebo mouthwash); negative control (fluoride toothpaste and placebo mouthwash); and CHX group (fluoride toothpaste and 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash). Patients were clinically assessed at inclusion, pre-washout visit, baseline, and after 4-days, 1-week, and 2-weeks of twice daily use of the products. Patients received a diary for documentation of bleeding on brushing and provided unstimulated saliva samples. RESULTS: After two weeks, all groups showed significant reductions in all clinical parameters. The CHX group exhibited significantly greater reductions in gingival index and interproximal gingival index scores at week-2, as compared to patients in the negative control (p=0.04). In contrast, reductions in gingival index scores did not differ between CHX and OA groups and between OA and negative control groups at week-2. The CHX group had significantly greater reductions in plaque index scores at day-4, 1-week, and 2-week evaluations, as compared to the negative control and OA groups. The frequency of adverse events was similar among the groups. None of the groups reduced salivary transferrin levels. Finally, the OA group had the lowest percentage of self-reported bleeding events.

This is known as parosmia. The aim of this study was to identify the key food triggers of parosmic distortions and investigate the relationship between distortion and disgust in order to establish the impact of parosmia on diet and quality of life. In this cross-sectional study (n = 727), respondents experiencing smell distortions completed a questionnaire covering aspects of smell loss, parosmia and the associated change in valence of everyday items. There was a significant correlation between strength and disgust (p < 0.0001), and when the selected items were reported as distorted, they were described as either unpleasant or gag-inducing 84% of the time.

Investigation about PAEs in terrestrial ecosystem has been extensively conducted while the fate of PAEs in marine environment remains underexplored. In this study, a novel di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) degrading marine bacterial strain, Mycolicibacterium phocaicum RL-HY01, was isolated and characterized from intertidal sediments. Strain RL-HY01 could utilize a range of PAE plasticizers as sole carbon source for growth. The effects of different environmental factors on the degradation of PAEs were evaluated and the results indicated that strain RL-HY01 could efficiently degrade PAEs under a wide range of pH (5.0 to 9.0), temperature (20 C to 40 C) and salinity (below 10%). Specifically, when Tween-80 was added as solubilizing agent, strain RL-HY01 could rapidly degrade DEHP and achieve complete degradation of DEHP (50 mg/L) in 48 h. The kinetics of DEHP degradation by RL-HY01 were well fitted with the modified Gompertz model. The metabolic intermediates of DEHP by strain RL-HY01 were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis and then the metabolic pathway of DEHP was deduced. DEHP was transformed into di-ethyl phthalate (DEP) via ?-oxidation and then DEP was hydrolyzed into phthalic acid (PA) by de-esterification. PA was further transformed into gentisate via salicylic acid and further utilized for cell growth. Bioaugmentation of strain RL-HY01 with marine samples was performed to evaluate its application potential and the results suggested that strain RL-HY01 could accelerate the elimination of DEHP in marine samples. The results have advanced our understanding of the fate of PAEs in marine ecosystem and identified an efficient bioremediation strategy for PAEs-polluted marine sites.","output":"Phthalic acid esters degradation by a novel marine bacterial strain Mycolicibacterium phocaicum RL-HY01: Characterization, metabolic pathway and bioaugmentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sustainable scientific software needs a strong collaboration framework to ensure continuity by passing on the tools, skills and knowledge needed to the next generation.

Procedural technical success was achieved in 91% of the lesions; with 95% technical success rate in common iliac arteries, 87% in external iliac arteries and 89% in common femoral arteries; with 72% technical success rate in occlusions and 98% in stenosis. No in-hospital complications were observed. At 30days, 93 patients (93%) had an improvement of at least one category in the Rutherford classification of symptoms (clinical success rate 93%); 12 patients (12%) had an asymptomatic occlusion of the RA. CONCLUSIONS TRA can be used to treat iliac and common femoral arteries lesions with a high grade of technical success and a low rate of complications.","output":"Endovascular treatment of iliac and common femoral arteries disease by the transradial access: A prospective, feasibility study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plant viruses, like animal viruses, induce the formation of novel intracellular membranous structures that provide an optimum environment for coordinating diverse viral processes such as viral RNA synthesis and virus egress. Membrane reshaping is accomplished by the expression of specific membrane-associated viral proteins that interact with host proteins involved in membrane trafficking processes. Plant virus-induced membranous structures are motile, and this intracellular motility is required for the transport of viral RNA from sites of synthesis to plasmodesmata, which are used to move viral RNA from cell to cell. Cellular movement of these virus-induced bodies requires myosin motor activity and is dependent on the secretory pathway. The coupling of membrane-associated replication complexes with virus intra- and intercellular trafficking may explain why viral infection of neighboring cells is established rapidly and efficiently.","output":"Viral Manipulation of Plant Host Membranes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273) against severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are globally authorized as a two-dose regimen.

We enrolled 461 high-risk health services workers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and first responders in the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACoFD) to assess the humoral responses in previously infected (PI) and infection na?ve (NPI) individuals to mRNA-based vaccines (BNT162b2/Pfizer- BioNTech or mRNA-1273/Moderna). A chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay was used to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Spike in vaccinees prior to (n = 21) and following each vaccine dose (n = 246 following dose 1 and n = 315 following dose 2), and at days 31C60 (n = 110) and 61C90 (n = 190) following completion of the 2-dose series. Both vaccines induced robust antibody responses in all immunocompetent individuals. Previously infected individuals achieved higher median peak titers (p = 0.002) and had a slower rate of decay (p = 0.047) than infection-na?ve individuals. mRNA-1273 vaccinated infection-na?ve individuals demonstrated modestly higher titers following each dose (p = 0.005 and p = 0.029, respectively) and slower rates of antibody decay (p = 0.003) than those who received BNT162b2. A subset of previously infected individuals (25%) required both doses in order to reach peak antibody titers.

Despite the publication of many research papers reporting CPI predictors in the recent years, we have observed a number of fundamental issues in experiment design that lead to over optimistic estimates of model performance. Results: In this paper, we analyze the impact of several important factors affecting generalization perfor-mance of CPI predictors that are overlooked in existing work: 1. Similarity between training and test examples in cross-validation 2. The strategy for generating negative examples, in the absence of experimentally verified negative examples. 3. Choice of evaluation protocols and performance metrics and their alignment with real-world use of CPI predictors in screening large compound libraries. Using both an existing state-of-the-art method (CPI-NN) and a proposed kernel based approach, we have found that assessment of predictive performance of CPI predictors requires careful con-trol over similarity between training and test examples. We also show that random pairing for gen-erating synthetic negative examples for training and performance evaluation results in models with better generalization performance in comparison to more sophisticated strategies used in existing studies. Furthermore, we have found that our kernel based approach, despite its simple design, exceeds the prediction performance of CPI-NN. We have used the proposed model for compound screening of several proteins including SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Human ACE2 proteins and found strong evidence in support of its top hits.

METHODS: The neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and antibodies targeting nucleocapsid (N), spike protein (S), and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in longitudinal plasma samples from the LOTUS China trial were measured by microneutralization assay and ELISA. Viral load was determined by real-time RT-PCR. A total of 576 plasma and 576 throat swabs were collected from 191 COVID-19 patients. Antibody titers related to adverse outcome and clinical improvement were analysed. Multivariable adjusted generalized linear mixed model for random effects were developed. RESULTS: After day 28 post symptoms onset, the rate of antibody positivity reached 100% for RBD-IgM, 97.8% for S-IgM, 100% for N-IgG, 100% for RBD-IgG, 91.1% for N-IgM and 91.1% for NAbs. The NAbs titers increased over time in both survivors and non-survivors and correlated to IgG antibodies against N, S and RBD, while its presence showed no statistical correlation with death. N-IgG (slope -2.11, 95% CI -3.04 to -1.18, p&0.0001), S-IgG (slope -2.44, 95% CI -3.35 to -1.54, p&0.0001) and RBD-IgG (slope -1.43, 95% CI -1.98 to -0.88, p&0.0001) were negatively correlated with viral load.

METHODS: We conducted a pooled analysis of two prospective cohort studies. The outcomes of interest were in-hospital pulmonary embolism or lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (PE-LDVT), in-hospital nonleg deep vein thrombosis (NLDVT), and 90-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between predefined baseline prognostic factors and PE-LDVT or NLDVT. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between PE-LDVT or NLDVT and 90-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 2208 patients were included. The prevalence of any venous thromboembolism during 3 months before ICU admission was 3.6% (95% CI 2.8C4.4%). Out of 2166 patients, 47 (2.2%; 95% CI 1.6C2.9%) developed PE-LDVT and 38 patients (1.8%; 95% CI 1.2C2.4%) developed NLDVT.

Then we adopted a content analysis method via MAXQDA2020, to analyze the combined application of four different types of policy tools in different stages with 571 texts of epidemic governance policy from the Chinese central government. We also calculated and compared the Chinese public health expenditure between epidemic and non-epidemic periods. Moreover, we also discussed implications for public health emergency management and for infectious disease prevention and control in China. RESULTS: (1) in the incubation stage, the potential epidemic has not attracted enough attention from the government; (2) the combination of the 4 types of policies is not only an important reason in controlling epidemic during the outbreak stage and resolution stage, but also the reason why the small-scale epidemic has not expanded in the stable stage; (3) the increasing Chinese public health expenditure, involving public health emergency treatment (114.81 billion yuan), government hospitals (284.84 billion yuan) and major public health service projects (45.33 billion yuan), is another critical reason for the rapid control of the epidemic.

Currently only few sequences are available from three states in India. Kerala was the first state to deposit complete sequence from two isolates followed by one from Gujarat. On April 27, 2020, the first five sequences from the state of West Bengal (Eastern India) were deposited on GISAID, a global initiative for sharing avian flu data. In this study, we have analysed the spike protein sequences from all five isolates and also compared their similarities or differences with other sequences reported in India and with isolates of Wuhan origin. We report one unique mutation at position 723 and another at 1124 in the S2 domain of spike protein of the isolates from West Bengal only. There was one mutation downstream of the receptor binding domain at position 614 in S1 domain which was common with the sequence from Gujarat (a state of western India). Mutation in the S2 domain showed changes in the secondary structure of the spike protein at region of the mutation. We also studied molecular dynamics using normal mode analyses and found that this mutation decreases the flexibility of S2 domain. Since both S1 and S2 are important in receptor binding followed by entry in the host cells, such mutations may define the affinity or avidity of receptor binding.","output":"Analyses of spike protein from first deposited sequences of SARS-CoV2 from West Bengal, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has prompted the scientific community and the pharmaceutical companies to put maximum efforts into developing vaccines to contain the spread of this disease. Presently, many vaccines have been developed and authorized for use in human beings in different countries. In particular, in Europe to date, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Janssen COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized. All of them are based on a version of the spike (S) glycoprotein characterized at the beginning of the pandemic. However, they differ by their level of efficacy against COVID-19. SARS-COV-2, like other RNA viruses, mutates continually. Genome sequencing analysis shows a nucleotide substitution rate of about 1  10-3 substitutions per year that leads to the emergence of variants through point mutations, insertions, deletions and recombination. There is concern about the ability of the current vaccines to protect against emerging viral variants. Mutations in the S-glycoprotein may affect transmission dynamics and the risk of immune escape. In this review, we address the different technological platforms in use for developing COVID-19 vaccines, the impact of emerging viral variants on virus transmission, hospitalization, and response to current vaccines, as well as rare but important adverse reactions to them. Finally, different methods for measuring antibody response to the vaccines, including the importance of using the WHO International Standard to calibrate immunoassays accurately to an arbitrary unit, to reduce interlaboratory variation and to create a common language for reporting results, are reported.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic: viral variants and vaccine efficacy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the associated COVID-19 pneumonia have dramatically disrupted the delivery of cancer care worldwide. Indeed, this crisis has raised the urge of thoughtfully balancing the risk of delaying potentially curative treatments against the harm of developing a life-threatening respiratory infection. In this study, we report the experience of an Italian Reference Cancer Center, where strict triage procedures had to be promptly adopted. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive cohort of 787 cancer patients (pts) who accessed the Day Hospital (DH) of the Oncology Department of Udine from April 6th to June 19th 2020. Screening NP swabs and RT-PCR analysis were performed at every access in pts who, after passing the triage, were admitted to receive intravenous therapies. Clinicopathological data were collected from electronic health records and include sex, age, tumor type, disease stage, type of treatment, number of swabs received and RT-PCR results. Results: Overall, 2602 NP swabs were performed in a population of 787 cancer pts receiving intravenous therapies, including 55.7% female and 44.3% male pts, respectively, with 54.9% aged 65. Of note, 28.2% of pts had gastrointestinal tumors, 23% breast cancer, 19.8% lung cancer and 14.2% tumors of the genitourinary tract. Approximately 32% of pts had early-stage disease whereas 68% of them was receiving therapies for advanced disease. Treatments most frequently included chemotherapy (60%), immunotherapy (14.7%) and target therapies (9.8%) whereas 11.1% of swabs were performed in pts entering the premises for supportive therapy. The median number of SARS-CoV-2 tests per patient was 3 and 26% of pts received 5 swabs. In the whole population, only 10 SARS-CoV-2 tests (1.3%) resulted positive and were promptly isolated. Conclusions: In the pandemic context, the adoption and gradual refinement of rigorous procedures aimed at minimizing COVID-19 diffusion among pts and healthcare professionals are mandatory to ensure continuity of care. In our experience systematic triage, sequential screening with NP swabs and the prompt identification of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers limited COVID-19 spread among cancer pts accessing the Oncology DH.

While an issue-by-issue vote by all voters would maximize social welfare, we are interested in how well the preferences of the population can be approximated by a small committee. We show that a k-sortition (a random committee of k voters with the majority vote within the committee) leads to an outcome within the factor 1+O(1/k) of the optimal social cost for any number of voters n, any number of issues $m$, and any preference profile. For a small number of issues m, the social cost can be made even closer to optimal by delegation procedures that weigh committee members according to their number of followers. However, for large m, we demonstrate that the k-sortition is the worst-case optimal rule within a broad family of committee-based rules that take into account metric information about the preference profile of the whole population.","output":"Representative Committees of Peers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to analyze if choices made by family businesses (FBs) regarding job stability in economic recessions are different, on average, to those made by nonfamily firms. Moreover, the study tries to elucidate if this potential difference depends on the family generation that is in charge. The analysis relies upon a sample of 55,091 Spanish firms, as Spain is one of the countries that suffered the greatest impact of the 2008 Great Recession.Design/methodology/approachTo test the hypotheses, the authors built a database of 55,091 Spanish firms, 45,351 family firms and 9,740 nonfamily firms, for the period 2007C2015. Based on the socioemotional wealth (SEW) approach, this article sheds light on the question of whether family identification, binding social ties and long-term vision lead FB to behave differently from nonfamily businesses in human resource management.FindingsIn times of crisis, FBs do maintain jobs to a higher extent than nonfamily businesses, and this effect is especially intense when the first generation is in charge. According to the SEW approach, the emotional links between ownership and management make the firm more prudent when hiring during good times and when firing in times of crisis. This makes employment in FBs more stable than in private ones. This result has two positive effects. Higher job stability is an additional contribution of family firms to social welfare and happiness. Furthermore, a larger share of family firms involves stronger automatic macrostabilizers to deal with the business cycle, supplementing fiscal macrostabilizers, such as personal income tax (PIT) or unemployment insurance.Practical implicationsFamily firms maintained employment more than nonfamily firms did during the crisis. The emotional links between ownership and management and the long-term vision make the firm more prudent when hiring during good times and when firing in times of crisis. These features could make family firms more cautious in terms of hiring and firing and thus enable them to offer their employees implicit employment protection and stability. This positive effect decreases as firm age advances, due to the minor linkage between ownership and employees, in spite of maintaining identification and long-term vision.Social implicationsFrom a policy perspective, greater job stability is an additional contribution of family firms to social welfare and happiness. Hence, a larger share of family firms would involve stronger automatic macrostabilizers to deal with the business cycle, supplementing well-known fiscal macrostabilizers such as the PIT or unemployment insurance. The idea of family firms as countercyclical agents linking the micro dimension with the macro dimension becomes more interesting in the present context with the crisis generated by COVID-19.Originality/valueIn addition to contributing to the scarce literature on FB and employment in times of crisis, this paper also considers the generational effect on employment in the economic crisis context from the SEW approach. In addition, sound econometric methodology applied using an extremely large database grounded the results. In contrast with studies in the FB field that have typically focused on large listed firms (Mazzi, 2011), the study relies upon a database of privately held companies, which are more representative of FBs in civil law countries, such as Spain. The Spanish case is particularly interesting because it was one of the OECD countries shocked by the Great Recession. Finally, the authors propose family firms as countercyclical agents linking the micro dimension to the macro dimension.","output":"Do family firms contribute to job stability?

Methods: We enrolled 378 healthcare workers (255 women, 123 men) whose blood samples were collected 91 plus or minus 15 days after the second of two inoculations of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech) given 3 weeks apart. Medical histories and demographic characteristics were recorded using a structured self-reported questionnaire. The relationships between Ab titres and these factors were analysed. Results: Median age (interquartile range [IQR]) of the participants was 44 (32-54) years. Median Ab titre (IQR) against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike antigen was 764 (423-1140) U/mL. Older participants had significantly lower Ab titres; median (IQR) Ab titres were 942 (675-1390) and 1095 (741-1613) U/mL in men and women in their 20s, respectively, but 490 (297-571) and 519 (285-761) U/mL in men and women in their 60s-70s, respectively. In the age-adjusted analysis, the only risk factors for lower Ab titres were male sex and smoking. However, the sex difference may have arisen from the sex difference in smoking rate. Moreover, Ab titres were significantly lower in current smokers than in ex-smokers. Conclusion: The most important factors associated with low Ab titres were age and smoking habit. In particular, current smoking status caused lower Ab titres, and smoking cessation before vaccination may improve the individual efficacy of the BNT162b2 vaccine.","output":"Age and smoking predict antibody titres at 3 months after the second dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a betacoronavirus, and is associated with cytokine storm inflammation and lung injury, leading to respiratory distress.

All model parameters were estimated using the electronic health records of 1362 patients from ProMedica Health System admitted between March 20, 2020 and December 29, 2020 with a positive nasopharyngeal PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, vital signs, and laboratory test results were retrospectively evaluated to infer a patients clinical progression. RESULTS: The association between patient-level covariates and risk of progression was found to be disease state dependent. Specifically, while being male, being Black or having a medical comorbidity were all associated with an increased risk of progressing from the moderate disease state to the severe disease state, these same factors were associated with a decreased risk of progressing from the severe disease state to the deceased state. DISCUSSION: Recent studies have not included analyses of the temporal progression of COVID-19, making the current study a unique modeling-based approach to understand the dynamics of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. CONCLUSION: Dynamic risk stratification models have the potential to improve clinical outcomes not only in COVID-19, but also in a myriad of other acute and chronic diseases that, to date, have largely been assessed only by static modeling techniques.","output":"Dynamic modeling of hospitalized COVID-19 patients reveals disease stateCdependent risk factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has caused a severe pneumonia pandemic worldwide with high morbidity and mortality.

However, current CNNs and attention mechanisms are stochastic in nature and neglect the morphological indicators used by radiologists to manually annotate regions of interest. In this paper, we introduce a channel and spatial wise asymmetric attention (CASPIAN) by leveraging the inherent structure of tumors to detect regions of saliency. To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed layer, we integrate this into a well-established convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to achieve higher Dice scores, with less GPU resources. Also, we investigate the inclusion of auxiliary multiscale and multiplanar attention branches to increase the spatial context crucial in semantic segmentation tasks. The resulting architecture is the new CASPIANET++, which achieves Dice Scores of 91.19%, 87.6% and 81.03% for whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor respectively. Furthermore, driven by the scarcity of brain tumor data, we investigate the Noisy Student method for segmentation tasks. Our new Noisy Student Curriculum Learning paradigm, which infuses noise incrementally to increase the complexity of the training images exposed to the network, further boosts the enhancing tumor region to 81.53%.

We also investigated whether there were any changes in clinical characteristics of acute appendicitis before and after vaccination against the coronavirus. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who were diagnosed with acute appendicitis at our institution between March 1, 2019, and August 31, 2021. We divided the patients into three groups (pre-pandemic, before vaccination, and after vaccination) and analyzed the clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The time from symptom onset to hospital arrival and the time from symptom onset to operation increased during the COVID-19 pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic period. The rate of complicated appendicitis during the pandemic was higher than that before the pandemic. In addition, the number of new daily cases showed a positive correlation with the time from symptom onset to hospital arrival (OR, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.04; P < 0.001) and complicated appendicitis (OR, 1.002; 95% CI, 1.001C1.002; P = 0.0017).

METHODS: Otolaryngology patients were prospectively enrolled in an outpatient, cross\\\\sectional study. Demographic information and clinic room characteristics were recorded. A scanning mobility particle sizer and GRIMM aerosol monitor measured aerosols 14.3 nm to 34 m in diameter (i.e., particles smaller than those currently examined in the literature) during (1) nasal endoscopy ( debridement) and (2) no nasal endoscopy encounters.

RESULTS: Sixty\\\\two patients met inclusion criteria (25 nasal endoscopy without debridement; 18 nasal endoscopy with debridement; 19 no nasal endoscopy). There was no significant difference in age or gender across cohorts.

Thus here we collected 2,142 high-quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 160 regions in over 50 countries and reconstructed their phylogeny, and also analyzed the interaction between the polymorphisms of spike protein and human ACE2 (hACE2). Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus in other hosts show SARS-CoV-2 is highly possible originated from Bat-CoV (RaTG13) found in horseshoe bat and a recombination event may occur on the spike protein of Pangolin-CoV to imbue it the ability to infect humans.

Our previous work with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like viruses argued that bats already harbor CoVs with the ability to infect humans without adaptation. These results suggested that additional barriers limit the emergence of zoonotic CoV. In this work, we describe overcoming host restriction of two Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-like bat CoVs using exogenous protease treatment. We found that the spike protein of PDF2180-CoV, a MERS-like virus found in a Ugandan bat, could mediate infection of Vero and human cells in the presence of exogenous trypsin. We subsequently show that the bat virus spike can mediate the infection of human gut cells but is unable to infect human lung cells. Using receptor-blocking antibodies, we show that infection with the PDF2180 spike does not require MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 and antibodies developed against the MERS spike receptor-binding domain and S2 portion are ineffective in neutralizing the PDF2180 chimera. Finally, we found that the addition of exogenous trypsin also rescues HKU5-CoV, a second bat group 2c CoV. Together, these results indicate that proteolytic cleavage of the spike, not receptor binding, is the primary infection barrier for these two group 2c CoVs. Coupled with receptor binding, proteolytic activation offers a new parameter to evaluate the emergence potential of bat CoVs and offers a means to recover previously unrecoverable zoonotic CoV strains. IMPORTANCE Overall, our studies demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage is the primary barrier to infection for a subset of zoonotic coronaviruses. Moving forward, the results argue that both receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage of the spike are critical factors that must be considered for evaluating the emergence potential and risk posed by zoonotic coronaviruses. In addition, the findings also offer a novel means to recover previously uncultivable zoonotic coronavirus strains and argue that other tissues, including the digestive tract, could be a site for future coronavirus emergence events in humans.","output":"Trypsin treatment unlocks barrier for zoonotic bat coronavirus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The theme of my Editor's Notes in 2021 is I Fostering a GREAT Place for Student Success: Five Critical Components for Institutions i Introduction, reinforcement, and assessment of student achievement of these learning goals involves various assessment methods and approaches, along with direct and indirect evidence of learning Fostering a GREAT Place for Student Success: Critical Component #1, Graduate Our Students and Prepare Them for Post-degree Roles and Contexts [Extracted from the article] Copyright of Assessment Update is the property of John Wiley & Sons, Inc and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Fostering a GREAT Place for Student Success: Critical Component #1, Graduate Our Students and Prepare Them for Post\\\\degree Roles and Contexts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: At the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic there was widespread concern about potentially overwhelming demand for intensive care and the need for intensive care unit (ICU) triage. In March 2020, a draft United Kingdom (UK) guideline proposed a decision-support tool (DST). We sought to evaluate the accuracy of the tool in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively identified patients in two groups: referred and not referred to intensive care in a single UK national health service (NHS) trust in April 2020. Age, Clinical Frailty Scale score (CFS), and co-morbidities were collected from patients records and recorded, along with ceilings of treatment and outcome. We compared the DST, CFS, and age alone as predictors of mortality, and treatment ceiling decisions. Results: In total, 151 patients were included in the analysis, with 75 in the ICU and 76 in the non-ICU-reviewed groups. Age, clinical frailty and DST score were each associated with increased mortality and higher likelihood of treatment limitation (p-values all <.001). A DST cut-off score of >8 had 65% (95% confidence interval (CI) 51%-79%) sensitivity and 63% (95% CI 54%-72%) specificity for predicting mortality. It had a sensitivity of 80% (70%-88%) and specificity of 96% (95% CI 90%-100%) for predicting treatment limitation. The DST was more discriminative than age alone (p<0.001), and potentially more discriminative than CFS (p=0.08) for predicting treatment ceiling decisions. Conclusions: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, in a hospital without severe resource limitations, a hypothetical decision support tool was limited in its predictive value for mortality, but appeared to be sensitive and specific for predicting treatment limitation.","output":"Evaluation of a hypothetical decision-support tool for intensive care triage of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 52-year-old woman was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia. Treatment with dasatinib, a second-generation Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was initiated, and complete cytogenetic remission was achieved. Two years later, proteinuria occurred, and the urinary protein level increased gradually in the next 3 years. Moreover, the serum creatinine level increased mildly during this period. The urinary protein level reached 2.18 g/gCr; hence, a renal biopsy was conducted. Light microscopy revealed mild proliferation of mesangial cells, and immunofluorescence analysis revealed IgG and C3 depositions in the mesangial area. Electron microscopy revealed electron-dense deposition in the paramesangial area, partial podocyte foot process effacement, and segmental endothelial cell swelling with a slight expansion of the subendothelial space. Dasatinib was discontinued, and within 3 weeks, the proteinuria disappeared, with improvements in her renal function. After switching to bosutinib, a new second-generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor, the proteinuria remained negative. The rapid cessation of proteinuria following dasatinib discontinuation indicated that proteinuria was induced by the long-term administration of dasatinib.

This level will only grow as the provinces grapple with the pandemic and its fiscal effects. Some believe surging provincial debts have brought Canadian federalism to a critical juncture: they have greatly increased the odds of federal measures to stabilize provincial finances. This article assesses this claim. The cleanest and most balanced path to fiscal sustainability is a combination of enhanced federal transfers, which would bolster provincial fiscal capacity, and national fiscal rules, which would constrain provincial borrowing. But the former is unlikely to restore sustainability on its own, and the latter would require a severe provincial debt crisis, which Canada's existing fiscal federal structures can avoid. COVID-19 has increased the odds of certain reforms, and it is difficult to predict their long-run effects. But any obvious paths to fiscal sustainability remain hidden.","output":"COVID-19, Fiscal Federalism and Provincial Debt: Have We Reached a Critical Juncture?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The long-term effect of a complicated course of COVID-19 on echocardiography (EchoCG) parameters, in particular on left heart, has not been sufficiently studied. Purpose: To compare EchoCG parameters of left heart in patients with proven COVID-19 pneumonia 3 months and one year after discharge. Methods: The patients were identified according to the data of the medical information system of the monohospital from April 2020 to July 2021 within the framework of 'One-year Cardiac Follow-up of COVID-19 Pneumonia'. A total of 116 men and women were included, mean age 49  14.4 years, females 49.6%. During hospitalization, chest computed tomography detected mild lesions in 31.3%, moderate lesions in 33.3%, severe lesions in 29.3% and critical lesions in 6.1%. All patients underwent clinical examination including transthoracic EchoCG with 3 months  2 weeks and one year  3 weeks after discharge. All images were digitally stored and analyzed using off-line post processing with TomTec (Philips). The LV global and segmental longitudinal strain (LS) were studied in 100 individuals with satisfactory visualization quality 3 month after discharge and in 81 individuals one year after discharge. Results: During the observation, the average body mass index of the subjects increased (28.7  5.8 kg/m2 3 months after discharge vs 29.4  6.1% one year after discharge, p < 0.001), as well as the rate of cardiovascular diseases (67% 3 months after discharge versus 79% one year after discharge, p = 0.008). Significant dynamics of mean left heart EchoCG parameters were observed. The mean index of left atrium (LA) maximal volume decreased (26.0  7.2 vs 25.3  7.4, p = 0.015), index of LA minimal volume increased (9.9  5.4 vs 10.8  5.6 ml/m2, p = 0.011). Left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic, end-systolic and stroke volume indexes decreased (49.3  11.3 vs 46.9  9.9 ml/m2, p = 0.008;16.0  5.6 vs 14.4  4.1 ml/m2, p = 0.001;36.7  12.8 vs 30.8  8.1 ml/m2, p < 0,001, respectively). The LV myocardial mass index increased (70.0 [60.8-84.0] vs 75.4 [68.2-84.9] g/m2, p = 0.024). LV ejection fraction increased (68.1  5.3 vs 69.7  4.6%, p = 0.013). The LV global LS (-20.3  2.2 vs -19.4  2.7%, p = 0.001) and the LV segmental LS worsened: in mid segments (antero-septal -21.1  3.3 vs -20.4  4.1%, p = 0.039;inferior -21.0  2.7 vs -20.0  2.9%, p = 0.039;lateral -18.4  3.7 vs -17.6  4.4%, p = 0.021), and in apical segments (anterior -22.3  5.0 vs -20.8  5.2%, p = 0.006;inferior -24.6  4.9 vs -22.7  4.6, p = 0.003;lateral -22.7  4.5 vs -20.4  4.8%, p < 0.001;septal -25.3  4.2 vs -23.1  4,4%, p < 0.001;apical -23.7  4.1 vs -21.8  4.1%, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Compared to 3 month after discharge, in patients one year after COVID-19 pneumonia the LA maximal volume, LV end-diastolic, end-systolic and stroke volumes decrease, and the LV ejection fraction increased.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old male, returning from Spain, presented with complaints of fever, and cough, and class-II obesity, being hospitalized. The respiratory viruses and bacteria tested by FilmArray(?) PCR were negative. Two days later, clarithromycin was started because the patient was suspected as community-acquired pneumonia. At the third day, the rRT-PCR confirmed the SARS-CoV-2 infection. A day later, chloroquine was started because of that. His chest computed tomography was performed and showed bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities with consolidation, which suggested viral pneumonia as a differential diagnosis. Progressively his clinical condition improved and at day 9, patient rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 became negative. The patient was discharged and isolated at home per 14 days.

In immunocompetent patients, histoplasmosis is generally mild or asymptomatic unless there is inhalation of a large inoculum. Below, we present a case of severe acute pulmonary histoplasmosis in an otherwise healthy, immunocompetent person and discuss the diagnostic challenges it presented during the COVID-19 pandemic. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old non-smoking Caucasian man with hypertension presented to our hospital with 1 week duration of headache, dyspnea, productive cough and high fever. He was admitted with a provisional diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and started on dexamethasone and empiric antibiotics. He had elevated inflammatory markers. Chest x-ray showed diffuse bilateral interstitial and alveolar opacities. CT chest demonstrated numerous clustered ground glass nodular opacities bilaterally with mediastinal and hilar adenopathy. Subsequently, RT-PCR for SARS-CoV2 returned negative. The patient continued to deteriorate clinically over the next few days. Repeat imaging showed diffuse micronodules with mediastinal adenopathy. Upon further questioning, the patient recalled demolishing a chimney at his parents' house in Michigan 2 weeks prior to admission. The differential diagnosis was broadened to include acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis and fungal infection. BAL, transbronchial biopsies and EBUS-TBNA was performed while escalating steroids. The lung biopsy confirmed Histoplasma. Urine Histoplasma antigen returned positive. The patient was treated with itraconazole with an overlap of steroids for 2 weeks upon discharge. He was readmitted within a week with worsening hypoxia and worsening infiltrates on lung imaging. He was then treated with liposomal amphotericin with gradual clinical improvement. Follow-up 1 month post discharge revealed complete clinical and radiologic resolution. DISCUSSION: Viral pneumonia and acute pulmonary histoplasmosis have overlapping clinical and radiologic features which can make diagnosis challenging. COVID-19 pneumonia typically presents with peripheral ground glass opacities with or without superimposed consolidations. Invasive fungal pneumonia can have a similar appearance on CT usually with additional findings of hilar and mediastinal adenopathy. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the challenges involved in diagnosing acute pulmonary histoplasmosis in an immunocompetent individual in the midst of the pandemic. Clinicians should always maintain a wide differential diagnosis to avoid diagnostic delay.

Shortly before the pandemic turned the world upside down, one of the most pressing issues in global tourism was a phenomenon that became known as overtourism. It describes massively the negative impacts of tourism on destinations and the frustrated residents protesting against it, with discontent reaching a dimension that could hardly be estimated at the time when Doxeys Irritation Index was created. Especially in southern European destinations, thousands of people have taken to the streets over their dissatisfaction with the unlimited growth of tourism and its negative effects on their daily lives. Within a few years, small neighbourhood actions morphed into coordinated social movements demanding that politicians make fundamental changes to the socio-economic system. Those events demonstrate a politicizing effect of tourism that has not sufficiently been addressed hitherto in tourism research, which is mainly focused on the attitude of the visited towards tourism itself. This article offers a broader socio-political approach that focuses on tourism as one of the largest industries within a capitalist system that has massive impacts on peoples lives, rather than simply on changing attitudes towards tourism. Twelve problem-centred interviews with actors of the anti-overtourism movements in the Balearic Island of Mallorca were conducted to examine the effects of overtourism and COVID-19-caused tourism breakdown on residents socio-political perspectives. Building on the transformative learning theory developed by the American sociologist Jack Mezirow, the analysis of the data revealed far-reaching influences on residents personal development, fundamental perspectives and professional decisions.","output":"Transformative Effects of Overtourism and COVID-19-Caused Reduction of Tourism on ResidentsAn Investigation of the Anti-Overtourism Movement on the Island of Mallorca"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lactoperoxidase (1.11.1.7, LPO) is a mammalian heme peroxidase found in the extracellular fluids of mammals including plasma, saliva, airway epithelial lining fluids, nasal lining fluid, milk, tears, gastric juices and intestinal mucosa. To perform it's innate immune action against invading microbes, LPO utilizes hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) to convert thiocyanate (SCN) and iodide (I) ions into the oxidizing compounds hypothiocyanite (OSCN) and hypoiodite (IO). Previously determined structures of the complexes of LPO with SCN, OSCN and I show that SCN and I occupy appropriate positions in the distal heme cavity as substrates while OSCN may be bound in this cavity as a product inhibitor. We report here the structure of the complex of LPO with IO as the first structural evidence of the conversion of iodide into hypoiodite by LPO. To obtain this complex a solution of LPO was first incubated with H2 O2, then mixed with ammonium iodide solution and the complex crystallized by the addition of PEG-3350, 20% (w/v). These crystals were used for X-ray intensity data collection and structure analysis. The structure determination revealed the presence of four hypoiodite ions in the substrate binding channel of LPO. In addition to these, six other hypoiodite ions were observed at different exterior sites. We surmise that the presence of hypoiodite ions in the distal heme cavity blocks the substrate binding site and inhibits catalysis. This was confirmed by activity experiments with the colorimetric substrate, ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-sulfonic acid), in the presence of hypoiodite and iodide ions.

While variants and waning efficacy are relevant, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines reduce the risk of infection, transmission, and severe illness/hospitalization in adults. Thus, higher vaccination levels are beneficial by reducing healthcare system pressures and societal fear. However, the benefits of excluding unvaccinated people are unknown. MethodsA method to evaluate the benefits of excluding unvaccinated people to reduce transmissions is described, called the number needed to exclude (NNE). The NNE is analogous to the number needed to treat (NNT=1/ARR), except the absolute risk reduction (ARR) is the baseline transmission risk in the population for a setting (e.g., healthcare). The rationale for the NNE is that exclusion removes all unvaccinated people from a setting, such that the ARR is the baseline transmission risk for that type of setting, which depends on the secondary attack rate (SAR) typically observed in that type of setting and the baseline infection risk in the population. The NNE is the number of unvaccinated people who need to be excluded from a setting to prevent one transmission event from unvaccinated people in that type of setting. The NNE accounts for the transmissibility of the currently dominant Delta (B.1.617.2) variant to estimate the minimum NNE in six types of settings: households, social gatherings, casual close contacts, work/study places, healthcare, and travel/transportation. The NNE can account for future potentially dominant variants (e.g., Omicron, B.1.1.529). To assist societies and policymakers in their decision-making about VMVP, the NNEs were calculated using the current (mid-to-end November 2021) baseline infection risk in many countries. FindingsThe NNEs suggest that at least 1,000 unvaccinated people likely need to be excluded to prevent one SARS-CoV-2 transmission event in most types of settings for many jurisdictions, notably Australia, California, Canada, China, France, Israel, and others. The NNEs of almost every jurisdiction examined are well within the range of the NNTs of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) ([] 250 to 333). This is important since ASA is not recommended for primary prevention of CVD because the harms outweigh the benefits. Similarly, the harms of exclusion may outweigh the benefits. These findings depend on the accuracy of the model assumptions and the baseline infection risk estimates. ConclusionsVaccines are beneficial, but the high NNEs suggest that excluding unvaccinated people has negligible benefits for reducing transmissions in many jurisdictions across the globe. This is because unvaccinated people are likely not at significant risk - in absolute terms - of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to others in most types of settings since current baseline transmission risks are negligible. Consideration of the harms of exclusion is urgently needed, including staffing shortages from losing unvaccinated healthcare workers, unemployment/unemployability, financial hardship for unvaccinated people, and the creation of a class of citizens who are not allowed to fully participate in many areas of society.

This form included musculoskeletal symptoms and other COVID-19 symptoms. Considering all symptoms (musculoskeletal and other), 100.0%, 86.7%, and 72.0% of patients reported one or more symptoms, at hospitalization, 2-week, and 1-month, respectively. Considering only musculoskeletal symptoms, 92.3%, 72.7%, and 56.3% of patients reported any musculoskeletal symptom at hospitalization, 2-week, and 1-month, respectively. The musculoskeletal symptoms were fatigue (44.3% of patients reported), back pain (22.7%), arthralgia (22.0%), myalgia (21.0%), low back pain (16.3%), and neck pain (10.3%); the other symptoms were shortness of breath (26.3%), loss of taste (15.0%), cough (14.0%), loss of smell (12.3%), loss of appetite (10.3%), headache (8.7%), sore throat (3.0%), diarrhea (1.3%), dizziness (1.3%), and fever (0.3%) at 1-month. Increasing BMI was associated with higher odds of persistence of fatigue (OR: 1.08, 1.03 to 1.13), myalgia (OR: 1.08, 1.01 to 1.14), and arthralgia (OR: 1.07, 1.02 to 1.14, p = 0.012) at 1-month.

Through a systematic comparison of 351,525 full viral genome sequences collected during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, we reveal the spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. Unlike those of other viruses, the mutational spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits extreme asymmetry, with a much higher rate of C>U than U>C substitutions, as well as a higher rate of G>U than U>G substitutions. This suggests directional genome sequence evolution during transmission. The substantial asymmetry and directionality of the mutational spectrum enable pseudotemporal tracing of SARS-CoV-2 without prior information about the root sequence, collection time, and sampling region. This shows that the viral genome sequences collected in Asia are similar to the original genome sequence. Adjusted estimation of the dN/dS ratio accounting for the asymmetrical mutational spectrum also shows evidence of negative selection on viral genes, consistent with previous reports. Our findings provide deep insights into the mutational processes in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and advance the understanding of the history and future evolution of the virus.","output":"Mutational spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 during the global pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Group testing refers to the process of testing pooled samples to reduce the total number of tests. Given the current pandemic, and the shortage of test supplies for COVID-19, group testing can play a critical role in time and cost efficient diagnostics. In many scenarios, samples collected from users are also accompanied with auxiliary information (such as demographics, history of exposure, onset of symptoms). Such auxiliary information may differ across patients, and is typically not considered while designing group testing algorithms. In this paper, we abstract such heterogeneity using a model where the population can be categorized into clusters with different prevalence rates. The main result of this work is to show that exploiting knowledge heterogeneity can further improve the efficiency of group testing. Motivated by the practical constraints and diagnostic considerations, we focus on two-stage group testing algorithms, where in the first stage, the goal is to detect as many negative samples by pooling, whereas the second stage involves individual testing to detect any remaining samples. For this class of algorithms, we prove that the gain in efficiency is related to the concavity of the number of tests as a function of the prevalence. We also show how one can choose the optimal pooling parameters for one of the algorithms in this class, namely, doubly constant pooling. We present lower bounds on the average number of tests as a function of the population heterogeneity profile, and also provide numerical results and comparisons.

Closures included pain management departments where many staff were redeployed. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 on chronic pain services in the Republic of Ireland. METHODS: An online survey was sent to pain consultants working in public hospitals in the Republic of Ireland between the 22nd and 28th September 2020. RESULTS: We received responses from 18 consultants from all 15 public hospitals in the Republic of Ireland with chronic pain services. Procedural volume during lockdown fell to 26% of pre-COVID levels. This had recovered somewhat by the time of the survey to 71%. Similarly, in-person outpatient clinic volume fell to 10% of per-COVID numbers and recovered to 50%. On average, 39% of public hospital activity was made up for by the availability of private hospitals. This varied significantly across the country. The use of telemedicine increased significantly during the pandemic. Before COVID, on average, 13% of outpatient clinic volume was composed of telephone or video consultations. This increased to 46% at the time of the survey.

In addition to its fundamental importance in basic research, this class of biomolecules has recently become the first approved Covid vaccine, underscoring its utility in medical applications.Eukaryotic mRNA is heavily processed, including the 5' cap as the primary hallmark. This 5' cap protects mRNA from degradation by exoribonucleases but also interacts specifically with several proteins and enzymes to ensure mRNA turnover and processing, like splicing, export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and initiation of translation. The absence of a 5' cap leads to a strong immune response, and the methylation status contributes to distinguishing self from non-self RNA.Non-natural modifications of the 5' cap provide an avenue to label mRNAs and make them accessible to analyses, which is important to study their cellular localization, trafficking, and binding partners. They bear potential to engineer mRNAs, e.g., more stable or immunogenic mRNAs that are still translated, by impacting select interactions in a distinct manner. The modification of the 5' cap itself is powerful as it can be applied to make long mRNAs (a1000 nt, not directly accessible by solid-phase synthesis) by in vitro transcription.This Account describes our contribution to the field of chemo-enzymatic modification of mRNA at the 5' cap. Our approach relies on RNA methyltransferases (MTases) with promiscuous activity on analogues of their natural cosubstrate S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet). We will describe how RNA MTases in combination with non-natural cosubstrates provide access to site-specific modification of different positions of the 5' cap, namely, the N2 and N7 position of guanosine and the N6 position of adenosine as the transcription start nucleotide (TSN) and exemplify strategies to make long mRNAs with modified 5' caps.We will compare the chemical and enzymatic synthesis of the AdoMet analogues used for this purpose. We could overcome previous limitations in methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) substrate scope by engineering variants (termed PC-MATs) with the ability to convert methionine analogues with benzylic and photocaging groups at the sulfonium ion.The final part of this Account will highlight applications of the modified mRNAs. Like in many chemo-enzymatic approaches, a versatile strategy is to install small functional groups enzymatically and use them as handles in subsequent bioorthogonal reactions. We showed fluorescent labeling of mRNAs via different types of click chemistry in vitro and in cells. In a second line of applications, we used the handles to make mRNAs amenable for analyses, most notably next-generation sequencing. In the case of extremely promiscuous enzymes, the direct installation of photo-cross-linking groups was successful also and provided a way to covalently bind protein-interaction partners. Finally, the non-natural modifications of mRNAs can also modulate the properties of mRNAs. Propargylation of Am as the transcription start nucleotide at its N6 position maintained the translation of mRNAs but increased their immunogenicity. The installation of photocaging groups provides a way to revert these effects and control interactions by light.","output":"Chemo-Enzymatic Modification of the 5' Cap To Study mRNAs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: COVID-19 patients on anti-CD20 treatment can suffer a delayed viral clearance and worse clinical outcome. We aim to present our experience with remdesivir treatment in anti-CD20-treated patients with prolonged symptoms, a patient population for which no data from randomized controlled trials are available. METHODS: From the beginning of the pandemic until February 2021, we included all consecutive patients from our healthcare network on anti-CD20 treatment with prolonged COVID-19 symptoms, who received remdesivir. Patient informed consent was gathered and patients charts were reviewed to collect baseline data, COVID-19 history including time of symptom onset, diagnosis, data on treatment and disease course. Patients or their next of kin were contacted in March 2022 to assess long-term outcomes. RESULTS: We included 11 patients, who received remdesivir at a median of 33 days after diagnosis. Eight patients showed clinical improvement along with reductions in viral loads, one patient with relapsing infection recovered after administration of convalescent plasma, and two patients died. No clinical relapses were reported (median follow-up 13 months), while follow-up PCRs were not performed. One patient died of underlying malignancy 8 months after recovery from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a benefit of antiviral therapy in a majority of COVID-19 patients on anti-CD20 treatment, without any clinical relapses in the 1-year follow-up. Although these data suggest that remdesivir might be a promising management option in patients with delayed viral clearance, the lack of a control group is an important limitation of the study design.

(2) What are the adverse events and unintended consequences of hard-stop alerts? (3) How do hard-stop alerts compare to soft-stop alerts? Methods and Materials Studies evaluating computerized hard-stop alerts in healthcare settings were identified from biomedical and computer science databases, gray literature sites, reference lists, and reviews.

However, up to May 2020, there has been a lack of information about the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents and staff in care homes and limited testing in this setting. RESULTS: Overall, the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 6.5% with a higher rate in residents (9.0%) than in staff (4.7%). A key finding was the high proportion of asymptomatic infection detected in staff (69%) and residents (51%) with evidence of under-detection of symptoms by care home staff. CONCLUSIONS: The high proportion of asymptomatic infection combined with under detection of symptoms by care home staff indicates that offering a test to all residents and staff in care homes with rapid reporting of results would assist accurate identification of infected individuals, facilitating prompt infection prevention and control action. METHODS: Combined nose and throat swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was carried out in 2455 residents and staff across 37 care homes in the London Borough of Bromley across a three-week period.

Due to the dynamics of COVID-19 where many infected people are not showing symptoms or showing mild symptoms, and where different countries are employing different testing strategies, it is quite difficult to calculate the R, while the pandemic is still widespread. This paper presents a probabilistic methodology to evaluate the effective reproduction number by considering only the daily death statistics of a given country. The methodology utilizes a linearly constrained Quadratic Programming scheme to estimate the daily new infection cases from the daily death statistics, based on the probability distribution of delays associated with symptom onset and to reporting a death. The proposed methodology is validated in-silico by simulating an infectious disease through a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. The results suggest that with a reasonable estimate of distribution of delay to death from the onset of symptoms, the model can provide accurate estimates of R. The proposed method is then used to estimate the R values for two countries.","output":"Probabilistic approximation of effective reproduction number of COVID-19 using daily death statistics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In a pilot study, naratriptan was significantly more effective than placebo in preventing menstrually related migraine (MRM) when given as 1 mg twice daily for 5 days beginning 2 days before the predicted onset of MRM for up to 4 menstrual cycles. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of naratriptan for short-term prevention of MRM in 2 large, identically designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies. METHODS MRM was defined as any migraine beginning during the perimenstrual period (PMP). By definition, the PMP consisted of Days -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, and 4, with Day 1 being the first day of menstrual flow. Adult women were eligible if they reported a history of MRM, had regular menstrual cycles, and could predict within 2 days both the onset of menstrual flow and MRM. The studies comprised a baseline phase and a treatment phase. During the baseline phase, patients prophylactically treated their first PMP after the screening visit with single-blind placebo. Patients who documented an MRM while receiving placebo were eligible for the treatment phase. During the treatment phase, patients were randomized to receive either naratriptan 1 mg twice daily or placebo beginning 3 days before the predicted onset of MRM for a total of 6 days for 4 PMPs or 6 months, whichever occurred sooner. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean percentage of treated PMPs without MRM per patient. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the percentage of patients who were free of MRM during all treated PMPs, the median number of days with MRM over 4 PMPs, and patient satisfaction. Safety and tolerability measures included adverse events, standard clinical laboratory tests, and vital signs. RESULTS The intent-to-treat population was 287 in Study 1 (149 in the naratriptan group and 138 in the placebo group) and 346 in Study 2 (173 in each treatment group). Approximately 20% of randomized patients in each treatment group in Study 1 and 10% in each treatment group in Study 2 withdrew prematurely from the studies over the 4-month treatment period. The mean percentage of PMPs without MRM per patient was 38% and 34% among naratriptan-treated patients treating at least 1 PMP compared with 29% and 24% among placebo-treated patients in each respective study (P < .05 naratriptan vs placebo for both studies). Efficacy of naratriptan did not vary as a function of age, use of oral contraceptives, or use of migraine prophylaxis. More patients who had received naratriptan reported attacks posttreatment compared to patients who had received placebo. Among patients treating at least 1 PMP, the percentage of patients with no MRM in any treated PMP was significantly (P < .05) higher in the naratriptan group (11%; 19/173) than the placebo group (3%; 6 of 173) in Study 2. There were no differences in the percentages of patients with no MRM in any treated PMP in Study 1. The number of MRM days per patient across 4 PMPs was significantly lower in the naratriptan group than in the placebo group in both studies (median 5.0 days vs 6.5 days in Study 1 [P= .005] and 5.3 days vs 6.0 days in Study 2 [P= .018]). Significantly more patients receiving naratriptan were satisfied with the ability of naratriptan to control MRM either by preventing their occurrence or reducing their severity or duration compared with patients receiving placebo. No single drug-related adverse event was reported by more than 2% of patients in a treatment group in either study, and no serious drug-related adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS Naratriptan 1 mg twice daily for 6 days per month is effective and well tolerated when used for short-term prevention of MRM. More patients receiving naratriptan than placebo were satisfied with treatment. The observed increase in posttreatment attacks needs further study.","output":"Efficacy and tolerability of naratriptan for short-term prevention of menstrually related migraine: data from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has followed complex pathways, largely attributed to the high virus infectivity, human travel patterns, and the implementation of multiple mitigation measures.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study ran from April 1 to May 12, 2020, and consisted of all consecutively admitted patients to the Radboud university medical centre nursing ward for COVID-19. Laboratory assessment included high-sensitivity Troponin T and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Echocardiographic evaluation focused on left and right ventricular systolic function and global longitudinal strain (GLS). RESULTS: In total, 51 patients were included, with a median age of 63 years (range 51-68 years) of whom 80% was male. Troponin T was elevated (>14a?ng/l) in 47%, and a clinically relevant Troponin T elevation (10a? URL) was found in three patients (6%). NT-proBNP was elevated (>300a?pg/ml) in 24 patients (47%), and in four (8%) the NT-proBNP concentration was >1,000a?pg/ml. Left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction <52% and/or GLS >-18%) was observed in 27%, while right ventricular dysfunction (TAPSE <17a?mm and/or RV S'a?< 10a?cm/s) was seen in 10%. There was no association between elevated Troponin T or NT-proBNP and left or right ventricular dysfunction. Patients with confirmed pulmonary embolism had normal right ventricular function. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalised patients, it seems that COVID-19 predominantly affects the respiratory system, while cardiac dysfunction occurs less often.

Infoveillance approaches using social media can help characterize disease distribution and public knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors critical to the early stages of an outbreak. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to conduct a quantitative and qualitative assessment of Chinese social media posts originating in Wuhan City on the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Chinese-language messages from Wuhan were collected for 39 days between December 23, 2019, and January 30, 2020, on Weibo. For quantitative analysis, the total daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan were obtained from the Chinese National Health Commission, and a linear regression model was used to determine if Weibo COVID-19 posts were predictive of the number of cases reported. Qualitative content analysis and an inductive manual coding approach were used to identify parent classifications of news and user-generated COVID-19 topics. RESULTS: A total of 115,299 Weibo posts were collected during the study time frame consisting of an average of 2956 posts per day (minimum 0, maximum 13,587). Quantitative analysis found a positive correlation between the number of Weibo posts and the number of reported cases from Wuhan, with approximately 10 more COVID-19 cases per 40 social media posts (P<.001). This effect size was also larger than what was observed for the rest of China excluding Hubei Province (where Wuhan is the capital city) and held when comparing the number of Weibo posts to the incidence proportion of cases in Hubei Province. Qualitative analysis of 11,893 posts during the first 21 days of the study period with COVID-19-related posts uncovered four parent classifications including Weibo discussions about the causative agent of the disease, changing epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak, public reaction to outbreak control and response measures, and other topics. Generally, these themes also exhibited public uncertainty and changing knowledge and attitudes about COVID-19, including posts exhibiting both protective and higher-risk behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide initial insight into the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of Chinese social media data at the initial epicenter in Wuhan City. Future studies should continue to explore the utility of social media data to predict COVID-19 disease severity, measure public reaction and behavior, and evaluate effectiveness of outbreak communication.","output":"Data Mining and Content Analysis of the Chinese Social Media Platform Weibo During the Early COVID-19 Outbreak: Retrospective Observational Infoveillance Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Foreign Exchange (FOREX) is a decentralised global market for exchanging currencies.

The number of cases and deaths will remain escalating due to the lack of effective therapeutic agents. Several studies have established the importance of the viral main protease (Mpro) in the replication of SARS-CoV-2 which makes it an attractive target for antiviral drug development, including pharmaceutical repurposing and other medicinal chemistry approaches. Identification of natural products with considerable inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 could be beneficial as a rapid and potent alternative with drug-likeness by comparison to de novo antiviral drug discovery approaches. Thereof, we carried out the structure-based screening of natural products from Echinacea-angustifolia, commonly used to prevent cold and other microbial respiratory infections, targeting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Four natural products namely, Echinacoside, Quercetagetin 7-glucoside, Levan N, Inulin from chicory, and 1,3-Dicaffeoylquinic acid, revealed significant docking energy (>-10 kcal/mol) in the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro catalytic pocket via substantial intermolecular contacts formation against co-crystallized ligand (<-4 kcal/mol). Furthermore, the docked poses of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with selected natural products showed conformational stability through molecular dynamics. Exploring the end-point net binding energy exhibited substantial contribution of Coulomb and van der Waals interactions to the stability of respective docked conformations. These results advocated the natural products from Echinacea angustifolia for further experimental studies with an elevated probability to discover the potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro antagonist with higher

Paired t-tests were performed to compare the participants quality of life before and after the outbreak of COVID-19. Multivariable linear regression models with a backward elimination stepwise process determined the parameters that significantly correlated with self-reported wellness and health. Results: Of the 200 healthcare workers who participated in this study, 119 (60%) were female and 81 (40%) were male, with a mean (SD) age of 28.8 (5.9) years. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly changed many lifestyle factors compared to the pre-pandemic states. The scores of sleep quality, mood status, pre-planned physical activity and social activity were reduced by 30%, 40%, 50% and 70%, respectively.

Forthcoming large international events will expose female athletes to hot environments, and studies evaluating aerobic exercise performance in such environments across the menstrual cycle are sparse, with mixed findings. We have identified that autonomic heat loss responses at rest and during fixed-intensity exercise in well-trained women are not affected by menstrual cycle phase, but differ between dry and humid heat. Furthermore, exercise performance is not different across the menstrual cycle, yet is lower in humid heat, in conjunction with reduced evaporative cooling. Menstrual cycle phase does not appear to affect exercise performance in the heat in well-trained women, but humidity impairs performance, probably due to reduced evaporative power. ABSTRACT We studied thermoregulatory responses of ten well-trained [V?O2 max , 57 (7) ml min-1 kg-1 ] eumenorrheic women exercising in dry and humid heat, across their menstrual cycle. They completed four trials, each of resting and cycling at fixed intensities (125 and 150 W), to assess autonomic regulation, then self-paced intensity (30 min work trial), to assess behavioural regulation. Trials were in early-follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases in dry (DRY) and humid (HUM) heat matched for wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT, 27C). During rest and fixed-intensity exercise, rectal temperature was 0.2C higher in ML than EF (P < 0.01) independent of environment (P = 0.66). Mean skin temperature did not differ between menstrual phases (P  0.13) but was higher in DRY than HUM (P < 0.01). Local sweat rate and/or forearm blood flow differed as a function of menstrual phase and environment (interaction: P  0.01). Exercise performance did not differ between phases [EF: 257 (37), ML: 255 (43) kJ, P = 0.62], but was 7 (9)% higher in DRY than HUM [263 (39), 248 (40) kJ; P < 0.01] in conjunction with equivalent autonomic regulation and thermal strain but higher evaporative cooling [16 (6) W m2 ; P < 0.01]. In well-trained women exercising in the heat: (1) menstrual phase did not affect performance, (2) humidity impaired performance due to reduced evaporative cooling despite matched WBGT and (3) behavioural responses nullified thermodynamic and autonomic differences associated with menstrual phase and dry vs. humid heat.","output":"Influence of menstrual phase and arid vs. humid heat stress on autonomic and behavioural thermoregulation during exercise in trained but unacclimated women."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Asthma is the most common chronic lower respiratory tract disease in childhood throughout the world.

These included 14 cholecystectomies, one appendectomy, and two ventral hernia repairs. The patients had average age of 36.2 years (range 19-62 years) and average BMI of 38.9 kg/m(2) (range 35.2-44.9 kg/m(2)). The mean number of previous abdominal operations was 1. The TV cholecystectomies were hybrid NOTES procedures, while TV appendectomy and ventral hernia repair were pure NOTES. All operations were completed with standard straight laparoscopic instruments. RESULTS The mean operative time was 60 min for cholecystectomy, 41 min for TV appendectomy, and 90 min for ventral hernia repair. No significant difference was encountered between the operative time for NOTES cholecystectomies in obese versus nonobese (60 vs. 61 min, p = 0.86). No conversions to traditional laparoscopy or open surgery were made, and no major complications were encountered.

Yet, research on the effects of this tendency on individuals' well-being yielded inconclusive findings. OBJECTIVE The aim of this longitudinal study is to examine the effects of prior trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on changes in the amount of TV news watching and its effect on subsequent PTSD. More specifically, we examined the interrelations of prior exposure to war captivity, long-term PTSD trajectories, and amount of change TV news watching with PTSD severity during the COVID-19 pandemic, among aging Israeli combat veterans. METHODS One-hundred-and-twenty Israeli ex-prisoners of war (ex-POWs) from 1973 Yom Kippur War and 65 matched controls (combat veterans from the same war) were followed up at five points of time: 1991 (T1), 2003 (T2), 2008 (T3), 2015 (T4), and in April-May 2020 (T5), during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Ex-POWs had higher odds of COVID-19 related increase in TV news watching, which, in turn, contributed to PTSD severity at T5.

It was also largely demonstrated that hemodialysis patients have high mortality rates with severe to fatal disease due to COVID-19 during their initial hospitalization. Even though the functional decline and fatigue after severe infections are not novel entity, some long-term effects of COVID-19 has drawn attention with its prolonged effects even after discharge. A recent prospective, observational study of Carriazo et al provided the first evidence to compare long-term mortality rates of hemodialysis patients with and without COVID-19. Carriazo et al stated a hazard ratio of 3.00 for the mortality rates of hemodialysis patients over a one-year follow-up period after the COVID-19 diagnosis. They emphasized that the high mortality rates of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 are not limited to the initial hospitalization period but also continue after discharge, especially the first three months. In the light of this study, it can be recommended that hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 should be monitored closely and continuously and hemodialysis patients should be prioritized for a vaccination against COVID-19 with close follow-up for their antibody levels.","output":"Long-term effect of COVID-19 infection on hemodialysis patients: Should we follow hemodialysis patients more closely?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected population mental health. We aimed to assess temporal trends in primary care-recorded common mental illness, episodes of self-harm, psychotropic medication prescribing, and general practitioner (GP) referrals to mental health services during the COVID-19 emergency in the UK. METHODS: We did a population-based cohort study using primary care electronic health records from general practices registered on the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We included patient records from Jan 1, 2010, to Sept 10, 2020, to establish long-term trends and patterns of seasonality, but focused primarily on the period January, 2019-September, 2020. We extracted data on clinical codes entered into patient records to estimate the incidence of depression and anxiety disorders, self-harm, prescriptions for antidepressants and benzodiazepines, and GP referrals to mental health services, and assessed event rates of all psychotropic prescriptions and self-harm. We used mean-dispersion negative binomial regression models to predict expected monthly incidence and overall event rates, which were then compared with observed rates to assess the percentage reduction in incidence and event rates after March, 2020. We also stratified analyses by sex, age group, and practice-level Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles. FINDINGS: We identified 14a210a507 patients from 1697 UK general practices registered in the CPRD databases. In April, 2020, compared with expected rates, the incidence of primary care-recorded depression had reduced by 430% (95% CI 383-474), anxiety disorders by 478% (443-512), and first antidepressant prescribing by 364% (339-388) in English general practices. Reductions in first diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders were largest for adults of working age (18-44 and 45-64 years) and for patients registered at practices in more deprived areas. The incidence of self-harm was 376% (348-403%) lower than expected in April, 2020, and the reduction was greatest for women and individuals aged younger than 45 years. By September, 2020, rates of incident depression, anxiety disorder, and self-harm were similar to expected levels. In Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, rates of incident depression and anxiety disorder remained around a third lower than expected to September, 2020. In April, 2020, the rate of referral to mental health services was less than a quarter of the expected rate for the time of year (753% reduction [740-764]). INTERPRETATION: Consequences of the considerable reductions in primary care-recorded mental illness and self-harm could include more patients subsequently presenting with greater severity of mental illness and increasing incidence of non-fatal self-harm and suicide. Addressing the effects of future lockdowns and longer-term impacts of economic instability on mental health should be prioritised.

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve during the global transmission with the notable emergence of the spike D614G substitution that enhances infectivity. Some of these viral adaptations may alter not only the infectivity but also viral pathogenesis. Continuous phylogenomic analysis of circulating viral strains and functional investigation of new non-synonymous substitutions may help to understand the evolution of virus, its virulence and transmissibility. Here we describe a loss of an accessory protein orf3b (57 amino acids) in current circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains, contributing around 24% of more than 100,000 complete viral genomes analyzed. The loss of 3b is caused by the presence of an early stop codon which is created by an orf3a Q57H substitution. There is an increasing trend in the loss of orf3b which has reached 32% in May 2020. Geographically, loss of 3b is more prevalent in certain countries including Colombia (46%), USA (48%), South Korea (51%), France (66%), Saudi Arabia (72%), Finland (76%) and Egypt (77%). Interestingly, the loss of 3b coincides with the emergence of spike D614G substitution. In addition, we found that truncated orf3b has lost the interferon antagonism compared to the full-length orf3b, suggesting a loss of function by the newly adapted virus. Further investigation of orf3b deletion and spike D614G substitution on virulence and infectivity respectively will provide important insights into SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","output":"Loss of orf3b in the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Not available.","output":"Covid-19 after school opening in a population of students in Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Biomarkers of disease severity might help individualizing the management of patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Whether the alveolar compartmentalization of biomarkers has a clinical significance in patients with pneumonia-related ARDS is unknown. This study aimed at assessing the interrelation of ARDS/sepsis biomarkers in the alveolar and blood compartments and explored their association with clinical outcomes. METHODS: Immunocompetent patients with pneumonia-related ARDS admitted between 2014 and 2018 were included in a prospective monocentric study. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and blood samples were obtained within 48 h of admission. Twenty-two biomarkers were quantified in BAL fluid and serum. HLA-DR(+) monocytes and CD8(+) PD-1(+) lymphocytes were quantified using flow cytometry. The primary clinical endpoint of the study was hospital mortality. Patients undergoing a bronchoscopy as part of routine care were included as controls. RESULTS: Seventy ARDS patients were included. Hospital mortality was 21.4%. The BAL fluid-to-serum ratio of IL-8 was 20 times higher in ARDS patients than in controls (p < 0.0001). ARDS patients with shock had lower BAL fluid-to-serum ratio of IL-1Ra (p = 0.026), IL-6 (p = 0.002), IP-10/CXCL10 (p = 0.024) and IL-10 (p = 0.023) than others. The BAL fluid-to-serum ratio of IL-1Ra was more elevated in hospital survivors than decedents (p = 0.006), even after adjusting for SOFA and driving pressure (p = 0.036). There was no significant association between alveolar or alveolar/blood monocytic HLA-DR or CD8(+) lymphocytes PD-1 expression and hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: IL-8 was the most compartmentalized cytokine and lower BAL fluid-to-serum concentration ratios of IL-1Ra were associated with hospital mortality in patients with pneumonia-associated ARDS.","output":"Alveolar compartmentalization of inflammatory and immune cell biomarkers in pneumonia-related ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID19 pandemic in India is causing significant morbidity and disruptions of healthcare delivery.

Seven herbs of traditional Chinese medicine, namely, Ephedra sinica, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Caragana korshinskii, Allium mongolicum, Thymus vulgaris, Astragalus membranaceus, and Lespedeza bicolor are commonly grazed by Tan sheep. It has been widely believed that these herbs are of high nutritive value, which may significantly contribute to the high meat quality and distinct flavor of Tan sheep. However, the nutritive values of these herbs have not been evaluated to date. In this study, samples of the seven herbs were collected from the steppe of Yanchi County of Ningxia Autonomous Region of China. The dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), ash (Ash), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) of these herbs were measured using locally cultivated alfalfa as the standard forage. Digestion of the dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and crude protein in the rumen of Tan sheep was examined using the nylon bag method, in order to evaluate their feeding nutritional value. Our results show that all the seven herbs meet the nutritional needs of ruminants based on the standard forage alfalfa.

It is caused by an apicomplexanTheileria annulata. The timely and accurate detection of infection is vital for implementing a mass vaccination or control programme in a given area under outbreak. Most of the literature concerned with diagnosis of theileriosis revolves around cattle, and practically, there are very limited assays available for detecting bubaline theileriosis. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay certainly amplifies the targeted deoxyribosenucleic acid (DNA) with a comparatively higher efficacy, rapidity and sensitivity. Alongside, minimal use of sophisticated instruments in performing LAMP assay is certainly an add on. The present study describes the application of LAMP assay in diagnosing tropical theileriosis in buffaloes alongside, its comparison with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and blood microscopical examination. RESULTS: No cross-reaction was seen with DNA of other haemoprotozoan. LAMP was compared with blood microscopy and PCR. LAMP detected infection in 27 out of 100 buffaloes, while blood microscopy and PCR detected disease in 16 and 24 buffaloes, respectively. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity, specificity and kappa value prediction of LAMP were found to be much higher than the PCR and blood microscopy.

The purpose of this manuscript is to describe the application of the IDEAS framework in adapting a web-based physical activity intervention for young adult college students. Steps 1C3 emphasized integrating insights from users and theory and Steps 4C7 focused on iterative and rapid design with user feedback. Data were collected via repeat qualitative interviews with young adult college students (N = 7). Resulting qualitative metathemes were engagement, accountability, and cultural fit. Therefore, intervention modifications focused on strategies to foster ongoing engagement with the program (e.g., increase interactivity), support personal and social accountability (e.g., private social media group), and provide a cultural fit within the college lifestyle (e.g., images relevant to student life). The resulting web-based intervention included eight weekly lessons, an expanded resource library, how-to videos, step and goal trackers, and a private social media group to be led by a wellness coach. In conclusion, the IDEAS framework guided an efficient, user-centered adaptation process that integrated empirical evidence and behavior change theory with user preferences and feedback. Furthermore, the process allowed us to address barriers to acceptability during the design and build stages rather than at later stages of pilot and efficacy testing.","output":"Application of the IDEAS Framework in Adapting a Web-Based Physical Activity Intervention for Young Adult College Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently reported detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater around the world has led to emerging concerns on potential risk in water bodies receiving treated wastewater effluent This review aims to provide an up-to-date state of key knowledge on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in natural water bodies receiving treated wastewater In this review, SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater, expected removal in WWTPs, and possible dilution and decay in water bodies are reviewed based on past studies on SARS-CoV-2 and related enveloped viruses We suggest a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) framework to estimate the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 in natural water bodies through various water activities DoseCresponse model of SARS-CoV and Poissons distribution is employed to estimate possible viral ingestion and the annual chance of infection through several water activities in natural water bodies Finally, future perspectives and research needs have been addressed to overcome the limitations and uncertainty in the risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2 in natural water bodies","output":"Potential discharge, attenuation and exposure risk of SARS-CoV-2 in natural water bodies receiving treated wastewater"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"N-acetyl-para-amino phenol (APAP, usually named paracetamol), which is commonly used for its analgesic and antipyretic properties may lead to hepatotoxicity and acute liver damage in case of overdoses.

These studies employed asynchronous online discussions in which participants were asked to respond to weekly prompts. A study facilitator moderated the discussion, encouraging participants to respond to both the prompts and comments of other participants. In the first pilot (n=8), participants engaged in a collective exploration of different symptoms of pre-frailty and frailty.

The decision-making process incorporates prophylaxis efficacy and disease prevalence with the individuals payoffs and planning horizon. Our results show that for short and long planning horizons individuals do not consider engaging in prophylactic behavior. In contrast, individuals adopt prophylactic behavior when considering intermediate planning horizons. Such adoption, however, is not always monotonically associated with the prevalence of the disease, depending on the perceived protection efficacy and the disease parameters. Adoption of prophylactic behavior reduces the epidemic peak size while prolonging the epidemic and potentially generates secondary waves of infection.

The self-report 33-item Hypomania Checklist (HCL-33) and the 33-item Hypomania Checklist C external assessment (HCL-33-EA) are well-validated scales for BD symptom detection. This study compared the network structure, central symptoms, and network stability of hypomanic symptoms measured by the HCL-33 vs. the HCL-33-EA. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January to December 2019. Adolescents (aged between 12 and 18 years) with BD were recruited from the outpatient department of Child Psychiatry, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. All participants were asked to complete the HCL-33, and their caregivers completed the HCL-33-EA. Network analyses were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 215 adolescents with BD and their family caregivers were recruited. Node HCL17 (talk more, node strength = 4.044) was the most central symptom in the HCL-33 network, followed by node HCL2 (more energetic, node strength = 3.822), and HCL18 (think faster, node strength = 3.801). For the HCL-33-EA network model, node HCL27 (more optimistic, node strength = 3.867) was the most central node, followed by node HCL18 (think faster, node strength = 3.077), and HCL17 (talk more, node strength = 2.998). In the network comparison test, there was no significant difference at the levels of network structure (M = 0.946, P = 0.931), global strength (S: 5.174, P = 0.274), or each specific edge (all Ps > 0.05 after HolmCBonferroni corrections) between HCL-33 and HCL-33-EA items. Network stabilities for both models were acceptable. CONCLUSION: The nodes talk more and think faster acted as central symptoms in BD symptom network models based on the HCL-33 and HCL-33-EA. Although the most prominent central symptom differed between the two models (talk more in HCL-33 vs. more optimistic in HCL-33-EA model), networks based on each measure were highly similar and underscored similarities in BD symptom relations perceived by adolescents and their caregivers.

METHODS: Multivariate statistical analyses were used to evaluate COVID-19 deaths and cases relative to nine other demographic and socioeconomic factors in all countries and regions of the world using data as of August 1, 2020. The factors analyzed in the study include a country's total COVID-19 deaths and cases per million population, per capita gross domestic product (GDP), population density, virus tests per million population, median age, government response stringency index, hospital beds availability per thousand population, extreme poverty rate, Bacille Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination rate, and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) immunization rate. RESULTS: The study reveals that COVID-19 deaths per million population in a country most significantly correlates, inversely, with the country's BCG vaccination rate (r = - 0.50, p = 5.3e-5), and also significantly correlates a country's per capita GDP (r = 0.39, p = 7.4e-3) and median age (r = 0.30, p = 0.042), while COVID-19 cases per million population significantly correlate with per capita GDP and tests per thousand population.

An association between low levels of 25(OH)D (the active form of vitamin D) and COVID\\\\19 severity of illness and mortality has also been reported. In addition, low 25(OH)D levels are associated with poor outcomes in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The cytokine storm experienced in severe COVID\\\\19 infections results from excessive release of pro\\\\inflammatory cytokines. Due to its immunomodulatory effects, adequate Vitamin D levels may cause a decrease in the pro\\\\inflammatory cytokines and an increase in the anti\\\\inflammatory cytokines during Covid\\\\19 infections. Vitamin D deficiency was found in 82.2% of hospitalized COVID\\\\19 cases and 47.2% of population\\\\based controls (p<0.0001). The available evidence warrants an evaluation of Vitamin D supplementation in susceptible populations with respiratory diseases such as TB, and particularly in those who are deficient in Vitamin D. This may mitigate against serious complications of Covid\\\\19 infections or reduce the impact of ARDS in those who have been infected.","output":"Potential benefit of vitamin d supplementation in people with respiratory illnesses, during the Covid\\\\19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The US Institute of Medicine's \\"quality chasm\\" report defined patient-centered care as care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values, and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions. Services that lack patient-centered care lead to unimproved health status, decreased patient and family satisfaction, and poor patient outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to assess patient-centered care and associated factors among admitted patients in South Wollo public hospitals in northeast Ethiopia. Methods: This was a facility-based quantitative cross-sectional study design supplemented with qualitative analysis conducted from February 10 to March 10, 2020 across South Wollo public hospitals. A total of 618 admitted patients were selected using multistage systematic random sampling and interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Five health professionals were selected for in-depth interviews. Binary logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify associated variables, and potential confounders were controlled using a multivariate logistic regression model, and P<0.05 was considered significant. Results: Overall, 60.9% (95% CI 57.1%-64.5%) of patients received patient-centered care. Age 25-35 years (AOR 0.39, 95% CI 0.32-0.64) years, rural residence (AOR 2.61, 95% CI 1.62-4.02), social well-being (AOR 2.34, 95% CI 1.45-3.78), perceived high quality of care (AOR 3.69, 95% CI 2.07-6.04), length of stay (AOR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02-0.79), and routine checkups (AOR 1.92, 95% CI 1.15-3.13) were variables significantly associated with patient-centered care. Conclusion: This study revealed that among admitted patients, three in five received patient-centered care. Age, residence, social well-being, length of stay, perceived quality of care, and routine checkups were significantly associated with patient-centered care. Therefore, working on provider improvements in providing consultation and facilitation and decreasing length of stay to improve patient-centered care is needed.","output":"Patient-Centered Care and Associated Factors among Adult Admitted Patients in South Wollo Public Hospitals, Northeast Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper discusses the potential of Ayurveda rasayana in prophylaxis of COVID-19.

Older classification systems regarding timing to reconstruction do not take into account recent improvements in critical care, wound vacuum-assisted closure use, or next-generation antibiotic therapies, which may prolong time to reconstruction. METHODS Records of patients undergoing sternal wound reconstruction performed by the senior author (J.A.A.) from 1996 to 2018 at a high-volume cardiac surgery center were reviewed. Indications included sternal wound infection or dehiscence. All patients underwent single-stage removal of hardware, dbridement, and flap closure. Patients were divided into two groups based on timing of wound closure after cardiac surgery: less than 30 days or greater than or equal to 30 days. RESULTS Of the 505 patients identified during the study period, 330 had sufficient data for analysis. Mean time to sternal wound surgery was 15.7 days in the early group compared to 64.4 days (p < 0.01) beyond 30 days. Postdbridement cultures were positive in 72 percent versus 62.5 percent of patients (p = 0.11), whereas rates of postoperative infection were significantly higher in the delayed group: 1.9 percent versus 9.5 percent (p < 0.01). Partial wound dehiscence rates were also higher after 30 days (1.9 percent versus 11.3 percent; p < 0.01), whereas total length of stay was decreased. Use of wound vacuum-assisted closure was significantly associated with reconstruction beyond 30 days (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Although performing sternal wound reconstruction more than 30 days after initial cardiac surgery was associated with a shorter overall hospital length of stay and higher extubation rates in the operating room, these patients also had elevated postoperative infection and wound complication rates. The authors thus recommend not delaying definitive surgical reconstruction when possible.

Endometriosis involving the rectus abdominis muscle on the trocar port site is a rare event; until now, only 16 cases have been reported in the literature. The majority of cases were associated with previous abdominal surgery such as diagnostic laparoscopy, cyst excision, appendectomy, myomectomy, or cholecystectomy. We review all the reported cases of this unusual form of extrapelvic endometriosis. CASE REPORT We report a new case of abdominal wall endometriosis at the trocar port site in the rectus abdominis muscle in a woman who had undergone 2 laparoscopies for endometriosis in the 3 years before coming to our attention. The diagnosis was made by sonography. We performed a surgical resection of the lesion with a free macroscopic margin of 5-10 mm.

The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the number of emergency room patients at the time of the pandemic in order to draw conclusions about the influence of the COVID 19 pandemic on the number of patients in an emergency department. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With this descriptive epidemiologic study we collected and analyzed anonymized patient-related data of 19,357 cases presenting to the emergency department of the Klinikum rechts der Isar (Munich) from 01 February 2019 to 30 April 2019 and from 01 February 2020 to 30 April 2020. RESULTS: Despite an increase in the number of patients from 2019 to 2020, there was a significant drop in the number of emergencies from February to March 2020 and proceeding in April to a level below that of 2019. This was particularly observed in the field of trauma surgery, with a 40% decrease in the number of patients. With regard to the individual complaint patterns in March 2020, it was found that an increased incidence of malaise (+47%) and breathing problems (+36%) was recorded, whereas back pain (?41%), wounds (?29%), thoracic (?24%) and abdominal pain (?23%) were significantly less common than in the previous year. In terms of the severity of the complaints, the decline was mainly due to complaints with a low degree of urgency. CONCLUSION: In the course of the COVID-19 pandemic we observed a significant decline in the number of patients in one of the largest emergency rooms in Munich. This has to be avoided with existing hospital capacities, in order to prevent potential damage to health caused by postponed or missing emergency presentations.","output":"Patientenzahlen im Rahmen der COVID-19-Pandemie in einer zentralen Notaufnahme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) massage is widely accepted as a conservative treatment for lymphedema. This systematic review aims to examine the methodologies used in recent research and evaluate the effectiveness of MLD for those at-risk of or living with lymphedema. METHODS The electronic databases Embase, PubMed, CINAHL Complete and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched using relevant terms. Studies comparing MLD with another intervention or control in patients at-risk of or with lymphedema were included. Studies were critically appraised with the PEDro scale. RESULTS Seventeen studies with a total of 867 female and two male participants were included. Only studies examining breast cancer-related lymphedema were identified. Some studies reported positive effects of MLD on volume reduction, quality of life and symptom-related outcomes compared with other treatments, while other studies reported no additional benefit of MLD as a component of complex decongestive therapy. In patients at-risk, MLD was reported to reduce incidence of lymphedema in some studies, while others reported no such benefits. CONCLUSIONS The reviewed articles reported conflicting findings and were often limited by methodological issues. This review highlights the need for further experimental studies on the effectiveness of MLD in lymphedema. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS There is some evidence that MLD in early stages following breast cancer surgery may help prevent progression to clinical lymphedema. MLD may also provide additional benefits in volume reduction for mild lymphedema.

METHODS The Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe Network Group initiated a retrospective, observational cohort study of HIV-positive patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Data were collected through a standardized questionnaire and DDIs were identified using the University of Liverpool's interaction checker. RESULTS In total, 524 (94.1% of 557) patients received cART at COVID-19 onset: 117 (22.3%) were female, and the median age was 42 (interquartile range 36-50) years. Only 115 (21.9%) patients were hospitalized, of whom 34 required oxygen therapy. The most frequent nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone was tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) with lamivudine or emtricitabine (XTC) (79.3%) along with an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) (68.5%), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) (17.7%), protease inhibitor (PI) (13.7%) or other (2.5%). In total, 148 (28.2%) patients received COVID-19-specific treatments: corticosteroids (15.7%), favipiravir (7.1%), remdesivir (3.1%), hydroxychloroquine (2.7%), tocilizumab (0.6%) and anakinra (0.2%). In total, 62 DDI episodes were identified in 58 patients (11.8% of the total cohort and 41.9% of the COVID-19-specific treatment group). The use of boosted PIs and elvitegravir accounted for 43 DDIs (29%), whereas NNRTIs were responsible for 14 DDIs (9.5%). CONCLUSIONS In this analysis from the Central and Eastern European region on HIV-positive persons receiving COVID-19-specific treatment, it was found that potential DDIs were common. Although low-dose steroids are mainly used for COVID-19 treatment, comedication with boosted antiretrovirals seems to have the most frequent potential for DDIs.

A prothrombotic state, attributable to excessive inflammation, cytokine storm, hypoxia, and immobilization, is a feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Up to 30% of patients with severe COVID-19 remain at high risk of thromboembolic events despite anticoagulant administration, with adverse impact on in-hospital prognosis. Methods. We retrospectively studied 4742 patients with acute infectious respiratory disease (AIRD); 2579 were diagnosed to have COVID-19 and treated with heparin, whereas 2163 had other causes of AIRD. We compared the incidence and predictors of total, arterial, and venous thrombosis, both in the whole population and in a propensity score-matched subpopulation of 3036 patients (1518 in each group). Results. 271 thrombotic events occurred in the whole population: 121 (4.7%) in the COVID-19 group and 150 (6.9%) in the no-COVID-19 group (p < 0.001). No differences in the incidence of total (p = 0.11), arterial (p = 0.26), and venous (p = 0.38) thrombosis were found between the two groups after adjustment for confounding clinical variables and in the propensity score-matched subpopulation. Likewise, there were no significant differences in bleeding rates between the two groups. Clinical predictors of arterial thrombosis included age (p = 0.006), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.034), peripheral artery disease (p < 0.001), and previous stroke (p < 0.001), whereas history of solid cancer (p < 0.001) and previous deep vein thrombosis (p = 0.007) were associated with higher incidence of venous thrombosis.

Among 95 hospitalised pneumonia patients and 95 household-cohort individuals, analysis of viral NGS identified at least one respiratory-associated virus in 35 (37%) and 23 (24%) samples, respectively. The majority (66%; 42/64) belonged to the Picornaviridae family. The NGS data analysis identified a number of viruses that were missed by the diagnostic panel (rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus), and these failures could be attributed to PCR primer/probe binding site mismatches. Unexpected viruses identified included parvovirus B19, enterovirus D68, coxsackievirus A16 and A24 and rubella virus. The regular application of such viral NGS could help evaluate assay performance, identify molecular causes of missed diagnoses and reveal gaps in the respiratory virus set used for local screening assays.

However, it is unclear why these people are prone to developing alveolar pneumonia, rapid exacerbations, and death. Therefore, we hypothesized that people with comorbidities may have a genetic predisposition that makes them more vulnerable to various factors; for example, they are likely to become more severely ill when infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To test this hypothesis, we searched the literature extensively. Polymorphisms of genes, such as those that encode angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1), have been associated with numerous comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and obesity, and there are potential mechanisms to explain these associations (e.g., -type carriers have greater ACE1 activity, and patients with a genetic alpha-1 anti-trypsin (AAT) deficiency lack control over inflammatory mediators). Since comorbidities are associated with chronic inflammation and are closely related to the reninCangiotensinCaldosterone system (RAAS), these individuals may already have a mild ACE1/ACE2 imbalance before viral infection, which increases their risk for developing severe cases of COVID-19. However, there is still much debate about the association between ACE1 D/I polymorphism and comorbidities. The best explanation for this discrepancy could be that the D allele and  subtypes are associated with comorbidities, but the  genotype alone does not have an exceptionally large effect. This is also expected since the ACE1 D/I polymorphism is only an intron marker. We also discuss how polymorphisms of AAT and other genes are involved in comorbidities and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Presumably, a combination of multiple genes and non-genetic factors is involved in the establishment of comorbidities and aggravation of COVID-19.","output":"Does Genetic Predisposition Contribute to the Exacerbation of COVID-19 Symptoms in Individuals with Comorbidities and Explain the Huge Mortality Disparity between the East and the West?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This review aimed to determine the role of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) in abdominal and pelvic operations. DATA SOURCES The Medline, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were systematically searched until October 2009 using \\"single-incision laparoscopic surgery\\" and related terms as keywords. References from retrieved articles were reviewed to broaden the search STUDY SELECTION The study included case reports, case series, and empirical studies that reported SILS in abdominal and pelvic operations. DATA EXTRACTION Number of patients, type of instruments, operative time, blood loss, conversion rate, length of hospital stay, length of follow-up evaluation, and complications were extracted from the reviewed items DATA SYNTHESIS The review included 102 studies classified as level 4 evidence. Most of these studies investigated SILS in cholecystectomy (n=34), appendectomy (n=24), and nephrectomy (n=17). For these procedures, operative time, hospital stay, and complications were comparable with those of conventional laparoscopy. Conversion to conventional laparoscopy was seldom performed in cholecystectomy (range, 0-24%) and more frequent in appendectomy (range, 0-41%) and nephrectomy (range, 0-33%). CONCLUSION The potential benefits of SILS include superior cosmesis and possibly shorter operative time, lower costs, and a shortened time to full physical recovery. Careful case selection and a low threshold of conversion to conventional laparoscopic surgery are essential. Multicenter, randomized, prospective studies are needed to compare short- and long-term outcome measures against those of conventional laparoscopic surgery.","output":"The role of single-incision laparoscopic surgery in abdominal and pelvic surgery: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In social restrictions due to the current pandemic, there is a change in the learning system and changing learning styles So it has the potential to affect mathematical abilities, especially geometry thinking skills The problems are: 1)how the learning styles tendencies of students during the pandemic, 2)how the students 'geometric thinking abilities viewed from the level of geometry according to van Hiele, 3)how the students' geometric thinking abilities viewed from their learning styles, and 4)are their association of student learning styles with the level of geometry ability according to van Hiele This research conducted at the University of Bina Bangsa in mathematics education, totaling 38 students The method in this research is mixed methods For quantitative data were analyzed using chi-square test and contingency test, while qualitative data were analyzed using flow models The study found that during the covid-19 pandemic, the students tend to use auditory learning style and it is known that there is an association between student learning style and geometric ability level according to Van Hiele Furthermore, it is known that the higher level of geometry ability of students, the higher indicators of ability to think geometry they have ? 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing All rights reserved","output":"Analysis of student learning styles and geometry thinking skills: During the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundRecent studies reported that patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) might have liver injury.

Among them, indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug, was shown to have potent in-vitro antiviral properties on human SARS-CoV-1, canine CCoV, and more recently on human SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar range. Our objective was to show that indomethacin could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and to provide criteria for comparing benefits of alternative dosage regimens using a model-based approach.A multi-stage model-based approach was developed to characterize % of recovery and viral load in CCoV-infected dogs, to estimate the PK of indomethacin in dog and human using published data after administration of immediate (IR) and sustained-release (SR) formulations, and to estimate the expected antiviral activity as a function of different assumptions on the effective exposure in human. Different dosage regimens were evaluated for IR formulation (25 mg and 50 mg three-times-a-day, and 25 mg four-times-a-day), and SR formulation (75 mg once and twice-a-day). The best performing dosing regimens were: 50 mg three-times-a-day for the IR formulation, and 75 mg twice-a-day for the SR formulation. The treatment with the SR formulation at the dose of 75 mg twice-a-day is expected to achieve a complete response in three days for the treatment in patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. These results suggest that indomethacin could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 whose potential therapeutic effect needs to be further assessed in a prospective clinical trial.","output":"Model Based Approach for Estimating the Dosage Regimen of Indomethacin a Potential Antiviral Treatment of Patients Infected with SARS CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently the first genome sequences for 11 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Lebanon became available.

Despite our natural tendencies to categorise and organise, it can be unhelpful to delineate clean boundaries and linear understandings for complex and messy concepts such as loss and damage. Drawing on the perspectives of 42 local and regional Pacific Islander stakeholders, an underexplored resource for understanding loss and damage, we explore the complexity and interconnectedness of non-economic loss and damage (NELD). According to participants, Pacific Islander worldviews, knowledge systems and cosmologies often make it difficult to separate and evaluate NELD independently, challenging the nomenclature of NELD categories developed through international mechanisms. Instead, NELD understandings are often centred on the interdependencies between losses, including the cascading flow-on effects that can occur and the nature of some losses as risk multipliers (i.e. one loss creating the risk for further losses). Most notably, losses to biodiversity, ecosystem services and land are critically linked to, and have cascading effects on, livelihoods, knowledge, ways of life, wellbeing, and culture and heritage. We argue that loss and damage is not always absolute, and that there are NELD that are arguably reparable. Concerning, however, is that biodiversity loss, as a risk multiplier, was considered the least reparable by participants. We put forward that NELD understandings must consider interconnectivity, and that biodiversity and ecosystem conservation and restoration must be the focus for interventions to prevent irreparable and cascading losses from climate change in the Pacific Islands.","output":"Cascading loss and loss risk multipliers amid a changing climate in the Pacific Islands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has become a significant global crisis that requires individuals, organizations and nations to take necessary steps to cope.

This study evaluated the influence of the early use of antimicrobials on the health and performance of neonatal Holstein calves. Twenty-six Holstein calves were screened and divided into two groups, according to the administration (ATB+), or not (ATB-) of tulathromycin (2.5mg/kg, subcutaneously) within the first 12 hours of life. Calves were evaluated by general clinical examination, fecal score, respiratory score, and external palpation of the umbilical region, besides fecal output of dry matter. Anemia was determined by using an automatic system and, also, using a commercial kit for iron dosage. Diarrhea was diagnosed by a centrifuge-flotation technique using a sugar solution (Cryptosporidium) and multiplex semi-nested RT-PCR (rotavirus/coronavirus). The performance of the calves was estimated by Daily Weight Gain (DWG). The young dairy calves were evaluated within 12 hours of birth (&#8804;12h) and at 3-5th (D3-5), 7-9th (D7-9), 13-15th (D13-15), 20-23rd (D20-23), and 27-30th (D27-30) days of life.

METHODS: We analyzed serologic data collected from health care workers and first responders in New York City and the Detroit metropolitan area with history of a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result and who were tested for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at least 2 weeks after symptom onset. RESULTS: Of 2,547 persons with previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 160 (6.3%) were seronegative. Of 2,112 previously symptomatic persons, the proportion seronegative slightly increased from 14 to 90 days post symptom onset (p=0.06). The proportion seronegative ranged from 0% among 79 persons previously hospitalized to 11.0% among 308 persons with asymptomatic infections.

The vascular surgery departments of two collaborating Swiss hospitals had decided to introduce the technique to their services. A surgeon experienced in the technique (AM) was supposed to come to Switzerland and proctor the first four procedures. Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and travel restrictions, this was not possible and we decided to perform the first four pAVF procedures tele-proctored via a video conference system. We present the setup and our experience with tele-proctoring. METHODS: The setup relied on an all-in-one live video production device, video encoder, video streamer and video recorder (Pearl-2, Epiphan), which made it possible to simultaneously transmit the live image from the ultrasound device (GE Logiq S8, linear probe 9L-D) and a live image from a video camera (JVC Camcorder G/-HM440E, Japan), both connected via HDMI (Figure). The live stream was shared with the proctor in France and the device support team in the US, using an encrypted Swiss video client (www.vitimway.ch). The setup was tested with all parties three days in advance. RESULTS: All 4 procedures started with a verbal briefing and a live ultrasound scan. All steps of the procedures were taken under the proctors instruction and supervision. The proctor gave on average 21 instructions per procedure. An average 4 were device-related but these became less frequent as we proceeded. The operators consulted the proctor on average 5 times per procedure. The average duration of the procedure was 34 min. The pAVF creation was successful in all 4 patients, with an average fistula flow measured at the end of the procedure of 600 ml/min. CONCLUSION: Our experience showed us that pAVF creation, which is a procedure performed entirely under sonographic guidance lends itself particularly well to tele-proctoring. The simultaneous transmission of the live sonographic image and the live image of the operators' hands allowed the proctor to supervise and correct the key steps of the procedures. The simplicity of the set-up and the quality of proctor-operator interaction was such a positive experience that we can well envisage a much wider use of tele-proctoring in the future.","output":"Tele-proctoring in vascular surgery implementing percutaneous creation of arteriovenous fistula"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To determine the safety of Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine among health care workers of Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH, Peshawar).

Patients were assessed with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI score), serum cathelicidin and vitamin D at the first visit and after three months of treatments.Results: The highest mean PASI score percent improvement was reported in the combined NB-UVB phototherapy with methotrexate (92%). There was a significant increase in serum vitamin D after treatments with NB-UVB phototherapy and combined NB-UVB phototherapy with methotrexate (P < 0.001). There was a significant decrease in cathelicidin after three months of treatment with combined NB-UVB phototherapy with methotrexate (P < 0.01).Conclusion: This study could contribute to the hypothesis considering the role of cathelicidin and vitamin D in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The combined NB-UVB phototherapy with methotrexate had the highest clinical improvement of psoriasis vulgaris.","output":"Effect of narrow-band ultraviolet B phototherapy, methotrexate, and combined narrow-band ultraviolet B phototherapy with methotrexate on serum cathelicidin and vitamin D in patients with psoriasis vulgaris."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spectroscopy techniques are being implemented within the biopharmaceutical industry due to their non-destructive ability to measure multiple analytes simultaneously, however, minimal work has been applied focussing on their application at small scale.

OPLS models were developed demonstrating good accuracy for multiple analytes at both scales. Furthermore, the 50L SUB prototype enabled on-line monitoring without the need for sterilisation of the probe prior to use and minimal light interference was observed. We also demonstrate the ability to build robust models due to induced changes that are hard and costly to perform at large scale and the potential of transferring these models across the scales. The implementation of this technology enables integration of spectroscopy at the small scale for better process understanding and generation of robust models over a large design space while facilitating model transfer throughout the scales enabling continuity throughout process development and utilisation and transfer of ever-increasing data generation from development to manufacturing.","output":"Spectroscopy Integration to Miniature Bioreactors and Large Scale Production Bioreactors - Increasing Current Capabilities and Model Transfer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The rapid development of vaccines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has provided an effective tool for the management of COVID-19. In Africa COVID-19 vaccine uptake is poor; with 15% vaccine coverage compared to the WHO target of 70%. An important factor has been vaccine hesitancy, understanding late adopters of vaccination can provide insights into the attitudes, motivations and influences that can enhance vaccine uptake. Methods: Between January 4 - February 11, 2022, we conducted a survey among adults presenting for their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine almost 12-months after the vaccination program began. Vaccines were free and provided at clinics and outreach centers in Harare, Zimbabwe. The questionnaire assessed environmental and individual factors (attitudes, barriers, motivations, key influencers, and information sources) that influenced the decision to present for vaccination. Baseline socio-demographic data and responses to survey questions were summarized using descriptive statistics. Binary logistic regression models were developed to understand factors associated with vaccine confidence. Results: 1016 adults were enrolled into the study, 508 (50%) were female, 126 (12.4%) had HIV co-infection. The median age was 30 years (IQR 22 - 39). Women were more likely to have negative views about the COVID-19 vaccine compared to men (OR 1.51 (95%CI 1.16, 1.97, p=0.002). Women compared to men and older adults (>= 40 years) compared with youth (18-25 years) were more likely to have major concerns about vaccines. Most concerns were about safety with 602 (59.3%) concerned about immediate and 520 (51.2%) about long-term health effects of vaccines. People living with HIV (PLWH) were more likely to perceive vaccines as safe (OR 1.71 (95%CI: 1.07, 2.74, p=0.025), effective (1.68 (95%CI: 1.07, 2.64, p=0.026) and to trust regulatory systems for approving vaccines (OR 1.79 (95% CI: 1.11, 2.89, p=0.017) compared to those without HIV. Internet users were less likely to perceive vaccines as safe (OR 0.72 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.95, p=0.021), effective (OR 0.61 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.80, p<0.001) or trust regulatory processes for approving vaccines (OR 0.64 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.85, p=0.002) compared to non-internet users. Social influence was a key factor in the decision to be vaccinated with family members being the primary key influencers for 560 (55.2%) participants. The most important reason for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine today for 715 (70.4%) participants was the protection of individual health. The most trusted source of information regarding the vaccine was the Ministry of Health (79.7%) and the radio, television and social media were the preferred sources for obtaining this information. Social media was a more likely source for youth and those with higher levels of education. Conclusion: Improving vaccine coverage will need targeted communication strategies that address negative perceptions of vaccines and associated safety and effectiveness concerns. Leveraging normative behavior as a social motivator for vaccination will be important as close social networks are key influences of vaccination. Traditional media remains important for health communication in Africa and should be strengthened to counter social media-based misinformation that drives concerns about safety and effectiveness particularly among internet users.","output":"Investigating Attitudes, Motivations and Key Influencers for vaccine uptake among late adopters of COVID-19 vaccination in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

Methods. CoV 229E and OC43 were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and serology in 4 adult populations under surveillance for acute respiratory illness during the winters of 1999C2003.

Three hundred ninety-eight CoV infections were identified, with annual infection rates ranging from 2.8% to 26% in prospective cohorts, and prevalence ranging from 3.3% to 11.1% in the hospitalized cohort. The incidence of infections with each strain was similar, although asymptomatic infection and viral coinfection was significantly more common with 229E than OC43 infection. Although the incidence and clinical manifestations were similar for each strain, OC43-infected subjects tended to seek more medical care, as OC43 was twice as common as 229E among the hospitalized cohort.

No study has evaluated the time required to reverse this downward curve of MI admissions. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis on patients (N = 2415) admitted to the Emergency Departments for acute MI in nine Italian centers. Primary endpoint was the incidence rates (IRs) of MI admissions in the post-lockdown COVID-19 period (case-period: from May 4 to July 12, 2020) vs. the following control periods: January 1-February 19, 2020 (pre-lockdown period); February 20-May 3, 2020 (intra-lockdown period); May 4-July 12, 2019 (inter-year non-COVID-19 period). RESULTS: IR of admissions for MI in the post-lockdown period was higher than the intra-lockdown period (IR ratio, IRR: 1.60, 95% CI 1.42-1.81; p = 0.0001), was lower than the pre-lockdown period (IRR: 0.86, 0.77-0.96; p = 0.009) and similar to the inter-year non-COVID-19 period (IRR: 0.96, 0.87-1.07; p = 0.47). Within the case period, the increase in MI admissions was more pronounced in earlier vs later weeks (IRR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02-1.38, p = 0.024) and, compared to the inter-year control period, was significant for non ST-segment elevation MI (IRR: 1.25, 95% CI 1.08-1.46, p = 0.004), but was not observed for ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI), where hospitalizations were reduced (IRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65-0.88, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study first indicates an increase in the number of admissions for MI after the removal of the national lockdown for COVID-19 in Italy.

These same warnings are reverberating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consideration of the impacts of EVD on maternal and child health services from facility data can be instructive during COVID-19. We surveyed all peripheral healthcare units (PHUs) in Sierra Leone in October 2014 and March 2015 to assess closures, staffing, amenities, medicines, supplies, and service utilization during May 2014CJanuary 2015 and October 2013CJanuary 2014. We report PHU characteristics and service utilization changes for equivalent 4-month periods during the epidemic and the prior year. We present utilization changes by district and service type, and model excess child mortality. PHU closures (?8%) and staff attrition (?3%) were limited, but many facilities lacked amenities, medicines, and supplies. Utilization of preventive and scheduled services fell more than individualized, clinical care interventions, aside from malaria treatment which declined significantly. Ebola virus disease intensity in districts was weakly associated with utilization, aside from two districts that were severely affected. Modeling suggests utilization declines resulted in 6,782 excess under-five deaths (an increase of 21%) between 2014 and 2015. Ebola virus disease negatively affected service provision, but utilization declined relatively more, particularly for preventive and scheduled interventions. Although these findings are specific to Sierra Leone's EVD epidemic, they illustrate the magnitude of possible effects in other settings due to COVID-19Cinduced service disruptions, where collateral impacts on child mortality from other preventable causes may far outweigh COVID-19 mortality","output":"The Effect of Ebola Virus Disease on Maternal and Child Health Services and Child Mortality in Sierra Leone, 2014C2015: Implications for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE In patients undergoing midline incisions, the abdominal fascia can be closed with a continuous or interrupted suture using various materials. The aim of this study is to compare: (1) interrupted technique with rapidly absorbable sutures and (2) continuous techniques with different slowly absorbable sutures, focusing on the incidence of incisional hernias within 1 year. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA A meta-analysis suggested that the incidence of incisional hernias can be more effectively reduced with slowly absorbable continuous sutures. METHODS Multicenter randomized surgical trial with 3 parallel groups. Patients were scheduled for primary elective midline incisions. All surgeons were trained (4:1 suture wound length in continuous groups) and monitored. Primary end point, measured within 1 year after surgery, was the frequency of incisional hernias diagnosed by clinical examination and confirmed by ultrasound. Complications and safety were used as secondary end points. This study has been registered with the ISRCTN Register (INSECT: ISRCTN24023541). RESULTS Conducted on 625 randomized patients (210 interrupted Vicryl, 205 continuous polydioxanone suture (PDS), 210 continuous Monoplus), the primary analysis showed an incidence of 28 incisional hernias (15.9%) versus 15 (8.4%) versus 22 (12.5%) for the 3 closure techniques, respectively (P = 0.09). No significant difference was observed between the 3 groups with regard to burst abdomen (4 [2.0%] vs. 6 [3.0%] vs. 8 [4.0%], P = 0.46), wound infection (26 [12.7%] vs. 39 [19.4%] vs. 33 [16.3%], P = 0.19), pulmonary infections (9 [4.4%] vs. 5 [2.5%] vs. 5 [2.5%], P = 0.46), serious adverse events (63 [30.0%] vs. 57 [27.8%] vs. 61 [29.1%], P = 0.89), and 1-year mortality (16 [7.9%] vs. 11 [5.5%] vs. 16 [7.9%], P = 0.54). CONCLUSIONS The incidence of incisional hernias and the frequency of wound infection was higher than expected in all groups.

The number of infections rose steeply and preventative measures such as lockdowns were implemented to slow down the spread of the disease.

Following the relaxation of lockdown and the appearance of mutant strains of the virus, a much severe second wave of COVID-19 emerged starting mid-February. For characterization and comparison of both the waves, a SIQR (Susceptible-Infected-Quarantined-Removed) model is used in this paper. The results indicate that a single patient can infect approximately 2.44 individuals in the population. The epidemic doubling time was calculated to be 11.8 days.

RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the incidence of TC in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and what is the relationship between the dose of anticoagulant therapy and the incidence of TC? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: All consecutive patients referred to eight French ICUs for COVID-19 were included in this observational study. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from ICU admission to day 14, including anticoagulation status and thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. The effect of high-dose prophylactic anticoagulation (either at intermediate or equivalent to therapeutic dose), defined using a standardized protocol of classification, was assessed using a time-varying exposure model using inverse probability of treatment weight. RESULTS: Of 538 patients included, 104 patients experienced a total of 122 TCs with an incidence of 22.7% (95% CI, 19.2%-26.3%). Pulmonary embolism accounted for 52% of the recorded TCs. High-dose prophylactic anticoagulation was associated with a significant reduced risk of TC (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66-0.99) without increasing the risk of bleeding (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.70-1.75). INTERPRETATION: High-dose prophylactic anticoagulation is associated with a reduction in thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 without an increased risk of hemorrhage.

Thus, we aimed to investigate whether in the situation of an imminent coronavirus pandemic, people would still perceive themselves as being less exposed to the disease than others. Methods: Survey studies were conducted to examine the level of unrealistic optimism. Participants (n = 171, 67.3% of women) in a subjective way judged the risk of their coronavirus infection and the likelihood that this would happen to an average student of the same sex from their class. The survey was conducted in three waves: prior to the announcement of the first case of coronavirus (2-3 March), immediately after that announcement (5-6 March), and a few days later (9-10 March). Results: We showed that women estimated the chances of being infected as significantly higher (M = 4.52, SD = 2.079; t = 2.387; p = 0.018; Cohen's d = 0.393) than men (M = 3.71, SD = 2.042).

However, the effect of anesthetics on arterial oxygenation during one-lung ventilation has not been well established in human study. In this clinical trial, we investigated whether a difference between desflurane-remifentanil and propofol-remifentanil anesthesia can be observed with regard to oxygenation during one-lung ventilation for thoracoscopic surgery. METHODS Adult patients with lung cancer, scheduled for video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy without preoperative oxygen support, were screened and randomized to receive desflurane or propofol, with remifentanil continuous infusion in both groups. Mechanical ventilation was performed with tidal volume of 8 ml/kg and FIO2 0.5 during two-lung ventilation, and 6 ml/kg and 1.0 during one-lung ventilation, both with positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed preoperatively, during two-lung ventilation, and after 15, 30, 45, and 60 min of one-lung ventilation. The primary endpoint was PaO2 at 30 min after initiating one-lung ventilation. Statistical analyses included the independent t-test for the primary endpoint and a mixed model with a post-hoc analysis to evaluate the serial changes in values. RESULTS Patients were recruited between July 9 and December 2, 2014. In total, 103 patients were analyzed (n = 52 in desflurane group and n = 51 in propofol group). The primary endpoint, PaO2 at 30 min of one-lung ventilation was lower in the desflurane group than the propofol group (170  72 vs. 202  82 mmHg; p = 0.039). Serial changes in PaO2 during one-lung ventilation showed lower levels during desflurane anesthesia compared with propofol anesthesia (mean difference, 45 mmHg; 95% confidence interval, 16-75 mmHg; p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, desflurane-remifentanil anesthesia resulted in decreased arterial oxygenation compared with that of propofol-remifentanil anesthesia during one-lung ventilation for thoracoscopic surgery in patients with lung cancer.

OBJECTIVES: To measure the association of closures and restrictions with aggregate mobility and the association of mobility with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and to characterize community spread of COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used aggregated anonymized mobility data from smartphone users in Nigeria who opted to provide location history (from a pool of up to 40 million individuals) collected between February 27 and July 21, 2020. The analyzed data included daily counts of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and daily changes in aggregate mobility across 6 categories: retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential. Closures and restrictions were initiated on March 30, 2020, and partially eased on May 4, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Interrupted time series were used to measure associations of closures and restrictions with aggregate mobility. Negative binomial regression was used to evaluate associations between confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and mobility categories. Averted infections were estimated by subtracting cumulative confirmed infections from estimated infections assuming no closures and restrictions. RESULTS: Closures and restrictions had negative associations with mean change in daily aggregate mobility in retail and recreation (C46.87 [95% CI, C55.98 to C37.76] percentage points; P < .001), grocery and pharmacy (C28.95 [95% CI, C40.12 to C17.77] percentage points; P < .001), parks (C43.59 [95% CI, C49.89 to C37.30] percentage points; P < .001), transit stations (C47.44 [95% CI, C56.70 to C38.19] percentage points; P < .001), and workplaces (C53.07 [95% CI, C67.75 to C38.39] percentage points; P < .001) and a positive association with mobility in residential areas (24.10 [95% CI, 19.14 to 29.05] percentage points; P < .001). Most of these changes reversed after closures and restrictions were partially eased (retail and recreation: 14.63 [95% CI, 10.95 to 18.30] percentage points; P < .001; grocery and pharmacy: 15.29 [95% CI, 10.90 to 19.67] percentage points; P < .001; parks: 6.48 [95% CI, 3.98 to 8.99] percentage points; P < .001; transit stations: 17.93 [95% CI, 14.03 to 21.83] percentage points; P < .001; residential: C5.59 [95% CI, C9.08 to C2.09] percentage points; P = .002). Additionally, every percentage point increase in aggregate mobility was associated with higher incidences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in residential areas (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.03 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.07]; P = .04), transit stations (IRR, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.03]; P = .008), and workplaces (IRR, 1.01 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.02]; P = .04). Lastly, closures and restrictions may have been associated with averting up to 5.8 million SARS-CoV-2 infections over the study period. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, closures and restrictions had significant associations with aggregate mobility and were associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infections. These findings suggest that future anticontagion measures need better infection control and contact tracing in residential areas, transit stations, and workplaces.","output":"Associations of Government-Mandated Closures and Restrictions With Aggregate Mobility Trends and SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health organizations play a pivotal role during pandemic preparedness, response and recovery.

To this end, they are typically applied to measurement results generated from entangled systems of particles. They can, however, also be used as a statistical tool for macroscopic systems, where they can describe the connection strength between two components of a system under a causal model. We show that, in principle, data from macroscopic observations analyzed with Bell s approach can invalidate certain causal models. To illustrate this use, we describe a macroscopic game setting, without a quantum mechanical measurement process, and analyze it using the framework of Bell experiments. In the macroscopic game, violations of the inequalities can be created by cheating with classically defined strategies. In the physical context, the meaning of violations is less clear and is still vigorously debated. We discuss two measures for optimal strategies to generate a given statistic that violates the inequalities. We show their mathematical equivalence and how they can be computed from CHSH-quantities alone, if non-signaling applies. As a macroscopic example from the financial world, we show how the unfair use of insider knowledge could be picked up using Bell statistics. Finally, in the discussion of realist interpretations of quantum mechanical Bell experiments, cheating strategies are often expressed through the ideas of free choice and locality. In this regard, violations of free choice and locality can be interpreted as two sides of the same coin, which underscores the view that the meaning these terms are given in Bells approach should not be confused with their everyday use.

To understand why we engage in psychological healing, we review the evolution of cooperation among social species and the roles of emotional contagion, empathy, and self-regulation. We discuss key aspects of human biocultural evolution that have contributed to healing behaviors: symbolic logic including language, complex social networks, and the long period of childhood that necessitates identifying and responding to others in distress. However, both biological and cultural evolution also have led to social context when empathy and consoling are impeded.

All NMR methods gave highly significant discrimination of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from controls and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients with individual NMR methods, giving different diagnostic information windows on disease-induced phenoconversion. Longitudinal trajectory analysis in selected patients indicated that metabolic recovery was incomplete in individuals without detectable virus in the recovery phase. We observed four plasma cytokine clusters that expressed complex differential statistical relationships with multiple lipoproteins and metabolites. These included the following: cluster 1, comprising MIP-1?, SDF-1&#945;, IL-22, and IL-1&#945;, which correlated with multiple increased LDL and VLDL subfractions; cluster 2, including IL-10 and IL-17A, which was only weakly linked to the lipoprotein profile; cluster 3, which included IL-8 and MCP-1 and were inversely correlated with multiple lipoproteins. IL-18, IL-6, and IFN-?3 together with IP-10 and RANTES exhibited strong positive correlations with LDL1-4 subfractions and negative correlations with multiple HDL subfractions.

Multiple factors drove the rapid growth of the epidemic in India and caused a large number of deaths within a very short period. These factors include a new variant with increased transmissibility, a lack of preparations exists national wide, and health and safety precautions poorly implemented or enforced during festivals, sporting events, and state/local elections.

COVID-19 infection has been directly related to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe infections could lead to admission to intensive care and increased risk of death. The use of clinical data in machine learning models available at time of admission to ED can be used to assess possible risk of ARDS, the need for intensive care (admission to the Intensive Care Unit; ICU) as well as risk of mortality. In addition, chest radiographs can be inputted into a deep learning model to further assess these risks. PURPOSE: This research aimed to develop machine and deep learning models using both structured clinical data and image data from the electronic health record (EHR) to predict adverse outcomes following ED admission. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) was used as the main machine learning algorithm using all clinical data including 42 variables. Compact models were also developed using the 15 most important variables to increase applicability of the models in clinical settings. To predict risk (or early stratified risk) of the aforementioned health outcome events, transfer learning from the CheXNet model was also implemented on the available data. This research utilized clinical data and chest radiographs of 3,571 patients, 18 years and older, admitted to the emergency department between 9(th) March 2020 and 29(th) October 2020 at Loyola University Medical Center.

METHODS: Care home staff were tested for SARS-COV-2 infection by RT-PCR and asked to report any symptoms, their contact with residents and if they worked in different care homes. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on RT-PCR positive samples. RESULTS: In total, 53 (21%) of 254 staff were SARS-CoV-2 positive but only 12/53 (23%) were symptomatic.

Respondents gave their informed consent and reported personal, social, and economic resource loss since the Umbrella Movement (Conservation of Resources-Evaluation), current anxiety symptoms (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and self-rated health (1=very good, 4=very bad). RESULTS: A total of 47.35% (95% CI=44.55, 50.17) respondents reported moderate/severe anxiety symptoms and 14.4% (95% CI=12.54, 16.50) reported moderate/severe depressive symptoms; 9.11% (95% CI=7.61, 10.86) reported poor or very poor health. Multivariable regressions revealed that personal and social resource loss was associated with higher anxiety and depressive symptoms and greater odds of very poor health (adjusted odds ratios/incidence rate ratios=5C102%), independent of lower education level and income and being unmarried. LIMITATIONS: This study was cross-sectional in nature and thus could not determine causality from the associations between resource loss and outcome variables. Second, the telephone survey relied on self-reports; response bias and social desirability could influence respondents' answers and discount data validity. Third, potential confounders such as preexisting mental and physical health issues and concurrent predictors like exposure to the Umbrella Movement were not assessed. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies following any recent political movement (e.g., The Arab Spring) to quantify distress and the associated correlates of distress among affected citizens.

AB uptake by plants depended on both the vegetable and the AB class and was higher in radish than in lettuce edible parts. Levels ranged from undetectable to up to 76 ng/g (fresh weight). Repetitive organic fertilisation resulted in an increase in the concentration of ABs in lettuce leaves, but not in radish roots. Significant metabolomic and transcriptomic changes were observed following soil fertilisation. Nevertheless, a human health risk assessment indicates that the occurrence of ABs in lettuce or radish edible parts does not pose any risk. To our knowledge, this is the first holistic plot-scale study demonstrating that the use of organic fertilisers containing ABs is safe for crop security and human health.","output":"Occurrence of antibiotics in Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and Radish (Raphanus sativus L.) following organic soil fertilisation under plot-scale conditions: Crop and human health implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resilience is a dynamic process through which people adjust to adversity and buffer anxiety and depression.

Despite the pronounced vulnerability of autistic adults to anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, relationships among autism-related traits, resilience, and mental health outcomes have not been examined. As such, we aimed to describe the relationships between these traits in a sample enriched in autism spectrum traits during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also aimed to investigate the impact of demographic and social factors on these relationships. Across three independent samples of adults, we assessed resilience factors, autism-related traits, anxiety symptoms, and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. One sample (recruited via the Autism Spectrum Program of Excellence, n = 201) was enriched for autism traits while the other two (recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk, n = 624 and Facebook, n = 929) drew from the general population. We found resilience factors and quantitative autism-related traits to be inversely related, regardless of the resilience measure used. Additionally, we found that resilience factors moderate the relationship between autism-related traits and depression symptoms such that resilience appears to be protective. Across the neurodiversity spectrum, resilience factors may be targets to improve mental health outcomes.

Older people have more risk of severe COVID 19; hospitalization, ITU admission, ventilation and mortality. AIM: To assess the correlation between age, frailty and comorbidity in COVID-19 inpatients 65 years and older. METHODS: A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis was carried out on COVID 19 inpatients 65 and older in a UK district general hospital. Patients with no microbiological evidence of COVID-19 and patients with incomplete data were excluded from the study. Demographic data, frailty score and comorbidity index were extracted from the electronic records of patients. SPSS 27 statistical software was used to perform descriptive analysis and linear regression coefficient. RESULTS: 357 COVID-19 patients 65 and over were assessed; 207 males and 150 females. Mean age was 81.9 +/? 9.31. Frailty scores were measured using the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and comorbidity was calculated using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). There was positive correlation between age and Clinical Frailty Scale (r=. 436; p<. 001), between age and Charlson Comorbidity Index (r=. 448; p<. 001, and between frailty and comorbidity (r=. 429; p<. 001). CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 inpatients 65 and older, there was positive correlation between age and Clinical Frailty Scale, between age and Charlson Comorbidity Index and between frailty and comorbidity.

Gaps remain in our understanding of the core components of effective pregnancy yoga programmes. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the characteristics and effectiveness of pregnancy yoga interventions, incorporating the FITT (frequency, intensity, time/duration and type) principle of exercise prescription. METHODS Nine electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, WHOLiS, AMED, ScieLo, ASSIA and Web of Science. Randomised control trials and quasi-experimental studies examining pregnancy yoga interventions were eligible. Covidence was used to screen titles, abstracts, and full-text articles. Outcomes of interest were stress, anxiety, depression, quality of life, labour duration, pain management in labour and mode of birth. The Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Assessment tool was used to assess methodological quality of studies and GRADE criteria (GRADEpro) evaluated quality of the evidence. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3. RESULTS Of 862 citations retrieved, 31 studies met inclusion criteria. Twenty-nine studies with 2217 pregnant women were included for meta-analysis. Pregnancy yoga interventions reduced anxiety (SMD: -0.91; 95% CI: - 1.49 to - 0.33; p = 0.002), depression (SMD: -0.47; 95% CI: - 0.9 to - 0.04, P = 0.03) and perceived stress (SMD: -1.03; 95% CI: - 1.55 to - 0.52; p < 0.001). Yoga interventions also reduced duration of labour (MD = - 117.75; 95% CI - 153.80 to - 81.71, p < 0.001) and, increased odds of normal vaginal birth (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.46-4.56, p < 0.001) and tolerance for pain. The quality of evidence (GRADE criteria) was low to very low for all outcomes. Twelve or more yoga sessions delivered weekly/bi-weekly had a statistically significant impact on mode of birth, while 12 or more yoga sessions of long duration (> 60 min) had a statistically significant impact on perceived stress.

Dengue disease is of great importance for global public health, with vaccination being its main prophylactic measure. However, there is a paucity of biological models for evaluating tetravalent dengue vaccines. The aim of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of human cell lines HEK293T and THP-1 to a commercial dengue vaccine and test the feasibility of this approach in the development of a potency assay with human cell lines, as a methodological alternative to the golden standard potency assay with VERO cells. In this context, we used a batch of the commercial vaccine Dengvaxia? (CYD-TDV) for the infection tests. We evaluated the presence of the vaccine virus in THP-1 cells, differentiated into macrophages (dTHP-1), and in HEK293T by confocal microscopy, using 4G2 pan-flavivirus antibody. Vaccine infectivity and potency were determined by immunocolorimetric assay using monoclonal antibodies specific for each serotype. The results indicated that the human strain HEK293T was responsive to the tetravalent vaccine, as shown by the presence of virus particles in the cell cytoplasm in a pattern similar to the one observed with VERO cells. Moreover, it was possible to determine the infectivity and potency values of each vaccine virus serotype in the HEK293T, with serotype 4 prevailing over the others. Thus, the human cell line HEK293T provides a potential candidate to be used in assays to determine potency and identity of tetravalent dengue vaccines.","output":"Short communication: Feasibility of dengue vaccine to infect different human cell lines: An alternative potency test using HEK293T cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing, shutdown, and lockdown policies have recently been implemented worldwide to help slow the spread of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has caused economic, social, and cultural crises on a global scale.

In addition, machine learning based regression analysis of patients sensory data is performed to obtain highly accurate predictions of the patients sensory data (patients vitals), which enables highly accurate virtual observers to predict the data in case of communication failures. The performance analysis of the proposed IoT based vital signs monitoring system for the post-surgery patients offers reduced delay and packet loss in comparison to IEEE low latency deterministic networks.

Results Of 217 patients enrolled, 78 (35.9%) reported dysosmia (n = 73, 33.6%) and/or dysgeusia (n = 62, 28.6%). The median duration of COVID-19 associated symptom-onset to development of dysosmia and/or dysgeusia was <1 days (interquartile range [IQR], <1 to 6 days) and 53 of 78 (67.9%) patients developed dysosmia and/or dysgeusia as one of the initial symptoms of COVID-19. Of 59 closely monitored patients, 41 (69.5%) patients recovered within 3 weeks after symptoms onset and the median time to recovery was 12 days (IQR, 7 to 20 days). Only 6 of the 59 (10.2%) patients reported persistent dysosmia and/or dysgeusia before discharge from hospitals.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the early postoperative morbidity and mortality of patients undergoing iRARC and conduct a critical analysis of complications using standardised reporting criteria as stratified according to urinary diversion. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 134 patients underwent iRARC for bladder cancer at a single centre between June 2011 and July 2015. INTERVENTION Radical cystectomy with iRARC. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Patient demographics, pathologic data, and 90-d perioperative mortality and complications were recorded. Complications were reported according to the Clavien-Dindo (CD) classification and stratified according to urinary diversion type and either surgical or medical complications. The chi-square test and t test were used for categorical and continuous variables respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was performed on variables with significance in univariate analysis. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The 90-d all complication rate following ileal conduit and continent diversion was 68% and 82.4%, and major complications were 21.0% and 20.6% respectively. The 90-d mortality was 3% and 2.9% for ileal conduit and continent diversion patients, respectively. On multivariate analysis, the blood transfusion requirement was independently associated with major complications (p=0.002) and all 30-d (p=0.002) and 90-d (p=0.012) major complications. Male patients were associated with 90-d major complications (p=0.015). Critical analysis identified that surgical complications were responsible for 39.4% of all 90-d major complications. The incidence of surgical complications did not decline with increasing number of iRARC cases performed (p=0.742, r=0.31). Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature, limited sample size, and limited multivariate analysis due to the low number of major complications events. CONCLUSIONS Although complications following iRARC are common, most are low grade. A critical analysis identified surgical complications as a cause of major complications. Addressing this issue could have a significant impact on lowering the morbidity associated with iRARC.

Using both drone footage and underwater counting, we were able to track the abundance of those two species before, during, and after reopening and thus investigate the impact of provisioning on wild shark populations. The absence of any stimulus during this long period resulted in almost total desertion of the site by the elasmobranchs. However, 1 day prior to reopening, some individuals of both species positively reacted to the single acoustic stimulus of an engine boat, showing the resilience of conditioning, and some elasmobranchs reacted to acoustic and olfactive stimuli linked to the provisioning practice from the first day after reopening.

In this article, we describe the materials obtained by bonding borocarbonitride (BCN) layers with BCN layers as well as with other layered structures such as MoS2 and C3N4. While cross-linking BCN layers with other 2D sheets, we have exploited the existence of different surface functional groups on the graphene (COOH) and BN(NH2) domains of the borocarbonitrides as quantitatively determined by FLOSS. Hence, we have thus obtained two different BCN-BCN assemblies differing in the location of the cross-linking and these are designated as GG/BCN-BCN and GBN/BCN-BCN, depending on which domains of the BCN are involved in cross-linking.

We halted toxicology testing, and to promote physical distancing and prevent interruptions in access to treatment for medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), we drastically increased unsupervised take-home doses of MOUD.

In the initial three months, our patients experienced six nonfatal overdoses, no fatal overdoses, and 20 deaths attributable to COVID-19. This experience provides an opportunity to re-imagine care in OTPs going forward. We advocate that OTPs rely less on toxicology testing and more on the other patient-centered measures to guide decisions about distribution of take-home doses of MOUD.

Levels of inflammatory cytokines in sera and lung tissues were significantly higher in adult F344 rats than in young rats. During in vivo passage of SARS-CoV, a single amino acid substitution was introduced within the binding domain of the viral spike protein recognizing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is known as a SARS-CoV receptor. The rat-passaged virus more efficiently infected CHO cells expressing rat ACE2 than did the original isolate. These results strongly indicate that host and virus factors such as advanced age and virus adaptation are critical for the development of SARS in rats.","output":"Participation of both host and virus factors in induction of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in F344 rats infected with SARS coronavirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The critical situation of Covid-19 in recent years is gradually easing.

India's multipronged response included nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs) like intensive case-based surveillance, expanding testing capacity, social distancing, health promotion, and progressive travel restrictions leading to a complete halt of international and domestic movements (lockdown). Objectives: We studied the impact of NPI on transmission dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic in India and estimated the minimum level of herd immunity required to halt it. Methods: We plotted time distribution, estimated basic (R0) and time-dependent effective (Rt) reproduction numbers using software R, and calculated doubling time, the growth rate for confirmed cases from January 30 to May 4, 2020. Herd immunity was estimated using the latest Rtvalue. Results: Time distribution showed a propagated epidemic with subexponential growth. Average growth rate, 21% in the beginning, reduced to 6% after an extended lockdown (May 3). Based on early transmission dynamics, R0was 2.38 (95% confidence interval [CI] =1.79-3.07). Early, unmitigated Rt= 2.51 (95% CI = 2.05-3.14) (March 15) reduced to 1.28 (95% CI = 1.22-1.32) and was 1.83 (95% CI = 1.71-1.93) at the end of lockdown Phase 1 (April 14) and 2 (May 3), respectively.

We sought to examine whether obesity, sex, and age influence the adipose tissue endocrine response to the disease. Methods: This prospective study investigated 145 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Patients were categorized based on their body mass index (BMI), sex and age, and were also classified regarding their outcome after hospitalization as: (a) Non-ICU: patients hospitalized who did not receive intensive care; (b) ICU-survivor: patients admitted to the intensive care unit and discharged; (c) ICU-death: patients who died. Blood samples were collected by the hospital staff between the first and third day of hospitalization. Serum leptin, adiponectin and BDNF concentrations, triglycerides, total cholesterol and cholesterol fractions were performed following the manufacturer's guidelines. Results: We demonstrate that BDNF levels predict intensive care (IC) need (p < 0.01). This association was found to be stronger in patients >60y (p = 0.026). Neither leptin nor adiponectin concentration was associated with IC requirement or with patient's outcome, while the BDNF/adiponectin ratio was closely associated with worsened outcomes (p < 0.01). BDNF concentration was similar between sexes, however tended to be lower in male patients (p = 0.023). In older patients, BDNF concentration was lower than that of younger patients (p = 0.020). These age and sex-specific differences should be considered when employing these potential markers for prognosis assessment. While appetite and body composition regulating hormones secreted by the white adipose tissue are not reliable predictors of disease severity, the ratio BDNF/adiponectin was indicative of patient status. Conclusion: Thus, we propose that serum BDNF content and BDNF/adiponectin ratio may serve as tools predicting worsened prognosis in COVID-19, especially for male patients.","output":"COVID-19 Outcome Relates With Circulating BDNF, According to Patient Adiposity and Age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been a variety of policy responses that have produced a range of expected and unexpected effects on society and our surrounding environment. One widely reported result of the pandemic response is that travel restrictions have resulted in improvements in regional air quality. This study aims to determine the effect of COVID-19 related Stay at Home precautions on air quality in a metropolitan area. We specifically focus on CO, NO(2), and PM(10) in Maricopa County (Phoenix), Arizona, as these all contribute to local air quality concerns. The role of meteorological parameters on ambient concentrations for these pollutants was investigated by using the local planetary boundary layer height (PBH) to account for vertical mixing. Across all three sites studied, there was no uniform decrease in either CO or NO(2), even when freeway traffic volume was down by ~35%. For PM(10), there was a significant decrease of ~45% seen at all the sites for the period most directly impacted by local Stay at Home restrictions compared to the past two years. This indicates that different pollutants have fundamentally different behavior in the local environment and suggests that these pollutants originate from different sources.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 travel restrictions on Phoenix air quality after accounting for boundary layer variations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to analyze the confusion of information uncertainty in the situation and human puzzlement have overshadowed the actions of Indonesian citizens throughout 2020 until the end of January 2021 in line with the pandemic outbreak which have not yet ended and still cannot be predicted when it will end.

Notably, coix seed is currently being used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of COVID-19 in China. However, coix seeds are generally contaminated by mycotoxins, and this risk cannot be ignored. In this paper, we developed a method that involves direct extraction and UHPLC-HRMS analysis for the simultaneous detection of 24 mycotoxins in coix seeds. UHPLC-HRMS instrument and data acquisition parameters, and the sample pretreatment were optimised. One-step extraction showed several advantages compared to the three commercial solid-phase extraction clean-up methods, including ease of use, reduced time of sample preparation, low cost, good recovery, and acceptable matrix effect. The method validation results indicate that all mycotoxins have good linearity and sensitivity. Recoveries were between 74.2-101.1%, and RSD ranged from 0.1-5.8%. The LOQs for 24 mycotoxins were in the range of 0.5-100 g/kg. To survey the contamination levels of these mycotoxins in commercial coix seeds, more than 70 samples were collected from Chinese markets and were analysed using the newly developed method. Zearalenone (positive ratio: 98.7%, range:1.1-1562 g/kg), deoxynivalenol (positive ratio: 87%, range: 8.4-382.5 g/kg), nivalenol (positive ratio: 85.7%, range: 26.8-828.2 g/kg), fumonisin B1 (positive ratio: 84.4%, range:2.5-314.5 g/kg), fumonisin B2 (positive ratio: 75.3%, range:1.6-72.8 g/kg), fumonisin B3 (positive ratio: 48%, range:1.0-203.6 g/kg), aflatoxin B1 (positive ratio: 29.9%, range: 0.39-14.7 g/kg), sterigmatocystin (positive ratio: 29.9%, range: 1.4-51.6 g/kg), and tenuazonic acid (positive ratio: 19.5%, range 36.1-105.7 g/kg) were the most frequent mycotoxin contaminants.

The pandemic pushed the teaching of anatomy, histology and embryology out of the classroom and labs, across states, countries, and continents. It demanded an immense effort and adaptability, especially from faculty. Teaching through the thick of the pandemic has been the challenge of a lifetime to instructors, doctors, educators. We are living through what may be the most difficult time in the history of global healthcare. The pandemic threw us off our paths and demanded more than training, more than skills. It demanded our passion and our courage. Our willingness to lean into our values and embrace our purpose: the success of our students. All the rules were changed as we navigated uncharted territories together. It was a call to courage and the Team of World Changers at Mount Sinai showed up, bravely, with all their passion, their curiosity to ask questions, try new modalities, and look for solutions out of their comfort zones. Mentors and experienced professors supported the system with humbleness and unparalleled openness, leaning into the vulnerable place of learning an entirely new set of skills in record time. The pandemic demanded resilience: that willingness to try again and again, with patience, flexibility and persistence. Structures is the first course of our medical school, encompassing Anatomy, Histology, and Embryology. It is traditionally a hands-on course which was moved to a 100% remote system in a matter of 3 months. We stripped ourselves from our identities and our voices, and went searching for something entirely new, yet authentic, still ours. Our bodies ached and our minds were drained at the end of working days of 12, 14, sometimes 24 hours, weekdays and weekends, as we strived to be the air under our student's wings. Zoom became our classroom, our lab, our meeting room, our offices, our everywhere;we acquired and repurposed resources, created new visualizations, developed new materials, expanded the team, reinvented ourselves, defied our boundaries as educators, and reached out farther than ever before. We accelerated the technological fluency of our teaching force and we dealt with questions of equality of learning, e.g. students in different time zones, disparity of internet speed, quality of hardware, not to mention the inherent isolation of the distance learning modality. And we succeeded. We got to teach and inspire our students. We got to learn and be inspired by them. We got to see them being curious and daring, discovering new ways to learn, and finding their own paths as they progressed in Structures, and in their career. We were rewarded with priceless joy and fulfillment. As we peak into the future, we see a world of possibilities and potential, coupling hands-on work and remote technology in the world of Anatomical Sciences and Medical Education. We know we can reach out our arms farther than ever before and spread knowledge at an even larger scale, prioritizing the quality of learning, and embracing our community anywhere in the world. At the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, we believe that ?impossible? is a temporary concept, and we pride ourselves of having the most passionate and compassionate thinkers and doers in our teams.

The COVID-19 pandemic represented the first large-scale opportunity to shed light into mechanisms of action, safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma using modern evidence-based medicine approaches. Studies ranging from observational case series to randomized controlled trials (RCT) have reported highly variable efficacy results for COVID-19 CP (CCP), resulting in more doubt than certainty. Reasons for CCP success and failure may be hidden in study details, which are usually difficult to explain to physicians and the public but provide fertile ground for designing next-generation studies. In this paper we analyzed variables associated with efficacy such as clinical settings, disease severity, CCP SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and function, dose, timing of administration (variously defined as time from onset of symptoms, molecular diagnosis, diagnosis of pneumonia, or hospitalization, or by serostatus), outcomes (defined as hospitalization, requirement for ventilation, clinical improvement or mortality), CCP provenance and time for collection, and criteria for efficacy. Focusing only on the results from the 23 available RCT we noted that these were more likely to show signals of efficacy, including reductions in mortality, if the plasma neutralizing titer was [] 160 and the time to randomization was [] 9 days, consistent with passive antibody therapy efficacy requiring dosing with sufficient antibody.

To develop a simple, rapid, accurate, and high-throughput detection method for diagnosis and differential diagnosis on swine enteric coronaviruses, specific primers and probes were designed based on the highly conserved regions of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) N, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) M, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) M, and porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV) N genes respectively. A TaqMan-probe-based multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay was developed and optimized to simultaneously detect these swine enteric coronaviruses. The results showed that the limit of detection can reach as low as 10 copies in singular real-time RT-qPCR assays and 100 copies in multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay, with all correlation coefficients (R(2)) at above 0.99, and the amplification efficiency at between 90 and 120%. This multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay demonstrated high sensitivity, extreme specificity, and excellent repeatability. The multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay was then employed to detect the swine enteric coronavirus from 354 field diarrheal samples.

Severity of several inflammation-related diseases has been associated with autoantibodies against RAS, particularly agonistic autoantibodies for angiotensin type-1 receptors (AA-AT1) and autoantibodies against ACE2 (AA-ACE2). Disease severity of COVID-19 patients was defined as mild, moderate or severe following the WHO Clinical Progression Scale and determined at medical discharge. Serum AA-AT1 and AA-ACE2 were measured in COVID-19 patients (n = 119) and non-infected controls (n = 23) using specific solid-phase, sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Serum LIGHT (TNFSF14; tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 14) levels were measured with the corresponding assay kit. At diagnosis, AA-AT1 and AA-ACE2 levels were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group relative to controls, and we observed significant association between disease outcome and serum AA-AT1 and AA-ACE2 levels. Mild disease patients had significantly lower levels of AA-AT1 (p < 0.01) and AA-ACE2 (p < 0.001) than moderate and severe patients. No significant differences were detected between males and females. The increase in autoantibodies was not related to comorbidities potentially affecting COVID-19 severity. There was significant positive correlation between serum levels of AA-AT1 and LIGHT (TNFSF14; rPearson = 0.70, p < 0.001). Both AA-AT1 (by agonistic stimulation of AT1 receptors) and AA-ACE2 (by reducing conversion of Angiotensin II into Angiotensin 1-7) may lead to increase in AT1 receptor activity, enhance proinflammatory responses and severity of COVID-19 outcome. Patients with high levels of autoantibodies require more cautious control after diagnosis.

This detection can remain positive for weeks without implying virus viability. Methods: We have performed cell culture to assess viral replication in 106 respiratory samples rRT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 from 105 patients with COVID-19. Fifty were samples from 50 patients with mild forms of COVID-19 who did not require hospital admission. Fifty-six samples were obtained from 55 hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia. Samples were obtained at different time points covering the time from clinical diagnosis to the follow up during hospital care. Results: In 49 samples (49/106, 46.2%) a cytopathic effect (CPE) was detected in cell culture. Our study demonstrates that while in patients with mild COVID-19, viral viability is maintained in fact up to 10 days in patients with severe COVID-19 the virus can remain viable for up to 32 days after the onset of symptoms. Patients with severe COVID-19 as compared with mild cases, presented infective virus in a significantly higher proportion in samples with moderate or low viral load (Ct value > 26): 22/46 (47.8%) versus 7/38 (18.4%), (p <0.01), respectively. Conclusions: Persistent SARS-CoV-2 replication could be demonstrated in severe COVID-19 cases for periods up to 32 days after the onset of symptoms and even at high Ct values. COVID-19 severity is a more determining factor for viral viability than the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms or the Ct value obtained in the RT-PCR assay.","output":"Persistent SARS-CoV-2 replication in severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Data suggest that there were disparities in H1N1 vaccine uptake, and these may inform COVID-19 vaccination efforts. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate disparities in H1N1 vaccine uptake, factors contributing to disparities, and interventions to reduce them. METHODS: We searched English-language articles in MEDLINE ALL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception through May 8, 2020. Observational studies examining H1N1 vaccine uptake by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, rurality, and disability status in US settings were included. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility. Single-reviewer data abstraction was confirmed by a second reviewer. We conducted independent dual quality assessment, and collective strength of evidence assessment. RESULTS: We included 21 studies. African American/Black, Latino, and low-socioeconomic status participants had disproportionately lower H1N1 vaccination rates (low- to moderate-strength evidence). However, Latinos were more likely than Whites to intend to be vaccinated, and African American/Blacks and participants with lower-socioeconomic status were just as likely to intend to be vaccinated as their White and higher-socioeconomic status counterparts (low-strength evidence). Vaccine uptake for other groups has been insufficiently studied. Factors potentially contributing to disparities in vaccine uptake included barriers to vaccine access, inadequate information, and concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy. Studies were largely cross-sectional. Many of the studies are a decade old and were conducted in the context of a different pandemic. The categorization of racial and ethnic groups was not consistent across studies and not all groups were well-studied. DISCUSSION: Efforts to avoid disparities in COVID-19 vaccination uptake should prioritize vaccine accessibility and convenience in African American/Black, Latino, and low-SES communities; engage trusted stakeholders to share vaccine information; and address concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy.

Current health policies discourage mass sampling, preferring to focus on the corrective treatment of severe cases. Outpatients are only advised to undergo brief voluntary confinement and symptomatic treatment, with no follow-up. Therefore, the present study aimed to analyze sex, age, and viral load in outpatients during the four waves in a medium-sized city in Mexico. For each wave, the date of peak contagion was identified, and data were collected within 15 days. In this regard, data from 916 patients (434 men and 482 women) were analyzed. The age range of positive patients (37C45 years) presented a higher frequency during the first and third waves, while 28C36 years was the most frequent age range during the second and fourth waves, while the viral load values were significantly higher, for both sexes, during the fourth wave.

The aim of this study was to evaluate if DDX3 is a useful prognosticator for MBC patients. Nuclear as well as cytoplasmic DDX3 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry in a Dutch retrospective cohort of 106 MBC patients. Differences in 10-year survival by DDX3 expression were analyzed using log-rank test. The association between clinicopathologic variables, DDX3 expression, and survival was tested in uni- and multivariate Cox-regression analysis. High cytoplasmic DDX3 was associated with high androgen receptor (AR) expression while low nuclear DDX3 was associated with negative lymph node status. Nuclear and cytoplasmic DDX3 were not associated with each other. In a univariate analysis, high cytoplasmic DDX3 (p = 0.045) was significantly associated with better 10-year overall survival. In multivariate analyses, cytoplasmic DDX3 had independent prognostic value (p = 0.017).

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a genetic detection method based on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is used in global RSV surveillance. In Japan, immunoassay-based rapid antigen detection kits are widely used for the detection of RSV. In this study, an ultra-rapid real-time RT-PCR method for the rapid detection of RSV was developed using the PCR1100 device based on the US CDC assay in order to detect RSV in comparable time to rapid test kits. The ultra-rapid real-time RT-PCR could detect RSV viral RNA in less than 20 min while maintaining sensitivity and specificity comparable to conventional real-time RT-PCR using large installed instruments. Furthermore, combining ultra-rapid real-time RT-PCR with the M1 Sample Prep kit reduced the total working time for the detection of RSV from clinical specimen to less than 25 min, suggesting this method could be used for point-of-care RSV testing.","output":"An Ultra-Rapid Real-Time RT-PCR Method Using PCR1100 for Detecting Human Orthopneumovirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic started in late 2002 and swiftly spread across 5 continents with a mortality rate of around 10%.

Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) infects cattle and wild ruminants, both as a respiratory and enteric pathogen, and possesses a significant economic threat to the cattle industry. Transcription factors are proteins that activate or inhibit transcription through DNA binding and have become new targets for disease therapies. This study utilized in silico tools to identify potential transcription factors that can serve as biomarkers for regulation of BCoV pathogenesis in cattle, both for testing and treatment. A total of 11 genes were identified as significantly expressed during BCoV infection through literature searches and functional analyses. Eleven transcription factors were predicted to target those genes (AREB6, YY1, LMO2, C-Rel, NKX2-5, E47, RORAlpha1, HLF, E4BP4, ARNT, CREB). Function, network, and phylogenetic analyses established the significance of many transcription factors within the immune response. This study establishes new information on the transcription factors and genes related to host-pathogen interactome in BCoV infection, particularly transcription factors YY1, AREB6, LMO2, and NKX2, which appear to have strong potential as diagnostic markers, and YY1 as a potential target for drug therapies.","output":"Dissecting Transcription Factor-Target Interaction in Bovine Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While vaccines and antivirals are now being deployed for the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we require additional antiviral therapeutics to not only effectively combat SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, but also future coronaviruses. All coronaviruses have relatively similar genomes that provide a potential exploitable opening to develop antiviral therapies that will be effective against all coronaviruses. Among the various genes and proteins encoded by all coronaviruses, one particularly \\"druggable\\" or relatively easy-to-drug target is the coronavirus Main Protease (3CLpro or Mpro), an enzyme that is involved in cleaving a long peptide translated by the viral genome into its individual protein components that are then assembled into the virus to enable viral replication in the cell. Inhibiting Mpro with a small-molecule antiviral would effectively stop the ability of the virus to replicate, providing therapeutic benefit. In this study, we have utilized activity-based protein profiling (ABPP)-based chemoproteomic approaches to discover and further optimize cysteine-reactive pyrazoline-based covalent inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Structure-guided medicinal chemistry and modular synthesis of di- and tri-substituted pyrazolines bearing either chloroacetamide or vinyl sulfonamide cysteine-reactive warheads enabled the expedient exploration of structure-activity relationships (SAR), yielding nanomolar potency inhibitors against Mpro from not only SARS-CoV-2, but across many other coronaviruses.

Multiple COVID-19 outbreaks occurred in agricultural settings, including a large outbreak among employees of a fruit grower during May-August. Because of this outbreak, Okanogan County Public Health and the Washington State Department of Health initiated one-time, on-site screening testing (2) of all orchard and warehouse employees in August 2020 and assessed risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among 3,708 known orchard employees, a valid SARS-CoV-2 test result or information on COVID-19-like symptoms in the absence of a test was available for 3,013 (81%). Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during approximately 3 months among tested orchard employees was 6%. Cumulative incidence was 12% in employees residing in the community, compared with 4% in employees residing in farmworker housing (p<0.001); point prevalence during the single screening testing event was 1% in both groups. Among 1,247 known warehouse employees, a valid result was available for 726 (58%). Cumulative incidence over approximately 3 months among tested warehouse employees was 23%, with substantial variation across job roles. Positive test results were received by 28% of employees who worked packing and sorting fruit, 24% of those in other roles in the packing and sorting area, 10% of forklift operators, 7% of employees in other warehouse roles, and 6% of office employees. Point prevalence among all warehouse workers was 1% at the screening testing event.

In the absence of a proven vaccine or cure, non-pharmaceutical interventions including social distancing, testing and contact tracing, isolation, and wearing of masks are essential in the fight against the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. We use data envelopment analysis and data compiled from Worldometers and The World Bank to analyze how efficient the use of resources were to stabilize the rate of infections and minimize death rates in the top 36 countries that represented 90% of global infections and deaths out of 220 countries as of November 11, 2020. This is the first paper to model the technical efficiency of countries in managing the COVID-19 pandemic by modeling death rates and infection rates as undesirable outputs using the approach developed by You and Yan. We find that the average efficiency of global healthcare systems in managing the pandemic is very low, with only six efficient systems out of a total of 36 under the variable returns to scale assumption. This finding suggests that, holding constant the size of their healthcare systems (because countries cannot alter the size of a healthcare system in the short run), most of the sample countries showed low levels of efficiency during this time of managing the pandemic; instead it is suspected that most countries literally threw resources at fighting the pandemic, thereby probably raising inefficiency through wasted resource use.","output":"Global Healthcare Resource Efficiency in the Management of COVID-19 Death and Infection Prevalence Rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Elevated urban Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) is a consequence of road traffic and other fossil-fuel combustion sources, and the road transport sector provides a significant contribution to UK NO2 emissions. The inhalation of traffic-related air pollution, including NO2, can cause a range of problems to human health. Due to their developing organs, children are particularly susceptible to the negative effects of air pollution inhalation. Accordingly, schools and associated travel behaviours present an important area of study for the reduction of child exposure to these harmful pollutants. COVID-19 reached the UK in late January 2020. On the 23rd of March that year, the UK government announced a nationwide stay-at-home order, or lockdown, banning all non-essential travel and contact with people outside of their own homes. The lockdown was accompanied by the closure of schools, public facilities, amenities, businesses and places of worship. The current study aims to assess the significance of nationwide NO2 reductions at schools in England as a consequence of the lockdown in order to highlight the benefits of associated behavioural changes within the context of schools in England and potential child exposure. NO2 data were collected from all AURN (Automatic Urban and Rural Network) monitoring sites within 500 m of nurseries, primary schools, secondary schools and colleges in England. A significant reduction of mean NO2 concentrations was observed in the first month of the UK lockdown at background (-35.13%) and traffic (-40.82%) sites. Whilst lockdown restrictions are undoubtedly unsustainable, the study results demonstrate the possible reductions of NO2 at schools in England and potential reductions of child exposure that are achievable when public behaviours shift towards active travel, work from home policies and generally lower use of polluting vehicles.","output":"Traffic-related air pollution reduction at UK schools during the Covid-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Todays situation in the universities of the world is virtual learning during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.

Optogenetically mimicking this increase in fronto-striatal activity reduced compulsive grooming behavior in KO mice. Conversely, inhibiting this circuit in wild-type mice increased grooming. Finally, we demonstrate that ketamine blocks the exacerbation of grooming in KO mice caused by optogenetically inhibiting fronto-striatal activity.

Besides pulmonary injury, SARS-CoV-2 also causes cardiac injury, but the exact mechanisms are unclear. This review summarizes the essential structural characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), describes the cardiac manifestations following SARS-CoV-2 infection, and explores the mechanisms of cardiac injury targeting ACE2 after the viral invasion. We aim to help the timely detection of related symptoms and implementation of therapeutic measures by clinicians for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Research Progress on the Cardiac Injury from ACE2 Targeting in SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We implement Epstein-Nesbet perturbative corrections in the third-order for the initiator approximation of the configuration space quantum Monte Carlo.

METHODS: The participants' training behaviour before and during the Covid-19 pandemic was surveyed. Furthermore, the acceptance and usability of the Retina Case App was evaluated using the System Usability Scale (SUS). A possible influence of the app on everyday clinical practice was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 145 ophthalmologists participated in the survey. The frequency of continuing medical education did not decrease for 62.8% of ophthalmologists during the pandemic. A significant increase in at least monthly use of online courses or lectures has been observed (90.3% vs. 28.2%, p<0.001). No significant difference was identified in terms of frequency of use of print and digital journals or printed textbooks. The majority of participants stated that online training platforms are well suited to replace the absence of face-to-face events (73.8%). The mean SUS score was 87.7 (SD 11.9), which categorises the app's usability as excellent. The majority agreed that the newly developed app enables faster learning (82.1%) and leads to an increased motivation (71.7%). Most ophthalmologists (80.7%) felt that regular use of the app would improve confidence in the treatment of retinal diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a significant change in training behaviour in ophthalmology towards e-learning and online courses, which has not been accompanied by a general decline in training activity.

DC-SIGN (Dendritic Cell-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Non-integrin) is a protein expressed in antigen-presenting cells that recognizes a variety of glycan epitopes. Until now, the binding of DC-SIGN to SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein has been reported in various articles and is regarded to be a factor in systemic infection and cytokine storm. The mechanism of DC-SIGN recognition offers an alternative method for discovering new medication for COVID-19 treatment. Here, we discovered three potential pockets that hold different glycan epitopes by performing molecular dynamics simulations of previously reported oligosaccharides. The EPN motif, NDD motif, and Glu354 form the most critical pocket, which is known as the Core site. We proposed that the type of glycan epitopes, rather than the precise amino acid sequence, determines the recognition. Furthermore, we deduced that oligosaccharides could occupy an additional site, which adds to their higher affinity than monosaccharides. Based on our findings and previously described glycoforms on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, we predicted the potential glycan epitopes for DC-SIGN. It suggested that glycan epitopes could be recognized at multiple sites, not just Asn234, Asn149 and Asn343.

There are now over 30 clinical trials evaluating if BCG vaccination can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19. However, the mechanism by which BCG vaccination can induce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific T cell responses is unknown. Here, we identify 8 novel BCG-derived peptides with significant sequence homology to either SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 or NSP13-derived peptides. Using an in vitro co-culture system, we show that human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells primed with a BCG-derived peptide developed enhanced reactivity to its corresponding homologous SARS-CoV-2-derived peptide. As expected, HLA differences between individuals meant that not all persons developed immunogenic responses to all 8 BCG-derived peptides. Nevertheless, all of the 20 individuals that were primed with BCG-derived peptides developed enhanced T cell reactivity to at least 7 of 8 SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency and safety of the COVID-19 medicine. METHODS: Studies were determined through searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Medline. The studies of COVID-19 medicine were involved with eligible end points containing mortality, discharge rate, rate of clinical improvement, and rate of serious adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 33 studies involving 37,879 patients were included in our study, whose intervening measures contained three major types of COVID-19 medicine, ACEI/ARB, antiviral medicine, and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. Compared to control group, COVID-19 drugs have no distinct effect on mortality (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.79-1.11, Pa=a.43) and discharge rate (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.98-1.14, Pa=a.13). However, antiviral medicine presents the obvious advantage in clinical improvement (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.23, Pa<a.05). In addition, the serious adverse events rate (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63-0.88, Pa<a.05) of COVID-19 medicine is lower than control group. CONCLUSION: The results indicated antiviral medicine was potential specific medicine for COVID-19 treatment by improving clinical symptoms, but it failed to increase the discharge rate and reduce mortality.

The COVID-19 pandemic goes along with increased mortality from acute respiratory disease, and measures to limit the spread of the infection go along with increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, especially among high risk groups. It has been suggested that vitamin D3 supplementation might help to reduce respiratory disease mortality. Methods. We assessed the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency, defined by 25(OH)D blood levels of 30-50 and <30 nmol/L, respectively, and their association with mortality from respiratory diseases during 15 years of follow-up in a cohort of 9,548 adults aged 50-75 years from Saarland, Germany. Results. Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency were common (44% and 15%, respectively). Compared to sufficient vitamin D status, respiratory disease mortality was 2.1 (95%-CI 1.3-3.2)- and 3.0 (95%-CI 1.8-5.2)-fold increased, respectively. Although significant increases were seen in both women and men, they were much stronger among women, with 8.5 (95% CI 2.4-30.1) and 2.3 (95% CI 1.1-4.4)-fold increase of respiratory disease mortality in case of vitamin D deficiency among women and men, respectively (p-value for interaction =0.041). Overall, 41% (95% CI 20%-58%) of respiratory disease mortality was statistically attributable to vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. Conclusion.

The current standard of care is especially poor in patients with a constitutively active form of EGFR, EGFRvIII, which is associated with shorter survival time. This study examined the effect of GZ17-6.02, a novel anti-cancer agent undergoing phase 1 studies, on two EGFRvIII+ glioblastoma stem cells: D10-0171 and D317. In vitro analyses showed that GZ17-6.02 inhibited the growth of both D10-0171 and D317 cells with IC50 values of 24.84 and 28.28 g/mL respectively. RNA sequencing and reverse phase protein array analyses revealed that GZ17-6.02 downregulates pathways primarily related to steroid synthesis and cell cycle progression. Interestingly, G17-6.02's mechanism of action involves the downregulation of the recently identified glioblastoma super-enhancer genes WSCD1, EVOL2, and KLHDC8A. Finally, a subcutaneous xenograft model showed that GZ17-6.02 inhibits glioblastoma growth in vivo. We conclude that GZ17-6.02 is a promising combination drug effective at inhibiting the growth of a subset of glioblastomas and our data warrants further preclinical studies utilizing xenograft models to identify patients that may respond to this drug.","output":"GZ17-6.02 Inhibits the Growth of EGFRvIII+ Glioblastoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Numerous nucleic acid amplification assays utilizing different target genes of the SARS-CoV-2 genome have received emergency use authorization (EUA) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Limited data are available comparing the test performance characteristics of these assays. METHODS: A diagnostic comparison study was performed to evaluate the performance of the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay compared to the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay using clinical nasopharyngeal specimens. Agreement between the two assays was assessed by overall, positive, and negative percent agreement and Cohens kappa coefficient. RESULTS: A total of 104 (54 positive and 50 negative) clinical nasopharyngeal samples were tested by both assays. Using the Panther Fusion as a reference standard, the Xpert demonstrated an overall agreement of 99.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 94.8 C 100), positive percent agreement of 98.1% (95% CI: 90.1 C 100), and a negative percent agreement of 100% (95% CI: 94.2 C 100). The kappa coefficient was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.94 C 1.0). One sample positive by the Panther Fusion with a cycle threshold (Ct) of 38.6 was found to be reproducibly negative by the Xpert assay.

The SARS-CoV-2 genome consists of approximately 30 kb single-stranded RNA that is too large to analyze the whole genome by Sanger sequencing. Thus, in this study, we performed Sanger sequencing following long-range RT-PCR of the entire SARS-CoV-2 S-gene and analyzed the mutational dynamics. METHODS: The 4 kb region, including the S-gene, was amplified by two-step long-range RT-PCR. Then, the entire S-gene sequence was determined by Sanger sequencing. The amino acid mutations were identified as compared with the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome. RESULTS: The S:D614G mutation was found in all samples. The R.1 variants were detected after January 2021. Alpha variants started to emerge in April 2021. Delta variants replaced Alpha in July 2021. Then, Omicron variants were detected after December 2021. These mutational dynamics in samples collected in the Chiba University Hospital were similar to those in Japan. CONCLUSION: The emergence of variants of concern (VOC) has been reported by the entire S-gene analysis.

PURPOSE: To appraise current evidence of the effects of physiotherapy on symptoms and functioning in ME/CFS patients in view of the significance of PEM in the applied diagnostic criteria for inclusion. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials published over the last two decades was conducted. Studies evaluating physiotherapeutic interventions for adult ME/CFS patients were included. The diagnostic criteria sets were classified into three groups according to the extent to which the importance of PEM was emphasized: chronic fatigue (CF; PEM not mentioned as a criterion), CFS (PEM included as an optional or minor criterion) or ME (PEM is a required symptom). The main results of included studies were synthesized in relation to the classification of the applied diagnostic criteria. In addition, special attention was given to the tolerability of the interventions. RESULTS: Eighteen RCTs were included in the systematic review: three RCTs with CF patients, 14 RCTs with CFS patients and one RCT covering ME patients with PEM.

These infections are associated with the development of a disease known as COVID-19, which is characterized by several symptoms, including persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, loss of taste or smell, and gastrointestinal distress. COVID-19 has been characterized by elevated mortality (over 100 thousand people have already died in the US alone), mostly due to thromboinflammatory complications that impair lung perfusion and systemic oxygenation in the most severe cases. While the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been associated with the severity of the disease, little is known about the impact of IL-6 levels on the proteome of COVID-19 patients. The present study provides the first proteomics analysis of sera from COVID-19 patients, stratified by circulating levels of IL-6, and correlated to markers of inflammation and renal function. As a function of IL-6 levels, we identified significant dysregulation in serum levels of various coagulation factors, accompanied by increased levels of anti-fibrinolytic components, including several serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs). These were accompanied by up-regulation of the complement cascade and antimicrobial enzymes, especially in subjects with the highest levels of IL-6, which is consistent with an exacerbation of the acute phase response in these subjects. Although our results are observational, they highlight a clear increase in the levels of inhibitory components of the fibrinolytic cascade in severe COVID-19 disease, providing potential clues related to the etiology of coagulopathic complications in COVID-19 and paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions, such as the use of pro-fibrinolytic agents.","output":"Serum proteomics in COVID-19 patients: Altered coagulation and complement status as a function of IL-6 level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected the healthcare system in a major way generally.

In the past, the administration of convalescent plasma of patients having recovered from SARS and severe influenza to patients actively having the disease showed promising effects on mortality and appeared safe. Whether or not this also holds true for the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently unknown. METHODS: DAWn-Plasma is a multicentre nation-wide, randomized, open-label, phase II proof-of-concept clinical trial, evaluating the clinical efficacy and safety of the addition of convalescent plasma to the standard of care in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Belgium. Patients hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 are eligible when they are symptomatic (i.e. clinical or radiological signs) and have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the 72 h before study inclusion through a PCR (nasal/nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage) or a chest-CT scan showing features compatible with COVID-19 in the absence of an alternative diagnosis. Patients are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either standard of care and convalescent plasma (active treatment group) or standard of care only. The active treatment group receives 2 units of 200 to 250 mL of convalescent plasma within 12 h after randomization, with a second administration of 2 units 24 to 36 h after ending the first administration. The trial aims to include 483 patients and will recruit from 25 centres across Belgium. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients that require mechanical ventilation or have died at day 15. The main secondary endpoints are clinical status on day 15 and day 30 after randomization, as defined by the WHO Progression 10-point ordinal scale, and safety of the administration of convalescent plasma. DISCUSSION: This trial will either provide support or discourage the use of convalescent plasma as an early intervention for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection.

Special attention is paid to local social services for the elderly as a group recognised as most vulnerable to COVID-19. A survey of representatives of territorial centres of social services in Ukraine, conducted in August 2020, revealed some problems caused by restrictive quarantine measures and positive changes in the centres. The study highlights some surprising contradictions in the impact of the pandemic on social work practice with the elderly. Social services providers in local communities (territorial centres of social services, social services centres for families, children, youth, etc.) received almost no additional support during the quarantine. Yet, they consider introducing new, distant forms of communication, adjusting the work schedule, etc., as positive changes in service provision.The study determines that the response to the challenges of a problematic situation depends on local characteristics and mostly on human resources - work organisation and professional adaptability. An important role belongs to the ability of social workers to act in emergencies, the availability of standard procedures, protocols, and resources for use in such situations, understanding the need to adhere to values of social solidarity.

Since TNF- plays a role in immune-mediated processes we evaluated the levels of TNF-/TNF- receptors and the downstream signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) during disease in both retinal degeneration susceptible BALB/c and degeneration resistant CD-1 mice. Following coronavirus injection, TNF- mRNA was detected at higher levels within the retinas, and concentrations of TNF- (p < 0.005) and sTNFR1 (p < 0.0005) proteins were increased within the sera of BALB/c but not CD-1 mice. While concentrations of sTNFR2 proteins were elevated in both BALB/c (p < 0.00005) and CD-1 (p < 0.005) mice compared to controls, concentrations were higher in BALB/c mice (p < 0.0005). Gene expression of iNOS while initially high in BALB/c mice decreased during the acute phase of infection, while it increased in CD-1 mice. These trends are attributable to differences in monocyte TNFR2 release (p < 0.0005) between the strains since sTNFR2 decreased (p < 0.01) levels of NO production. These studies demonstrate that retinal degeneration following viral infection is associated with increased release of TNF-/TNF receptors combined with a down-regulation of NO.

Until data from clinical studies are available to provide solid evidence for worldwide applicable guidelines, there is a need to provide guidance to the transfusion community and researchers on this emergent therapeutic option. This paper aims to identify existing key gaps in current knowledge in the clinical application of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) initiated a multidisciplinary working group with worldwide representation from all six continents with the aim of reviewing existing practices on CCP use from donor, product and patient perspectives. A subgroup of clinical transfusion professionals was formed to draft a document for CCP clinical application to identify the gaps in knowledge in existing literature. RESULTS: Gaps in knowledge were identified in the following main domains: study design, patient eligibility, CCP dose, frequency and timing of CCP administration, parameters to assess response to CCP treatment and long-term outcome, adverse events and CCP application in less-resourced countries as well as in paediatrics and neonates. CONCLUSION: This paper outlines a framework of gaps in the knowledge of clinical deployment of CPP that were identified as being most relevant.

The analyses indicate that the Covid-19 pandemic affected both the initiation of clinical trials overall and the initiation of non-Covid-19 trials. An increase in the overall numbers of clinical trials could be observed both in Europe and the US in 2020 as compared to 2019. However, the number of non-Covid-19 trials initiated is reduced as compared to the previous decade, with a slightly larger relative decrease in the US as compared to Europe. Additionally, the monthly trend for the initiation of non-Covid-19 trials differs between regions. In the US, after a sharp decrease in April 2020, trial numbers reached the levels of 2019 from June 2020 onwards.

However, due to their charge, zinc ions are not able to pass the lipid bilayer and enter the cell. Thus, it was determined that selpercatinib could act as an ionophore, effectively transporting active zinc ions into cells. Furthermore, various quantum mechanical analyses, including energy studies, evaluation of the reactivity parameters, examination of the electron localisation and delocalisation properties, as well as assessment of the nonlinear optical (NLO) properties and information entropy, were conducted herein. The performed docking studies (docking scores ?9.3169, ?9.1002, ?8.1853 and ?8.1222 kcal mol(?1)) demonstrated that selpercatinib strongly bound with four isolated SARS-CoV-2 proteins.","output":"Structural investigations, quantum mechanical studies on proton and metal affinity and biological activity predictions of selpercatinib"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread, swift actions and preparation are critical for ensuring the best outcomes for patients and providers. We aim to describe our hospital and Department of Surgerys experience in preparing for the COVID-19 pandemic and caring for surgical patients during this unprecedented time. Study Design This is a descriptive study outlining the strategy of a single academic health system for addressing the following 4 critical issues facing surgical departments during the COVID-19 pandemic: developing a cohesive leadership team and system for frequent communication throughout the department; ensuring adequate hospital capacity to care for an anticipated influx of COVID-19 patients; safeguarding supplies of blood products and personal protective equipment to protect patients and providers; and preparing for an unstable workforce due to illness and competing personal priorities, such as childcare. Results Through collaborative efforts within the Department of Surgery and hospital, we provided concise and regular communication, reduced operating room volume by 80%, secured a 4-week supply of personal protective equipment, and created reduced staffing protocols with back-up staffing plans. Conclusions By developing an enabling infrastructure, a department can nimbly respond to crises like COVID-19 by promoting trust among colleagues and emphasizing an unwavering commitment to excellent patient care.

This has led to a series of pathogens developing antibiotic resistance, which poses severe threats to public health systems while also driving up the costs of hospitalization and treatment. Moreover, without proper action and collaboration between academic and health institutions, a catastrophic trend might develop, with the possibility of returning to a pre-antibiotic era. Nevertheless, new emerging AI-based technologies have started to enter the field of antibiotic and drug development, offering a new perspective to an ever-growing problem. Cheaper and faster research can be achieved through algorithms that identify hit compounds, thereby further accelerating the development of new antibiotics, which represents a vital step in solving the current antibiotic crisis.

The new coronavirus pandemic, which appeared at the end of the year 2019, was the greatest in recent decades, and it affected almost all countries and economies, causing a highly significant number of deaths. Objectives. This study aimed to evaluate patients knowledge and attitude when experiencing potential COVID-19 symptoms toward reporting their illness and following viral preventive precautions. Material and methods. A cross-sectional study conducted among the general population in Al-Ahsa, Eastern region, Saudi Arabia. A self-administered questionnaire distributed among the general population, divided into three parts: Socio-demographic characteristics, previous COVID-19 infection and attitude toward experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. A total of 504 responses collected in this study from December 15, 2020 to January 15, 2021. Results. We found that 31.7% were positive among the participants who did COVID-19 testing (48.8%). The level of knowledge showed that more than half (52.2%) were classified at a low knowledge level, while the rest were classified as good (47.8%). Regarding attitude, nearly two-thirds (64.1%) showed a negative attitude, while 35.9% showed a positive attitude. The workplace during the pandemic and family history of COVID-19 were the factors associated with both good knowledge and a positive attitude. Conclusions. The knowledge and attitude toward reporting potential COVID-19 symptoms were generally suboptimal. Male participants, holders of a university degree in the medical field, health practitioners or having a family member working in the medical field demonstrated better knowledge, while those who had a COVID-19 test and those with a family history of the disease positively influenced the attitude.","output":"Patients attitude and practice toward reporting potential covid-19 symptoms among the al-ahsa population in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An innovation in developing the Supports Intensity Scale-Children's Version (SIS-C) was the adoption of latent variable modeling approaches to norm development.

A computer-aided diagnostic system capable of reducing uncertainties would have important clinical impact. To develop a computer-aided diagnosis method for classifying breast biopsy images into a range of diagnostic categories (benign, atypia, ductal carcinoma in situ, and invasive breast cancer), we introduce a transformer-based hollistic attention network called HATNet. Unlike state-of-the-art histopathological image classification systems that use a two pronged approach, i.e., they first learn local representations using a multi-instance learning framework and then combine these local representations to produce image-level decisions, HATNet streamlines the histopathological image classification pipeline and shows how to learn representations from gigapixel size images end-to-end. HATNet extends the bag-of-words approach and uses self-attention to encode global information, allowing it to learn representations from clinically relevant tissue structures without any explicit supervision. It outperforms the previous best network Y-Net, which uses supervision in the form of tissue-level segmentation masks, by 8%. Importantly, our analysis reveals that HATNet learns representations from clinically relevant structures, and it matches the classification accuracy of 87 U.S. pathologists for this challenging test set.","output":"End-to-End diagnosis of breast biopsy images with transformers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vancomycin plus piperacillinCtazobactam (VPT) is a commonly used antimicrobial regimen for septic patients. VPT is more nephrotoxic than other regimens such as vancomycin plus cefepime (VC) when given over several days. This risk of nephrotoxicity is less clear when VPT is given for initial empiric therapy in sepsis and de-escalated quickly based on evolving clinical information. The objective of this study was to assess nephrotoxicity among septic patients empirically treated with either VPT or VC at initial clinical presentation. We conducted a retrospective study of septic patients who received VPT or VC within 12 h of presentation to the emergency department. The primary outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI) and renal recovery 72 h after presentation. For the total of 418 patients, 306 received VPT and 112 received VC. Rates of AKI at 72 h were 15.2% for VPT patients and 11.0% for VC patients [p = 0.44]. Among patients with AKI at presentation, 16.3% of VPT patients had AKI at 72 h compared to 8.9% of VC patients [p = 0.19]. Among those without AKI at presentation, 14.2% VPT patients and 16.7% VC patients had AKI at 72 h [p = 0.71].

There is a lot of information about the COVID-19 pandemic, especially on the internet where people can create and share information quickly. This can lead to an infodemic, which is a challenge every government might face in the fight against pandemics. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand public attention toward the pandemic (from December 2019 to November 2020) through 7 types of sources: Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, blogs, news sites, forums, and e-commerce sites. METHODS: We collected and analyzed nearly 38 million pieces of text data from the aforementioned sources via SocialHeat, a social listening (infoveillance) platform developed by YouNet Group. We described not only public attention volume trends, discussion sentiments, top sources, top posts that gained the most public attention, and hot keyword frequency but also hot keywords' co-occurrence as visualized by the VOSviewer software tool. RESULTS: In this study, we reached four main conclusions. First, based on changing discussion trends regarding the COVID-19 subject, 7 periods were identified based on events that can be aggregated into two pandemic waves in Vietnam. Second, community pages on Facebook were the source of the most engagement from the public. However, the sources with the highest average interaction efficiency per article were government sources. Third, people's attitudes when discussing the pandemic have changed from negative to positive emotions. Fourth, the type of content that attracts the most interactions from people varies from time to time. Besides that, the issue-attention cycle theory occurred not only once but four times during the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that online resources can help the government quickly identify public attention to public health messages during times of crisis. We also determined the hot spots that most interested the public and public attention communication patterns, which can help the government get practical information to make more effective policy reactions to help prevent the spread of the pandemic.","output":"Social Media Insights During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Infodemiology Study Using Big Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Does the organisation of healthcare systems affect health outcomes? To answer this question, we analysed the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic by focusing on mortality rate outcomes and exploited the heterogeneity of the healthcare organisational models among Italian regions, which makes Italy an ideal laboratory. Within a common national healthcare system, Italian regions are allowed large autonomy to organise themselves as mixed-markets based on choice and competition, network or centralised leadership models, each delivering different responses to the Covid-19 emergency. Exploiting the discontinuity of healthcare organisational models across the Italian regional borders around Lombardy  the region that most convincingly embraced the mixed-market model fostering competition among health service providers  we applied a difference in geographic regression discontinuity design (DiD-GRDD) to compare mortality rates in 2020 of Lombardys municipalities with that of neighboring municipalities in other regions and also exploited the pre-crisis period (2017-2019). Our analysis shows that mortality rates in Lombardy during the first wave were higher by 1-2 percentage points among the population of residents aged 80 years or more, compared to the past, as opposed to regions adopting different organisational models. The mortality rate differential disappeared during the second wave following the implementation of a national policy based on risk zones, limiting mobility and taking stock of the experience developed during the first wave. Finally, by investigating the channels causing higher mortality during the first wave, we show that the role of organisational model differences vanishes, as differential mortality is mostly explained by the decision of the Lombardy regional government to use care homes for hosting Covid-19 patients and reduce the excess demand on the hospital system.","output":"Administrative Border Effects in COVID-19 Related Mortality (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Despite the therapeutic advances, disease recurrence remains an ever-present threat to the health and well-being of breast cancer survivors. Assessment of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and cancer stem cells (CSCs) during and after treatment may be of value in refining treatment. Methods Three 5 mL blood samples were taken from each patient: the first, at diagnosis; the second, after completion of neoadjuvant anthracyclin-based chemotherapy; and the third, a month after surgery and completion of adjuvant radiotherapy. The absolute numbers of CTCs were identified as CD45-cytokeratin+ cells. CTCs per 5 mL of blood were determined by recording all events in the whole suspension. CSCs were identified as cytokeratin+CD44+CD24-/CD45- cells. The CSCs were expressed as a percentage of CTCs. Results Univariate analysis identified the measurements of baseline CTCs and CSCs, taken after chemotherapy and one month after the cessation of radiotherapy, as prognostic factors for both four-year disease-free survival and four-year overall survival. Multivariable analysis identified the third measurement of CSCs, taken one month after the completion of radiotherapy, as the only independent prognostic factor for the four-year disease-free survival (P < 0.002, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.231, 95% CI 1.077-1.407). The initial CTC measurement was the one factor that reached significance on multivariate analysis (P < 0.03, HR 1.969, 95% CI 1.092-3.551) for the four-year overall survival. Correlation was higher between CTC and CSC counts at diagnosis (r = 0.654, P < 0.001) than after chemotherapy (r = 0.317, P < 0.03), because of the more rapid decrease in the mean CTC count with chemotherapy. Conclusion The CTC count could be suitable as one of the measures for monitoring response to chemotherapy, while persistence of CSC after cessation of the treatment of nonmetastatic breast cancer, except hormonal therapy when indicated, may be a reason to consider additional therapy in the future.

As a methodology, 16 nurseries (total of 35 classrooms) were selected to measure the indoor air quality compared with WHO IAQ Standard, and identify the daily concentration change of the pollutants. Based on the measurements, IAQ improvements for selected facilities are carried out to compare the results before and after improvement. The result has shown that the concentration of Carbon Dioxide (CO(2)), Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC), Total Suspended Particles (TSP) and formaldehyde (CH(2)O) exceeds WHO IAQ standards. The concentration of CO(2) and TSP is changed mainly by physical activity of children and that of CH(2)O and TVOC is changed mainly by ventilation after school start. TVOC decreased by 46.4% and the TSP decreased by 21.7% after air purifier, but CH(2)O and TVOC increased 1.8C3.8 times after interior renovation with low-emission finishing materials. After new ventilation installation, the CH(2)O and TVOC reduced half and the TSP reduced one third.

Though this has been well characterized for both theoretical and empirical networks for the spread of epidemics on completely susceptible networks, the long-term impact of network structure on risk of infection with an endemic pathogen has been less well characterized. Here, we analyze detailed records of the transportation of cattle between farms in Turkey to characterize the global and local attributes of the shipments network between 2007-2012, building an aggregated static directed - weighted network. We study the correlation between network properties and the likelihood of infection with, or exposure to, foot-and-mouth (FMD) disease over the same time period using recorded outbreaks. The shipments network shows properties of small-worldness and scale-freeness (intermediate degrees), with an exponential cut-off for high degrees. The shipments network illustrates strong modularity and lack of assortativity. The shipments network shows signs of spatial constraints, with few long-distance connections, and a strong similarity to other spatially constrained networks. We find that farms that were either infected or at high risk of infection with FMD (within one link from an infected farm) had higher values of centrality; farms that were never less than 2 links from an infected farm had disproportionately low centrality. However, the correlation of the rankings of farms shows that central farms (high eigenvector centrality) are not necessarily those with more connections to/from it (in/out degree). Several central farms serve as bridges of densely connected farms (high betweenness centrality). These results suggest that to detect FMD spread, surveillance efforts could be focused preferentially on farms with centralities greater than the mean.","output":"Network structure and disease risk for an endemic infectious disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to be a pandemic in March 2020 due to growing case notification rates worldwide.

COVID-19 has highlighted the relationship between incarceration and health, but prior work has not explored how COVID-19 spread in communities have influenced case rates in prisons. Our objective was to understand the relationship between COVID-19 case rates in the general population and prisons located in the same county. METHODS: Using North Carolinas (NC) Department of Health and Human Services data, this analysis examines all COVID-19 tests conducted in NC from June-August 2020. Using interrupted time series analysis, we assessed the relationship between substantial community spread (50/100,000 detected in the last seven days) and active COVID-19 case rates (cases detected in the past 14 days/100,000) within prisons. RESULTS: From June-August 2020, NC ordered 29,605 tests from prisons and detected 1,639 cases. The mean case rates were 215 and 427 per 100,000 in the general and incarcerated population, respectively.

To investigate whether differences in the upper airway immune response could contribute to this disparity, we compared nasopharyngeal gene expression in 83 children (<19-years-old; 38 with SARS-CoV-2, 11 with other respiratory viruses, 34 with no virus) and 154 adults (>40-years-old; 45 with SARS-CoV-2, 28 with other respiratory viruses, 81 with no virus). Expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) was robustly activated in both children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the respective non-viral groups, with only relatively subtle distinctions. Children, however, demonstrated markedly greater upregulation of pathways related to B cell and T cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine signaling, including TNF, IFN, IL-2 and IL-4 production. Cell type deconvolution confirmed greater recruitment of B cells, and to a lesser degree macrophages, to the upper airway of children. Only children exhibited a decrease in proportions of ciliated cells, the primary target of SARS-CoV-2, upon infection with the virus. These findings demonstrate that children elicit a more robust innate and adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper airway that likely contributes to their protection from severe disease in the lower airway.","output":"Upper airway gene expression reveals a more robust innate and adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in children compared with older adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has already brought unprecedented challenges for public health and resulted in huge numbers of cases and deaths worldwide.

MethodsThe data were retrieved from an online panel of full-time employees (E- COCO- J). The analysis included participants who were employed and were not vaccinated at baseline (June 2021) but received vaccination at a four-month follow-up (October 2021). An 11-item scale measured the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines. Four types of psychosocial working conditions (i.e., job demands, job control, and supervisor and coworker support) were measured using the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ). Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between the psychosocial working conditions and side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, adjusting for gender, age, educational attainment, marital status, occupation, chronic disease, dose of vaccination, anxiety from potential side effects of vaccines, fear and worry about COVID-19, and psychological distress at baseline. ResultsOverall, 747 employees were included in the analysis. The average number of side effects was 3.78 (SD=2.19): Arm pain (81.1%), fatigues (64.1%), muscle pains (63.3%), and fever (37.5 degrees Celsius +) (53.5%) were reported more frequently. Coworker support score was significantly and negatively associated with the numbers of side effects (standardized {beta}=-0.122, p=0.017). Women, young age, second time vaccination, and high psychological distress were significantly associated with several side effects. ConclusionsEmployees with low coworker support may be more likely to have side effects after COVID-19 vaccinations. The findings of this study could inform employees with low coworker support that increasing workplace support may reduce the side effects. Highlights The effect of poor psychosocial working conditions on side effects after COVID-19 vaccinations was unknown. Poor coworker support at baseline was significantly associated with increased side effects after COVID-19 vaccinations. Informing workers with low coworker support about the findings may help them prepare for the side effect and motivate them to improve coworker support to reduce side effects.","output":"The effect of job strain and worksite social support on reported side effects of COVID-19 vaccine: a prospective study of employees in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To avoid the significant risks posed by the use of COVID-19 serology tests with supply chain constraints or poor performance characteristics, we developed an in-house SARS-CoV-2 total antibody test. Our test was compared with three commercial methods, and was used to determine COVID-19 seroprevalence among healthcare workers and outpatients in Minnesota. METHODS: Seventy-nine plasma and serum samples from 50 patients 4-69 days after symptom onset who tested positive by a SARS-CoV-2 PCR method using a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab were used to evaluate our test's clinical performance. Seropositive samples were analyzed for IgG titers in a follow-up assay. Thirty plasma and serum from 12 patients who tested negative by a SARS-CoV-2 PCR method using a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and 210 negative pre-pandemic serum samples were also analyzed. Among samples from patients > 14 days after symptom onset, the assay had 100% clinical sensitivity and 100% clinical specificity, 100% positive predictive value and 100% negative predictive value. Analytical specificity was 99.8%, indicating minimal cross-reactivity. A screening study was conducted to ascertain COVID-19 seroprevalence among healthcare workers and outpatients in Minnesota. RESULTS: Analysis of serum collected between April 13 and May 21, 2020 indicated a COVID-19 seroprevalence of 2.96% among 1,282 healthcare workers and 4.46% among 2,379 outpatients.

We examined how often published CEAs included non-health consequences and their impact on ICERs. We also reviewed 45 country-specific guidelines to examine recommended analytic perspectives. RESULTS: Study authors often mis-specified or did not clearly state the perspective used. After re-classification by registry reviewers, a healthcare sector or payer perspective was most prevalent (74%). CEAs rarely included unrelated medical costs and impacts on non-healthcare sectors. The most common non-health consequence included was productivity loss in the cost-per-QALY studies (12%) and patient transportation in the cost-per-DALY studies (21%). Of 19,946 cost-per-QALY ratios, the median ICER was $US26,000/QALY (interquartile range [IQR] 2900-110,000), and 18% were cost saving and QALY increasing. Of 5572 cost-per-DALY ratios, the median ICER was $US430/DALY (IQR 67-3400), and 8% were cost saving and DALY averting. Based on 16 cost-per-QALY studies (2017-2018) reporting 68 ICERs from both the healthcare sector and societal perspectives, the median ICER from a societal perspective ($US22,710/QALY [IQR 11,991-49,603]) was more favorable than from a healthcare sector perspective ($US30,402/QALY [IQR 10,486-77,179]).

Cells harboring a disrupted ADAM10 (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 10) allele survived reovirus infection, and subsequently ADAM10 was shown by RNA interference to be important for replication of HIV-1. RESULTS: Silencing ADAM10 expression with small interfering RNA (siRNA) 48 hours before infection significantly inhibited HIV-1 replication in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages and in CD4(+ )cell lines. In agreement, ADAM10 over-expression significantly increased HIV-1 replication. ADAM10 down-regulation did not inhibit viral reverse transcription, indicating that viral entry and uncoating are also independent of ADAM10 expression. Integration of HIV-1 cDNA was reduced in ADAM10 down-regulated cells; however, concomitant 2-LTR circle formation was not detected, suggesting that HIV-1 does not enter the nucleus. Further, ADAM10 silencing inhibited downstream reporter gene expression and viral protein translation. Interestingly, we found that while the metalloprotease domain of ADAM10 is not required for HIV-1 replication, ADAM15 and -secretase (which proteolytically release the extracellular and intracellular domains of ADAM10 from the plasma membrane, respectively) do support productive infection. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that ADAM10 facilitates replication at the level of nuclear trafficking. Collectively, our data support a model whereby ADAM10 is cleaved by ADAM15 and -secretase and that the ADAM10 intracellular domain directly facilitates HIV-1 nuclear trafficking.

Expression of prostate epithelial cell marker KLK3 was below detection in most tumours from castrated mice (62%, 23/37 mice), consistent with its known up-regulation by androgens. Endpoint tumour size after castration varied significantly in a PDX model-specific pattern; while most tumours were castration-sensitive (BM18, LuCaP70), the majority of LuCaP105 tumours continued to grow following castration. By contrast, LuCaP96 PDX showed a mixed response to castration. CTCs were detected in 33% of LuCaP105, 43% of BM18, 47% of LuCaP70, and 54% of LuCaP96 castrated mice using RPL32 mRNA measurement in plasma. When present, CTC numbers estimated using human RPL32 expression ranged from 1 to 458 CTCs per ml blood, similar to our previous observations in non-castrated mice. In contrast to their non-castrated counterparts, there was no relationship between tumour size and CTC burden in castrated mice. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the gene expression profiles of CTCs collected from castrated and non-castrated mice revealed distinct CTC sub-groups within the pooled population that were classified as having mesenchymal, epithelial, or EMP hybrid gene expression profiles. The epithelial signature was only found in CTCs from non-castrated mice. Hybrid and mesenchymal signatures were detected in CTCs from both castrated and non-castrated mice, with an emphasis towards mesenchymal phenotypes in castrated mice. Post-castration serum PSA levels were either below detection or very low for all the CTC positive samples highlighting the potential usefulness of CTCs for disease monitoring after androgen ablation therapy.

The association between the UA level and short-term outcomes were examined. RESULTS: The in-hospital mortality was 6.2% (69/1117). Patients with hyperuricemia carried a higher risk of in-hospital death (9.8% vs. 4.6%, p=0.001). Hyperuricemia was not an independent risk factor for in-hospital death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92-4.02, p=0.084).

Dual mutations at the two sites (N3D/N6D) did not affect particle assembly, virus-like particle formation and viral replication in culture cells. However, activation of the ER stress response was significantly reduced in cells infected with rN3D/N6D, correlated with a lower level of apoptosis and reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Finding historical film footage about a particular local setting, or a relevant topic, is time-consuming and difficult for the care staff. The Danish Film Institute - a government institution under the Ministry of Culture - set out to develop a platform that made part of their historical archive available for staff, to support the national agenda of creating a dementia-friendly society. METHOD: Based on knowledge from reminiscence theory, suitable archive footage was selected and grouped into four packages, consisting of several short film clips and supportive documents. The platform was tested on eight nursing home residents with a dementia diagnosed, in two groups of four. Each group performed one session per week for three weeks at the nursing home. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, only proxy data was collected in terms of interviews with a group leader and two on-site observers after every session, about their experiences with the material and their observed participant reactions. Data collection without the voices of the participants themselves was performed due to the need for obtaining at least proxy data on the effect of targeted film clip to stimulate frail elderlies with dementia - also in a pandemic lockdown situation. Informed consent from all participants was obtained. Data and ethics approval was done in accordance with Danish law. RESULTS: Although the archive content was not targeted people with declining cognitive function, the staff assessed the effect of this pedagogical dissemination of well-designed film clip content, as very positive in relation to the participants with dementia. The sessions managed to stimulate engaging discussion and storytelling about the participant's own life in what can be described as deep memory recollections. Some instances of transference of new knowledge about life history to daily care of the participants were reported.

Focusing on the problem of urban pollution from vehicle exhaust, this study used system dynamics to establish an urban congestion mitigation and emission-reduction management model. Specifically, a nonlinear function that integrates system dynamics and a non-homogeneous discrete grey model (SD-NDGM) was used to construct an algorithm, which improved the accuracy of the model. Thereafter, the mid- and long-term effects of the restriction policy were explored. The main findings from dynamic model simulations were as follows: All types of restrictions alleviated traffic congestion to varying degrees, but odd and even restrictions had more obvious effects, with an average annual reduction rate of 43.53% in the number of motor vehicle trips. The driving-restriction policy had a time effect, significantly reducing the number of vehicle trips in the short term. However, it could have negative effects in the long term (e.g., agglomeration effect, emission-reduction paradox), and it does not fundamentally solve traffic and environmental problems. Thus, it could only be used as a phased policy, not a long-term measure. The purchase-restriction policy controlled excessive increases in the number of private cars, but it had little effect in terms of solving environmental problems. Compared with a single policy, the combination of public-transport development and driving-restriction policy not only reduced traffic congestion, air pollution, and air quality health indexes by 29.13%, 52.63%, and 54.63%, respectively, but also improved environmental carrying capacity by 294.26%. A combined approach can therefore be said to have certain benefits for society, health, and the environment.

During the first lockdown, extrafamilial contact was significantly reduced. Many parents had to look after their children and work from home while the economic pressure increased. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between intimate partner violence (IPV) and mental health problems in children and adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional online survey 687 parents of underaged children in Germany were included. Demographic and psychosocial predictors for IPV and associations with mental health problems of children before and during the first lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed. The survey ran from 18 May 2020 to 21 July 2020 and the lockdown in Germany began on 23 March 2020 and ended via a gradual relaxation. The first schools reopened on 22 April and the opening of schools, kindergartens and daycare centers extended to the end of June 2020. RESULTS: Lower household incomes and the experience of own adverse childhood experiences increased the risk of participants reporting violence in their relationship. According to the participating parents, children and adolescents living in families in which violence was reported by intimate partners were more likely to have higher levels of externalizing problems before and during the pandemic. There were no significant differences with respect to emotional problems. CONCLUSION: Adverse childhood experiences increase the risk of intimate partner violence, which in turn increases the risk of mental health problems in the children.

While numerous studies have been published on immune responses triggered by vaccination, these often focus on studying the impact of one or two immunisation schemes within subpopulations such as immunocompromised individuals or healthcare workers. To provide information on the duration and quality of vaccine-induced immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed antibody titres against various SARS-CoV-2 antigens and ACE2 binding inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and variants of concern in samples from a large German population-based seroprevalence study (MuSPAD) who had received all currently available immunisation schemes. We found that homologous mRNA-based or heterologous prime-boost vaccination produced significantly higher antibody responses than vector-based homologous vaccination. Ad26.CoV2S.2 performance was particularly concerning with reduced titres and 91.7% of samples classified as non-responsive for ACE2 binding inhibition, suggesting that recipients require a booster mRNA vaccination. While mRNA vaccination induced a higher ratio of RBD- and S1-targeting antibodies, vector-based vaccines resulted in an increased proportion of S2-targeting antibodies. Given the role of RBD- and S1-specific antibodies in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2, their relative over-representation after mRNA vaccination may explain why these vaccines have increased efficacy compared to vector-based formulations. Previously infected individuals had a robust immune response once vaccinated, regardless of which vaccine they received, which could aid future dose allocation should shortages arise for certain manufacturers.

Consequently, many authors studied the onset and evolution of the cytokine storm. In contrast, other inflammatory mediators such as oxylipins have received almost no attention. MethodsWe conducted a monocentric observational and retrospective study (IMPRE-COVID-19) with patients (aged [] 18 years) admitted to Pisa University Hospital with COVID-19 related pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction in a nasopharyngeal swab, while pneumonia was demonstrated by CT scan. Oxylipin plasma levels were analysed in a convenient sample of 52 patients randomly selected from those that had a complete set of cytokine values evaluated for clinical purposes. In 12 cases, plasma samples collected on different days were available at the BMS Multispecialistic Biobank of Pisa University Hospital and were analysed to understand the evolution of the oxylipin levels during hospitalization. The two datasets that included oxylipin and cytokine values were analysed by principal component analysis (PCA), computation of Fishers canonical variable, and a multivariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. FindingsBetween March and April 2020, 52 patients were enrolled of which 28 were hospitalised in COVID-19 wards, 20 in ICUs, and 4 who were initially hospitalised in the wards and who were then transferred to the ICUs due to deteriorating health conditions. Plasma samples collected on different days were available from 7 patients in the wards, 1 from an ICU, and 4 from patients who were hospitalised in both. The mean age of participants was 61 years (SD 16), 11 were females (21%), and 41 were males (79%), without significant differences between groups in terms of age and gender. PCA of oxylipin data led to a clear differentiation of samples collected in COVID-19 wards and ICUs. This differentiation had not been obtained with cytokine data. In addition, borderline samples were from patients hospitalised in COVID-19 wards that were about to be transferred to the ICUs, thus suggesting that differentiation is not a consequence of a different treatment, but somehow related to a diverse evolution of the pathology. Computation of Fishers canonical variable identified the original input variables that were the most effective in discriminating between the two classes. The combination of the two datasets did not improve the discrimination, thus suggesting that oxylipins are more informative than cytokines for this purpose. A multivariate class model built using the four lowest-order principal components as the input variables, and COVID-19 ward samples as the target class, produced a ROC curve with a resulting area under the curve (AUC) equal to 0{middle dot}92 - which is much higher than most AUC outcomes obtained for individual oxylipins. InterpretationAfter analysing the metabolic pathways of the most informative oxylipins, we speculate that more severe COVID-19 is associated with a selective deficiency of pro-resolving oxylipins leading to ineffective resolutive mechanisms of inflammation, likely worsened by endothelial damage. We believe that our oxylipin data suggest the possibility to predict the evolution of COVID-19 in individual patients at an early stage.

GHSR(1a) is a promising therapeutic target for a wide range of metabolic, age-related, and central nervous system (CNS)Cbased conditions. In addition, growing evidence supports that GHSR(1a) is a modulator of dopamine (DA) homeostasis and is neuroprotective within brain DA circuits. GHSR(1a) signaling originates from pharmacologically separable G proteinC and -arrestin (arr)Cdependent pathways, and consequently, GHSR(1a)-mediated physiological responses depend upon their distinctive signaling contributions. Thus, when treating disorders of disrupted DA homeostasis, a pharmacological strategy that modulates biased GHSR(1a) signaling may uncouple desired therapeutic outcomes from unwanted side effects. Here, we report the discovery of a small molecule GHSR(1a) agonist, N8279 (NCATS-SM8864), functionally selective for G protein signaling. Comprehensive pharmacological characterization reveals that N8279 elicits potent G(q) activity at the apo- and ghrelin-bound GHSR(1a). Further biochemical analysis and molecular modeling demonstrate that N8279 signaling requires the extracellular domain of GHSR(1a), especially extracellular loop 2. Collectively, these findings suggest that N8279 possesses an extended binding mode into the extracellular vestibule of the GHSR(1a) that preferentially favors G(q) signaling over alternative G proteins and arr2-dependent cellular responses. Critically, N8279 is brain-penetrant in mice, exhibits CNS stability, and attenuates dysfunctional DA-mediated behaviors in both genetic and pharmacological mouse models of hyperdopaminergia. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms governing GPCR functional selectivity and emphasize how biased ligand drug development can produce novel GHSR(1a) pharmacotherapeutics to treat pathological disruptions of brain DA homeostasis.","output":"Discovery of a functionally selective ghrelin receptor (GHSR(1a)) ligand for modulating brain dopamine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We assessed the performance, stability, and user acceptability of swab-independent self-collected saliva and saline mouth rinse/gargle sample types for the molecular detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in adults and school-aged children.

Although there are multiple biosensing platforms for monitoring glucose available on the market, there is still a strong need to enhance their precision, repeatability, wearability, and accessibility to end-users. Biosensing technologies are being increasingly explored that use different bodily fluids such as sweat and tear fluid, etc., that can be calibrated to and therefore used to measure blood glucose concentrations accurately. To improve the wearability of these devices, exploring different fluids as testing mediums is essential and opens the door to various implants and wearables that in turn have the potential to be less inhibiting to the wearer. Recent developments have surfaced in the form of contact lenses or mouthguards for instance. Challenges still present themselves in the form of sensitivity, especially at very high or low glucose concentrations, which is critical for a diabetic person to monitor. This review summarises advances in wearable glucose biosensors over the past 5 years, comparing the different types as well as the fluid they use to detect glucose, including the CGMs currently available on the market.

The disease is known of viral origin and zoonotic nature originating from animals. However, to date neither the source of the spillover nor the intermediate hosts are identified. Moreover, the public health situation is intermittently aggravated by identification of new animals susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, potentially replicating the virus and maintaining intra and interspecies spread of the disease.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS the study population includes all patients consecutively admitted to the emergency department of Citt della salute e della scienza University Hospital from 01.03 to 31.05.2020 with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES patients were classified in two groups according to the findings of X-ray imaging, lung ultrasound and chest computer tomography, as pneumonia or not pneumonia patients. RESULTS in multivariable analysis, factors most strongly associated with emergency department admission with pneumonia were age, oxygen saturation <90% (adj OR 4.16 ;95%CI 1.44-12.07), respiratory rate >24 breaths/min (adj OR 6.50; 95%CI 2.36-17.87), fever 38 (adj OR 3.05; 95%CI 1.53-6.08) and the presence of gastroenteric symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea).

Emerging epidemiological evidence suggest cardiovascular risk factors are associated with increased disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with a more severe form of COVID-19 are also more likely to develop cardiac complications such as myocardial injury and arrhythmia. The true incidence of and mechanism underlying these events remain elusive.

Of 1679 consultations, 67% were considered completely managed by phone. The aim of the present study was to assess patients' experience and satisfaction with telemedicine and to compare them with urologists' perceptions about quality and completeness of the telemedicine consultation. METHODS We contacted a randomly selected sample of patients (n=356) from our previous study to enquire about their experience. We used a home patient experience questionnaire, inspired by the Patient Experiences Questionnaire for Out-of-Hours Care (PEQ-OHC) and the Consumer Assessment Health Profile Survey (CAHPS). RESULTS Of 356 patients contacted, 315 agreed to complete the questionnaire. Urological consultations were for non-oncological (104), oncological (121), cancer suspicion (41), and pediatric (49) indications. Mean patient satisfaction score after telemedicine consultation was 8.8/10 (median 9/10) and 86.3% of patients rated the quality of the consultation as either excellent (54.6%) or very good (31.7%). Consultations regarding cancer suspicion had the lowest score (8.3/10). Overall, 46.7% of all patients would have preferred an in-person visit outside of the pandemic situation. Among patients whose consultations were rated suboptimal by urologists, almost a third more (31.2%) would have preferred an in-person visit (p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS Despite high reported patient satisfaction rates with telemedicine, it is noteworthy that nearly half of the patients would have preferred an in-person visit.

DESIGN Controlled challenge study. Animals-84 dairy calves (3 to 11 days old). PROCEDURES Responses to BRSV challenge of seronegative calves vaccinated under licensing trial conditions were compared with those of seropositive calves 2 times after vaccination. In experiment 1, young BRSV-seronegative calves were vaccinated intranasally with a minimum immunizing dose of BRSV and challenged with BRSV approximately 7 weeks later. In experiments 2 and 3, young BRSV-seropositive calves were vaccinated intranasally with a commercially available combination modified-live virus vaccine containing the commercial dose of the BRSV fraction and challenged with BRSV 9 weeks or approximately 14 weeks later, respectively. RESULTS In experiments 1 and 2, BRSV-vaccinated calves had significantly higher Pao2, significantly fewer lung lesions, and significantly lower mortality rate than did unvaccinated calves subsequent to BRSV challenge. In contrast, in experiment 3, there were no differences in Pao2, lung lesions, or mortality rate between vaccinated and control calves after BRSV challenge approximately 14 weeks after vaccination. Protected calves in experiment 1 consistently had significant anamnestic mucosal and systemic antibody responses after challenge, whereas in experiments 2 and 3, antibody responses after challenge were more variable. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE A combination BRSV vaccine administered intranasally to young calves induced protective immunity in the presence of maternal antibodies.

This is particularly of importance in view of the rates of failure of seroconversion and re-infection after COVID-19 infection, which could make the vaccine role and response debatable. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) have an established immune-modulatory role, but their effects as adjuvants to vaccination have not been explored to date. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: It is increasingly recognized that PPAR agonists can upregulate the levels of anti-apoptotic factors such as MCL-1. Such effect can improve the results of vaccination by enhancing the longevity of long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs). The interaction between PPAR agonists and the immune system does not halt here, as T cell memory is also stimulated through enhanced T regulatory cells, antagonizing PD-L1 and switching the metabolism of T cells to fatty acid oxidation, which has a remarkable effect on the persistence of T memory cells. What is even of a more significant value is the effect of PPAR gamma on ensuring a profound secretion of antibodies upon re-exposure to the offending antigen through upregulating lipoxin B4, therefore potentially assisting the vaccine response and deterring re-infection. SHORT CONCLUSION: In view of the above, we suggest the use of PPAR as adjuvants to vaccines in general especially the emerging COVID-19 vaccine due to their role in enhancing immunologic memory through DNA-dependent mechanisms.","output":"PPAR agonists as effective adjuvants for COVID-19 vaccines, by modifying immunogenetics: a review of literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is known that alterations in Down syndrome (DS) occur at cognitive and language levels that affect the acquisition of reading and academic skills.

We evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on prostate cancer care in the Netherlands. METHODS: Prostate cancer diagnoses per month in 2020-2021 versus 2018-2019 were compared based on preliminary data of the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR) and nationwide pathology network. Detailed data was retrieved from the NCR for the cohorts diagnosed from March-May, 2020 (first COVID-19 wave) and March-May 2018-2019 (reference). Changes in number of diagnoses, age, disease stage and first-line treatment were compared. RESULTS: An initial decline of 17% in prostate cancer diagnoses during the first COVID-19 wave was observed. From May onwards the number of diagnoses started to restore to approximately 95% of the expected number by the end of 2020. Stage at diagnosis remained stable over time. In low-risk localised prostate cancer radical prostatectomy was conducted more often in week 9-12 (21% versus 12% in the reference period; OR=1.9, 95% CI; 1.2-3.1) and less active surveillance was applied (67% versus 78%; OR=0.6, 95% CI; 0.4-0.9). In the intermediate-risk group, a similar change was observed in week 13-16. Radical prostatectomy volumes in 2020 were comparable to 2018-2019. CONCLUSION: During the first COVID-19 wave the number of prostate cancer diagnoses declined. In the second half of 2020 this largely restored although the number remained lower than expected. Changes in treatment were temporary and compliant with adapted guidelines.

Current therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection have primarily been adapted from previous drugs used for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome. In search of new potential drug candidates, we screened a library composed of 2334 clinically approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds. The drug saracatinib, a potent inhibitor of Src-family of tyrosine kinases (SFK), was identified as an inhibitor of MERS-CoV replication in vitro. Our results suggest that saracatinib potently inhibits MERS-CoV at the early stages of the viral life cycle in Huh-7 cells, possibly through the suppression of SFK signaling pathways. Furthermore, saracatinib exhibited a synergistic effect with gemcitabine, an anticancer drug with antiviral activity against several RNA viruses. These data indicate that saracatinib alone or in combination with gemcitabine can provide a new therapeutic option for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection.","output":"Saracatinib Inhibits Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus Replication In Vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chemokines are an extensive family of small proteins which, in conjunction with their receptors, guide the chemotactic activity of various immune cells throughout the body. CCL28, - or CC chemokine, is involved in the host immunity at various epithelial and mucosal linings. The unique roles of CCL28 in several facets of immune responses have attracted considerable attention and may represent a promising approach to combat various infections. CCL28 displays a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, as well as fungi. Here, we will summarize various research findings regarding the antimicrobial activity of CCL28 and the relevant mechanisms behind it. We will explore how the structure of CCL28 is involved with this activity and how this function may have evolved. CCL28 displays strong homing capabilities for B and T cells at several mucosal and epithelial sites, and orchestrates the trafficking and functioning of lymphocytes. The chemotactic and immunomodulatory features of CCL28 through the interactions with its chemokine receptors, CCR10 and CCR3, will also be discussed in detail. Thus, in this review, we emphasize the dual properties of CCL28 and suggest its role as an anchoring point bridging the innate and adaptive immunity.","output":"CCL28 chemokine: An anchoring point bridging innate and adaptive immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has led to a halt in elective surgeries throughout the United States and many other countries throughout the world. Early reports suggest that COVID-19 patients undergoing surgery have an increased risk of requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and overall mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of all COVID-19, positive with polymerase chain reaction confirmation, patients who had surgery between February 17, 2020 and April 26, 2020 at a major New York City hospital. Clinical characteristics and outcomes including ICU admission, ventilator requirement, and mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-nine COVID-19 surgical patients were identified. Mean age was 53.9 y, and there were more men than women in the cohort (56.4% versus 43.6%). Twenty-two patients (56.4%) had a confirmed positive COVID-19 test preoperatively, and the remainder tested positive after their procedure. The majority (59%) of patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class of 3 or higher. Postoperatively, 7 patients (17.9%) required ICU level care with a mean length of stay of 7.7 d. There were 4 deaths (10.3%) in this patient population, all of which occurred in patients who were ASA class 3 or 4. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the largest study to date, that objectively analyzes the outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients who underwent surgery. Overall, ICU admission rates and mortality are similar to reported rates in the literature for nonsurgical COVID-19 patients. Notably, in COVID-19 patients with ASA 1 or 2, there was a 0% mortality rate in the postoperative period.","output":"Clinical Outcomes of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Positive Patients Who Underwent Surgery: A New York City Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a microarray nonlinear calibration (MiNC) method for quantifying antibody binding to the surface of protein microarrays that significantly increases the linear dynamic range and reduces assay variation compared with traditional approaches.

The effective therapeutics are in urgent need. Here, we developed a high-content screening for the antiviral candidates using fluorescence-based SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein detection in Vero E6 cells coupled with plaque reduction assay. Among 122 Thai natural products, we found that Boesenbergia rotunda extract and its phytochemical compound, panduratin A, exhibited the potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Treatment with B. rotunda extract and panduratin A after viral infection drastically suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in Vero E6 cells with IC(50) of 3.62 g/mL (CC(50) = 28.06 g/mL) and 0.81 ̦ (CC(50) = 14.71 M), respectively. Also, the treatment of panduratin A at the pre-entry phase inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection with IC(50) of 5.30 M (CC(50) = 43.47 M). Our study demonstrated, for the first time, that panduratin A exerts the inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection at both pre-entry and post-infection phases. Apart from Vero E6 cells, treatment with this compound was able to suppress viral infectivity in human airway epithelial cells. This result confirmed the potential of panduratin A as the anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent in the major target cells in human. Since B. rotunda is a culinary herb generally grown in China and Southeast Asia, its extract and the purified panduratin A may serve as the promising candidates for therapeutic purposes with economic advantage during COVID-19 situation.","output":"High-content screening of Thai medicinal plants reveals Boesenbergia rotunda extract and its component Panduratin A as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games is expected to be among the hottest Games in modern history, increasing the chances for exertional heat stroke (EHS) incidence, especially in non-acclimatised athletes/workers/spectators The urgent need to recognise EHS symptoms to protect all attendees health has considerably accelerated research examining the most effective cooling strategies and the development of wearable cooling technology and real-time temperature monitoring While these technological advances will aid the early identification of EHS cases, there are several potential ethical considerations for governing bodies and sports organisers For example, the impact of recently developed cooling wearables on health and performance is unknown Concerning improving athletic performance in a hot environment, there is uncertainty about this technologys availability to all athletes Furthermore, the real potential to obtain real-time core temperature data will oblige medical teams to make crucial decisions around their athletes continuing their competitions or withdraw Therefore, the aim of this review is (1) to summarise the practical applications of the most novel cooling strategies/technologies for both safety (of athletes, spectators and workers) and performance purposes, and (2) to inform of the opportunities offered by recent technological developments for the early recognition and diagnosis of EHS These opportunities are presented alongside several ethical dilemmas that require sports governing bodies to react by regulating the validity of recent technologies and their availability to all","output":"Ethical dilemmas and validity issues related to the use of new cooling technologies and early recognition of exertional heat illness in sport"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Academics generally should meet both teaching duty and research performance requirements.

We analyzed the work time allocation preferences of 450 Korean academics in science and engineering fields based on the multiple discreteCcontinuous extreme value (MDCEV) model. We classified work time into either of research, teaching, or other tasks and investigated the relationship between academics preferences in choosing and allocating their work time and faculty system (e.g., tenure), individual characteristics (e.g., research productivity) and external shock (e.g., COVID-19). Analysis results show that academics with either of tenure, higher research productivity, or commercialization experience preferred to allocating their work time firstly to research, i.e., rather than to teaching or other tasks, while this was not the case for the academics after the pandemic. In general, academics appeared not to prefer allocating their work time firstly to teaching. Implications of our study are twofold. First, the higher education sector needs to incentivize academics teaching time allocation for enhanced effectiveness of education.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study screened 233 patients admitted to the First Hospital of Changsha, China with COVID-19 from January 17th to February 29th, 2020. After completion of SARS-CoV2-specific immunoglobulins, and T cells tests at 2-week and 3-month follow-up points after discharge, 87 were enrolled. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to assess changes in the values of IgG and IgM, the number of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and CD4+/CD8+ ratio during the 3-month follow-up. Linear regressions were used to evaluate the associations of immunological changes and medications during hospitalization. RESULTS: The positive rate of IgG decreased from 98.6% (40/41) to 85.4% (35/41) in men and 100% (43/43) to 76.7% (33/43) in women, whereas IgM declined from 34.1% (14/41) to 12.2% (5/41) in men and 37.2% (16/43) to 27.9% (12/43) in women during the follow-up. CD4+ T cells increased from (median (IQR), 484 (384-635)) cells/ul to 543 (414-657) cells/ul (P = 0.01).

OBJECTIVES: The first objective was to investigate the reliability and validity of OSCEs when administered to PTs during their education or as part of a licensure process. The second objective was to conduct a structured review to report PT educational and licensing components and policies in 17 countries with well-developed PT regulation systems. METHODS: An electronic search was performed in four databases from inception to 31(st) March 2021 to identify relevant articles. Two reviewers performed the critical appraisal of the included studies using a validated quality assessment tool. We deployed a random effects meta-analysis on reliability and validity estimates of OSCEs and examined sources of heterogeneity with univariate meta-regressions. We searched websites of professional regulatory bodies and associations for data on educational and licencing components and policies. Educational and licensing components across countries were synthesized descriptively. RESULTS: A pooled estimate of Cronbachs alpha of 0.55, (95% CI: 0.41, 0.67) was determined for OSCEs. The pooled estimate of Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) between assessors was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.83). The pooled estimate of Pearson Correlation between multiple OSCE stations scores was 0.27 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.39); and between each station score and the total score was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.79). The pooled estimates for kappa Coefficients were 0.75 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.86) and 0.84, (95% CI: 0.72, 0.91) for intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of the standardised patient respectively.

The objective of the present study was to examine perceptions of how weight\\\\related lifestyle changed in social lockdown among UK adults compared with before the emergence of the COVID\\\\19 crisis. METHODS: As part of an online cross\\\\sectional survey conducted during social lockdown in the United Kingdom, 723 UK adults reported on the extent to which their eating (healthiness of diet, frequency of bingeing on food), physical activity, sleep and alcohol consumption had changed since the emergence of the COVID\\\\19 crisis and completed measures of current psychological well\\\\being. RESULTS: Although both improvements and declines in weight gain protective behaviours were reported, 79% of participants reported a decline in one or more weight gain protective behaviours. Both participants with a diagnosis of psychiatric illness or obesity (body mass index [BMI]  30) were most likely to report declines in weight gain protective behaviours and show an overall profile of weight management behaviours worsening. Participants experiencing high levels of stress also reported reductions in more weight gain protective behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle behaviours associated with weight gain are likely to have been affected by the COVID\\\\19 crisis. Reductions to the perceived frequency by which people engage in behaviours usually associated with successful weight management appear to be common, and people living with obesity and mental health problems may be at increased risk.","output":"Weight\\\\related lifestyle behaviours and the COVID\\\\19 crisis: An online survey study of UK adults during social lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stereotypes are encountered every day, in interpersonal communication as well as in entertainment, news stories, and on social media. In this study, we present a computational method to mine large, naturally occurring datasets of text for sentences that express perceptions of a social group of interest, and then map these sentences to the two-dimensional plane of perceived warmth and competence for comparison and interpretation. This framework is grounded in established social psychological theory, and validated against both expert annotation and crowd-sourced stereotype data. Additionally, we present two case studies of how the model might be used to answer questions using data in-the-wild, by collecting Twitter data about women and older adults. Using the data about women, we are able to observe how sub-categories of women (e.g., Black women and white women) are described similarly and differently from each other, and from the superordinate group of women in general. Using the data about older adults, we show evidence that the terms people use to label a group (e.g., old people vs. senior citizens) are associated with different stereotype content. We propose that this model can be used by other researchers to explore questions of how stereotypes are expressed in various large text corpora.","output":"Computational Modeling of Stereotype Content in Text"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Paediatric glioblastomas are rapidly growing, devastating brain neoplasms with an invasive phenotype. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which are the current therapeutic adjuvant to surgical resection, are still associated with various toxicity profiles and only marginally improve the course of the disease and life expectancy. A considerable body of evidence supports the antitumour and apoptotic effects of certain cannabinoids, such as WIN55,212-2, against a wide spectrum of cancer cells, including gliomas. In fact, we previously highlighted the potent cytotoxic activity of the cannabinoid ligand 5 against glioblastoma KNS42 cells. Taken together, in this study, we designed, synthesised, and evaluated several indoles and indole bioisosteres for their antitumour activities. Compounds 8a, 8c, 8f, 12c, and 24d demonstrated significant inhibitory activities against the viability (IC50 = 2.34-9.06 M) and proliferation (IC50 = 2.88-9.85 M) of paediatric glioblastoma KNS42 cells. All five compounds further retained their antitumour activities against two atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumour (AT/RT) cell lines. When tested against a medulloblastoma DAOY cell line, only 8c, 8f, 12c, and 24d maintained their viability inhibitory activities. The viability assay against non-neoplastic human fibroblast HFF1 cells suggested that compounds 8a, 8c, 8f, and 12c act selectively towards the panel of paediatric brain tumour cells. In contrast, compound 24d and WIN55,212-2 were highly toxic toward HFF1 cells. Due to their structural resemblance to known cannabimimetics, the most potent compounds were tested in cannabinoid 1 and 2 receptor (CB1R and CB2R) functional assays. Compounds 8a, 8c, and 12c failed to activate or antagonise both CB1R and CB2R, whereas compounds 8f and 24d antagonised CB1R and CB2R, respectively. We also performed a transcriptional analysis on KNS42 cells treated with our prototype compound 8a and highlighted a set of seven genes that were significantly downregulated. The expression levels of these genes were previously shown to be positively correlated with tumour growth and progression, indicating their implication in the antitumour activity of 8a. Overall, the drug-like and selective antitumour profiles of indole-2-carboxamides 8a, 8c, 8f, and 12c substantiate the versatility of the indole scaffold in cancer drug discovery.","output":"Synthesis and antitumour evaluation of indole-2-carboxamides against paediatric brain cancer cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Although the incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) has decreased since the emergence of the pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 is still evolving, number of TBI cases still soar in multiple countries. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the epidemiological characteristics of TBI patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method We conducted a systematic literature search of original articles, short reports, and research letters from databases on studies that contain data about the severity, mortality, presence of neurological deficits, radiological diagnosis, cause of injury, and type of management of TBI cases during a specified period within pandemic compared to pre-pandemic. Results A total of 18490 subjects from 13 studies were included in this present study. Meta-analysis showed a higher TBI mortality rate during the COVID-19 pandemic in low-middle income countries (OR 1.65 (95% CI 1.12 C 2.41), p < 0.05, I 2 = 40.8%, p = 0.18). The proportion of subdural hemorrhage was decreased, and subarachnoid hemorrhage was increased in low-middle and high-income countries, respectively. The proportion of assaults as the cause of TBI increased during the pandemic (OR 1.40 (95%CI 1.06 C 1.86), p = 0.02, I 2 = 20.8%, p = 0.28). We did not find any significant difference in the surgical intervention of TBI during the pandemic period.

METHODS: We evaluated these characteristics and established their association with clinical severity in a prospective observational cohort study of 100 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (mean age 46 years, 56% male, 38% with comorbidities). Respiratory samples (n=74) were collected for viral culture, serum samples for measurement of IgM/IgG levels (n=30), and plasma samples for levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (n=81). Disease severity was correlated with results from viral culture, serologic testing, and immune markers. RESULTS: 57 (57%) patients developed viral pneumonia, of whom 20 (20%) required supplemental oxygen including 12 (12%) invasive mechanical ventilation. Viral culture from respiratory samples was positive for 19 of 74 patients (26%). No virus was isolated when the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value was >30 or >14 days after symptom onset. Seroconversion occurred at a median of 12.5 days (IQR 9-18) for IgM and 15.0 days (IQR 12-20) for IgG; 54/62 patients (87.1%) sampled at day 14 or later seroconverted. Severe infections were associated with earlier seroconversion and higher peak IgM and IgG levels. Levels of IP-10, HGF, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1, IL-12p70, IL-18, VEGF-A, PDGF-BB and IL-1RA significantly correlated with disease severity. CONCLUSION: We found virus viability was associated with lower PCR Ct value in early illness. A stronger antibody response was associated with disease severity.

Recently, replicating SARS-CoV-2 was found inside salivary epithelial cells resulting in inflammation and atrophy of salivary glands. Saliva possesses healing properties crucial for maintaining the health of the oral mucosa. Specifically, salivary antimicrobial peptides, most notable, histatin-5 exclusively produced in salivary glands, plays a vital role in innate immunity against colonizing microbial species. The demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 destruction of gland tissue where histatin-5 is produced strongly indicate that histatin-5 production is compromised due to COVID-19. Here we present a case of a patient presenting with unexplained chronic oral dysesthesia and dysgeusia post-recovery from COVID-19. To explore potential physiological mechanisms behind the symptoms, we comparatively analyzed saliva samples from the patient and matched healthy subject for histatin-5 and key cytokines. Findings demonstrated significantly reduced histatin-5 levels in patients saliva and activation of the Th17 inflammatory pathway. As histatin-5 exhibits potent activity against the opportunistic oral pathogen Candida albicans, we evaluated saliva potency against C. albicans ex vivo. Compared to control, patient saliva exhibited significantly reduced anti-candidal efficacy. Although speculative, based on history and salivary analysis we hypothesize that salivary histatin-5 production may be compromised due to SARS-CoV-2 mediated salivary gland destruction. With the current lack of emphasis on implications of COVID-19 on oral health, this report may provide lacking mechanistic insights that may lead to reassessment of risks for oral opportunistic infections and mucosal inflammatory processes in acutely-ill and recovered COVID-19 patients.","output":"Long-Term Post-COVID-19 Associated Oral Inflammatory Sequelae"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Erectile dysfunction (ED) and premature ejaculation (PE) are the two most prevalent sexual disorders among males associated with significant distress and impairment in quality of life. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among patients with primary ED and PE. METHODS A sample of 57 men (ED = 31; PE = 26) were compared to 25 male outpatients with anxiety disorder (AD) and 25 healthy controls. Principal assessment measures included the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). RESULTS Greater levels of STAI state anxiety were reported among the ED, PE, and AD groups as compared to healthy controls. In contrast ED and AD groups scored higher than controls on the STAI trait anxiety and BDI, but PE scores were not different from healthy controls in both measures. CONCLUSIONS The study findings suggest that both primary ED and PE are conditions associated with significant state anxiety; however, PE appears to be less associated with trait anxiety and depression compared to ED, a finding that corroborates the recent acknowledgement of PE as a more biologically based condition.

However, the suitability of AHLT versus adult whole liver transplantation (AWLT) for recipients with high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores remains controversial. METHODS: We divided patients undergoing AHLT and AWLT into subgroups according to their MELD scores ( 30: AHLT, n = 35; AWLT, n = 88; and < 30: AHLT, n = 323; AWLT, n = 323). Patients were matched by demographic data and perioperative conditions according to propensity scores. A cut-off value of 30 for MELD scores was determined by comparing the overall survival data of 735 cases of nontumor liver transplantation. RESULTS: Among patients with an MELD score  30 and < 30, AHLT was found to be associated with increased warm ischemia time, operative time, hospitalization time, and intraoperative blood loss compared with AWLT (P < 0.05). In the MELD  30 group, although the 5-year survival rate was significantly higher for AWLT than for AHLT (P = 0.037), there was no significant difference between AWLT and AHLT in the MELD < 30 group (P = 0.832); however, we did not observe a significant increase in specific complications following AHLT among patients with a high MELD score ( 30). Among these patients, the incidence of complications classified as Clavien-Dindo grade III or above was significantly higher in patients undergoing AHLT than in those undergoing AWLT (25.7% vs. 11.4%, P = 0.047). For the MELD < 30 group, there was no significant difference in the incidence of complications classified as Clavien-Dindo grade III or above for patients undergoing AHLT or AWLT. CONCLUSION: In patients with an MELD score < 30, AHLT can achieve rates of mortality and overall survival comparable to AWLT. In those with an MELD score  30, the prognosis and incidence of complications classified as Clavien-Dindo III or above are significantly worse for AHLT than for AWLT; therefore, we may need to be more cautious regarding the conclusion that patients with a high MELD score can safely undergo AHLT.","output":"Outcomes of hemi- versus whole liver transplantation in patients from mainland china with high model for end-stage liver disease scores: a matched analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Replicating or distilling information from psychological interventions reported in the scientific literature is hindered by inadequate reporting, despite the existence of various methodologies to guide study reporting and intervention development.

The shape of the biological membrane in the budding process, as observed in phospholipid vesicles, in erythrocytes and in CNVs, was described by an unifying model. Taking the mean curvature h and the curvature deviator d of the membrane surface as the relevant parameters, the shape and the distribution of membrane constituents were determined theoretically by minimization of membrane free energy. Considering these results and previous results on vesiculation of red blood cells it was interpreted that the budding processes may lead to formation of different types of CNVs as regards the compartment (exo/endovesicles), shape (spherical/tubular/torocytic) and composition (enriched/depleted in particular kinds of molecules). It was concluded that the specificity of pinched off nanovesicles derives from the shape of the membrane constituents and not primarily from their chemical identity, which explains evidences on great heterogeneity of isolated extracellular vesicles with respect to composition.","output":"Minimizing isotropic and deviatoric membrane energy C An unifying formation mechanism of different cellular membrane nanovesicle types"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plastic pollution is one of the most significant environmental issues worldwide During Covid-19 pandemic, single-use plastic containers have been overused due to a lock-down policy This led to remarkable increase in municipal plastic wastes An alternative method to manipulate plastic wastes is to recycle them as construction and building materials The research introduces an idea of using plastic straw to produce fibre-reinforced polymer composite as a strengthening material to confine concrete The plastic straw fibre-reinforced polymer composite coupons were tested to obtain their tensile strength, ultimate strain, and elastic modulus A series of compression tests were conducted on plastic straw fibre-reinforced polymer composite confined concrete to investigate the improved strength and ductility performance The results show that the mechanical properties of plastic straw fibre-reinforced polymer composite are acceptable for concrete strengthening purpose More importantly, use of plastic straw fibre-reinforced polymer composite is rewarded by its environmental solution for reduction of plastic wastes in household","output":"Fibre-Reinforced Polymer Made from Plastic Straw for Concrete Confinement: An Alternative Method of Managing Plastic Waste from the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The outbreak of COVID-19 posed the issue of urgently identifying treatment strategies. Colchicine was considered for this purpose based on well-recognised anti-inflammatory effects and potential antiviral properties. In the present study, colchicine was proposed to patients with COVID-19, and its effects compared with 'standard-of-care' (SoC). METHODS: In the public hospital of Esine, northern Italy, 140 consecutive inpatients, with virologically and radiographically confirmed COVID-19 admitted in the period 5-19 March 2020, were treated with 'SoC' (hydroxychloroquine and/or intravenous dexamethasone; and/or lopinavir/ritonavir). They were compared with 122 consecutive inpatients, admitted between 19 March and 5 April 2020, treated with colchicine (1 mg/day) and SoC (antiviral drugs were stopped before colchicine, due to potential interaction). RESULTS: Patients treated with colchicine had a better survival rate as compared with SoC at 21 days of follow-up (84.2% (SE=3.3%) vs 63.6% (SE=4.1%), p=0.001). Cox proportional hazards regression survival analysis showed that a lower risk of death was independently associated with colchicine treatment (HR=0.151 (95% CI 0.062 to 0.368), p<0.0001), whereas older age, worse PaO2/FiO2, and higher serum levels of ferritin at entry were associated with a higher risk.

Methods: This prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint, multicenter, parallel-group, comparative study included 340 subjects with T2DM but no history of apparent CVD recruited at 24 clinical units. Subjects were randomly allocated to either the tofogliflozin treatment group (n=169) or conventional treatment group using drugs other than SGLT2 inhibitors (n=171). Primary outcomes were changes in mean and maximum common carotid IMT measured by echography during a 104-week treatment period. Findings: Although the mean IMT of the common carotid artery (mean-IMT-CCA), along with the right and left maximum IMT of the CCA (max-IMT-CCA), statistically significantly declined in both the tofogliflozin (-0.132 mm, SE 0.007;-0.163 mm, SE 0.013;-0.170 mm, SE 0.020;respectively) and the control group (-0140 mm, SE 0006;-0190 mm, SE 0012;-0190 mm, SE 0020;respectively), no significant difference was observed between the two groups. Relative to the control treatment effects, tofogliflozin statistically significantly reduced the HbA1c, blood glucose level, body weight/body mass index, abdominal circumference, and systolic blood pressure, and statistically significantly increased the HDL-C. Interpretation: A tofogliflozin treatment regimen of 104 weeks was not associated with improved inhibition of carotid wall thickening in T2DM patients without apparent CVD, as compared to the effect of the control treatment.

There is a likelihood of other domestic livestock serving as intermediate hosts for this virus. The presence of coronaviruses, closely related to MERS-CoV in Ghanaian bats, presented the opportunity to test the hypothesis of transmissibility of this virus through domestic livestock species. The possible interactions between livestock and bats in 31 household farms were accessed by observation and interviews with farmers. Rectal swabs and serum from cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, and swine from commercial and household farms were tested for MERS-CoV and a Nycteris sp. bat coronavirus, previously detected in Ghana. A pan-PCR assay to detect clade 2c viruses and recombinant immunofluorescence assay to detect anti-spike IgG antibodies against the target viruses were used. Likely contact between livestock and bats was determined for 13 farms (41.9%) that reported confining their livestock and also observing bats in their homes.

Methodological simplification could increase diagnostic availability and efficiency, benefitting patient care and infection control. Here, we describe methods circumventing RNA extraction in COVID-19 testing by performing RT-PCR directly on heat-inactivated or lysed samples. Our data, including benchmarking using 597 clinical patient samples and a standardised diagnostic system, demonstrate that direct RT-PCR is viable option to extraction-based tests. Using controlled amounts of active SARS-CoV-2, we confirm effectiveness of heat inactivation by plaque assay and evaluate various generic buffers as transport medium for direct RT-PCR. Significant savings in time and cost are achieved through RNA-extraction-free protocols that are directly compatible with established PCR-based testing pipelines.

Rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants provides crucial information concerning the outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 variants and possible lines of transmission. This information is vital for infection prevention and control. We used a Cas12a-based RT-PCR combined with CRISPR on-site rapid detection system (RT-CORDS) platform to detect the key mutations in SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as 69/70 deletion, N501Y, and D614G. We used type-specific CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to identify wild-type (crRNA-W) and mutant (crRNA-M) sequences of SARS-CoV-2. We successfully differentiated mutant variants from wild-type SARS-CoV-2 with a sensitivity of 10(?17) M (approximately 6 copies/L). The assay took just 10 min with the Cas12a/crRNA reaction after a simple RT-PCR using a fluorescence reporting system. In addition, a sensitivity of 10(?16) M could be achieved when lateral flow strips were used as readouts. The accuracy of RT-CORDS for SARS-CoV-2 variant detection was 100% consistent with the sequencing data. In conclusion, using the RT-CORDS platform, we accurately, sensitively, specifically, and rapidly detected SARS-CoV-2 variants. This method may be used in clinical diagnosis.","output":"Rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 mutations using a Cas12a-based sensing platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online education was widely used in China during the Covid-19, and the remote conferencing platform provided great support for online education.

The first manufacturer-independent head-to-head comparison of two rapid high-throughput automated electrochemiluminescence double-antigen sandwich immunoassays targeting total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against two different viral proteins, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Elecsys-N) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S) (Roche Diagnostics), was performed in a routine setting during the exponential growth phase of the epidemics second wave. METHODS: The diagnostic specificity of Elecsys-N and Elecsys-S was initially evaluated on a panel of 572 pre-COVID-19 samples, showing 100% specificity of both assays. Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S head-to-head comparison used 3,416 consecutive blood samples from individuals that were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 within commercial out-of-pocket serologic testing. RESULTS: Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S head-to-head comparison showed overall agreement of 98.68% (3,371/3,416; 95% CI, 98.23C99.03%), positive agreement of 95.16% (884/929; 95% CI, 93.52C96.41%), and a high kappa value of 0.996 (95% CI, 0.956C0.976).

The use of advance care planning (ACP) for people with progressive MS (pwPMS) remains limited. The ConCure-SM project aims to assess the effectiveness of a structured ACP intervention for pwPMS. The intervention consists of a training programme on ACP for healthcare professionals caring for pwPMS, and a booklet to be used during the ACP conversation. Herein, we describe the first two project phases. METHODS: In phase 1 we translated and adapted, to the Italian legislation and MS context, the ACP booklet of the National ACP Programme for New Zealand. Acceptability, comprehensibility and usefulness of the booklet were assessed via 13 personal cognitive interviews with pwPMS and significant others (SOs), and one health professional focus group. Based on these findings, we will revise the booklet. In phase 2 we will conduct a single-arm pilot/feasibility trial with nested qualitative study. Participants will be 40 pwPMS, their SOs, health professionals from six MS and rehabilitation centres in Italy. In the 6 months following the ACP conversation, we will assess completion of an advance care plan document (primary outcome), as well as safety of the intervention. Secondary outcomes will be a range of measures to capture the full process of ACP; patient-carer congruence in treatment preferences; quality of patient-clinician communication and caregiver burden. A qualitative process evaluation will help understand the factors likely to influence future implementation and scalability of the intervention. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The project is coleaded by a neurologist and a bioethicist. Phase 1 has received ethical approvals from each participating centre, while phase 2 will be submitted to the centres in May 2021.

METHODS: We estimated the incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to upper and lower respiratory infections (URIs and LRIs) and attributable risk factors in China by a systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study. Incidence, mortality, and DALYs were stratified by sex, age, and province. Risk factors for respiratory infections were analyzed from exposure data. FINDINGS: The age-standardized incidence rates of URIs and LRIs were 179,077 and 3926 per 100,000 persons in 2019, with a 7?52% and 35?07% decrease from 1990, respectively. Moreover, 2801 and 185,264 persons died of URIs and LRIs in 2019, respectively. DALYs for URIs and LRIs also decreased from 1,516,727 in 1990 to 928,617 in 2019 and from 38,278,504 in 1990 to 4,020,676 in 2019. The burden of URIs and LRIs were generally similar in males and females, but relatively higher in the new-borns and the elderly.

In order to control the spread of an epidemic, the effective management of rapidly increased medical waste through establishing a temporary reverse logistics system is of vital importance. However, no research has been conducted with the focus on the design of an epidemic reverse logistics network for dealing with medical waste during epidemic outbreaks, which, if improperly treated, may accelerate disease spread and pose a significant risk for both medical staffs and patients. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel multi-objective multi-period mixed integer program for reverse logistics network design in epidemic outbreaks, which aims at determining the best locations of temporary facilities and the transportation strategies for effective management of the exponentially increased medical waste within a very short period. The application of the model is illustrated with a case study based on the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Even though the uncertainty of the future COVID-19 spread tendency is very high at the time of this research, several general policy recommendations can still be obtained based on computational experiments and quantitative analyses.

Here, we intended to investigate genetic causes of hearing loss in a Han Chinese man. METHOD: First, whole-exome sequencing was performed to identify the gene mutations responsible for hearing loss in the proband. Sanger sequencing was used to verify the candidate mutations detected in the family. Next, we collected blood samples and clinical data from the three-generation pedigree. Finally, SLC26A4 mRNA and protein expression levels were detected by qPCR and western blotting. RESULT: The proband suffered from bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing loss with EVA. The sequence analysis of SLC26A4 revealed that the proband and his sister both harbored a compound heterozygous mutation of c.2168A > G/c.2029C > T, inherited from their father and mother respectively. c.2029C > T mutation has not been recorded in the relevant literature previously. Relative mRNA levels of the SLC26A4 gene in individuals carrying a compound heterozygous mutation were significantly lower compared to a heterozygous mutation.

Two years after the initial reported case, MERS-CoV has caused limited disease outside the Arabian Peninsula with several cases in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Epidemiologically, these infections are linked to exposures from the region and their diagnosis outside is related to travel. Several reported clusters of disease report multiple transmissions of MERS-CoV within healthcare settings that have been attributed to poor compliance with the basic infection control measures. Factors contributing to the spread and control of MERS-CoV within healthcare settings have not been elucidated so far. Data suggest the overcrowding, late recognition of MERS-CoV cases, and inadequate infection control practices contribute significantly to the transmission.

Treatment may be difficult since a single modality cannot be enough to alleviate both the urge and the stress symptoms. Biofeedback-assisted pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) has a great role in strengthening the pelvic floor muscles especially when accompanied by electrical stimulation. Neuromodulation is another safe well-tolerated method that may improve symptoms of female voiding dysfunction. There are no previous studies that assessed the efficacy of biofeedback-assisted pelvic floor muscle training versus two different types of peripheral neuromodulation which are transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation (TPTNS) and anogenital neuromodulation in the treatment of mixed urinary incontinence among women. The aim of this work is to study the effectiveness of biofeedback-assisted pelvic floor muscle training with electrostimulation versus two different methods of peripheral neuromodulation techniques in the treatment of women with MUI. Patients were subjected to history taking, assessment questionnaires (Questionnaire for female Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis (QUID), Australian Pelvic Floor Questionnaire (PFQ), and International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence-Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF)), clinical examination, and manometric pressure assessment. The patients were allocated randomly into three groups. Group I received biofeedback-assisted pelvic floor muscle training and faradic electrical stimulation, group II received posterior tibial neuromodulation, and group III received anogenital neuromodulation.

Using anticoagulants for 10-35 days following arthroplasty is the standard prophylaxis, but its cost-effectiveness after accounting for bleeding complications remains unproven. Methods A comprehensive, clinical model of VTE was created using the incidences, clinical effects (including bleeding), and costs of VTE and prophylaxis from randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and large observational studies. Over 50 years, the total health care costs and clinical impact of three prophylaxis strategies, that are as follows, were compared: low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) alone, intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), and IPC with LMWH (IPC+LMWH). The cost per VTE event that was avoided and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in both the US and Australian health care settings were calculated. Results For every 2,000 patients, the expected number of VTE and major bleeding events with LMWH were 151 and 6 in the USA and 160 and 46 in Australia, resulting in a mean of 11.3 and 9.1 QALYs per patient, respectively. IPC reduced the expected VTE events by 11 and 8 in the USA and Australia, respectively, compared to using LMWH alone. IPC reduced major bleeding events compared to LMWH, preventing 1 event in the US and 7 in Australia. IPC+LMWH only reduced VTE events.

METHODS: Data on confirmed patients, with a final outcome reported as of 29 March 2020, were obtained from official websites and other internet sources. The hospitalized CFR (HCFR) was estimated, epidemiological features described, and risk factors for a fatal outcome identified. RESULTS: The overall HCFR in China was estimated to be 4.6% (95% CI 4.5C4.8%, P < 0.001). It increased with age and was higher in males than females. Although the highest HCFR observed was in male patients 70 years old, the relative risks for death outcome by sex varied across age groups, and the greatest HCFR risk ratio for males vs. females was shown in the age group of 50C60 years, higher than age groups of 60C70 and  70 years. Differential age/sex HCFR patterns across geographical regions were found: the age effect on HCFR was greater in other provinces outside Hubei than in Wuhan. An effect of longer interval from symptom onset to admission was only observed outside Hubei, not in Wuhan. By performing multivariate analysis and survival analysis, the higher HCFR was associated with older age (both P < 0.001), and male sex (both P < 0.001). Only in regions outside Hubei, longer interval from symptom onset to admission, were associated with higher HCFR. CONCLUSIONS: This up-to-date and comprehensive picture of COVID-19 HCFR and its drivers will help healthcare givers target limited medical resources to patients with high risk of fatality.

Deaths on duty, including deaths due to overwork, during the COVID-19 response were usually reported on web-based platforms for public recognition and solidarity. Although no official statistics are available for these casualties, a list of on-duty deaths has been made publicly available on the web by crowdsourcing. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the trends and characteristics of deaths related to overwork among the frontline nonclinical essential workers participating in nonpharmaceutical interventions during the first wave of COVID-19 in China. METHODS: Based on a web-based crowdsourced list of deaths on duty during the first wave of the COVID-19 response in China, we manually verified all overwork-related death records against the full-text web reports from credible sources. After excluding deaths caused by COVID-19 infection and accidents, a total of 340 deaths related to overwork among nonclinical essential workers were attributed to combatting the COVID-19 crisis. We coded the key characteristics of the deceased workers, including sex, age at death, location, causes of death, date of incidence, date of death, containment duties, working area, and occupation. The temporal and spatial correlations between deaths from overwork and COVID-19 cases in China were also examined using Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULTS: From January 20 to April 26, 2020, at least 340 nonclinical frontline workers in China were reported to have died as a result of overwork while combatting COVID-19. The weekly overwork mortality was positively correlated with weekly COVID-19 cases (r=0.79, P<.001). Two-thirds of deceased workers (230/340, 67.6%) were under 55 years old, and two major causes of deaths related to overwork were cardiovascular diseases (138/340, 40.6%) and cerebrovascular diseases (73/340, 21.5%). Outside of Hubei province, there were almost 2.5 times as many deaths caused by COVID-19-related overwork (308/340, 90.6%) than by COVID-19 itself (n=120). CONCLUSIONS: The high number of deaths related to overwork among nonclinical essential workers at the frontline of the COVID-19 epidemic is alarming.

Previous results indicated that the composition and abundance of this small mammal community were altered by the presence and density of A. heterophyllus. One observed effect was the increased population size of the spiny-rat Trinomys dimidiatus within the grids where the jackfruit trees were present. Therefore we decided to create a mathematical model for this species, based on the Verhulst-Pearl logistic equation. Our objectives were i) to calculate the carrying capacity K based on real data of the involved species and the environment; ii) propose and evaluate a mathematical model to estimate the population size of T. dimidiatus based on the monthly seed production of jackfruit tree, Artocarpus heterophyllus and iii) determinate the minimum jackfruit tree seed production to maintain at least two T. dimidiatus individuals in one study grid. Our results indicated that the predicted values by the model for the carrying capacity K were significantly correlated with real data.

We analyzed the B cell compartment in human newborns and identified a population of neonatal regulatory B lymphocytes (nBreg cells) that produced interleukin 10 (IL-10) in response to RSV infection. The polyreactive B cell receptor of nBreg cells interacted with RSV protein F and induced upregulation of chemokine receptor CX3CR1. CX3CR1 interacted with RSV glycoprotein G, leading to nBreg cell infection and IL-10 production that dampened T helper 1 (Th1) cytokine production. In the respiratory tract of neonates with severe RSV-induced acute bronchiolitis, RSV-infected nBreg cell frequencies correlated with increased viral load and decreased blood memory Th1 cell frequencies. Thus, the frequency of nBreg cells is predictive of the severity of acute bronchiolitis disease and nBreg cell activity may constitute an early-life host response that favors microbial pathogenesis.","output":"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infects Regulatory B Cells in Human Neonates via Chemokine Receptor CX3CR1 and Promotes Lung Disease Severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Use of certain antihypertensive medications has been an area of interest during the COVID-19 pandemic, and several hypotheses have been developed regarding the effects of renin-angiotensin system blockers as well as calcium channel blockers in those infected with COVID-19. We seek to determine the association between exposure to ACEI, ARB, and CCB and outcomes in those admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 841 adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection at the University of Chicago Medical Center between March 25 and June 22, 2020. Out of these 841, 453 patients had a personal history of hypertension. For the first part, we evaluated primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and ICU admission in hospitalized COVID-19 patients based on their exposure to particular medications regardless of a personal history of hypertension and compared them with those who were not on these medications. For the second part, we evaluated the aforementioned outcomes in 453 patients with a personal history of hypertension based on their medication exposure. Secondary outcomes of length of stay, readmission rate, and new-onset dialysis requirement were also compared across the study groups. RESULTS: Out of 841 patients, 111 (13.19%) were on ACEI/ARB (median age: 66.1, SD 15.4; 52.25% females) and 730 (86.80%) were not on them (median age: 56.6, SD 20.3; 50.14% females), while 277 (32.93%) used CCB (median age: 64.6, SD 15.2; 57.04% females) and 564 (67.06%) did not use CCB (median age: 54.6, SD 21.2; 47.16% females). After adjusting for demographics and covariates, neither ACEI/ARB nor CCB exposure was associated with any effect on mortality, but ACEI/ARB exposure was associated with 42% reduction in risk of ICU admissions (OR 0.58, 95% CI [0.35, 0.95], p value 0.03). In addition, combined use of ACEI/ARB and CCB was associated with statistically significant (45%) reduction in ICU admission (OR 0.55, 95% CI [0.32, 0.94], p value 0.029). Out of 453 patients with a personal history of hypertension, 85 (18.76%) were taking ACEI/ARB (median age 65, SD 15.6; 56.47% females) and 368 (81.24%) were not on ACEI/ARB (median age 62.8, SD 16.4; 54.89% females), while 208 (45.92%) out of 453 were on CCB (median age 65; SD 14.8; 60.1% females) and 245 (54.08%) were not on CCB (median age 61.7, SD 17.3; 51.02% females). In the fully adjusted model in this group, ACEI use was associated with 71% reduction in in-house mortality (OR 0.29, 95% CI [0.09, 0.93], p value 0.03). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Among all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection, exposure to ACEI/ARB, as well as combined exposure to ACEI/ARB and CCB, were associated with reduced incidence of ICU admissions.

However, tDCS clinical relevance still needs to be determined. The present systematic review aims to determine whether tDCS applied to the primary motor cortex (M1) in stroke patients can have a positive effect on functional motor outcomes.Materials and methods: Two databases (Medline & Scopus) were searched for randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled trials pertaining to the use of M1 tDCS on cerebral stroke patients, and its effects on validated functional motor outcomes. When data were provided, effect sizes were calculated. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42018108157Results: 46 studies (n = 1291 patients) met inclusion criteria. Overall study quality was good (7.69/10 on the PEDro scale). Over half (56.5%) the studies were on chronic stroke patients. There seemed to be a certain pattern of recurring parameters, but tDCS protocols still remain heterogeneous. Overall results were positive (71.7% of studies found that tDCS has positive results on functional motor outcomes). Effect-sizes ranged from 0 to 1.33. No severe adverse events were reported.Conclusion: Despite heterogeneous stimulation parameters, outcomes and patient demographics, tDCS seems to be complementary to classical and novel rehabilitation approaches. With minimal adverse effects (if screening parameters are respected), none of which were serious, and a high potential to improve recovery when using optimal parameters (i.e.: 20 min of stimulation, at 2 mA with 25 or 35cm2 electrodes that are regularly humidified), tDCS could potentially be ready for clinical applications.Implications for RehabilitationtDCS could potentially be ready for clinical application.Evidence of very low to very high quality is available on the effectiveness of tDCS to improve motor control following stroke.This should with caution be focused on the primary motor cortex.","output":"Evaluating the effects of tDCS in stroke patients using functional outcomes: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Intravenous medication is essential for many hospital inpatients. However, providing intravenous therapy is complex and errors are common. 'Smart pumps' incorporating dose error reduction software have been widely advocated to reduce error. However, little is known about their effect on patient safety, how they are used or their likely impact. This study will explore the landscape of intravenous medication infusion practices and errors in English hospitals and how smart pumps may relate to the prevalence of medication administration errors. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This is a mixed-methods study involving an observational quantitative point prevalence study to determine the frequency and types of errors that occur in the infusion of intravenous medication, and qualitative interviews with hospital staff to better understand infusion practices and the contexts in which errors occur. The study will involve 5 clinical areas (critical care, general medicine, general surgery, paediatrics and oncology), across 14 purposively sampled acute hospitals and 2 paediatric hospitals to cover a range of intravenous infusion practices. Data collectors will compare each infusion running at the time of data collection against the patient's medication orders to identify any discrepancies. The potential clinical importance of errors will be assessed. Quantitative data will be analysed descriptively; interviews will be analysed using thematic analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval has been obtained from an NHS Research Ethics Committee (14/SC/0290); local approvals will be sought from each participating organisation. Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences for academic and health professional audiences. Results will also be fed back to participating organisations to inform local policy, training and procurement. Aggregated findings will inform the debate on costs and benefits of the NHS investing in smart pump technology, and what other changes may need to be made to ensure effectiveness of such an investment.","output":"Exploring the Current Landscape of Intravenous Infusion Practices and Errors (ECLIPSE): protocol for a mixed-methods observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Congenital infection of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be exceptionally rare despite many cases of COVID-19 during pregnancy.

We examined 19 COVID-19 exposed placentas for histopathologic findings, and for expression of ACE2, and TMPRSS2 by immunohistochemistry. Direct placental SARS-CoV-2 expression was studied by two methodsnucleocapsid protein expression by immunohistochemistry, and RNA expression by in situ hybridization. ACE2 membranous expression in the syncytiotrophoblast (ST) of the chorionic villi is predominantly in a polarized pattern with expression highest on the stromal side of the ST. In addition, cytotrophoblast and extravillous trophoblast express ACE2. No ACE2 expression was detected in villous stroma, Hofbauer cells, or endothelial cells. TMPRSS2 expression was only present weakly in the villous endothelium and rarely in the ST. In 2 of 19 cases, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in the placenta focally in the ST and cytotrophoblast. There was no characteristic histopathology present in our cases including the two placental infections. We found that the placenta is capable of being infected but that this event is rare.

These challenges involve its actual and perceived role within the medical system, in particular how psychiatric hospitals can maintain their core mission of attending to people with mental illness while at the same time providing relief to overstretched general medicine services. Although psychiatric disorders comprise the leading cause of the global burden of disease, mental healthcare has been deemphasised in the wake of the onslaught of the pandemic: to make room for emergency care, psychiatric wards have been downsized, clinics closed, psychiatric support systems discontinued and so on. To deal with this pressing issue, we developed a pandemic contingency plan with the aim to contain, decelerate and, preferably, avoid transmission of COVID-19 and to enable and maintain medical healthcare for patients with mental disorders. AIMS: To describe our plan as an example of how a psychiatric hospital can share in providing acute care in a healthcare system facing an acute and highly infectious pandemic like COVID-19 and at the same time provide support for people with mental illness, with or without a COVID-19 infection. METHOD: This was a descriptive study. RESULTS: The plan was based on the German national pandemic strategy and several legal recommendations and was implemented step by step on the basis of the local COVID-19 situation. In addition, mid- and long-term plans were developed for coping with the aftermath of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The plan enabled the University Hospital to maintain medical healthcare for patients with mental disorders. It has offered the necessary flexibility to adapt its implementation to the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. The plan is designed to serve as an easily adaptable blueprint for psychiatric hospitals around the world.","output":"Role of psychiatric hospitals during a pandemic: introducing the Munich Psychiatric COVID-19 Pandemic Contingency Plan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is no practical dementia risk score in the clinical setting. OBJECTIVE: To derive and validate a score obtained by a rapid and simple assessment, which guides primary care providers in predicting the risk of dementia among older adults. DESIGN: A total of 4178 participants from three longitudinal cohorts (mean age at baseline = 76.8 [SD = 7.6] years), without baseline dementia, followed annually for a median of 10 years (IQR: 5 to16 years, Reverse Kaplan-Meier). PARTICIPANTS: To derive the score, we used data from 1,780 participants from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (93% White). To validate the score, we used data from 1,299 participants from the Religious Order Study (92% White), and to assess generalizability, 679 participants from the Minority Aging Research Study (100% Black). MEASUREMENTS: Clinician-based dementia diagnosis at any time after baseline and predictive variables associated with dementia risk that can be collected in a primary care setting: demographics, clinical indicators, medical history, memory complaints, cognitive and motor tests, and questions to assess functional disability, depressive symptoms, sleep, social isolation, and genetics (APOE e4 and AD polygenic risk score). RESULTS: At baseline, age, memory complaint, the ability to handle finances, the recall of the month, recall of the room, and recall of three words, were associated with the cumulative incidence of dementia, in the derivation cohort. The discrimination of the RADaR (Rapid Risk Assessment of Dementia) was good for the derivation and external-validation cohorts (AUC3 years = 0.82-0.86), compared to the overall discrimination of age alone (AUC3 years = 0.73), a major risk factor for dementia.

DESIGN: UKs PwO (body mass index of 30 kg/m(2) based on self-reported height and weight) and HCPs who manage patients with obesity completed an online survey. RESULTS: In the UK, 1500 PwO and 306 HCPs completed the survey. Among the 47% of PwO who discussed weight with an HCP in the past 5 years, it took a mean of 9 years from the start of their struggles with weight until a discussion occurred. HCPs reported that PwO initiated 35% of weight-related discussions; PwO reported that they initiated 47% of discussions. Most PwO (85%) assumed full responsibility for their own weight loss. The presence of obesity-related comorbidities was cited by 76% of HCPs as a top criterion for initiating weight management conversations. The perception of lack of interest (72%) and motivation (61%) in losing weight was reported as top reasons by HCPs for not discussing weight with a patient. Sixty-five per cent of PwO liked their HCP bringing up weight during appointments. PwO reported complex and varied emotions following a weight loss conversation with an HCP, including supported (36%), hopeful (31%), motivated (23%) and embarrassed (17%). Follow-up appointments were scheduled for 19% of PwO after a weight discussion despite 62% wanting follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The current narrative around obesity requires a paradigm shift in the UK to address the delay between PwO struggling with their weight and discussing weight with their HCP. Perceptions of lack of patient interest and motivation in weight management must be challenged along with the blame culture of individual responsibility that is prevalent throughout society. While PwO may welcome weight-related conversations with an HCP, they evoke complex feelings, demonstrating the need for sensitivity and respect in these conversations.

Loss-of-function mutations of MC4R constitute the most common monogenic cause of early-onset extreme obesity in humans, whereas gain-of-function mutations appear to be protective. In particular, two relatively frequent alleles carrying the non-synonymous coding mutations V103I or I251L have been associated with lower risks of obesity and type-2 diabetes. Although V103I and I251L MC4Rs showed more efficient signaling in transfected cells, their specific effects in live animals remain unexplored. Here, we investigated whether the introduction of V103I and I251L mutations into the mouse MC4R leads to a lean phenotype and provides protection against an obesogenic diet. METHODS: Using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated two novel strains of mice carrying single nucleotide mutations into the mouse Mc4r which are identical to those present in V103I and I251L MCR4 human alleles, and studied their phenotypic outcomes in mice fed with normal chow or a high-fat diet. In particular, we measured body weight progression, food intake and adiposity. In addition, we analyzed glucose homeostasis through glucose and insulin tolerance tests. RESULTS: We found that homozygous V103I females displayed shorter longitudinal length and decreased abdominal white fat, whereas homozygous I251L females were also shorter and leaner due to decreased weight in all white fat pads examined. Homozygous Mc4rV103I/V103I and Mc4rI251L/I251L mice of both sexes showed improved glucose homeostasis when challenged in a glucose tolerance test, whereas Mc4rI251L/I251L females showed improved responses to insulin. Despite being leaner and metabolically more efficient, V103I and I251L mutants fed with a hypercaloric diet increased their fasting glucose levels and adiposity similar to their wild-type littermates. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our results demonstrate that mice carrying V103I and I251L MC4R mutations displayed gain-of-function phenotypes that were more evident in females. However, hypermorphic MC4R mutants were as susceptible as their control littermates to the obesogenic and diabetogenic effects elicited by a long-term hypercaloric diet, highlighting the importance of healthy feeding habits even under favorable genetic conditions.","output":"Mouse models for V103I and I251L gain of function variants of the human MC4R display decreased adiposity and are not protected from a hypercaloric diet"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The serious impact of the COVID-19 pandemic also affected educational institutions offering tourism programs and students perceptions of their future career in the industry.

PRL has pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory functions. High PRL serum level or hyperprolactinemia is associated with different viral infections. In coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), which caused by positive-sense single-strand RNA virus known as severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), PRL serum level is increased. PRL in Covid-19 may exacerbate the underlying inflammatory status by induction release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, PRL through its anti-inflammatory effects may reduce the hyperinflammatory status in Covid-19. The underlying mechanism of increasing PRL in Covid-19 is poorly understood. Therefore, in this review we try to find the potential anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory role of PRL in Covid-19.

Projections expect massive climate-related migration in this century. Nascent research calls to study health, migration, population, and armed conflict potential together, accounting for EICC and other factors. System science offers a way: develop a dynamic simulation model (DSM). We aim to validate the feasibility and usefulness of a pilot DSM intended to serve as a proof-of-concept and a basis for identifying model extensions to make it less simplified and more realistic. METHODS: Studies have separately examined essential parts. Our DSM integrates their results and computes composites of health problems (HP), health care (HC), non-EICC environmental health problems (EP), and environmental health services (ES) by origin site and by immigrants and natives in a destination site, and conflict risk and intensity per area. The exogenous variables include composites of EICC, sociopolitical, economic, and other factors. We simulate the model for synthetic input values and conduct sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The simulation results refer to generic origin and destination sites anywhere on Earth. The effects sizes are likely inaccurate from a real-world view, as our input values are synthetic. Their signs and dynamics are plausible, internally consistent, and, like the sizes, respond logically in sensitivity analyses. Climate migration may harm public health in a host area even with perfect HC/ES qualities and full access; and no HP spillovers across groups, conflict, EICC, and EP. Deviations from these conditions may worsen everyones health. We consider adaptation options. CONCLUSIONS: This work shows we can start developing DSMs to understand climate migration and public health by examining each case with its own inputs. Validation of our pilot model suggests we can use it as intended. We lay a path to making it more realistic for policy analysis.

Such an outbreak occurred in the UK associated with acute vomiting in dogs between December 2019 and March 2020. We tracked this outbreak using the clinical free text component of anonymised electronic health records (EHRs) collected from a sentinel network of participating veterinary practices. We sourced the free text (narrative) component of each EHR supplemented with one of 10 practitioner-derived main presenting complaints (MPCs), with the gastroenteric MPC identifying cases involved in the disease outbreak. Such clinician-derived annotation systems can suffer from poor compliance requiring retrospective, often manual, coding, thereby limiting real-time usability, especially where an outbreak of a novel disease might not present clinically as a currently recognised syndrome or MPC. Here, we investigate the use of an unsupervised method of EHR annotation using latent Dirichlet allocation topic-modelling to identify topics inherent within the clinical narrative component of EHRs. The model comprised 30 topics which were used to annotate EHRs spanning the natural disease outbreak and investigate whether any given topic might mirror the outbreak time-course. Narratives were annotated using the Gensim Library LdaModel module for the topic best representing the text within them. Counts for narratives labelled with one of the topics significantly matched the disease outbreak based on the practitioner-derived gastroenteric MPC (Spearman correlation 0.978); no other topics showed a similar time course. Using artificially injected outbreaks, it was possible to see other topics that would match other MPCs including respiratory disease. The underlying topics were readily evaluated using simple word-cloud representations and using a freely available package (LDAVis) providing rapid insight into the clinical basis of each topic. This work clearly shows that unsupervised record annotation using topic modelling linked to simple text visualisations can provide an easily interrogable method to identify and characterise outbreaks and other anomalies of known and previously un-characterised diseases based on changes in clinical narratives.","output":"Using topic modelling for unsupervised annotation of electronic health records to identify an outbreak of disease in UK dogs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many countries have responded (or have considered responding) to the COVID pandemic by modifying their intellectual property laws to ensure the availability of vaccines, medicines, diagnostics, and related information.

One of the potential ways to limit its spread is by controlling free international travel. The objective of this systematic review is to identify, critically-appraise and summarize evidence on international travel-related control measures. Methods: This review is based on the Cochrane review: International travel-related control measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and followed the same methods. In brief, we searched for clinical and modelling studies in general health and COVID-19-specific bibliographic databases. The primary outcome categories were (i) cases avoided, (ii) a shift in epidemic development and, (iii) cases detected. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. Results: We assessed 66 full-text articles that met with our inclusion criteria. Seventeen new studies (modelling = 9, observational = 8) were identified in the updated search. Most studies were of critical to moderate risk of bias. The added studies did not change the main conclusions of the Cochrane review nor the quality of the evidence (very low to low certainty). However, it did add to the evidence base for most outcomes. Conclusions: Weak evidence supports the use of international travel-related control measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 via air travel.

Because of the pandemic, virtual clinics were implemented to provide diabetes care. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the impact of these virtual clinics on glycaemic control among high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS A prospective single-cohort pre-/post telemedicine care intervention study was conducted on 130 patients with type 2 DM attending a virtual integrated care clinic at a chronic Illness center in a family and community medicine department in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS The mean age of the participants was 57 years (standard deviation (SD) = 12) and the mean (SD) duration of diabetes was 14 (7) years. Over a period of 4 months, the HbA1c decreased significantly from 9.98  1.33 pre-intervention to 8.32  1.31 post-intervention (mean difference 1.66  1.29; CI = 1.43-1.88; P <0.001). In addition, most in-person care visits were successfully replaced, as most patients (64%) needed only one or two in-person visits during the 4-month period, compared with typically one visit every 1-2 weeks in the integrated care programme before the pandemic for this group of high-risk patients. DISCUSSION The current study found a significant positive impact of telemedicine care on glycaemic control among high-risk patients with DM during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, it showed that telemedicine could be integrated into diabetic care to successfully replace many of the usual in-person care visits. Consequently, health policy makers need to consider developing comprehensive guidelines in Saudi Arabia for telemedicine care to, ensure the quality of care and address issues such as financial reimbursement and patient information privacy.","output":"The impact of telemedicine on patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia: Findings and implications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mitochondrial function needs strong interactions of mitochondrial and nuclear (mitonuclear) genomes, which can be disrupted by mitonuclear mismatch due to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) introgression between two formerly isolated populations or taxa. This mitonuclear disruption may cause severe cellular stress in mismatched individuals. Gene expression changes and alternative splicing (AS) are two important transcriptional regulations to respond to environmental or cellular stresses. We previously identified a naturally introgressed population in the intermediate horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis). Individuals from this population belong to R. a. himalayanus and share almost identical nuclear genetic background; however, some of them had mtDNA from another subspecies (R. a. macrurus). With this unique natural system, we examined gene expression changes in six tissues between five mitonuclear mismatched and five matched individuals. A small number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and functional enrichment analysis revealed that most DEGs were related to immune response although some may be involved in response to oxidative stress. In contrast, we identified extensive AS events and alternatively spliced genes (ASGs) between mismatched and matched individuals. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that multiple ASGs were directly or indirectly associated with energy production in mitochondria which is vital for survival of organism. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the role of AS in responding to cellular stress caused by mitonuclear mismatch in natural populations. Our results suggest that AS may play a more important role than gene expression regulation in responding to severe environmental or cellular stresses.","output":"Extensive alternative splicing triggered by mitonuclear mismatch in naturally introgressed Rhinolophus bats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Up to now, a total of eight Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of autoimmune and myeloproliferative disease.

We investigated a fully automated body segmentation algorithm for measuring WC on abdominal computed tomography (CT) in comparison to manual WC measurements (WC-manual) and evaluated the performance of CT-measured WC for identifying overweight/obesity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included consecutive adults who underwent both abdominal CT scans and manual WC measurements at a health check-up between January 2013 and November 2019. Mid-waist WCs were automatically measured on noncontrast axial CT images using a deep learning-based body segmentation algorithm. The associations between CT-measured WC and WC-manual was assessed by Pearson correlation analysis and their agreement was assessed through Bland-Altman analysis. The performance of these WC measurements for identifying overweight/obesity (i.e., body mass index [BMI] 25 kg/m(2)) was evaluated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Among 763 subjects whose abdominal CT scans were analyzed using a fully automated body segmentation algorithm, CT-measured WCs were successfully obtained in 757 adults (326 women; mean age, 54.3 years; 64 women and 182 men with overweight/obesity). CT-measured WC was strongly correlated with WC-manual (r = 0.919, p < 0.001), and showed a mean difference of 6.1 cm with limits of agreement between -1.8 cm and 14.0 cm in comparison to WC-manual. For identifying overweight/obesity, CT-measured WC showed excellent performance, with areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of 0.960 (95% CI, 0.933C0.979) in women and 0.909 (95% CI, 0.878C0.935) in men, which were comparable to WC-manual (AUCs of 0.965 [95% CI, 0.938C0.982] and 0.916 [95% CI, 0.886C0.941]; p = 0.735 and 0.437, respectively).

This pilot study aims to examine the speech recognition performance of ASR apps using audiological speech tests. In addition, we compare ASR speech recognition performance to normal hearing and hearing impaired listeners and evaluate if standard clinical audiological tests are a meaningful and quick measure of the performance of ASR apps. METHODS: Four apps have been tested on a smartphone, respectively AVA, Earfy, Live Transcribe, and Speechy. The Dutch audiological speech tests performed were speech audiometry in quiet (Dutch CNC-test), Digits-in-Noise (DIN)-test with steady-state speech-shaped noise, sentences in quiet and in averaged long-term speech-shaped spectrum noise (Plomp-test). For comparison, the app's ability to transcribe a spoken dialogue (Dutch and English) was tested. RESULTS: All apps scored at least 50% phonemes correct on the Dutch CNC-test for a conversational speech intensity level (65 dB SPL) and achieved 90C100% phoneme recognition at higher intensity levels. On the DIN-test, AVA and Live Transcribe had the lowest (best) signal-to-noise ratio +8 dB. The lowest signal-to-noise measured with the Plomp-test was +8 to 9 dB for Earfy (Android) and Live Transcribe (Android). Overall, the word error rate for the dialogue in English (19C34%) was lower (better) than for the Dutch dialogue (25C66%). CONCLUSION: The performance of the apps was limited on audiological tests that provide little linguistic context or use low signal to noise levels. For Dutch audiological speech tests in quiet, ASR apps performed similarly to a person with a moderate hearing loss. In noise, the ASR apps performed more poorly than most profoundly deaf people using a hearing aid or cochlear implant.

However, knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection, diseases and therapy remains limited, underlining the urgency of fundamental studies and drug development. Studies have shown that induction of autophagy and hijacking of autophagic machinery are essential for infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2; however, the mechanism of this manipulation and function of autophagy during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unclear. In the present study, we identified ORF3 as an inducer of autophagy and revealed that ORF3 localizes to the ER and induces FAM134B-related ERphagy through the HMGB1-Beclin1 pathway. As a consequence, ORF3 induces ER stress and inflammatory responses through ERphagy and sensitizes cells to ER stress-induced cell death, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3 hijacks ERphagy and then harms ER homeostasis to induce inflammatory responses through excessive ER stress. These findings reveal a sequential induction of ERphagy, ER stress and acute inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide therapeutic potential for ERphagy and ER stress-related drugs for COVID-19 treatment and prevention. Importance SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication require autophagosome-like double-membrane vacuoles. Inhibition of autophagy suppresses viral replication, indicating the essential role of autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, how SARS-CoV-2 hijacks autophagy and the function of autophagy in the disease progression remain unknown.

Therefore, centralized isolation of close contacts and suspected patients is an important measure to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. At present, the quarantine duration in most countries is 14 d due to the fact that the incubation period of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is usually identified as 1-14 d with median estimate of 4-7.5 d. Since COVID-19 patients in the incubation period are also contagious, cases with an incubation period of more than 14 d need to be evaluated. CASE SUMMARY: A 70-year-old male patient was admitted to the Department of Respiratory Medicine of The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University on April 5 due to a cough with sputum and shortness of breath. On April 10, the patient was transferred to the Fever Clinic for further treatment due to close contact to one confirmed COVID-19 patient in the same room. During the period from April 10 to May 6, nucleic acid and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were tested 7 and 4 times, respectively, all of which were negative. On May 7, the patient developed fever with a maximum temperature of 39, and his respiratory difficulties had deteriorated. The results of nucleic acid and antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2 were positive. On May 8, the nucleic acid and antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Heilongjiang Provincial Center for Disease Control were also positive, and the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 and reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period. Further epidemiological investigations and clinical observations are urgently needed to identify the optimal incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 and formulate rational and evidence-based quarantine policies for COVID-19 accordingly.","output":"COVID-19 patient with an incubation period of 27 d: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We performed a retrospective screening of 428 serum samples for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin during a period of low prevalence.

If several strains could be isolated worldwide, especially for in-vitro drug susceptibility testing and vaccine development, few laboratories routinely isolate SARS-CoV-2. This is due to the fact that the current co-culture strategy is highly time consuming and requires working in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. In this work, we present a new strategy based on high content screening automated microscopy (HCS) allowing large scale isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples in 1 week. A randomized panel of 104 samples, including 72 tested positive by RT-PCR and 32 tested negative, were processed with our HCS procedure and were compared to the classical isolation procedure. Isolation rate was 43 % with both strategies on RT-PCR positive samples, and was correlated with the initial RNA viral load in the samples, where we obtained a positivity threshold of 27 Ct. Co-culture delays were shorter with HCS strategy, where 80 % of the positive samples were recovered by the third day of co-culture, as compared to only 25 % with the classic strategy. Moreover, only the HCS strategy allowed us to recover all the positive elements after 1 week of co-culture.

It can help in eliminating the crowd at the notice board and can also save their time. With the help of an admit card generated to which a barcode be attached, an examinee can scan that code each day and know their seating location as per a daily basis.

Here we adapted a stage-shift model to inform service planning decisions within NHS Scotland for the Detect Cancer Early tumours, breast, colorectal and lung cancer which represent 46% of all cancers diagnosed in Scotland. Methods & Data: Lung, colorectal and breast cancer incidence data for years 2017-18 were obtained from Public Health Scotland Cancer Quality Performance Indicators (QPI), to define a baseline scenario. The most current stage-specific 5-year survival data came from 2009-2014 national cancer registry and South East Scotland Cancer Network (SCAN) QPI audit datasets. The Degeling et al., inverse stage-shift model was adapted to estimate changes in stage at diagnosis, excess mortality and life-years lost from delays to diagnosis and treatment due to Covid-19-related health services disruption. Three and 6-month periods of disruption were simulated to demonstrate the model predictions. Results: Approximately, 1-9% reductions in stage I/II presentations leading up to 2-10% increases in stage III/IV presentations are estimated across the three cancer types. A 6-month period of service disruption is predicted to lead to excess deaths at 5 years of 32.5 (31.1, 33.9) per 1000 cases for lung cancer, 16.5 (7.9, 24.3) for colorectal cancer and 31.6 (28.5, 34.4) for breast cancer. Conclusions: Disruption of cancer diagnostic services can lead to significant excess deaths in following years. Increasing diagnostic and capacity for cancer services to deal with the backlog of care are needed. Real time monitoring of incidence and referral patterns over the disruption and post-disruption period to reduce excess deaths including more rapid incidence data by stage and other key tumour/clinical characteristics at presentation for key cancer cases (on a quarterly basis).

We developed predictive models by applying machine learning methods (i.e., elastic net and lasso regression models) to YARH's self-reports of internet use. The YARH were aged 14-24 years old (N = 1287) from Los Angeles and New Orleans. Models were fit to three binary indicators of YARH's lifetime internet searches for general health, sexual and reproductive health (SRH), and social service information. YARH responses regarding internet health information seeking were fed into machine learning models with potential predictor variables based on findings from previous research, including sociodemographic characteristics, sexual and gender minority identity, healthcare access and engagement, sexual behavior, substance use, and mental health. About half of the YARH reported seeking general health and SRH information and 26% sought social service information. Areas under the ROC curve ( .75) indicated strong predictive models and results were consistent with the existing literature. For example, higher education and sexual minority identification was associated with seeking general health, SRH, and social service information. New findings also emerged. Cisgender identity versus transgender and non-binary identities was associated with lower odds of general health, SRH, and social service information seeking.

Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model. RESULTS: According to the observational studies, patients who received CBPs showed a decline in all-cause mortality compared with patients who did not receive CBPs (odds ratio (OR) 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23-0.56; p < 0.00001). However, the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed no difference between the intervention group and the control group regarding all-cause mortality (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.57-1.19; p = 0.30). The use of CBPs did not increase the risk of adverse events (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60-1.29; p = 0.51).

Additionally, the reflective collaboration deployed methodologically in this study highlights how higher education faculty can marshal intellectual resources across distinct disciplines to identify and develop responsive pedagogy in advanced science courses at the university level.","output":"Titrating Teaching: An Interdisciplinary Case Study of Online and Face-to-Face Undergraduate Biochemistry Instruction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and reduced albumin have been prominently correlated with unfavorable outcomes in patients with cardiovascular diseases. However, whether combination BUN and albumin levels could predict the adverse outcomes of cardiac surgery patients remains to be confirmed. Here, we investigated the prognostic effect of the preoperative BUN to serum albumin ratio (BAR) in cardiac surgery patients. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III and eICU databases and classified into a training cohort and validation cohort. The BAR (mg/g) was calculated by initial BUN (mg/dl)/serum albumin (g/dl). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were 1-year mortality, prolonged length at intensive care unit, and duration of hospital stay. The associations of BAR with outcomes were explored by multivariate regression analysis and subgroup analyses. Then, C statistics were performed to assess the added prognostic impact of BAR beyond a baseline risk model. RESULTS: Patients with in-hospital death had significantly higher levels of BAR. Multivariate regression analysis identified BAR, as a categorical or continuous variable, as an independent factor for adverse outcomes of cardiac surgery (all p < 0.05). Subgroup analyses demonstrated a significant relationship between elevated BAR and in-hospital mortality in different subclasses. The addition of BAR to a baseline model provided additional prognostic information benefits for assessing primary outcome. Results were concordant in the external validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Increased preoperative BAR is a potent predictor of unfavorable outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.","output":"Elevated Blood Urea Nitrogen to Serum Albumin Ratio Is an Adverse Prognostic Predictor for Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Major infectious disease outbreaks are a constant threat to human health. Clinical research responses to outbreaks generate evidence to improve outcomes and outbreak control. Experiences from previous epidemics have identified multiple challenges to undertaking timely clinical research responses. This scoping review is a systematic appraisal of political, economic, administrative, regulatory, logistical, ethical and social (PEARLES) challenges to clinical research responses to emergency epidemics and solutions identified to address these. METHODS: A scoping review. We searched six databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, PsycINFO, Scopus and Epistemonikos) for articles published from 2008 to July 2018. We included publications reporting PEARLES challenges to clinical research responses to emerging epidemics and pandemics and solutions identified to address these. Two reviewers screened articles for inclusion, extracted and analysed the data. RESULTS: Of 2678 articles screened, 76 were included. Most presented data relating to the 2014-2016 Ebola virus outbreak or the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. The articles related to clinical research responses in Africa (n = 37), Europe (n = 8), North America (n = 5), Latin America and the Caribbean (n = 3) and Asia (n = 1) and/or globally (n = 22). A wide range of solutions to PEARLES challenges was presented, including a need to strengthen global collaborations and coordination at all levels and develop pre-approved protocols and equitable frameworks, protocols and standards for emergencies. Clinical trial networks and expedited funding and approvals were some solutions implemented. National ownership and community engagement from the outset were a key enabler for delivery. Despite the wide range of recommended solutions, none had been formally evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: To strengthen global preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic and future epidemics, identified solutions for rapid clinical research deployment, delivery, and dissemination must be implemented. Improvements are urgently needed to strengthen collaborations, funding mechanisms, global and national research capacity and capability, targeting regions vulnerable to epidemics and pandemics. Solutions need to be flexible to allow timely adaptations to context, and research led by governments of affected regions. Research communities globally need to evaluate their activities and incorporate lessons learnt to refine and rehearse collaborative outbreak response plans in between epidemics.","output":"Addressing challenges for clinical research responses to emerging epidemics and pandemics: a scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the State of Maryland established a 250-bed emergency response field hospital at the Baltimore Convention Center to support the existing health care infrastructure.

We aimed to detect signals of impact on health services utilization during the first year of policy implementation and to provide early data to policy-makers. METHODS We constructed cohorts of users of originator infliximab: 3 historical cohorts (2016-2018) and 1 policy cohort (2019). We extracted data from BC Ministry of Health databases from 2015 to 2020, as we followed each cohort for 365 days from May 27 of each cohort's respective year. We excluded patients with gastrointestinal conditions and those not covered by PharmaCare. We examined the cumulative incidence of infliximab prescription refills, switching to other biologic drugs and use of additional health services. A log-likelihood ratio of 1.96 compared with the null hypothesis was used as the threshold for differences between the policy cohort and the historical cohorts. RESULTS The study included a total of 572 unique patients: 520 in the 2016 historical cohort, 461 in the 2017 historical cohort, 423 in the 2018 historical cohort and 377 in the policy cohort (with some patients included in multiple cohorts; 335 [58.6%] were included in all 4 cohorts). During months 8 and 9 of follow-up, a transient signal was observed in infliximab refills (7.2% decrease in refilling infliximab for the fourth time for the policy cohort, log-likelihood ratio > 1.96). An anticipated increase in visits to specialists was observed from month 4 forward (15.0%, log-likelihood ratio > 1.96). No signal was observed for increased use of other health services (log-likelihood ratio < 1.96). INTERPRETATION Early monitoring did not detect signals of negative impacts on health services use during the first year of the policy.

In this study, a high GABA producing C. glutamicum strain was constructed by chromosomal editing. Lactobacillus brevis-derived gadB2 was introduced into the chromosome of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid and simultaneously blocked the biosynthesis of lactate and acetate. GABA transport and degradation in C. glutamicum were also blocked to improve GABA production. As precursor of GABA, L-glutamic acid synthesis in C. glutamicum was enhanced by introducing E. coli gdhA encoding glutamic dehydrogenase, and the copy numbers of gdhA and gadB2 were also optimized for higher GABA production. The final C. glutamicum strain CGY705 could produce 33.17 g/L GABA from glucose in 2.4-L bioreactor after 78 h fed-batch fermentation. Since all deletion and expression of genes were performed using chromosomal editing, fermentation of the GABA producing strains constructed in this study does not need supplementation of any antibiotics and inducers.

In the light of the negative impact of air pollution on health and the direct and indirect mediation of this impact through risk perceptions, it is crucial to better understand the lay perceptions of air pollution. Since qualitative research methods are well suited for this aim, the central objective of this study is to present a review of qualitative research articles in the field of environmental epidemiology that investigate health risk perceptions of ambient air pollution since the 2000s. METHODS: We followed the PRISMA-guidelines which resulted in a selection of 20 scientific articles published in peer-reviewed academic journals that used qualitative research methods and reported on health risk perceptions about ambient air pollution. RESULTS: Qualitative research in the field of environmental epidemiology is still scarce. Most of the studies included in the review were based on face-to-face interviews and focus group discussions; a minority used a mixed-method approach. Interesting contributions were made with respect to both the perception of exposure to air pollution and the perception of the health effect associated with air pollution. CONCLUSIONS: The review suggests that data generated through qualitative research might complement the traditionally quantitative field of environmental epidemiology. Mixed method multidisciplinary research is likely to provide a more holistic explanation of environmental health patterns observed through quantitative research. These explanations are key in managing environmental health and in developing successful prevention, mitigation and communication strategies. Implementing qualitative research methods contribute to the field of environmental epidemiology as it i) allows for triangulation of findings; ii) generates nuanced findings and new research questions; iii) triggers in-depth understandings of quantitatively identified patterns; iv) leads to additional surprising and/or multifaceted responses; v) enhances relationships between researcher and respondent; vi) increases the awareness of important context-dependent dynamics or interactions that may generate biases and vii) grasps the local, contextual, situational and cultural elements that interact with health risk perceptions.","output":"Qualitative research about public health risk perceptions on ambient air pollution.

The outbreak that started from January 22, 2020, in Fujian Province has been controlled as the number of indigenous cases has not increased since March. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in Fujian Province, China. METHODS: In this retrospective, multicenter study, we collected and analyzed the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data of all cases confirmed by nucleic acid tests in five designated hospitals in Fujian Province between January 22 and February 27, 2020. All patients were followed up until discharge. COVID-19 severity was classified as mild, moderate, severe, or critical. RESULTS: Of 199 discharged patients with COVID-19, 105 patients were male, with a median age of 46.3 years, and 17 patients were severe, and 5 patients were critical on admission. Hypertension and diabetes were the most common comorbidities. The symptoms at illness onset were mainly fever (76.4%), cough (60.8%), and myalgia or fatigue (27.6%). A total of 96.5% of patients had abnormal imaging findings on chest computed tomography. Lymphopenia (37.2%) and hypoxemia (13.6%) were observed. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure occurred in 9 patients (4.5%) and 8 patients (4.0%) respectively. One patient died and the others were cured and discharged with the median hospital stay of 19 days. Old age was negatively correlated with lymphocyte count (r = - 0.296, p < 0.001) and oxygenation index (r = - 0.263, p = 0.001). Bivariate regression analysis revealed that old age (&#8805; 75 years), hypertension, diabetes, and lymphopenia were correlated with the severity of COVID-19.

Recent studies have found that loneliness and living in isolation are likely to cause an acceleration in the cognitive decline associated with AD. Therefore, understanding social behaviours of AD patients is crucial to promote sociability, thus delaying cognitive decline, preserving independence, and providing a good quality of life. In this work, we analyze the localization data of AD patients living in assisted care homes to gather insights about the social dynamics among them. We use localization data collected by a system based on iBeacon technology comprising two components: a network of antennas scattered throughout the facility and a Bluetooth bracelet worn by the patients. We redefine the Relational Index to capture wandering and casual encounters, these being common phenomena among AD patients, and use the notions of Relational and Popularity Indexes to model, visualize and understand the social behaviour of AD patients. We leverage the data analyses to build predictive tools and applications to enhance social activities scheduling and sociability monitoring and promotion, with the ultimate aim of providing patients with a better quality of life. Predictions and visualizations act as a support for caregivers in activity planning to maximize treatment effects and, hence, slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

Although hypoalbuminemia has been related with severity in COVID-19, there is no agreement of the albumin cutoff points with a potential clinical use. Additionally, a measure of strength of the association between albumin levels and mortality has not been reported. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate if Child Pug albumin categories are associated with mortality and obtain the strength of the association. Methods Patients admitted to hospitalization with a positive SARS CoV 2 PCR from 4 April to 24 June 2020 were analyzed. Three groups were formed based on Child-Pugh albumin categories. Death frequency were compared between groups and statistical significance of the difference were assessed using a Xi2 test, strength of association between albumin levels and death was evaluated with a Kendalls Tau B test. Results A total of 348 patients were studied, age was 54.4  14.7 years, 250 (71.8%) were male and 182 patients died (52%). Association of Albumin level and Death is presented Table 1, Kendall Tau B shows that knowing albumin level improves in 32% the prediction of death and since it has a negative coefficient at a lower level of albumin, risk of death increase. Conclusions Kendalls Tau-B shows a strong association between Child-Pug albumin categories and death, so is possible its use in clinical decisions as a marker of severity.","output":"P-4 ALBUMIN LEVELS HAVE STRONGASSOCIATION WITH MORTALITY IN COVID-19 INFECTED PATIENS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Targeted treatment of cancer hinges on the identification of specific intracellular molecular receptors on cancer cells to stimulate apoptosis for eventually inhibiting growth; the development of novel ligands to target biomarkers expressed by the cancer cells; and the creation of novel multifunctional carrier systems for targeted delivery of anticancer drugs to specific malignant sites. There are numerous receptors, antigens, and biomarkers that have been discovered as oncological targets (oncotargets) for cancer diagnosis and treatment applications. Oncotargets are critically important to navigate active anticancer drug ingredients to specific disease sites with no/minimal effect on surrounding normal cells. In silico techniques relating to genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics have catalyzed the discovery of oncotargets for various cancer types. Effective oncotargeting requires high-affinity probes engineered for specific binding of receptors associated with the malignancy. Computational methods such as structural modeling and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations offer opportunities to structurally design novel ligands and optimize binding affinity for specific oncotargets. This article proposes a streamlined approach for the development of ligand-oncotarget bioaffinity systems via integrated structural modeling and MD simulations, making use of proteomics, genomic, and X-ray crystallographic resources, to support targeted diagnosis and treatment of cancers and tumors.","output":"Oncological Ligand-Target Binding Systems and Developmental Approaches for Cancer Theranostics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using the unique Survey of Foreigner Residents in China from 2018 to 2019, this study examines the assimilation of international migrants in China by considering how migrants intention to assimilate and perceptions of local control affect their behavior, which in turn affects their assimilation outcomes. The main behavior upon which we focus on is the formation of a host social network. Regression analyses and formal mediation analyses are performed to explore how intention and perceived control serve as motivators or barriers that facilitate or restrict international migrants acculturation and structural assimilation via host social network formation or other behaviors. Our results show that migrants intention to assimilate has significant effects on their acculturation and structural assimilation outcomes via the establishment of a host social network and via other behaviors. As a result, it has a strong total impact on migrants assimilation outcomes, as tested with a formal Sobel test. Migrants perceptions of local control, in contrast, have negative direct effects on both acculturation and structural assimilation, but no significant indirect effects are identified, which suggests that perceived local control may not affect migrants formation of a host social network but may influence other behaviors. From the Sobel test, we find no evidence of total effects from the perceptions of local control.

A pilot study conducted in 2017 among GMT pilgrims showed that 41.8% of participants reported respiratory symptoms, mostly due to rhinovirus (13.0%), coronaviruses (16.0%) and adenovirus (4.6%). METHODS A PCR-based prospective cohort study was conducted among GMT pilgrims and controls (who did not participate to the event) in two rural villages in South Senegal, in 2019. RESULTS 93 pilgrims and 84 controls were included in the study. There were no significant differences between pilgrims and controls regarding demographic characteristics and chronic conditions. 60.2% of pilgrims reported respiratory symptoms during their stay in Touba, or soon after their return. By contrast, only 8.3% of controls reported respiratory symptoms after the GMT. The acquisition of rhinovirus, coronaviruses, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis was 22.6%, 6.5%, 17.2% and 6.8% respectively in pilgrims and was significantly higher than in controls (3.6%, 0%, 4.8% and 1.2% respectively). Respiratory symptoms post-GMT were five times more frequent in S. pneumoniae carriers (aOR = 5.18, 95%CI = [1.98 - 13.57]).

Recently, the literature has identified desiderata of counterfactual explanations, such as feasibility, actionability and sparsity that should support their applicability in real-world contexts. However, we show that the literature has neglected the problem of the time dependency of counterfactual explanations. We argue that, due to their time dependency and because of the provision of recommendations, even feasible, actionable and sparse counterfactual explanations may not be appropriate in real-world applications.

Participants were 18 years of age or older and must not have traveled outside of their country since March 15, 2020 (n= 12 328, M age= 38.1 years, 65% female). Four drinking behaviors (online socializing drinking [OSD], drinking with child present [DCP], drinking before 5 p.m. [DB5]), heavy episodic drinking [HED]) were response variables, and quarantining, anxiety symptoms and sociodemographic covariables were explanatory variables. Results. Quarantine was positively associated with a higher frequency of OSD and with DCP, but negatively associated with a higher frequency of HED. Anxiety symptoms were associated with a higher frequency of HED, more OSD, and DB5. Higher incomes seemed to be more associated with all the studied drinking behaviors. Women tended to report less DB5 and less HED during the pandemic. Conclusions. Quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic seems to affect drinking behavior and mental health indicators like anxiety symptoms.

METHODS A multi-institutional database was retrospectively queried for all femoropopliteal bypass procedures from 1995-2020. Cumulative incidence function estimated the long-term rate of bypass graft infection (BGI) and Fine-Gray model was used to determine independent risk factors for BGI to account for death as a competing risk. RESULTS Over the 25-year period, 1315 femoral popliteal bypasses were identified with a median follow-up of 2.89 years (IQR 0.75-6.55). BGI was diagnosed in 34 (2.6%) patients. BGI occurred between 9 days and 11.2 years postoperatively, with a median 109 days. Estimated 1- and 5-year incidence of BGI was 2.1% (95% CI, 1.4-3.1%) and 2.8% (95% CI, 1.9-3.9%) respectively. Medical comorbidities, indications for bypass, and popliteal bypass targets (above- vs below-knee) were similar between BGI patients and all patients (p=NS each). Patients with BGI were more frequently complicated by postoperative hematoma (14.7% vs 3.7%), superficial wound infection (38.2% vs 19.2%), lymphocele/lymphorrhea (8.8% vs 2.1%), and 30-day readmission rates (47.1% vs 21.3%) (p<0.05 each). Most commonly isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (n=19, 55.9%) and polymicrobial cultures (n=5, 14.7%). Reoperation for BGI involved incision and drainage (n=7, 20.6%), graft excision without reconstruction (n=12, 35.3%), graft excision with in-line reconstruction (n=11, 32.4%), and graft excision with extra-anatomic reconstruction (n=2, 5.9%). Nine BGI patients (26.5%) ultimately required major amputation. Prosthetic bypass (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] 3.73 [1.64-8.51], p=0.002), postoperative hematoma (SHR 3.44 [1.23-9.61], p=0.018), and 30-day readmission (SHR 2.75 [1.27-5.44], p=0.010) were independently associated with BGI. One-year amputation-free survival was 50% (95% CI, 31.9-65.7%) after BGI. CONCLUSIONS BGI is a rare complication of femoral-popliteal bypass with significant morbidity. Graft infection is associated with the use of prosthetic grafts, postoperative hematoma, and unplanned hospital readmission. Mitigation of these risk factors may decrease the risk of this dreaded complication.","output":"Risk Factors and Consequences of Graft Infection after Femoropopliteal Bypass: A 25-year Experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral infections are associated with coagulation disorders.

The impact of such changes in the workflow of AECs on throughput and other performance indicators is largely unknown, although a significant reduction in revenue stream is expected. METHODS: A discrete event simulation-based model was developed in the setting of a small to medium community-based single-specialty AEC to quantify the impact of COVID-19-related workflow changes on performance indicators and cost per case compared with the pre-COVID-19 baseline. RESULTS: In the simulation model, post-COVID-19 recommended workflow changes significantly impacted the operational and productivity metrics and, in turn, adversely affected financial metrics. Overall, there was a significant decrease in staff utilization and consequent increase in total facility time, waiting time for patients, and cost per case because of a bottleneck at the time of preprocedure COVID-19 screening and testing while practicing social distancing. Strategies to minimize this adverse impact on productivity were assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Pretesting and screening for COVID-19 as recommended by current guidelines will significantly impact the productivity and revenue stream of AECs.

Here, by using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study, we show how the risk of local outbreaks can be assessed when non-symptomatic transmission can occur. We construct a branching process model that includes non-symptomatic transmission and explore the effects of interventions targeting non-symptomatic or symptomatic hosts when surveillance resources are limited. We consider whether the greatest reductions in local outbreak risks are achieved by increasing surveillance and control targeting non-symptomatic or symptomatic cases, or a combination of both. We find that seeking to increase surveillance of symptomatic hosts alone is typically not the optimal strategy for reducing outbreak risks. Adopting a strategy that combines an enhancement of surveillance of symptomatic cases with efforts to find and isolate non-symptomatic infected hosts leads to the largest reduction in the probability that imported cases will initiate a local outbreak.","output":"Interventions targeting non-symptomatic cases can be important to prevent local outbreaks: SARS-CoV-2 as a case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When higher education moved online this past spring because of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, few faculty or administrators had time to stop and ponder the intellectual property?related questions regarding remote instruction Do faculty own materials used when teaching remotely, or does the university (as employer and software provider) have a claim?

H2O2 and K2S2O8 co-reactants can promote each other to continuously generate corresponding radicals (OHa?, 1O2, O2a?-, SO4a?-) that trigger the CL emission of luminol. H2O2 can also be constantly produced by the reaction of K2S2O8 and H2O to further extend the persistence of this CL system. CL emission can be quenched via ascorbic acid (AA), which can be generated through hydrolysis reaction of L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate trisodium salt (AAP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Next, a CL-based method was established for the detection of ALP with good linearity from 0.08 to 5 UL-1 and a limit of detection of 0.049 UL-1. The proposed method was used to detect ALP in human serum samples.","output":"A catalyst-free co-reaction system of long-lasting and intensive chemiluminescence applied to the detection of alkaline phosphatase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cannabis sativa var. Kompolti, a variety routinely used for food production purposes, is characterized by a low concentration of psychoactive molecules, although containing many other biologically attractive metabolites in all parts of the plant, including the roots. In the present work, we evaluate the specific biological activities of the roots extract from plants cultivated through aeroponics, an affordable and reliable method facilitating the isolation and processing of roots, with the advantage of being suitable for industrial scale-up. Furthermore, aeroponics results in an increased net accumulation of the most biologically attractive constituents (-sitosterol, friedelin and epi-friedelanol) found in the roots. The ethanolic extract of the aeroponic roots of C. sativa (APEX) and its separate components are studied to evaluate their anti-inflammatory (modulation of the expression level of specific markers upon LPS stimulation in U937 cells, such as IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, IkB-, iNOS, IRAK-1 and miR-146a) and antioxidant (in either acellular or cellular settings) activities. The APEX anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacities are also functionally benchmarked using the wound-healing assay. On the whole, the data obtained show that APEX and its main components showed significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, which may render the exploitation of roots as a source of natural antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents highly attractive, with the additional technical and economic advantages of aeroponics compared to soil cultivation.","output":"Characterization of the Biological Activity of the Ethanolic Extract from the Roots of Cannabis sativa L.

In the following years, a great number of building sites were activated, building workers resulted intensely exposed and represent a relevant target for research on environmental mutagenesis and epidemiological surveillance. Cells of buccal mucosa are considered an appropriate site for early detecting of cytogenetic damage, since it represents the first barrier in inhalation or ingestion and can metabolize carcinogenic agents into reactive chemicals. Our study is aimed 1) at comparing the early genotoxic damage as measured by the buccal mucosa micronucleus test in two subgroups of workers defined by different occupational exposure and 2) at evaluating possible confounding variables such as lifestyle factors. METHODS AND RESULTS A cross-sectional study was conducted in L'Aquila, on 24 outdoor workers (OWs) highly exposed on the construction sites and 26 indoor workers (IWs), all subjected to the compulsory occupational surveillance system, in the period 2017-2018. Buccal cells samples were collected and, based on the Micronucleus test, the exfoliated cells were classified in respect of nuclear changes observed. Moreover, a self-report questionnaire composed of 84 items, was administered to the workers. RESULTS Significant differences were observed between Exp+ (OWs) and Exp- (IWs) in the number of the analyzed cells (expressed as mean value out of 1000 cells): respectively 954.46 vs 990.06 normal cells, (p < 0.001); 19.79 vs 4.95 micronucleated cells, as marker of chromosomal damage (p < 0.001); 13.93 vs 8.96 binucleated cells, as marker of failed cytokinesis (p < 0.001); 2.09 vs 1.18 karyolytic cells, as marker of cell death and damaged DNA (p < 0.05). According with a multivariate regression analysis, in addition to the job exposure (OW vs IW, beta = 12.221, p < 0.001), the only variable independently associated with an increase in Micronuclei (MNs) is the smoking habit (OWs vs IWs, beta = 6.683, p < 0.001) which, even if not associated with dust exposure, worsens cell integrity. Moreover, this worsening effect is weaker in workers not exposed to the site dust (moderation effect). Within social demographic factors, the high educational level only apparently seems to affect MNs number: even if unbalanced in favor of IWs vs OWs, this variable resulted a confounder, since its effect disappears when the interaction between these two factors is considered, because it is a covariate of smoking habit as well as of the job condition. CONCLUSION Despite some limitation, our findings clearly confirm the role of occupational exposure as a marker of cytogenetic damage associated with MNs number in construction workers. Moreover, smoking status appears as the only other investigated factor independently associated to the outcome. The statistical model, in addition, highlights possible moderation and confounding effects, such as interaction between smoking and occupational exposure and the unbalanced school education level in workers. Micronucleus test in exfoliated buccal cells would be considered a suitable method for studying the early genotoxic damage in the construction occupational setting as well as in evaluating the efficacy of preventive practices.","output":"Early genotoxic damage through micronucleus test in exfoliated buccal cells and occupational dust exposure in construction workers: a cross-sectional study in L'Aquila, Italy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated economies and public health systems across the globe, increasing the anticipation for the creation of an effective vaccine With this comes the reinforcement of debates between the right to health and pharmaceutical patent rights The purpose of this study is to illustrate how the Philippines could attempt to balance the right to health with pharmaceutical patent rights in the introduction of a potential COVID-19 vaccine into the country Design/methodology/approach: This will be accomplished through an examination of the flexibilities allowed by international agreements and domestic patent laws Findings: With the economic and health challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippine Government will have a strong justification to pursue parallel importation and compulsory licencing under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights This is exacerbated by the bold leadership of President Duterte, whose administration has so far shown a propensity to decide in favor of the right to health at the expense of other rights in dealing with the pandemic Originality/value: While this paper focuses on the Philippines, it has a potential application in the least developed and developing countries which aim to gain access to a prospective COVID-19 vaccine Moreover, while this study discusses the harmonization of laws on the right to health and patent laws as a solution to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of access to vaccines, it also calls for solutions that go beyond the application of the law ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Analysing the interplay between the right to health and pharmaceutical patent rights in the introduction of a COVID-19 vaccine into the Philippines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background COVID-19 is often characterized by an acute upper respiratory tract infection. However, information on longer-term clinical sequelae following acute COVID-19 is emerging. We followed a group of persons with COVID-19 in Zambia at two months to assess persistent symptoms. Methods In September 2020, we re-contacted participants from SARS-CoV-2 prevalence studies conducted in Zambia in July 2020 whose PCR tests were positive. Participants with valid contact information were interviewed using a structured questionnaire that captured demographics, pre-existing conditions, and types and duration of symptoms. We describe the frequency and duration of reported symptoms and used chi-square tests to explore variability of symptoms by age group, gender, and underlying conditions. Results Of 302 participants, 155 (51%) reported one or more acute COVID-19-related symptoms in July 2020. Cough (50%), rhinorrhoea (36%) and headache (34%) were the most frequently reported symptoms proximal to diagnosis. The median symptom duration was 7 days (IQR: 3-9 days). At a median follow up of 54 days (IQR: 46-59 day), 27 (17%) symptomatic participants had not yet returned to their pre-COVID-19 health status. These participants most commonly reported cough (37%), headache (26%) and chest pain (22%). Age, sex, and pre-existing health conditions were not associated with persistent symptoms. Conclusion A notable percentage of persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection in July still had symptoms nearly two months after their diagnosis.

This paper explored the operationalization of using key opinion leaders (KOLs) to distribute HIVST (HIV self-test) kits to MSM. This qualitative survey used a combination of in-depth interviews (IDI) with HIVST users and focus group discussions (FGDs) with KOLs to collect data three months after the distribution of the test kits by the KOLs. Thematic analysis of the data was carried out. RESULT: Three themes were generated namely: KOLs serve as a trusted resource to promote and support HIVST for the MSM community; Skills and qualifications required for KOLs to effectively distribute and promote uptake of HIVST; and Effective strategies used to create demand and promote uptake of HIVST. CONCLUSION: This study showed the practical steps involved in operationalizing KOL support system distribution of HIVST that positively influenced the testing experience for the participants irrespective of the HIV status and engagement in care.

DESIGN: Data were collected from service providers on the number of children who had their appointments cancelled during the first lockdown. Paediatric dentists and clinical leads contributed views on the likely impact of these cancellations on the affected children. RESULTS: 1,456 children had their appointments cancelled in the six weeks between 20th March and 30th June 2020. The key themes identified from providers included lengthening waiting lists, challenges of swab testing and self-isolation and the need to re-orientate dental services to increase prevention.

In addition, elevated levels of multiple pathobionts and lower levels of protective or anti-inflammatory microbes were observed in the faecal microbiome of those with the poorest clinical outcomes. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identified modules that associated severity-associated cytokines with tryptophan metabolism, coagulation-linked fibrinopeptides, and bile acids with multiple pathobionts. In contrast, less severe clinical outcomes associated with clusters of anti-inflammatory microbes such as Bifidobacterium or Ruminococcus, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and IL-17A.

Smartphone photogrammetry could offer a low cost alternative, but there is no widely accepted imaging technique for prosthetic socket digitisation. Therefore, this paper aims to determine an optimal imaging technique for whole socket photogrammetry and evaluate the resultant scan measurement accuracy. A 3D printed transtibial socket was produced to create digital and physical twins, as reference models. The printed socket was photographed from 360 positions and simplified genetic algorithms were used to design a series of experiments, whereby a collection of photos were processed using Autodesk ReCap. The most fit technique was used to assess accuracy. The accuracy of the socket wall volume, surface area and height were 61.63%, 99.61% and 99.90%, respectively, when compared to the digital reference model. The scanned model had a wall thickness ranging from 2.075 mm at the top to 7.758 mm towards the base of the socket, compared to a consistent thickness of 2.025 mm in the control model. The technique selected did not show sufficient accuracy for clinical application due to the degradation of accuracy nearer to the base of the socket interior.

RESULTS A total of 1407 articles were included in the review, involving 28,030 participants. The annual representation of women ranged from a mean of 11.6% [95% credible interval (CI); 9.2, 14.3] to 17.8% [95% CI; 15.2, 20.6] across the 10 years, indicating studies predominantly included men. Nonetheless, there was a small statistical increase in the overall proportion of women, with a mean overall proportion change of 0.7% [95% CI; 0.2, 1.2] per year. The increase appeared to be driven by a reduction in the number of studies including only men, rather than studies including more women alongside men, or increased women-only studies. Less than one third of articles involving women reported the menstrual orientation of participants and less than one quarter reported both menstrual orientation and phase. This study shows that women were proportionally underrepresented in exercise thermoregulation research during the past decade and the majority of studies did not report menstrual cycle details of female participants. Researchers should consider including women in future work where their inclusion could contribute meaningful data that enhance the evidence-based and ultimately improves our comprehension of women's thermal physiology.","output":"Female (Under) Representation in Exercise Thermoregulation Research."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 has now been confirmed globally.

The Aneurysm Study of Pipeline In an observational Registry (ASPIRe) study prospectively analyzed rates of complete aneurysm occlusion and neurologic adverse events following PED treatment of intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a multicenter study prospectively evaluating patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with PED. Primary outcomes included (1) spontaneous rupture of the Pipeline-treated aneurysm; (2) spontaneous nonaneurysmal intracranial hemorrhage (ICH); (3) acute ischemic stroke; (4) parent artery stenosis, and (5) permanent cranial neuropathy. Secondary endpoints were (1) treatment success and (2) morbidity and mortality at the 6-month follow-up. Vascular imaging was evaluated at an independent core laboratory. RESULTS One hundred and ninety-one patients with 207 treated aneurysms were included in this registry. The mean aneurysm size was 14.5  6.9 mm, and the median imaging follow-up was 7.8 months. Twenty-four aneurysms (11.6%) were small, 162 (78.3%) were large and 21 (10.1%) were giant. The median clinical follow-up time was 6.2 months. The neurological morbidity rate was 6.8% (13/191), and the neurological mortality rate was 1.6% (3/191). The combined neurological morbidity/mortality rate was 6.8% (13/191). The most common adverse events were ischemic stroke (4.7%, 9/191) and spontaneous ICH (3.7%, 7/191). The complete occlusion rate at the last follow-up was 74.8% (77/103). CONCLUSIONS Our prospective postmarket study confirms that PED treatment of aneurysms in a heterogeneous patient population is safe with low rates of neurological morbidity and mortality.

We aimed to determine whether the percentage of circulating fibrocytes could be predictive of severity and prognosis during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Blood fibrocytes were quantified by flow cytometry as CD45(+)/CD15(?)/CD34(+)/collagen-1(+) cells in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia. In a subgroup of patients admitted in an intensive care unit (ICU), fibrocytes were quantified in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Serum amyloid P (SAP), transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1), CXCL12, CCL2, and FGF2 concentrations were measured. We included 57 patients in the hospitalized group (median age = 59 yr [23C87]) and 16 individuals as healthy controls. The median percentage of circulating fibrocytes was higher in the patients compared with the controls (3.6% [0.2C9.2] vs. 2.1% [0.9C5.1], P = 0.04). Blood fibrocyte count was lower in the six patients who died compared with the survivors (1.6% [0.2C4.4] vs. 3.7% [0.6C9.2], P = 0.02). Initial fibrocyte count was higher in patients showing a complete lung computed tomography (CT) resolution at 3 mo. Circulating fibrocyte count was decreased in the ICU group (0.8% [0.1C2.0]), whereas BAL fibrocyte count was 6.7% (2.2C15.4). Serum SAP and TGF-1 concentrations were increased in hospitalized patients. SAP was also increased in ICU patients. CXCL12 and CCL2 were increased in ICU patients and negatively correlated with circulating fibrocyte count.

RESULTS: Valid responses were received from 36 hospitals. Most of these programmes offered both in-person and online therapy. The most common aim of these interventions was emotional regulation, which was treated by psychoeducational and cognitive-behavioural techniques in individual interventions. Group interventions mainly used psychoeducation and mindfulness. Only half of the teams that offered in-person interventions received training in the proper use of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Several hospitals in Spain have developed mental health interventions for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, deploying a wide range of therapeutic modalities and techniques.

Extreme contamination events, i.e. those exceeding normative are generally rare with respect to bathing conditions and thus the data is said to be imbalanced. Modeling and predicting those rare events present unique challenges. Here we introduce and evaluate several machine learning techniques and metrics to model imbalanced data and evaluate model performance. We do so by using a) simulated data-sets and b) a real data base with records of faecal coliform abundance monitored for 10 years in 21 recreational beaches in Uruguay (N  19000) using in situ and meteorological variables. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the methods and provide a simple guide to perform models for a general audience. We also provide R codes to reproduce model fitting and testing. We found that most Machine Learning techniques are sensitive to imbalance and require specific data pre-treatment (e.g. upsampling) to improve performance. Accuracy (i.e. correctly classified cases over total cases) is not adequate to evaluate model performance on imbalanced data set. Instead, true positive rates (TPR) and false positive rates (FPR) are recommended. Among the 52 possible candidate algorithms tested, the stratified Random forest presented the better performance improving TPR in 50% with respect to baseline (0.4) and outperformed baseline in the evaluated metrics. Support vector machines combined with upsampling method or synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) performed well, similar to Adaboost with SMOTE.

Here, we aimed to explore the functional role of circRNA itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (circITCH) in the development and doxorubicin (DXR) resistance of OS and the possible mechanistic pathway. METHODS Quantitative real-time PCR or western blot assays were exploited to analyze the expression of circITCH, miR-524 and Ras association domain family member 6 (RASSF6). Cell viability and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of DXR were monitored by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Cell migration, invasion and apoptosis were determined via transwell assay and flow cytometry. The target interaction among circITCH, miR-524 and RASSF6 was validated by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay. A xenograft model of MG-63/DXR cells stably expressing circITCH in nude mice was established for assessing the role of circITCH in vivo. RESULTS Downregulation of circITCH and RASSF6, as well as the upregulation of miR-524 were revealed in OS by study of 40 paired OS tissue and normal tissue samples. Overexpression of circITCH lowered the cell viability, IC50 value of DXR, migration and invasion, while facilitated apoptosis of OS cells. CircITCH sponged miR-524 to upregulate RASSF6, causing OS progression inhibition and DXR resistance reduction. Additionally, circITCH upregulation reduced tumor growth in vivo. CONCLUSIONS Transduction with circITCH represses OS progression and promotes DXR sensitivity by the miR-524/RASSF6 axis, providing a new perspective for therapeutic intervention.","output":"Downregulation of circITCH promotes osteosarcoma development and resistance to doxorubicin via the miR-524/RASSF6 axis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[...]we contend that how corporations define great leadership in their company need not change for the sake of change itself based on COVID-19, particularly if the models are based on theory, research, and detailed validation efforts.

Donor recipient body weight ratio (D/R ratio) was identified as one of the main variables related with the success to achieve the target cell dose for transplantation. According to this variable we modified the mobilization schedule. MATERIAL AND METHODS We report the results of 46 mobilizations and apheresis procedures performed in our center with unfavorable D/R ratio. Mobilization was attempted by the standard regime of G-CSF (10 mcg/kg/24 hours) in 28 cases (60.9%), with high dose G-CSF (10 mcg/kg/12 hours) in 9 cases (19.6%), and with plerixafor and G-CSF single dose regime in 9 cases (19.6%). RESULTS CD34+ cell quantification before apheresis is closely related to CD34+ yield, being the only factor related to collected CD34+ cells (beta .71; P < .0001). The mobilization efficiency was higher in plerixafor group compared to the other two schedules (P < .0001). By using plerixafor for mobilization, we achieved the target CD34+ cell dose of 2  106 /kg per recipient body weight in all cases with unfavorable D/R ratio. It was observed that 17.4% of cases that not reached the established target cell dose were located in the standard or high-dose mobilization regimes. This difference is even greater for optimal collections (5  106 /kg), since of the 54.3% cases that did not reach this goal none was mobilized by plerixafor. CONCLUSION Tailoring the mobilization regime we can reach the target cell dose, even in those cases with the worst D/R ratio.","output":"Plerixafor-based mobilization in pediatric healthy donors with unfavorable donor/recipient body weight ratio resulted in a better CD34+ collection yield: A retrospective analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Chest CT has an essential role in the detection and evaluation of novel coronary pneumonia (COVID-19) and has be regarded as a critical supplement for RT-PCR.

Access was achieved via a single-port, with four channels placed through a transumblical incision. After the apex of prostate was separated from the urethra, a self-developed port ('Zhu's port') was inserted through the urethra to facilitate resection of prostate and urethrovesical anastomosis. The peri-operative and postoperative data were collected and analysed retrospectively. Patients were followed up postoperatively for evidence of long-term side effects. RESULTS All the procedures were completed successfully. No conversion to conventional laparoscopic surgery was necessary. For LESS RP, the average operating time was 152 min. Estimated blood loss was 117 mL. The mean hospital stay was 16.4 days after surgery. For LESS RC with CU and LESS RC with OIN, the mean operating times were 215 and 328 min, mean estimated blood loss was 175 and 252 mL, and mean hospital stay was 9.4 and 18.2 days, respectively. Six patients required blood transfusion (5.26%). Intra-operative complications occurred in two patients (1.75%), and postoperative complications in nine (7.89%).

The median readmission lasted 5 (IQR 3.5C11) days, and none was >14 days. Except for the acute bleeds, we identified early signs of decompensation in all cases, e.g. failed Stroop test, hypotension or reduction/gain in body fluid (weight), and facilitated 2 short hospitalizations of the 8 total readmissions.Based on early signs of decompensation, we contacted patients on 16 other occasions, guiding intervention and likely preventing further readmissions as confirmed by an independent physician panel.

METHODS We injected a known amount of gel into unused ETT to simulate secretions. We calculated the volume of gel analyzing MicroCT scans for a length of 20 cm. We then collected eleven ETTs after extubation of critically ill patients, recording clinical and demographical data. We assessed the amount of secretions by MicroCT and obtained ETT microbiological cultures. RESULTS Gel volumes assessed by MicroCT strongly correlated with injected gel volumes (p < 0.001, r2 = 0.999).MicroCT revealed the accumulation of secretions on all the ETTs (median 0.154, IQR:0.02-0.837 mL), corresponding to an average cross-sectional area reduction of 1.7%. The amount of secretions inversely correlated with patients' age (p = 0.011, rho = -0.727) but not with days of intubation, SAPS2, PaO2/FiO2 assessed on admission.

Phages displaying sdAbs against rDIII were panned with the synthetic analogs of the DIII receptor binding motifs, DIII-1(G299CK307) and DIII-2(V371CR388), and the VHH gene from the eluted phages was subcloned into E. coli SHuffle. Soluble sdAbs purified from 96 E. coli SHuffle clones were screened to identify 20 candidates strongly binding to the synthetic analogs of DIII-1(G299CK307) and DIII-2(V371CR388) on a dot blot assay. Among them, sdAb(A1), sdAb(A6), sdAb(A9), and sdAb(A10) blocked the interaction between rDIII and human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) on Western blot and cell ELISA. However, optimum stability during the overexpression was noticed only for sdAb(A10) and it also neutralized the WNVClike particles (WNV-VLP) in the Luciferase assay with an half maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) of 1.48 nm. Furthermore, the hemocompatibility and cytotoxicity of sdAb(A10) were assessed by a hemolytic assay and XTT-based hBMEC proliferation assay resulting in 0.1% of hemolytic activity and 82% hBMEC viability, respectively. Therefore, the sdAb(A10) targeting DIII-2(V371CR388) of the WNV envelope glycoprotein is observed to be suitable for in vivo trials as a specific therapy for WNVCinduced neuropathogenesis.","output":"Engineering the Single Domain Antibodies Targeting Receptor Binding Motifs Within the Domain III of West Nile Virus Envelope Glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses form the largest and most diverse group of eukaryote-infecting viruses. Their genomes comprise one or more segments of coding-sense RNA that function directly as messenger RNAs upon release into the cytoplasm of infected cells. Positive-sense RNA viruses are generally accepted to encode proteins solely on the positive strand. However, we previously identified a surprisingly long (1,000-codon) open reading frame (ORF) on the negative strand of some members of the family Narnaviridae which, together with RNA bacteriophages of the family Leviviridae, form a sister group to all other positive-sense RNA viruses. Here, we completed the genomes of three mosquito-associated narnaviruses, all of which have the long reverse-frame ORF. We systematically identified narnaviral sequences in public data sets from a wide range of sources, including arthropod, fungal, and plant transcriptomic data sets. Long reverse-frame ORFs are widespread in one clade of narnaviruses, where they frequently occupy >95 per cent of the genome. The reverse-frame ORFs correspond to a specific avoidance of CUA, UUA, and UCA codons (i.e. stop codon reverse complements) in the forward-frame RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ORF. However, absence of these codons cannot be explained by other factors such as inability to decode these codons or GC3 bias. Together with other analyses, we provide the strongest evidence yet of coding capacity on the negative strand of a positive-sense RNA virus. As these ORFs comprise some of the longest known overlapping genes, their study may be of broad relevance to understanding overlapping gene evolution and de novo origin of genes.","output":"A case for a negative-strand coding sequence in a group of positive-sense RNA viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies on immunologic memory in animal models and especially in the human system are instrumental to identify mechanisms and correlates of protection necessary for vaccine development.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of cardiac involvement and of respiratory failure in a cohort of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in an academic hospital in Lombardy, one of the most affected Italian (and worldwide) regions by the epidemic. The study included 405 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a medical ward from February 25th to March 31st, 2020. Follow-up of surviving patients ended either at hospital discharge or by July 30th, 2020. Myocardial injury was defined on the basis of the presence of blood levels of hs-TnI above the 99th percentile upper reference limit. Respiratory function was assessed as PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F) ratio. The primary end-point was death for any cause. During hospitalization, 124 patients died. Death rate increased from 7.9% in patients with normal hs-TnI plasma levels and no cardiac comorbidity to 61.5% in patients with elevated hs-TnI and cardiac involvement (p < 0.001). At multivariable analysis, older age, P/F ratio < 200 (both p < 0.001) and hs-TnI plasma levels were independent predictors of death. However, it must be emphasized that the median values of hs-TnI were within normal range in non-survivors.

METHODS: An online survey was developed and delivered to the Lebanese general population. The questionnaire included the participants sociodemographic characteristics, financial situation, attitude toward vaccination, and WTP for the hypothetical vaccine. The study was based on the contingent valuation method. RESULTS: Among 500 individuals solicited, 352 individuals agreed to participate (participation rate = 70.4%); among them, 66% were between 18 and 45 years old, and 54% were women.

The problem of inferring individual sources from ambiguous mixtures of sounds is known as blind source decomposition. Experiments on humans have demonstrated that the auditory system can identify sound sources as repeating patterns embedded in the acoustic input. Source repetition produces temporal regularities that can be detected and used for segregation. Specifically, listeners can identify sounds occurring more than once across different mixtures, but not sounds heard only in a single mixture. However, whether such a behavior can be computationally modeled has not yet been explored. Here, we propose a biologically inspired computational model to perform blind source separation on sequences of mixtures of acoustic stimuli. Our method relies on a somatodendritic neuron model trained with a Hebbian-like learning rule which was originally conceived to detect spatio-temporal patterns recurring in synaptic inputs. We show that the segregation capabilities of our model are reminiscent of the features of human performance in a variety of experimental settings involving synthesized sounds with naturalistic properties. Furthermore, we extend the study to investigate the properties of segregation on task settings not yet explored with human subjects, namely natural sounds and images. Overall, our work suggests that somatodendritic neuron models offer a promising neuro-inspired learning strategy to account for the characteristics of the brain segregation capabilities as well as to make predictions on yet untested experimental settings.","output":"Modeling the Repetition-Based Recovering of Acoustic and Visual Sources With Dendritic Neurons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Recombinant nanoworms are promising candidates for materials and biomedical applications ranging from the templated synthesis of nanomaterials to multivalent display of bioactive peptides and targeted delivery of theranostic agents.

To advance the identification of design principles for the programmable assembly of proteins into well-defined nanoworms and to broaden their stability regimes, we were inspired by the ability of topologically engineered synthetic macromolecules to acess rare mesophases. To test this design principle in biomacromolecular assemblies, we used post-translational modifications (PTMs) to generate lipidated proteins with precise topological and compositional asymmetry. Using an integrated experimental and computational approach, we show that the material properties (thermoresponse and nanoscale assembly) of these hybrid amphiphiles are modulated by their amphiphilic architecture.

Here, we demonstrate how liposomes can significantly improve the LOD of traditional gold nanoparticle (AuNP)Cbased assays while fully supporting a ready-to-use system for commercial application. We fine-tuned liposomes towards photometric and fluorescence performance on the synthesis level and applied them in an established interleukin 6 (IL-6) immunoassay normally using commercial AuNP labels. IL-6s low abundance (< 10 pg mL(?1)) and increasing relevance as prognostic marker for infections make it an ideal model analyte. It was found that liposomes with a high encapsulant load (150 mmol L(?1) sulforhodamine B (SRB)) easily outperform AuNPs in photometric LFAs. Specifically, liposomes with 350 nm in diameter yield a lower LOD even in complex matrices such as human serum below the clinically relevant range (7 pg mL(?1)) beating AuNP by over an order of magnitude (81 pg mL(?1)). When dehydrated on the strip, liposomes maintained their signal performance for over a year even when stored at ambient temperature and indicate extraordinary stability of up to 8 years when stored as liquid. Whereas no LOD improvement was obtained by exploiting the liposomes fluorescence, an extraordinary gain in signal intensity was achieved upon lysis which is a promising feature for high-resolution and low-cost detection devices. Minimizing the procedural steps by inherently fluorescent liposomes, however, is not feasible. Finally, liposomes are ready for commercial applications as they are easy to mass-produce and can simply be substituted for the ubiquitously used AuNPs in the POCT market.

In developing nations such as Jordan, appreciable impacts on healthcare delivery ensued owing to limited resources. As a result, managing chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) has been modified to accommodate altercations in the system. This study assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on managing patients with critical limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) during the lockdown. METHODS: Objectives were accomplished by retrieving records of clinical data and perioperative results for patients diagnosed with CLTI at King Abdullah University Hospital between March 17 and June 1, 2020. Patients' demographics, Rutherford classification, type of intervention, and intervention variables during the outbreak were retrospectively analyzed (pandemic Group A) and compared with patients from the same period last year (control Group B). RESULTS: A total of 96 patients with CLTI were included in the study; Groups A and B consisted of 28 and 68 patients, respectively. The mean ages for Groups A and B were 62.8 and 60.2 years, respectively. Conservative management was applied to 53.6% (P < 0.01) of Group A patients, whereas endovascular revascularization was the primary approach in Group B (39.7%, P < 0.01). After the intervention, the majority of patients in Group A were classified as category six on the Rutherford classification system (46.4%, P < 0.01), whereas the majority in group B were classified as category five (55.9%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The more unsatisfactory outcome of CLTI during the pandemic entails substantial measures to ensure conscientious virtual encounters and ambulatory community-based services during current and future pandemics. The endovascular-first policy should be endorsed in future pandemics as it is better at reducing aerosol transmission than standard surgical intervention. Moreover, endovascular procedures are minimally invasive and associated with favorable outcomes when medical optimization and hospital beds are limited.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia in Northern Jordan: Case series and literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has cast a significant threat to mankind.

METHODS: A qualitative study was done in three districts of South Gondar Zone. Community key informants and health extension workers were selected purposely for in-depth interviews and focus group discussion. The interviews were conducted by maintaining WHO recommendations for social distancing and use of appropriate personal protective equipment. The sample size for the study depended on the theoretical saturation of the data at the time of data collection. The qualitative data generated from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions was transcribed verbatim and translated into English language and thematically analyzed using open code software version 4.02. RESULTS: Three main themes and five categories emerged from the narrations of the participants regarding the perceived barriers for the practice of COVID-19 prevention measures. A total of 9 community key informants (5 women development armies (HDA), 2 health extension workers (HEW), and 2 religious leaders participated in the in-depth interview, while two focus group discussions (7 participants in each round) were conducted among purposely selected community members. The age of the participants ranged from 24 to 70 years with the median age of 48 years. The major identified barriers for practicing COVID-19 prevention measures were the presence of strong cultural and religious practices, perceiving that the disease does not affect the young, misinformation about the disease, and lack of trust in the prevention measures. CONCLUSIONS: Socio-cultural, religious, and economic related barriers were identified from the participants narratives for the practice of COVID-19 prevention measures in south Gondar Zone.

After entry into cells, corona viruses (CoV) activate aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhRs) by an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1)-independent mechanism, bypassing the IDO1-kynurenine-AhR pathway. The IDO1-kynurenine-AhR signaling pathway is used by multiple viral, microbial and parasitic pathogens to activate AhRs and to establish infections. AhRs enhance their own activity through an IDO1-AhR-IDO1 positive feedback loop prolonging activation induced by pathogens. Direct activation of AhRs by CoV induces immediate and simultaneous up-regulation of diverse AhR-dependent downstream effectors, and this, in turn, results in a \\"Systemic AhR Activation Syndrome\\" (SAAS) consisting of inflammation, thromboembolism, and fibrosis, culminating in multiple organ injuries, and death. Activation of AhRs by CoV may lead to diverse sets of phenotypic disease pictures depending on time after infection, overall state of health, hormonal balance, age, gender, comorbidities, but also diet and environmental factors modulating AhRs. We hypothesize that elimination of factors known to up-regulate AhRs, or implementation of measures known to down-regulate AhRs, should decrease severity of infection. Although therapies selectively down-regulating both AhR and IDO1 are currently lacking, medications in clinical use such as dexamethasone may down-regulate both AhR and IDO1 genes, as calcitriol/vitamin D3 may down-regulate the AhR gene, and tocopherol/vitamin E may down-regulate the IDO1 gene. Supplementation of calcitriol should therefore be subjected to epidemiological studies and tested in prospective trials for prevention of CoV infections, as should tocopherol, whereas dexamethasone could be tried in interventional trials. Because lack of physical exercise activates AhRs via the IDO1-kynurenine-AhR signaling pathway increasing risk of infection, physical exercise should be encouraged during quarantines and stay-at-home orders during pandemic outbreaks. Understanding which factors affect gene expression of both AhR and IDO1 may help in designing therapies to prevent and treat humans suffering from Covid-19.","output":"AhR and IDO1 in pathogenesis of Covid-19 and the \\"Systemic AhR Activation Syndrome:\\" a translational review and therapeutic perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) is a major cause of infertility, but its etiology remains poorly understood.

These rates have currently not been described during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in comparison to other viral pneumonias. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Single high-volume tertiary critical care department at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Patients 16 years old or greater receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020, with coronavirus disease 2019 were compared with a cohort of patients with influenza pneumonia between June 1, 2012, and May 31, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The rates of venous thromboembolism and hemorrhage were compared in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 against a historic population of patients with influenza pneumonia who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. There were 51 patients who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to coronavirus disease 2019 and 80 patients with influenza. At cannulation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 37% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with 8% of patients with influenza had filling defects on CT pulmonary angiography (p = 0.0001). Catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis shown on ultrasound Doppler after decannulation was present in 53% with coronavirus disease 2019 versus 25% with influenza (p = 0.01). The rates of intracranial hemorrhage at the time of cannulation were 16% with coronavirus disease 2019 and 14% with influenza (p = 0.8). Elevated D-dimer levels were seen in both conditions and were significantly higher in those with pulmonary thromboembolism than those without in coronavirus disease 2019 (p = 0.02).

Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cornerstone of an effective public health response. However, efforts to test have been hampered by limited reagents, limitations in the availability of swabs used for the collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens, limitations in personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care providers collecting the NPS specimens, and limitations in viral transport media for transporting the specimens. Therefore, more flexible options for screening for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses are critical to inform clinical and public health responses. OBJECTIVE: We aim to document the ability of patients to self-collect sufficient specimens for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection and serology. METHODS: Patient self-collection of samples will be done with observation by a health care provider during a telemedicine session. Participants will be mailed a specimen collection kit, engage in a telehealth session with a provider through a HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996)-compliant video meeting, and collect specimens while being observed by the provider. Providers will record whether they are confident in the suitability of the specimen for laboratory testing that would inform clinical decision making. We will objectively assess the sufficiency of biological material in the mailed-in specimens. RESULTS: The protocol was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board (IRB) on March 30, 2020 (Protocol number 371). To date, we have enrolled 159 participants. CONCLUSIONS: Defining a conceptual framework for assessing the sufficiency of patient-collected samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses to infection is critical for facilitating public health responses and providing PPE-sparing options to increase testing.

For pathogen detection, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from all subjects. Blood and pleural fluid cultures were available per standard of care. RESULTS We enrolled a convenience sample of 441 patients: 380 hospitalized and 61 outpatients. Tachypnea and radiologic findings of consolidation and pleural effusion were more frequent among inpatients than outpatients. A pathogen was detected in 64.6% of patients: viruses in 55.6%, atypical bacteria in 8.8% and pyogenic bacteria in 4.3%. Eighteen (4.1%) patients had both viruses and bacteria detected. Rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV; 18.6%) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 16.8%) were the viruses most frequently detected, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (8.2%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (2.3%) were the most common bacteria.

However, relatively little is known about the impact of these common infections on individuals with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A review of the literature identifies three key areas that need further exploration. First, moderate-to-severe and even fatal lower respiratory viral illnesses in HIV-infected individuals have been reported. In general, the clinical presentation of these respiratory viral infections in persons with HIV infection is similar to their presentation in individuals without HIV infection. The major exception is the occurrence of fulminant, and often fatal, disseminated adenovirus infection in adults and children with HIV disease. Despite these reports, no information is available regarding the frequency of moderate-to-severe respiratory viral illnesses in individuals with HIV infection. Epidemiologic studies of respiratory viral illnesses in cohorts of HIV-infected adults and children are needed. Second, prolonged shedding of respiratory viruses for weeks and even months has been documented in HIV-infected adults and children. The frequency of prolonged shedding in this population has not been well defined, but data from a small newborn cohort study suggest that, at least for RSV, prolonged shedding is common. Prolonged respiratory viral shedding has implications for infection control in medical facilities where HIV-infected individuals are treated and in nursing homes, child care centers, and group foster homes that provide care for HIV-infected individuals. Therapies to help eliminate these chronic viral infections should be explored. Finally, indirect evidence suggests that respiratory viral infection may result in changes in HIV replication and, theoretically, HIV disease progression. Increased HIV-1 replication has been demonstrated in vitro in T lymphoma cells exposed to genetic material from adenovirus. Increased HIV replication in peripheral blood from adults following inactivated influenza vaccination has been reported. The impact of natural respiratory viral infection (and perhaps vaccination against these pathogens) on HIV replication and disease progression will be an important area of study.","output":"Community Respiratory Viruses in Individuals with Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization (EUA) for two malaria drugs to treat COVID-19, based on thin evidence of efficacy, has jeopardized research to learn the drugs real value against the pandemic coronavirus, say former agency executives under President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama They also charge that the 28 March EUA for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate undermines FDAs scientific authority because it appeared to be a response not to scientific evidence, but to fervent advocacy of the drugs by Trump and other political figures FDA has multiple mechanisms to allow the use of unapproved, experimental drugs for small numbers of desperately ill patients outside of clinical trials Because chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are approved for malaria, doctors could prescribe them off label for COVID-19 patients even without the EUA Since Trump first endorsed the drugs on 19 March, however, shortages have been reported, depriving some people with autoimmune disorders such as lupus who also depend on hydroxychloroquine The EUA will immediately add tens of millions of doses of the drugs for distribution to hospitalized COVID-19 patients through health care centers","output":"Former FDA leaders decry emergency authorization of malaria drugs for coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis has affected numerous areas of civil servants? working life.

This has led to considering new and unusual targets for SARS CoV-2. 2-O-Methyltransferase (nsp16) is a key and attractive target in the SARS CoV-2 life cycle since it is responsible for the viral RNA protection via a cap formation process. In this study, we propose a new potential inhibitor for SARS COV-2 2-O-methyltransferase (nsp16). A fragment library was screened against the co-crystal structure of the SARS COV-2 2-O-methyltransferase complexed with Sinefungin (nsp16 C PDB ID: 6WKQ), and consequently the best proposed fragments were linked via a de novo approach to build molecule AP-20. Molecule AP-20 displayed a superior docking score to Sinefungin and reproduced the key interactions in the binding site of 2-O-methyltransferase. Three molecular dynamic simulations of the 2-O-methyltransferase apo structure and its complexed forms with AP-20 and Sinefungin were performed for 150 nano-seconds to provide insights on the dynamic nature of such setups and to assess the stability of the proposed AP-20/enzyme complex. AP-20/enzyme complex demonstrated better stability for the ligandCenzyme complex compared to Sinefungin in a respective setup. Furthermore, MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations showed a better profile for AP-20/enzyme complex compared to Sinefungin/enzyme complex emphasizing the potential inhibitory effect of AP-20 on SARS COV-2 2-O-methyltransferase. We endorse our designed molecule AP-20 to be further explored via experimental evaluations to confront the spread of the emerging COVID-19.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective study. ANIMALS Forty-three male horses. METHODS Food was withheld for 36 hours before horses were placed under general anesthesia and positioned in dorsal recumbency. One laparoscopic portal and 2 instrument portals were placed for the laparoscopic procedure. A third instrument portal was created in bilateral cryptorchid horses. A vessel-sealing device was used for hemostasis and transection of retained testes. Descended testes were removed via closed castration with primary closure of the scrotal incision. Time required for removal of the retained testis and perioperative complications were recorded. Short-term (14, 30, 60 days) and long-term follow-up (>1.5 years) consisted of telephone interview with owners and referring veterinarians. RESULTS Forty-three male horses underwent laparoscopic cryptorchidectomy. Thirteen horses were bilateral cryptorchids, 19 were unilateral cryptorchids with a descended testis, and 11 were unilateral cryptorchids with 1 testis previously removed.

Though preventive vaccines and treatment methods are out on the market, a specific cure for the disease has not been discovered. Recent investigations and research studies primarily focus on the immunopathology of the disease. A healthy immune system responds immediately after viral entry, causing immediate viral annihilation and recovery. However, an impaired immune system causes extensive systemic damage due to an unregulated immune response characterized by the hypersecretion of chemokines and cytokines. The elevated levels of cytokine or hypercytokinemia leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) along with multiple organ damage. Moreover, the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 has been linked with race, gender, and age; hence, this viral infections outcome differs among the patients. Many therapeutic strategies focusing on immunomodulation have been tested out to assuage the cytokine storm in patients with severe COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the diverse signaling pathways triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is essential before contemplating relief measures. This present review explains the interrelationships of hyperinflammatory response or cytokine storm with organ damage and the disease severity. Furthermore, we have thrown light on the diverse mechanisms and risk factors that influence pathogenesis and the molecular pathways that lead to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and multiple organ damage. Recognition of altered pathways of a dysregulated immune system can be a loophole to identify potential target markers. Identifying biomarkers in the dysregulated pathway can aid in better clinical management for patients with severe COVID-19 disease.

METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed within a EULAR taskforce on the assessment of competences in rheumatology training and other related specialities (July 2019). Two searches were performed: one search for rheumatology and one for related medical specialities. Two reviewers independently identified eligible studies and extracted data on assessment methods. Risk of bias was assessed using the medical education research study quality instrument. RESULTS: Of 7335 articles in rheumatology and 2324 reviews in other specialities, 5 and 31 original studies were included, respectively. Studies in rheumatology were at variable risk of bias and explored only direct observation of practical skills (DOPS) and objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs). OSCEs, including clinical, laboratory and imaging stations, performed best, with a good to very good internal consistency (Cronbachs =0.83C0.92), and intrarater reliability (r=0.80C0.95). OSCEs moderately correlated with other assessment tools: r=0.48 vs rating by programme directors; r=0.2C0.44 vs multiple-choice questionnaires; r=0.48 vs DOPS. In other specialities, OSCEs on clinical skills had a good to very good inter-rater reliability and OSCEs on communication skills demonstrated a good to very good internal consistency. Multisource feedback and the mini-clinical evaluation exercise showed good feasibility and internal consistency (reliability), but other data on validity and reliability were conflicting. CONCLUSION: Despite consistent data on competence assessment in other specialities, evidence in rheumatology is scarce and conflicting. Overall, OSCEs seem an appropriate tool to assess the competence of clinical skills and correlate well with other assessment strategies.

Drawing on a mixed-method analysis of more than 6 million tweets, we examine how, in each country, conspiracies have uniquely intersected with longer-term discourses and political projects. In Nigeria, the two conspiracies were both seized as opportunities to extend criticism to the ruling party. In South Africa, they produced distinctive responses: while the 5G conspiracy had limited buy-in, the Gates conspiracy resonated with deep-rooted resentment toward the West, corporate interests, and what is seen as a paternalistic attitude of some external actors toward Africa. These findings stress the importance of taking conspiracy theories seriously, rather than dismissing them simply as negative externalities of digital ecosystems.

OBJECTIVES To determine whether rs6967330 influences RV-C infections and illnesses in early childhood. METHODS We studied associations between rs6967330 and respiratory infections and illnesses in the COPSAC2010 (Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010) and COAST (Childhood Origins of Asthma Birth Cohort Study) birth cohorts, where respiratory infections were monitored prospectively for the first 3 years of life. Nasal samples were collected during acute infections in both cohorts and during asymptomatic periods in COAST and analyzed for RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C, and other common respiratory viruses. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The CDHR3 asthma risk allele (rs6967330-A) was associated with increased risk of respiratory tract illnesses (incidence risk ratio [IRR] = 1.14 [95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.23]; P = 0.003). In particular, this variant was associated with risk of respiratory episodes with detection of RV-C in COPSAC2010 (IRR = 1.89 [1.14-3.05]; P = 0.01) and in COAST (IRR = 1.37 [1.02-1.82]; P = 0.03) children, and in a combined meta-analysis (IRR = 1.51 [1.13-2.02]; P = 0.006). In contrast, the variant was not associated with illnesses related to other viruses (IRR = 1.07 [0.92-1.25]; P = 0.37). Consistent with these observations, the CDHR3 variant was associated with increased detection of RV-C, but not of other viruses during scheduled visits at specific ages.

We aimed to identify the association between local PCTA thickness using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and prognosis of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and to investigate the incremental prognostic value of PCAT thickness in STEMI after reperfusion. METHODS: A total of 245 patients with STEMI (mean age, 55.61  10.52 years) who underwent CMR imaging within 1 week of percutaneous coronary intervention therapy and 35 matched controls (mean age, 53.89  9.45 years) were enrolled. PCAT thickness indexed to body surface area at five locations, ventricular volume and function, infarct-related parameters, and global strain indices were evaluated using CMR. Associations between PCAT thickness index and 1-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after STEMI were calculated. The prognostic value of the standard model based on features of clinical and CMR and updated model including PACT thickness index were further assessed. RESULTS: Patients with MACE had a more significant increase in PCAT thickness index at superior interventricular groove (SIVGi) than patients without MACE. The SIVGi was significantly associated with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), infarct size, and global deformation. SIVGi > 4.98 mm/m(2) was an independent predictor of MACE (hazard ratio, 3.2; 95% CI: 1.6C6.38; p < 0.001). The updated model significantly improved the power of prediction and had better discrimination ability than that of the standard model for predicting 1-year MACE (areas under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.8 [95% CI: 0.74C0.87] vs. AUC = 0.76 [95% CI: 0.68C0.83], p < 0.05; category-free net reclassification index [cfNRI] = 0.38 [95% CI: 0.1C0.53, p = 0.01]; integrated discrimination improvement [IDI] = 0.09 [95% CI: 0.01C0.18, p = 0.02]). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated SIVGi as an independent predictor conferred incremental value over standard model based on clinical and CMR factors in 1-year MACE predictions for STEMI.","output":"Incremental Prognostic Value of Pericoronary Adipose Tissue Thickness Measured Using Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging After Revascularization in Patients With ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: : The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has generated enormous pressure on healthcare establishments, prompting restructuring of services to rationalise resources. Complex head and neck reconstructive surgery in this setting may carry substantial risk to patients and staff. This paper outlines the management strategy and outcomes of major head and neck oncological cases at a single regional tertiary referral centre. METHODS: : A database review was undertaken of consecutive patients undergoing major head and neck surgery and reconstruction during the COVID-19 pandemic at St Andrew's Centre for Plastic Surgery & Burns, Chelmsford UK. Patient demographics, tumour and reconstruction characteristics as well as peri-operative information were determined. Patients were prospectively contacted regarding COVID-related symptoms and investigations. RESULTS: : Twenty-two patients (15 males, 7 females) with a mean age of 67 (range 36-92 years) were included between March 1 and June 13, 2020. Patients underwent pre-operative throat swabs at 72h and 24h as well as chest CT scanning, as part of a robust protocol. Twelve free flaps, four loco-regional flaps, four parotidectomies and 23 cervical lymphadenectomies were performed. Two patients required a return to theatre. No post-operative deaths occurred and flap survival rate was 100%. A single patient tested positive for COVID-19 pre-operatively and no post-operative COVID-19 infections occurred. CONCLUSION: : Although head and neck surgery represents a high-risk procedure to patients and healthcare professionals, our institutional experience suggests that in the presence of a robust peri-operative protocol and judicious patient selection, major head and neck surgery, including free tissue transfer reconstruction may be performed safely.","output":"Outcomes of major Head and Neck reconstruction during the COVID-19 pandemic: The St Andrew's Centre Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The systemic steroids are recommended for cases with refractory septic shock or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although systemic glucocorticoids help to resolve inflammation and treat cytokine storm, the time course for steroid use and which patients benefit from using systemic corticosteroids is unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients. Electronic medical records of hospitalized patients (n=7,980) from 178 hospitals across United States for confirmed COVID-19 between January 1st 2020 and May 8th 2020 were reviewed. Of the 7,980 patients, 3,951 (49.5%) were female and 4,029 (50.5%) were male. The mean age was 57.4 +/- 19 years. Fifteen percent (n=1,219) died in hospital or were discharged to hospice care. Seventy-two percent (n=5,774) required non-ICU level of care, while 28% (n=2,206) of patients required ICU, and of those 1,157 (14.5%) needed ventilator support. The mean length of stay in the hospital was 6 days (range 0 - 84 days). Fourteen percent (n=1111) of patients received at least one dose of systemic steroids during hospitalization. Sixty precent of those had ICU level of care with 435 (39%) requiring ventilator support. Overall, the use of corticosteroids was associated with increased mortality (OR=1.273;p=0.0160) and 3.53 days longer hospital stay (p<0.0001). The corticosteroid exposed group was also noted to progress to a higher level of care and have longer time on a ventilator when compared with the patients who did not receive steroids. The length of hospital stay and mortality was higher especially in severe/critical patients. Based on these results, we recommend cautious use of corticosteroids in COVID-19.

We aimed to investigate which specific responses from either cellular or humoral immunity associate to severity and progression of COVID-19. Methods: A cohort of 276 patients classified in mild, moderate and severe, was studied. Peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations were quantified by flow cytometry, and immunoglobulins and complement proteins by nephelometry. Results: At admission, dramatic lymphopenia of T, B and NK cells associated to severity. However, only the proportion of B cells increased, while T and NK cells appeared unaffected. Accordingly, the number of plasma cells and circulating follicular helper T cells (cTfh) increased, but levels of IgM, IgA and IgG were unaffected. When degrees of severity were considered, IgG was lower in severe patients, suggesting an IgG consumption by complement activation or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Activated CD56-CD16+ NK-cells, which mediate ADCC, were increased. Regarding complement, C3 and C4 protein levels were higher in mild and moderate, but not in severe patients, compared to healthy donors. Moreover, IgG and C4 decreased from day 0 to day 10 in patients who were hospitalized for more than two weeks, but not in patients who were discharged earlier. Conclusion: Our study provides important clues to understand the immune response observed in COVID-19 patients, which is probably related to viral clearance, but also underlies its pathogenesis and severity.

Furthermore, behavioral studies have found that the right side of the human face expresses emotions more accurately than the left side. Therefore, accounting for both the content of the emotion and the visual angle of presentation from the perspective of the viewer, here we have investigated variability in the discrimination of happy and sad faces when the visual angle of presentation was Positive (right side of the face) compared to Negative (left side of the face). Furthermore, the temporal dynamics involved in processing happy and sad emotions have been compared. Regardless of visual angle, happy emotions were processed faster than sad emotions. However, the evoked response to sad emotions significantly increased in amplitude compared to that for happy emotions, when faces were presented at Positive visual angles only.

DESIGN: Natural experiment using interrupted time series analysis, with results synthesised using meta-analysis. SETTING: 149 countries or regions, with data on daily reported cases of covid-19 from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and data on the physical distancing policies from the Oxford covid-19 Government Response Tracker. PARTICIPANTS: Individual countries or regions that implemented one of the five physical distancing interventions (closures of schools, workplaces, and public transport, restrictions on mass gatherings and public events, and restrictions on movement (lockdowns)) between 1 January and 30 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of covid-19 before and after implementation of physical distancing interventions, estimated using data to 30 May 2020 or 30 days post-intervention, whichever occurred first. IRRs were synthesised across countries using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: On average, implementation of any physical distancing intervention was associated with an overall reduction in covid-19 incidence of 13% (IRR 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 0.89; n=149 countries). Closure of public transport was not associated with any additional reduction in covid-19 incidence when the other four physical distancing interventions were in place (pooled IRR with and without public transport closure was 0.85, 0.82 to 0.88; n=72, and 0.87, 0.84 to 0.91; n=32, respectively). Data from 11 countries also suggested similar overall effectiveness (pooled IRR 0.85, 0.81 to 0.89) when school closures, workplace closures, and restrictions on mass gatherings were in place. In terms of sequence of interventions, earlier implementation of lockdown was associated with a larger reduction in covid-19 incidence (pooled IRR 0.86, 0.84 to 0.89; n=105) compared with a delayed implementation of lockdown after other physical distancing interventions were in place (pooled IRR 0.90, 0.87 to 0.94; n=41). CONCLUSIONS: Physical distancing interventions were associated with reductions in the incidence of covid-19 globally. No evidence was found of an additional effect of public transport closure when the other four physical distancing measures were in place. Earlier implementation of lockdown was associated with a larger reduction in the incidence of covid-19. These findings might support policy decisions as countries prepare to impose or lift physical distancing measures in current or future epidemic waves.","output":"Physical distancing interventions and incidence of coronavirus disease 2019: natural experiment in 149 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Medical mobile applications are increasing, accessible and easy leading to a considerable increase use by physicians.

The present study aimed to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and river water in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, using four quantitative and two nested PCR assays. Influent and secondary-treated (before chlorination) wastewater samples and river water samples were collected five times from a wastewater treatment plant and three times from a river, respectively, between March 17 and May 7, 2020. The wastewater and river water samples (200-5,000 mL) were processed by using two different methods: the electronegative membrane-vortex (EMV) method and the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. Based on the observed concentrations of indigenous pepper mild mottle virus RNA, the EMV method was found superior to the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was successfully detected in one of five secondary-treated wastewater samples with a concentration of 2.4 x 103 copies/L by N_Sarbeco qPCR assay following the EMV method, whereas all the influent samples were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

Vaccinations have previously been proposed as a \\"trigger\\" for some flares, although evidence supporting this is scant. Objective: To explore whether routine childhood vaccinations are associated with an increased risk of flares of arthritis activity in children with JIA. Methods: Patients aged below 6 years with a diagnosis of JIA were recruited from the Rheumatology Clinical Database at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, from 1 January 2010 to 30 April 2016. Patient immunisation status was cross-checked with the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR). The self-controlled case series methodology (Rowhani-Rahbar et al., 2012) was applied to determine whether the risk of arthritis flares in the three months following immunisation was greater than the baseline risk for each patient. Results: 138 patients were included in the study. 32 arthritis flares occurred in the 90 days following immunisation. The risk of arthritis flares during the 90 days following immunisation was reduced compared with patients' baseline risk (RR 0.59 (95% CI 0.39-0.89, p = 0.012)).

But few insights were produced concerning how the pandemic may take a toll on the public's mental health who were not contracted with the virus. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the links between social media use and mental health conditions in the general population based on a national sample (N = 2,185) collected at the peak of China's COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This study reveals the public's mental health conditions by analyzing social media use among those who experienced the first COVID-19 outbreak in the world. A nationally representative sample was collected for this study in China's 30 provinces concerning the participants' social media use, health information support, and psychiatric disorders, i.e., secondary traumatic stress (STS) and vicarious trauma (VT). RESULTS: COVID-19 had taken a severe toll on people's mental health who had no history of psychiatric disorders nor being contracted with coronavirus. Social media use did not cause mental health issues, but it mediated the levels of traumatic emotions. While people gained health information support in using social media, an excessive social media use led to elevated levels of stress (? = .175, P < .001), anxiety (? = .224, P < .001), depression (? = .201, P < .001), STS (? = .307, P < .001), and VT (? = .688, P < .001). Geo-location and lockdown conditions also contributed to traumatic disorders. People from small cities or towns were more anxious (P = .01) and depressed (P = .008) than those in rural areas. Obtaining more informational support (? = .165, P < .001) and emotional support (? = .144, P < .001) on social media increased VT. Peer support on social media increased both VT (? = .332, P < .001) and STS (? = .130, P < .001). Moreover, geo-location moderated the relationships between emotional support on social media and VT (F(2) = 3.549, P = .029) and the association between peer support and STS (F(2) = 5.059, P = .006). Geo-location also interacted with information support in predicting STS (F(2) = 5.093, P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: This research contributes to the literature by establishing the association between social media use and psychiatric disorders in the general public when COVID-19 struck, whose causes were complex and multifactorial, including social media use.

Additionally, such screens have yet to identify the protease TMPRSS2, known to be important for viral entry at the plasma membrane. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of these screens and showed a high level of cell-type specificity of the identified hits, arguing for the necessity of additional models to uncover the full landscape of SARS-CoV-2 host factors. We performed genome-wide knockout and activation CRISPR screens in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells, as well as knockout screens in Caco-2 intestinal cells. In addition to identifying ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as top hits, our study reveals a series of so far unidentified and critical host-dependency factors, including the Adaptins AP1G1 and AP1B1 and the flippase ATP8B1. Moreover, new anti-SARS-CoV-2 proteins with potent activity, including several membrane-associated Mucins, IL6R, and CD44 were identified. We further observed that these genes mostly acted at the critical step of viral entry, with the notable exception of ATP8B1, the knockout of which prevented late stages of viral replication. Exploring the pro- and anti-viral breadth of these genes using highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, seasonal HCoV-NL63 and -229E and influenza A orthomyxovirus, we reveal that some genes such as AP1G1 and ATP8B1 are general coronavirus cofactors.

Design, Setting & Participants: A prospective cohort study of children <16 years with a positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test cared for by the Sydney Children's Hospital Network (SCHN) virtual and inpatient medical teams between 1 June-31 October 2021. Main outcome measures: Demographic and clinical data from all admitted patients and a random sample of outpatients managed under the SCHN virtual care team were analysed to identify risk factors for admission to hospital. Results: There were 17,474 SARS-CoV-2 infections in children <16 years in NSW during the study period, of whom 11,985 (68.6%) received care coordinated by SCHN. Twenty one percent of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic. For every 100 SARS-CoV-2 infections in children <16 years, 1.26 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.46) required hospital admission for medical care; while 2.46 (95% CI 2.18 to 2.73) required admission for social reasons only. Risk factors for hospitalisation for medical care included age <6 months, a history of prematurity, age 12 to <16 years, and a history of medical comorbidities (aOR 7.23 [95% CI 2.92 to 19.4]). Of 17,474 infections, 15 children (median age 12.8years) required ICU admission; and 294 children required hospital admission due to social or welfare reasons. Conclusion: The majority of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Delta variant) had asymptomatic or mild disease.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of this prolonged sitting on students' self-perceived physical, mental, and cognitive condition and to answer the question of whether simple standing breaks in lectures can help students improve these conditions and for example feel more concentrated, motivated, or less tense in class. A five-minute standing break was introduced using a designed presentation slide for one semester in five different 90-min lectures. In addition, an active break as well as an open break with no trigger were implemented in two further lectures to explicitly investigate the effects of a standing break. Before, during, and after the semester, the students were surveyed about their physical, mental, and cognitive condition (836 respondents at start, 634 during semester, and 528 at the end). To evaluate the practicality and acceptance of the standing break, lecturers were interviewed about their experience. At all survey time points, the standing break was highly accepted by the university students. About three quarters of the students felt a relaxation of the muscles in the neck and shoulder as well as in the back and the legs. More than three quarters perceived an increase in concentration, receptiveness and retentiveness, motivation, and well-being. Results of the statistical analysis indicate that a standing break as well as an active break are more effective than an open break to improve the self-perceived physical and psychological well-being of the university students. The increase in cognitive skills is reported by all groups, including the group who were offered open breaks. Hence, standing breaks in university lectures receive a high level of acceptance and practicability and have the potential to increase students' physical, mental, and cognitive condition and contribute to students' physical activity and health. While field research provides opportunities such as the testing of measures in the natural environment and producing real-life results relevant to the students and lecturers, it also imposes limitations as lecture settings differed, not all disturbances could be controlled, and the participation in the study might have led to social-desirability bias. For a sustainable development of a standing-friendly teaching and learning culture at universities, further interventions as well as the consideration of the topic in all processes and decisions within the universities are necessary.

However, the outcomes of COVID-19 control and prevention measures varied between regions (ie, provinces and municipalities) in China; moreover, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, and the spread of the disease has accelerated in countries outside China. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to establish valid models to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control and prevention among various regions in China. These models also targeted regions with control and prevention problems by issuing immediate warnings. METHODS: We built a mathematical model, the Epidemic Risk Time Series Model, and used it to analyze two sets of data, including the daily COVID-19 incidence (ie, newly diagnosed cases) as well as the daily immigration population size. RESULTS: Based on the results of the model evaluation, some regions, such as Shanghai and Zhejiang, were successful in COVID-19 control and prevention, whereas other regions, such as Heilongjiang, yielded poor performance. The evaluation result was highly correlated with the basic reproduction number (R0) value, and the result was evaluated in a timely manner at the beginning of the disease outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: The Epidemic Risk Time Series Model was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control and prevention in different regions in China based on analysis of immigration population data. Compared to other methods, such as R0, this model enabled more prompt issue of early warnings.

Often, it is impractical to apply recommendations based on high-income country investigations to resource limited settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We present a set of pragmatic recommendations for the management of anticoagulation and thrombotic disease for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in LMICs. In the absence of contraindications, we recommend prophylactic anticoagulation with either low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs. If available, we recommend LMWH over UFH for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis to minimize risk to healthcare workers. We recommend against the use of aspirin for VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients in LMICs. Because of limited evidence, we suggest against the use of \\"enhanced\\" or \\"intermediate\\" prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients in LMICs. Based on current available evidence, we recommend against the initiation of empiric therapeutic anticoagulation without clinical suspicion for VTE. If contraindications exist to chemical prophylaxis, we recommend mechanical prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices or graduated compression stockings (GCS) for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs. In LMICs, we recommend initiating therapeutic anticoagulation for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, in accordance with local clinical practice guidelines, if there is high clinical suspicion for VTE, even in the absence of testing. If available, we recommend LMWH over UFH or Direct oral anticoagulants for treatment of VTE in LMICs to minimize risk to healthcare workers. In LMIC settings where continuous intravenous UFH or LMWH are unavailable or not feasible to use, we recommend fixed dose heparin, adjusted to body weight, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with high clinical suspicion of VTE. We suggest D-dimer measurement, if available and affordable, at the time of admission for risk stratification, or when clinical suspicion for VTE is high. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs, based on current available evidence, we make no recommendation on the use of serial D-dimer monitoring for the initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs receiving intravenous therapeutic UFH, we recommend serial monitoring of partial thromboplastin time or anti-factor Xa level, based on local laboratory capabilities. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs receiving LMWH, we suggest against serial monitoring of anti-factor Xa level. We suggest serial monitoring of platelet counts in patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation for VTE, to assess risk of bleeding or development of heparin induced thrombocytopenia.","output":"Pragmatic Recommendations for the Management of Anticoagulation and Venous Thrombotic Disease for Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 in Low- and Middle-Income Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The pandemic has led to the isolation and social exclusion of older adults and cut them off from any exercise activity. Thus, it is more than ever necessary to implement organized interventions to prevent falls in older people as they remain a global health problem associated with serious injuries, chronic disability, and high costs for the healthcare system. Otago exercise program (OEP) can effectively reduce the number of falls. AIM: To study the effect of a 6 months modified video supported OEP in balance, functional ability, fear of falls and number of falls in Greek older people who have fallen. METHOD: 150 fallers aged 65C80 years [Median age 70 (67C74), 88.7% women] were divided into two groups (intervention and control). Primary outcomes included changes in Short FES-I, CONFbal scale, 4-Stage Balance test, BBS, TUG test and number of falls, while the secondary outcome consists of the monthly adherence to exercise after the intervention. Analysis of variance with repeated measures was applied. RESULTS: There were statistically significant between groups differences after 6 months with the OEP group to shows improved values in TUG time score (17.8 vs 3.9%, p < 0.001, 95% CI), 4-Stage Balance Test (6.85 vs 1.09%, p < 0.05 95% CI), 30-Second Chair Stand Test 7.35 vs 2.93%, p < 0.001), BBS score (13.27 vs 3.89%, p < 0.001, 95% CI), Short FES-I (35.78 vs 13.01%, p < 0.001, 95% CI) and number of falls (69.12 vs 18.70%, p < 0.001, 95% CI).

The human B-cell response to natural influenza virus infection has not been extensively investigated at the polyclonal level. Methods. The overall B-cell response of patients acutely infected with the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (A[H1N1]pdm09) was analyzed by determining the reactivity of plasmablast-derived polyclonal antibodies (PPAbs) to influenza proteins. Recipients of inactivated influenza vaccine containing the same A(H1N1)pdm09 strain were studied for comparison. Results. During acute infection, robust plasmablast responses to the infecting virus were detected, characterized by a greater PPAb reactivity to the conserved influenza virus nuclear protein and to heterovariant and heterosubtypic hemagglutinins, in comparison to responses to the inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine. In A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccinees, the presence of baseline serum neutralizing antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09, suggesting previous exposure to natural A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, did not affect the plasmablast response to vaccination, whereas repeated immunization with inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine resulted in significantly reduced vaccine-specific and cross-reactive PPAb responses. Conclusions. Natural A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination result in very distinct patterns of B-cell activation and priming.

Moreover, IMM-H007 inhibited transforming growth factor 1 (TGF1) expression in wild-type, but not AMPK2-/- mice. By contrast, IMM-H007 inhibited Smad2/3 signaling downstream of TGF1 in both wild-type and AMPK2-/- mice. Surface plasmon resonance and molecular docking experiments showed that IMM-H007 directly interacts with TGF1, inhibits its binding to TGF type II receptors, and downregulates the Smad2/3 signaling pathway downstream of TGF1. These findings suggest that IMM-H007 inhibits isoprenaline-induced cardiac fibrosis via both AMPK2-dependent and -independent mechanisms. IMM-H007 may be useful as a novel TGF1 antagonist.","output":"IMM-H007 attenuates isoprenaline-induced cardiac fibrosis through targeting TGF1 signaling pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the main tasks in biological sequence analysis is biological sequence comparison.

Up to 50% of patients develop shock with cardiac dysfunction but presentation with acute abdominal pain is common and difficult to distinguish from appendicitis. METHOD Prospective case series of PIMS-TS patients presenting to a single UK tertiary paediatric centre. RESULTS As of 16 September 2020, 89 patients have presented with PIMS-TS to our institution; 19 (21.3%) were referred for surgical review. Pyrexia and acute abdominal pain were seen in all 19 patients. Diarrhoea was reported in 14 (73%) and vomiting in 12 (63%). On examination, eight (42%) had right abdominal tenderness, of which five had right iliac fossa (RIF) peritonism. C-reactive protein (CRP) was universally raised: median 176 (15-463)mg/l. Abdominal imaging was performed in 17 (89%), with 11 undergoing abdominal ultrasonography (65%) and 8 abdominal computed tomography (47%); two required both. Findings included nonspecific features of inflammation in the RIF. Eight patients (42%) had an abnormal echocardiogram at admission. Two (10%) patients, with classical signs and symptoms of appendicitis, underwent appendicectomy without radiological imaging and were subsequently diagnosed with PIMS-TS. During the same period, 18 patients underwent appendicectomy for histologically confirmed appendicitis. Serum CRP and ferritin levels were significantly higher in the PIMS-TS cohort compared with children with appendicitis. CONCLUSIONS PIMS-TS is a novel paediatric condition that may mimic appendicitis. It should be considered in patients presenting with abdominal pain to avoid unnecessary surgery in children at risk of cardiovascular instability.","output":"Paediatric post-COVID-19 hyperinflammatory syndrome mimicking appendicitis: a case series."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Reliable and peer reviewed information is of immense importance for preventive, diagnostic and curative solutions and efforts should be done to minimize inaccurate infodemics among post graduate trainee doctors.

Detailed analyses of the cleavage sequences and their evolution would give insights into the high pathogenicity of the H5N1 virus. HA segments were visually identifiable in the cellular automata (CA) image, and a feature gene segment (FGS) was only found in H5N1 rather than any other subtype. This FGS is a 30-bp gene segment mainly consisting of A and G. When translated into amino acids the FGS converted into a sequence of mainly basic amino acids with positive charges. This feature amino acid segment (FAAS) was located in the cleavage site loop of HA which was potentially cleavable by various proteases. The 3D structure of H5N1 HA was reconstructed using homology modelling. It was found that the cleavage site loop was well exposed to potential proteases. The molecular surfaces were reconstructed to study how mutation and deletion of some amino acids in the FAAS affected the charge distribution. It was found that some mutations had severely changed the landscape of the charge distribution. Statistical analyses of FAAS were made with respect to when and where the H5N1 viruses were found. In 2005, there were less un-mutated FAAS than the other years according to temporal evolution, and more mutated FAAS appeared in China than other regions according to geographic distribution. These results are helpful for exploring the evolution of virus high pathogenicity.","output":"Genetic insight of the H5N1 hemagglutinin cleavage site"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis is an unprecedented event.

In this study, we examine the durability of the newly developed surfaces when subjected to elevated temperature, chemical attack and mechanical damage in the form of abrasion and compressive load. Extensive tests were conducted to reveal the effect of these parameters on the surface performance. Three aspects of the work were accordingly examined. The first was concerned with controlled thermal stability tests in which the surfaces were subjected to elevated temperatures approaching 350 C for silicone-based nanocomposites and 150 C for epoxy-based nanocomposites. The second was concerned with subjecting the surfaces to alkaline and acidic solutions with pH concentrations ranging between 1 and 13. Finally, the third involved surface damage by abrasion tests. Our results show clearly that the newly developed superhydrophobic surfaces are capable of resisting the adverse effects of thermal and chemical attacks as well as mechanical abrasion owing to the excellent structural stability and mechanical properties of the constituents of the nanocomposite.

Since the reproduction number is below the mortality rate, there is a decrease in rhinos year over year, urgently requiring changes and saving the survivors. In this study, the efficacy of medical grade honey (MGH) for wound care in rhinos was investigated. We presented a case series of seven rhinos with wounds of different etiologies, including gunshots and poaching. Four wounds were around the horns and three on the limbs. It was a challenge to take care and follow-up the wounds of these wild animals in their natural habitat. A well-balanced decision between the need of treatment and risk of immobilization is constantly evaluated. In the presented cases, MGH proved a novel tool with minimal intervention and maximal effectiveness. With the severity of the wounds taken into consideration, there was a rapid healing in all cases, while infection resolved when present. MGH creates a moist and anti-inflammatory wound environment, while promoting almost all aspects in the wound healing processes, such as autolytic debridement, angiogenesis and re-epithelialization. The efficacy of MGH has constantly been confirmed in other cases and literature as well. MGH forms a potent therapy for treating wounded rhinos, independent of the severity of the wound.

However, how autophagosome-mediated viral spread occurs in infected host tissues or organs in vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we report that an important rice reovirus, rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV) hijacks autophagosomes to traverse multiple insect membrane barriers in the midgut and salivary gland of leafhopper vector to enhance viral spread. Such virus-containing double-membraned autophagosomes are prevented from degradation, resulting in increased viral propagation. Mechanistically, viral nonstructural protein Pns11 induces autophagy and embeds itself in the autophagosome membranes. The autophagy-related protein 5 (ATG5)-ATG12 conjugation is essential for initial autophagosome membrane biogenesis. RGDV Pns11 specifically interacts with ATG5, both in vitro and in vivo. Silencing of ATG5 or Pns11 expression suppresses ATG8 lipidation, autophagosome formation, and efficient viral propagation. Thus, Pns11 could directly recruit ATG5-ATG12 conjugation to induce the formation of autophagosomes, facilitating viral spread within the insect bodies. Furthermore, Pns11 potentially blocks autophagosome degradation by directly targeting and mediating the reduced expression of N-glycosylated Lamp1 on lysosomal membranes. Taken together, these results highlight how RGDV remodels autophagosomes to benefit viral propagation in its insect vector.","output":"A nonstructural protein encoded by a rice reovirus induces an incomplete autophagy to promote viral spread in insect vectors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been mutating since it was first sequenced in early January 2020 The genetic variants have developed into a few distinct clusters with different properties Since the United States (US) has the highest number of viral infected patients globally, it is essential to understand the US SARS-CoV-2 Using genotyping, sequence-alignment, time-evolution, k-means clustering, protein-folding stability, algebraic topology, and network theory, we reveal that the US SARS-CoV-2 has four substrains and five top US SARS-CoV-2 mutations were first detected in China (2 cases), Singapore (2 cases), and the United Kingdom (1 case) The next three top US SARS-CoV-2 mutations were first detected in the US These eight top mutations belong to two disconnected groups The first group consisting of 5 concurrent mutations is prevailing, while the other group with three concurrent mutations gradually fades out We identify that one of the top mutations, 27964C&gt;T-(S24L) on ORF8, has an unusually strong gender dependence Based on the analysis of all mutations on the spike protein, we further uncover that three of four US SASR-CoV-2 substrains become more infectious Our study calls for effective viral control and containing strategies in the US","output":"Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 mutations in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study a dynamics of the epidemiological infection spreading at different values of the risk factor $\\\\beta$ (a control parameter) with the using of dynamic Monte Carlo approach (DMC).

Compared with saline, the risk of CIAKI was reduced by using statin (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.26-0.67), xanthine (OR, 0.32; 95% CrI, 0.17-0.57), ischemic preconditioning (OR, 0.48; 95% CrI, 0.26-0.87), NAC+NaHCO3 (OR, 0.50; 95% CrI, 0.33-0.76), NAC (OR, 0.68; 95% CrI, 0.55-0.84), and NaHCO3 (OR, 0.66; 95% CrI, 0.47-0.90). The benefit of statin therapy was consistent across multiple sensitivity analyses, whereas the efficacy of all the other strategies was questioned by restricting the analysis to high-quality trials. Overall, high heterogeneity was observed for comparisons involving xanthine and ischemic preconditioning, although the impact of NAC and xanthine was probably influenced by publication bias/small-study effect. Hydration alone was the least effective preventive strategy for CIAKI. Meta-regressions did not reveal significant associations with baseline creatinine and contrast volume. In patients with diabetes mellitus, no strategy was found to reduce the incidence of CIAKI. CONCLUSIONS In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary procedures, statin administration is associated with a marked and consistent reduction in the risk of CIAKI compared with saline. Although xanthine, NAC, NaHCO3, NAC+NaHCO3, ischemic preconditioning, and natriuretic peptide may have nephroprotective effects, these results were not consistent across multiple sensitivity analyses.","output":"Preventive Strategies for Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Procedures: Evidence From a Hierarchical Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis of 124 Trials and 28 240 Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Coronaviruses are important emerging human and animal pathogens.

Although medical providers in New York were fortunate to have the knowledge gained in China and Italy before it came under siege, the magnitude and severity of the disease were unprecedented and arguably under appreciated. The surge of patients with significant COVID-19 threatened to overwhelm health care systems, as New York City health systems realized that the number of specialized critical care providers would be inadequate. A large academic medical system recognized that rapid redeployment of noncritical providers into such roles would be needed. An educational gap was therefore identified: numerous providers with minimal critical care knowledge or experience would now be required to provide critical-level patient care under supervision of intensivists. Safe provision of such high level of patient care mandated the development of \\"educational crash courses.\\" METHODS The purpose of this special article is to summarize the approach adopted by the Institute for Critical Care Medicine and Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine's Human Emulation, Education, and Evaluation Lab for Patient Safety and Professional Study Simulation Center in developing a training program for noncritical care providers in this novel disease.

Many rules and arrangements seek to insulate such individuals from public pressure or to address the effects of such pressure. We study this subject empirically, investigating the circumstances in which public pressure is more and less likely to affect judging. Using detailed data from the Bundesliga, Germanys top soccer league, our analysis of how crowd pressure affects the decisions of referees yields two key insights. First, we show that crowd pressure biases referees decisions in favor of the home team for those decisions that cannot be unam-biguously identified as erroneous but not for those decisions that can. In particular, a referee exhibits a bias in favor of the home team with respect to more subjective decisions such as the showing of yellow cards (cautions), which is based on the referees judgment, but not with respect to more objective de-cisions such as validating goals and awarding penalty kicks, where live TV coverage often allows for objective identification of errors. Second, we show that the effect of crowd pressure on referee decisions depends on the extent to which such pressure is viewed by the referee as understandable or reasonable (or even justified). Specifically, a referees bias in favor of the home team in yellow card issuance is strengthened after the referee makes an objectively identifiable error against the home team and thus might view crowd heckling as understandable. This effect is stronger when the referees error is costlier to the home team because the game is more important or the error is more consequential due to the closeness of the game at the time of the error. The introduction of VAR (Video Assistant Referee) technology in 2017 and the restrictions im-posed due to Covid-19 pandemic, which caused games to be played without crowds for the second half of the 2019C20 season, allow us to test our results under three different regimes (pre-VAR, VAR, and VAR/no-crowd). Inspection of the results under these three different regimes serves to reinforce them. As expected, VAR reduces the number of referee errors, but the pattern of no bias with respect to errors is preserved. VAR has no effect on the number of yellow cards, or on the number of goals. Once the crowd disappears, so does the home advantage in goals. Referee errors are unaffected, but the home bias with respect to yellow cards disappears as well. This confirms the effect that the crowd has on referees more subjective decisions.","output":"Judging Under Public Pressure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cigarette smoking among postpartum women remains a significant public health problem despite known health risks to women and their newborns.

METHODS: We collected oropharyngeal swab and blood samples from 754 healthy volunteers for screening between April and July, 2020. Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 using a qualitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and Immunoglo bulin G and M were detected using using two different rapid diagnostic tests. RESULTS: Out of 754 samples, 56 were found to have active SARS-COV2 infection (7.4%). This means 92.5% (n = 698/754) were RT-PCR negative out of which 117 had detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in their serum. Among these RT-PCR negative subjects, the seroprevalence raised from 1.7% for IgG + and 2.5% for IgM + in April to 14.2% of IgG and 17.6% of IgM in July. No difference was found according to the district of residence (P = 0.108). With regard to gender, 5% of women against 0% of men had either IgG and IgM in April. During the first three months, seroprevalence was significantly higher in women within IgG (P < 0.0001) and IgM (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The proportion of the population who seroconvert over the course of the first wave is an important data to predict the risk of future COVID-19 waves and this will facilitate the efficient use of limited resources in a low income country like the Republic of the Congo.","output":"High SARS-COV2 IgG/IGM seroprevalence in asymptomatic Congolese in Brazzaville, the Republic of Congo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Appalachian Kentucky was at the epicenter of the prescription opioid epidemic in the early 2000's. As we enter the third decade of the epidemic, patterns have begun to emerge as people who use drugs (PWUD) transition from use of opioids to other drugs. The purpose of this analysis was to examine longitudinal changes in methamphetamine use in an ongoing cohort of rural people who use drugs (PWUD) in Appalachian Kentucky. All but five of the cohort participants (N = 503) reported nonmedical prescription opioid use (NMPOU) at baseline and those 498 are included in this longitudinal analysis encompassing eight waves of data (2008C2020). Past 6-month use of methamphetamine was the dependent variable. Given the correlated nature of the data, mixed effects logistic regression was utilized to examine changes in methamphetamine use over time. Significant increases in methamphetamine use were observed over the past decade in this cohort of PWUD, especially in recent years (2017C2020). Prevalence of recent use at baseline and each of the follow-up visits was as follows: 9.4, 5.6, 5.0, 5.4, 8.1, 6.8, 6.9, and 33.1%, respectively (p < 0.001). On the contrary, significant reductions in NMPO and heroin use were observed in the same time period. The odds of methamphetamine use at the most recent visit were 25.8 times greater than at baseline (95% CI: 14.9, 44.6) and 52.6% of those reporting methamphetamine use reported injecting the drug. These results provide further evidence of twin epidemics of methamphetamine use among NMPOU. While problematic on several fronts, of particular concern is the lack of effective treatment options for methamphetamine use disorder. As policies around the opioid epidemic continue to evolve, particular attention should be paid to the surge in stimulant use in opioid-endemic areas.","output":"Recent Increase in Methamphetamine Use in a Cohort of Rural People Who Use Drugs: Further Evidence for the Emergence of Twin Epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although various studies have been conducted on the effects of seasonal climate changes or emotional variables on the risk of AMI, many of them have limitations to determine the predictable model. The currents study is conducted to assess the effects of meteorological and emotional variables on the incidence and epidemiological occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Sari (capital of Mazandaran, Iran) during 2011C2018. METHODS: In this study, a time series analysis was used to determine the variation of variables over time. All series were seasonally adjusted and Poisson regression analysis was performed. In the analysis of meteorological data and emotional distress due to religious mourning events, the best results were obtained by autoregressive moving average (ARMA) (5,5) model. RESULTS: It was determined that average temperature, sunshine, and rain variables had a significant effect on death. A total of 2375 AMIs were enrolled. Average temperate (C) and sunshine hours a day (h/day) had a statistically significant relationship with the number of AMIs ( = 0.011, P = 0.014). For every extra degree of temperature increase, the risk of AMI rose [OR = 1.011 (95%CI 1.00, 1.02)]. For every extra hour of sunshine, a day a statistically significant increase [OR = 1.02 (95% CI 1.01, 1.04)] in AMI risk occurred ( = 0.025, P = 0.001). Religious mourning events increase the risk of AMI 1.05 times more. The other independent variables have no significant effects on AMIs (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Results demonstrate that sunshine hours and the average temperature had a significant effect on the risk of AMI. Moreover, emotional distress due to religious morning events increases AMI.

Our study aims to analyze whether minimally invasive valve surgery (MIVS) can reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications compared to the full median sternotomy (FS) approach. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 1076 patients who underwent isolated mitral or aortic valve surgery (80 MIVS and 996 FS) in our institution between January 2015 and December 2019. Propensity score-matching analysis was used to compare outcomes between the groups and to reduce selection bias. RESULTS: Propensity score matching revealed no significant difference in hospital mortality between the groups. The incidence of PPCs was significantly less in the MIVS group than in the FS group (19% vs. 69%, respectively; P < 0.0001). The most common PPCs were atelectasis (P = 0.034), pleural effusions (P = 0.042), and pulmonary infection (P = 0.001). Prolonged mechanical ventilation time (> 24 h) (P = 0.016), blood transfusion amount (P = 0.006), length of hospital stay (P < 0.0001), and ICU stay (P < 0.0001) were significantly less in the MIVS group. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP), aortic cross-clamping, and operative time intervals were significantly longer in the MIVS group than in the matched FS group (P < 0.001). A multivariable analysis revealed a decreased risk of PPCs in patients undergoing MIVS (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.006C0.180; P < 0.0001).

However, the prevalence of these co-existing medical conditions in severe CHIKV cases has not been systematically reported. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to describe the prevalence of chronic comorbidities in CHIKV and evaluate their possible contributions to disease severity. METHODS: A search strategy was developed for online databases. Search terms used were Chikungunya AND Diabetes, Hypertension, Stroke, Cardiovascular Diseases, Coronary Artery Diseases, Obesity, OR Asthma. Only 11 articles documenting the frequency of comorbidities in CHIKV were included. Meta-analyses were conducted to evaluate the overall prevalence of comorbidities in the CHIKV infection and stratify the estimates by severity. RESULTS: Among 2,773 CHIKV patients, hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity (31.3%; 95%CI: 17.9-48.8%) followed by diabetes (20.5%; 95%CI: 12.7-31.3%), cardiac diseases (14.8%; 95%CI: 8.1-25.5%) and asthma (7.9%; 95%CI: 3.3-17.7). There was 4- to 5-fold significant increased prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and cardiac diseases in CHIKV patients over 50 years of age compared to their younger counterparts. Severe CHIKV cases had a significantly higher proportion of diabetes than non-severe cases (p < 0.05). CHIKV patients with diabetes had OR of 1.2 (95%CI: 1.05-1.48; p = 0.0135) for developing severe infection outcome compared to those with no diabetes. CONCLUSION: Hypertension, diabetes and cardiac diseases may contribute to the severe outcome of CHIKV. Diabetic subjects may be at higher risk of severe infection.

Previous studies have shown that many naturally derived substances, such as cyclodextrin and sterols, could reduce the infectivity of many types of viruses, including the coronavirus family, through interference with lipid-dependent attachment to human host cells. CONCLUSIONS: Certain molecules prove able to reduce the infectivity of some coronaviruses, possibly by inhibiting viral lipid-dependent attachment to host cells. More research into these molecules and methods would be worthwhile as it could provide insights the mechanism of transmission of SARS-COV-2 and, into how they could become a basis for new antiviral strategies.","output":"Natural small molecules as inhibitors of coronavirus lipid-dependent attachment to host cells: a possible strategy for reducing SARS-COV-2 infectivity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Convenient and precise assessment of the severity in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) contributes to the timely patient treatment and prognosis improvement.

METHODS: A total of 150 patients (training cohort n = 105; test cohort n = 45) with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test were enrolled. Two feature selection methods, Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy (mRMR) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), were used to extract features from CT images and construct model. A total of 30 radiomic features were finally retained. Rad-score was calculated by summing the selected features weighted by their coefficients. The radiomics nomogram incorporating clinical-radiological features was eventually constructed by multivariate regression analysis. Nomogram, calibration, and decision-curve analysis were all assessed. RESULTS: In both cohorts, 40 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were severe and 110 patients were non-severe. By combining the 30 radiomic features extracted from CT images, the radiomics signature showed high discrimination between severe and non-severe patients in the training set [Area Under the Curve (AUC), 0.857; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.775-0.918] and the test set (AUC, 0.867; 95% CI, 0.732-949). The final combined model that integrated age, comorbidity, CT scores, number of lesions, ground glass opacity (GGO) with consolidation, and radiomics signature, improved the AUC to 0.952 in the training cohort and 0.98 in the test cohort. The nomogram based on the combined model similarly exhibited excellent discrimination performance in both training and test cohorts.

The VRI were sub grouped into medical (lasers and injections) and surgical. Also interventions were categorized as urgent, semi-urgent and less urgent based on national guidelines. Results: : A total of 1210 patients underwent VRI during pre-lockdown, lockdown and post-lockdown periods. The proportion of urgent VRI increased significantly to 26.61 % during lockdown as compared to 9.81 % and 13.15 % during pre and post-lockdown period respectively ( p value <0.001, chi square test ). The proportion of semi-urgent and less urgent VRI decreased significantly during the lockdown period. The median presenting best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was significantly lesser during the lockdown period.

A national, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted in November, 2021. The self-administered online questionnaire was distributed to a random sample of parents. Adult parents with at least one 5C11-year-old child were included. The main outcome was parents' intention to vaccinate their 5C11-year-old children. Variability in parents' intention was assessed by demographics, COVID-19-related factors, children's health status, and constructs from the Health Belief Model. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to investigate each factor and adjust for the intervariable effect on parental intention to vaccinate their children. Of the 4,135 participants, 61.9% were hesitant to vaccinate their 5C11-year-old children.

Data on patient demographics, date of referral, duration between referral and appointment, appointment type, and diagnosis acuity were collected. A multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate the impact of the patient age, ethnicity, language, insurance, diagnosis acuity, time to appointment, and appointment type on attendance. RESULTS This study included 1988 referrals placed between March 16th-December 31st, 2020 and 3704 referrals placed between March 16th-December 31st, 2019. In 2020, attendance proportions were significantly higher at 72% compared to 62% during 2019 (p < 0.001).

M(pro) is therefore an attractive target for therapeutic interventions. Certain proteins in cells under oxidative stress undergo modification of reactive cysteines. We show M(pro) is susceptible to glutathionylation, leading to inhibition of dimerization and activity. Activity of glutathionylated M(pro) could be restored with reducing agents or glutaredoxin. Analytical studies demonstrated that glutathionylated M(pro) primarily exists as a monomer and that modification of a single cysteine with glutathione is sufficient to block dimerization and inhibit its activity. Gel filtration studies as well as analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed that glutathionylated M(pro) exists as a monomer. Tryptic and chymotryptic digestions of M(pro) as well as experiments using a C300S M(pro) mutant revealed that Cys300, which is located at the dimer interface, is a primary target of glutathionylation. Moreover, Cys300 is required for inhibition of activity upon M(pro) glutathionylation. These findings indicate that M(pro) dimerization and activity can be regulated through reversible glutathionylation of a non-active site cysteine, Cys300, which itself is not required for M(pro) activity, and provides a novel target for the development of agents to block M(pro) dimerization and activity.

METHOD Sixteen female patients (four with total prolapse, twelve with intussusception) underwent robot-assisted ventral mesh rectopexy (RVMR) and 14 female patients (two with prolapse, twelve with intussusception) laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy (LVMR). Primary outcome measures were perioperative parameters, complications and restoration of anatomy as assessed by MR defaecography, which was performed preoperatively and 3 months after surgery. RESULTS Patient demographics, operation length, operating theatre times and length of in-hospital stay were similar between the groups. The anatomical defects of rectal prolapse, intussusception and rectocele and enterocele were similarly corrected after rectopexy in either technique as confirmed with dynamic MR defaecography. A slight residual intussusception was observed in three patients with primary total prolapse (two RVMR vs one LVMR) and in one patient with primary intussusception (RVMR) (P = 0.60). Rectocele was reduced from a mean of 33.0  14.9 mm to 5.5  8.4 mm after RVMR (P < 0.001) and from 24.7  17.5 mm to 7.2  3.2 mm after LVMR (P < 0.001) (RVMR vs LVMR, P = 0.10). CONCLUSION Robot-assisted laparoscopic ventral rectopexy can be performed safely and within the same operative time as conventional laparoscopy. Minimally invasive ventral rectopexy allows good anatomical correction as assessed by MR defaecography, with no differences between the techniques.","output":"Robot-assisted vs laparoscopic ventral rectopexy for external or internal rectal prolapse and enterocele: a randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A public health emergency like the Covid-19 pandemic affords health systems an opportunity to effect transformations in care delivery that might never happen under normal circumstances.

Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 complicated by secondary Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) is poorly understood. METHODS: This retrospective case series was conducted between March and April 2020 at four hospitals of Steward Health Care Network of Massachusetts, USA. Seven patients out of 169 who had echocardiogram were identified to have features of TC. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, management and outcome were gathered from their electronic medical records. We also reviewed all the published cases of COVID-19 and TC in the literature to recognise their common clinical characteristics, risk factors and outcomes. RESULTS: In our series of seven patients, three typical, two inverted, one biventricular and one global TC were recognised. Three were females and four were males. The mean age was 7111 years. In-hospital death was observed in 57% of patients. Patients who belonged to the high-risk group and had high-risk echocardiographic features in our series had a 100% mortality rate.

Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) has demonstrated improved functional capacity and reduced patient-reported symptoms. To date the safety and tolerability of these methods have not been determined in CAP patients recovering following hospitalization. Accordingly, this study aimed to assess the safety and tolerability of IMT in adults discharged from hospital with CAP. MATERIAL AND METHODS Participants received an IMT device (POWERbreathe KHP2) and completed 9-weeks IMT training with weekly follow-up. Frequency (twice daily) and load (50% PImax) were fixed throughout, but training volume increased incrementally (2-week habituation phase, 7-week training phase). Primary outcomes of interest included IMT safety and tolerability. RESULTS Twenty-two participants were recruited; 16 were male, mean age 55.2 years (range 27.9-77.3). From 1183 possible training days, side effects were reported on 15 occasions by 10 individual participants. All reported side-effects were assessed as grade 1 and did not prevent further training. Participant-reported IMT acceptability was 99.4%. CONCLUSION Inspiratory muscle training is safe and tolerable in patients following hospitalisation for CAP. Patient satisfaction with IMT is high and it is viewed by patients as being helpful in their recovery. Distinguishing CAP-related symptoms and device-related side effects is challenging. Symptom prevalence declined during follow-up with concurrent improvements in spirometry observed. Further research is required to determine the efficacy of IMT interventions following CAP and other acute respiratory infections.","output":"The feasibility and tolerability of using inspiratory muscle training with adults discharged from the hospital with community-acquired pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of the Farmer Field School approach to address the complex problem of antimicrobial resistance in agriculture, specifically within small-to-medium-scale layer poultry systems in Ghana and Kenya. Impact was assessed across three domains relevant to the emergence and selection of antimicrobial resistance, including infection, prevention, and control practices, engagement with animal health professionals, and knowledge, attitudes, and practices on antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: Farmer Field Schools were held in Ghana (N = 2) and Kenya (N = 3) across an eight-month period with an average of 18 participants in each school. After completion, a quantitative evaluation survey was administered to participants and a sample of non-participants (Ghana; N = 97) (Kenya; N = 103). Logistic and ordinary least squares regression were used to assess differences between participants and non-participants on the three domains. RESULTS: Participation in a layer poultry Farmer Field School in Ghana and Kenya is associated with self-reported reductions in antibiotic use, particularly for prevention, an increased investment in farm infection, prevention, and control practices, including the use of footbaths and personal protective equipment, and enhanced engagement with animal health professionals. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial resistance is a complex problem driven by a wide range of practices and multiple stakeholders. To holistically address these factors requires the use of complex intervention approaches. The Farmer Field School approach offers a complex intervention methodology that can reduce the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in agricultural systems through targeting the variety of on-farm and off-farm factors that drive resistance.","output":"Social-technical interventions to reduce antimicrobial resistance in agriculture: evidence from poultry Farmer Field Schools in Ghana and Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The superior vena cava syndrome refers to a medical emergency resulting from superior vena cava compression, which develops in 2%-4% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

Experiments were performed with either CytoPatch?2 automated or manual patch-clamp setups on HEK293T cells stably or transiently transfected with hERG1, hNav1.5, hKir2.1, hKv7.1+hMinK, and on Pluricyte? cardiomyocytes (Ncardia), using physiological solutions. Dose-response plots of hERG1 inhibition fitted with Hill functions yielded IC50 values in the low micromolar range for both compounds. We found hyperpolarizing shifts of tens of mV, larger for chloroquine, in the voltage-dependent activation but not inactivation, as well as a voltage-dependent block of hERG current, larger at positive potentials. We also found inhibitory effects on peak and late I(Na) and on I(K1), with IC50 of tens of M and larger for chloroquine.

We assessed antibody functionality and reactivities to peptides across the CoV2 and the four endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) genomes in 126 COVID-19 convalescent plasma donations. We found strong correlation between plasma functionality and polyclonal antibody targeting of CoV2 spike protein peptides. Antibody reactivity to many HCoV spike peptides also displayed strong correlation with plasma functionality, including pan-coronavirus cross-reactive epitopes located in a conserved region of the fusion peptide. After accounting for antibody cross-reactivity, we identified an association between greater alphacoronavirus NL63 antibody responses and development of highly neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We also found that plasma preferentially reactive to the CoV2 receptor binding domain (RBD), versus the betacoronavirus HKU1 RBD, had higher neutralizing titer. Finally, we developed a two-peptide serosignature that identifies plasma donations with high anti-S titer but that suffer from low neutralizing activity.

We conducted a population-based cohort study of all patients with identified COVID-19 and respiratory symptoms who were hospitalized in France between February and June 2020. Cases were patients who had a diagnosis of SCZ. Controls were patients who did not have a diagnosis of severe mental illness. The outcomes were in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. A total of 50 750 patients were included, of whom 823 were SCZ patients (1.6%).

The ARB losartan is known to decrease the serum uric acid (SUA) level. However, there are very few clinical data comparing the effects of other ARBs on SUA level under the conditions of clinical practice. This study evaluated and compared the long-term effects of monotherapy with five ARBs on SUA level in Japanese hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS We identified hypertensive patients with type 2 DM who had been treated with monotherapy with losartan (n = 214), valsartan (n = 266), telmisartan (n = 185), candesartan (n = 458), or olmesartan (n = 192), in whom laboratory data of SUA between November 1, 2004 and July 31, 2011 were available, from the Nihon University School of Medicine's Clinical Data Warehouse (NUSM's CDW). We used a propensity-score weighting method and a multivariate regression model to adjust for differences in the background among ARB users, and compared the SUA level. The mean exposure of losartan was 264.7 days, valsartan 245.3 days, telmisartan 235.9 days, candesartan 248.9 days, and olmesartan 234.5 days. RESULTS In losartan users, mean SUA level was significantly decreased from baseline, while it was conversely increased in users of other ARBs; valsartan, telmisartan, candesartan, and olmesartan. The mean reduction of SUA level from baseline was significantly greater in losartan users compared with that in other ARB users. Comparison of ARBs other than losartan showed no significant difference in mean change in SUA level from baseline. CONCLUSIONS Our study showed that losartan had the most beneficial effect on SUA level among five ARBs, and that there was no significant difference in the unfavorable effects on SUA level among four ARBs other than losartan, at least during one year. These findings provide evidence of an effect of ARBs on SUA level, and support the benefit of the use of losartan in hypertensive patients with type 2 DM.","output":"Comparative effect of angiotensin II type I receptor blockers on serum uric acid in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a retrospective observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The effect of molecular cluster formation on the estimation of kinetic parameters for primary nucleation and growth in different systems has been studied using computationally generated data and three sets of experimental data in the literature.

For a system exhibiting a strong tendency to form molecular clusters, accounting for cluster formation in a kinetic model is critical to interpret kinetic data accurately, for instance, to estimate the specific surface energy  from a set of primary nucleation rates. On the contrary, for a system with negligible cluster formation, a consideration of cluster formation does not affect parameter estimation outcomes.

Consequently, elucidation of molecular determinants of their function and interaction with the host is an important task. Whereas some of the coronaviral proteins are extensively characterized, others remain understudied. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the structure and dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) protein (a viroporin) in the monomeric form. The protein consists of the hydrophobic -helical transmembrane domain (TMD) and amphiphilic -helices H2 and H3, connected by flexible linkers. We show that TMD has a preferable orientation in the membrane, while H2 and H3 reside at the membrane surface. Orientation of H2 is strongly influenced by palmitoylation of cysteines Cys40, Cys43, and Cys44. Glycosylation of Asn66 affects the orientation of H3. We also observe that the monomeric E protein both generates and senses the membrane curvature, preferably localizing with the C-terminus at the convex regions of the membrane; the protein in the pentameric form displays these properties as well. Localization to curved regions may be favorable for assembly of the E protein oligomers, whereas induction of curvature may facilitate the budding of the viral particles.

CASE SUMMARY: An 82-year-old man with HF, stable on medical therapy, underwent cardiac resynchronization therapy implantation in 2016. Modern CIEDs facilitate remote monitoring by providing real-time physiological data (thoracic impedance, heart rate and rhythm, etc.). The Triage Heart Failure Risk Score (Triage-HFRS), available on Medtronic CIEDs, integrates several monitored physiological parameters into a risk prediction model classifying patients as low, medium, or high risk of HF events within 30 days. In November 2019, the patient was enrolled in an innovative clinical pathway (Triage-HF Plus) whereby any high Triage-HF risk status transmission prompts a phone call-based virtual consultation. A high-risk alert was received via remote transmission on 11 March, triggering a phone call assessment. Upon reporting increasing breathlessness, diuretics were initiated. The prescription was remotely issued and delivered to the patients home. This approach circumvented the need for all face-to-face reviews, delivering care in an entirely remote manner. DISCUSSION: The challenges posed by COVID-19 have prompted us to think differently about how we deliver care for patients, both now and following the pandemic. Contemporary CIEDs facilitate the ability to remotely monitor HF patients by providing rich physiological data that can help identify individuals at elevated risk of decompensation using automated device-generated alerts.","output":"Protecting the most vulnerable during COVID-19 and beyond: a case report on the remote management of heart failure patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis introduced a sudden discontinuity into the functioning of human societies worldwide by affecting individual habits as well as economic and social life This paper is a first attempt to investigate whether that discontinuity also altered our relationship to the future, in particular through the production of scenarios of a ?world after? significantly different from the world before We analyzed the representations of the future produced at the height of the first wave of the crisis, between March and June 2020, through a selective review of these productions From the 60 sources found, we selected 23 texts yielding 83 scenarios We used a classic four-category typology (Continued Growth, Discipline, Collapse and Transformation) that allowed us to identify scenarios of continuity and discontinuity The results show a paradoxical predominance of continuity scenarios, contradicting our hypothesis that the crisis would have fostered creativity regarding the ?world after ?

Here, we characterized the TCR repertoire of MIS-C patients and found a profound expansion of TCR? variable gene 11-2 (TRBV11-2), with up to 24% of clonal T cell space occupied by TRBV11-2 T cells, which correlated with MIS-C severity and serum cytokine levels.

She joins an unknown number of clinicians who have taken their lives over the past year. The authors introduce Dr. Breen, a highly talented physician working on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, and examine how pervasive distress and suicide are in clinicians. Then, they explain the lived experience movement and highlight how clinicians speaking openly about their mental illness and treatment are making it easier for their colleagues to seek lifesaving help, despite the stigma still surrounding mental illness and treatment in medicine. The authors sort through the science of clinician distress; critique how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the lives of clinicians; and describe existing national initiatives to address clinician stress, burnout, and suicide. Finally, they recommend evidence-based actions to prevent clinician suicide that multiple stakeholder groups can take, including regulatory agencies, licensing boards, and hospital privileging boards; specialty boards, professional associations, and continuing education organizations; medical educators; and individual clinicians. Suicide is a complex but generally preventable cause of death. Those in medicine must forge ahead with collective momentum.

METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional study was developed, following the STROBE guidelines. Maximal inspiratory and expiratory mouth pressures were assessed in 50 healthy young students (26 women, 24 men; age 22.202.41 years). The inclusion criteria were as follows: aged between 18 and 35 years; control group: not diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019; and coronavirus disease 2019 group: diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019, at least 6 months ago. The exclusion criteria were as follows: obese/overweight; infected with coronavirus disease 2019 or coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms in the last 6 months; smokers; and asthmatics. RESULTS: When comparing with groups, the coronavirus disease 2019 group presented statistically significant lower maximal inspiratory pressure values compared with the control group (88.3216.62 vs. 101.0117.42 cm H2O; p=0.01). Regarding the maximal expiratory pressure, no significant differences were found. Similar results were found when performing a subgroup analysis by sex and group. CONCLUSIONS: Young students who suffered from coronavirus disease 2019 asymptomatically or mildly at least 6 months ago presented a significant decrease in the inspiratory muscle strength as a sequel, so we believe that patients affected by this disease should have a brief postinfection assessment of this musculature to detect the indication for cardiorespiratory rehabilitation.","output":"Respiratory muscle sequelae in young university students infected by coronavirus disease 2019: an observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives : To investigate the clinical characteristics of adverse events following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination in patients in South Korea.

We have recently reported that an original neuropathogenic LDV isolate, LDV-C-BR, contained a low level of a coexisting non-neuropathogenic LDV which, in a mixed infection of mice, rapidly outcompeted the former resulting in apparent loss of neuropathogenicity of the reisolated LDV. This correlated with an impaired ability of the neuropathogenic LDV to establish a viremic persistent infection. In the present study we identified the presence of three different quasispecies in another original neuropathogenic LDV by sequence analysis of cDNA clones of ORF 5 (encoding the primary envelope glycoprotein VP-3P) obtained from the isolate. Successful development of differential reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays allowed us to biologically clone all three quasispecies through repeated end point dilutions. Only one of the quasispecies (LDV-v) was neuropathogenic. The other two, LDV-vP (probably the same as LDV-P) and LDV-vx (a novel LDV quasispecies that had not been previously identified), were non-neuropathogenic and found to be the common LDV quasispecies associated with almost all LDVs originally isolated from mice carrying various other transplantable tumors. The neuropathogenic LDV-v became selectively amplified in the spinal cords of paralyzed mice, but possessed an impaired ability to establish a persistent viremic infection and was rapidly out-competed by LDV-vP and LDV-vx in mixed infections, just as reported previously for LDV-C-BR. The results further support our hypothesis that neuropathogenicity and impaired capability for viremic persistence of LDV are determined by the same molecular feature. The only consistent and biologically relevant molecular difference we have observed between neuropathogenic and non-neuropathogenic LDVs is the number of polylactosaminoglycan chains associated with the ectodomain of VP-3P.","output":"Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus variants: cosegregation of neuropathogenicity and impaired capability for high viremic persistent infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The COVID-19 outbreak means far-reaching changes in the organization of daily lives. Disease-related literacy and factors such as age, gender, or education play a major role in shaping individual practices of protective behavior. This paper investigates different types and frequency of practicing protective behaviors, as well as socio-demographic factors that are associated with such behavioral change. Methods: Data stem from a cross-sectional survey in Germany. Three thousand seven hundred and sixty-five people were contacted, 3,186 participated in the survey. Information on behavior to lower the risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 was assessed by nine items (answer options yes/no). For each item, logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR), using education, sex, and age as main predictors and adjusting for partnership status and household composition. Results: People with lower educational level were less likely to avoid gatherings (OR = 0.63; 95%CI = 0.48C0.83), adapt their work situation (OR = 0.66; 95%CI = 0.52C0.82), reduce personal contacts and meetings (OR = 0.71; 95%CI = 0.55C0.93), or increase hand hygiene (OR = 0.53; 95%CI = 0.38C0.73).

This qualitative study in a large urban institution aimed to: 1) characterize the clinical specialties that predominantly treat STIs, 2) identify perceived barriers to EPT, and 3) describe strategies to advance routine EPT use. METHODS Providers in Obstetrics/Gynecology (OB/GYN), Infectious Disease (ID) and Emergency Medicine (EM) were interviewed using a structured discussion guide. Transcripts were double-coded and iteratively analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Barriers and strategies were summarized and supported with quotes from providers (n=23). RESULTS Perceived EPT barriers overlapped across OB/GYN, ID and EM, yet the settings were diverse in their patient populations, resources and concerns. OB/GYNs were the only providers practicing EPT, yet there was a lack of standardization. ID providers noted that an EPT prescription from an ID provider could inadvertently disclose HIV status of a patient to a sexual partner, posing an ethical dilemma. EM providers exhibited readiness for EPT, although routine empiric treatment of index patients in EM (est. at 90%) gave some providers pause in prescribing for partners: \\"I don't know what I'm treating.\\" Point-of-care testing could increase providers' confidence in prescribing EPT, yet some worried it could contribute to overutilization of the ER as an STI clinic.

However, there is limited literature on the appropriate timing of corticosteroid administration to obtain the best possible patient outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study including patients with severe COVID-19 who received corticosteroid treatment from March 2 to June 30, 2020 in seven tertiary hospitals in South Korea. We analyzed the patient demographics, characteristics, and clinical outcomes according to the timing of steroid use. Twenty-two patients with severe COVID-19 were enrolled, and they were all treated with corticosteroids. RESULTS: Of the 22 patients who received corticosteroids, 12 patients (55%) were treated within 10 days from diagnosis. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics. The initial PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 168.75. The overall case fatality rate was 25%. The mean time from diagnosis to steroid use was 4.08 days and the treatment duration was 14 days in the early use group, while those in the late use group were 12.80 days and 18.50 days, respectively. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio, C-reactive protein level, and cycle threshold value improved over time in both groups. In the early use group, the time from onset of symptoms to discharge (32.4 days vs. 60.0 days, P = 0.030), time from diagnosis to discharge (27.8 days vs. 57.4 days, P = 0.024), and hospital stay (26.0 days vs. 53.9 days, P = 0.033) were shortened. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with severe COVID-19, early use of corticosteroids showed favorable clinical outcomes which were related to a reduction in the length of hospital stay.","output":"Effects of early corticosteroid use in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Perianal abscess (PA) in neonates is poorly understood, and its management remains controversial. The aim of this study was to compare incision and drainage (ID) with or without primary fistulotomy in the management of neonatal first-time PA. METHODS: A retrospective comparative study was conducted for neonates with first-time PA treated with incision and drainage with primary fistulotomy (IDF) vs. ID between 2008 and 2017. RESULTS: In total, 138 patients (137 boys and 1 girl) were identified; 65 in the IDF group and 73 in the ID group. The median follow-up was 6.5 years (range 4C13 years). Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. The cure rate in the IDF group (98.5%, 64/65) was significantly higher than that in the ID group (80.8%, 59/73; p = 0.001). The rate of fistula formation in the IDF group (1.5%, 1/65) was significantly lower than that in the ID group (13.7%, 10/73; p = 0.01). The rate of abscess recurrence was not statistically different (p = 0.12), even though the IDF group (0%, 0/65) seemed to have a better outcome than the ID group (5.5%, 4/73). No fecal incontinence was observed in any of our patients. CONCLUSIONS: First-time PA in neonates can be treated safely and effectively by the IDF or by ID alone.

Immunocompromised status is considered a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19. We aimed to determine whether immunocompromised patients with COVID-19 have an increased risk of mortality. METHOD: The groups baseline characteristics were balanced using a propensity score-based inverse probability of treatment weighting approach. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the risks of in-hospital mortality and other outcomes according to immunocompromised status using a multivariable logistic regression model. We identified immunocompromised status based on a diagnosis of malignancy or HIV/AIDS, having undergone organ transplantation within 3 years, prescriptions for corticosteroids or oral immunosuppressants for 30 days, and at least one prescription for non-oral immunosuppressants during the last year. RESULTS: The 6,435 COVID-19 patients (18 years) included 871 immunocompromised (13.5%) and 5,564 non-immunocompromised (86.5%). Immunocompromised COVID-19 patients were older (60.116.4 years vs. 47.118.7 years, absolute standardized mean difference: 0.738). The immunocompromised group had more comorbidities, a higher Charlson comorbidity index, and a higher in-hospital mortality rate (9.6% vs. 2.3%; p < .001). The immunocompromised group still had a significantly higher in-hospital mortality rate after inverse probability of treatment weighting (6.4% vs. 2.0%, p < .001). Multivariable analysis adjusted for baseline imbalances revealed that immunocompromised status was independently associated with a higher risk of mortality among COVID-19 patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.62C2.68, p < .001).

We aimed to investigate the association between pandemic-related stress factors (PRSF) and anxiety and to evaluate the potential effect of resilience on anxiety among physicians. METHODS: A self-report digital survey was completed by 1106 Israeli physicians (564 males and 542 females) during the COVID-19 outbreak. Anxiety was measured by the 8-item version of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. Resilience was evaluated by the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Stress was assessed using a PRSF inventory. RESULTS: Physicians reported high levels of anxiety with a mean score of 59.20  7.95. We found an inverse association between resilience and anxiety. Four salient PRSF (mental exhaustion, anxiety about being infected, anxiety infecting family members, and sleep difficulties) positively associated with anxiety scores.

Important variables that influence perpetuation differ in small (<1,000 individuals) and large (>10,000) populations: in small populations, two important variables are persistence in individuals, and turnover of the population, while in large populations important variables are transmissibility, generation time, and seasonality. In small populations, viruses such as poliovirus that cause acute infections cannot readily be perpetuated, in contrast to viruses such as hepatitis B virus, that cause persistent infections. However, small animal populations can turnover significantly each year, permitting the perpetuation of some viruses that cause acute infections. Large populations of humans are necessary for the perpetuation of acute viruses; for instance, measles required a population of 500,000 for perpetuation in the pre-measles vaccine era. Furthermore, if an acute virus, such as poliovirus, exhibits marked seasonality in large populations, then it may disappear during the seasonal trough, even in the presence of a large number of susceptible persons. Eradication is the converse of perpetuation and can be used as a definitive approach to the control of a viral disease, as in the instance of smallpox. Therefore, the requirements for perpetuation have significant implications for practical public health goals.","output":"Virus perpetuation in populations: biological variables that determine persistence or eradication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pennsylvania responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by closing schools and moving to online instruction in March 2020.

METHODS: We conducted a mixed methods study to investigate the career choices and progression of early career clinical scientists. First job sector and salary of trainees who completed the UK pre-registration Scientist Training Programme (STP) between 2014 and 2019 were analysed using descriptive statistics and Chi-Squared tests. Semi-structured interviews conducted with volunteer practising clinical scientists who completed the programme in 2015 or 2016 were analysed thematically and reviewed for alignment with theories for understanding career choice and workforce retention. RESULTS: Most scientists who completed the STP between 2014 and 2019 obtained a post in the UK National Health Service (NHS) and achieved the expected starting salary. Life scientists were more likely to work in non-NHS healthcare settings than other scientific divisions; and physiological scientists less likely to achieve the expected starting salary. Experiences during training influenced career choice and progression 0C3 years post qualification, as did level of integration of training places with workforce planning. Specialty norms, staff turnover, organisational uncertainty and geographical preferences influenced choices in both the short (0C3 years) and longer term (5 + years). Interviewees reported a strong commitment to public service; and some could foresee that these priorities would influence future decisions about applying for management positions. These factors aligned with the components of job embeddedness theory, particularly that of fit. CONCLUSIONS: Training experiences, personal values, specialty norms and organisational factors all influence UK clinical scientists early career choices and progression. Job embeddedness theory provides a useful lens through which to explore career choice and progression; and suggests types of intervention that can enhance the careers of this essential group.

METHODS We used an online survey to assess burnout in terms of exhaustion and disengagement in a sample of 58 geriatric healthcare workers. RESULTS We found higher levels of exhaustion, disengagement, and burnout among geriatric healthcare workers during the second than during the first lockdown. We also found high levels of exhaustion but moderate disengagement and burnout during the second lockdown. CONCLUSION The increased exhaustion, disengagement, and burnout during the second lockdown can be attributed to the increased workload in geriatric facilities throughout this crisis and during the second lockdown due to shortage in staff and increased number of shifts and allocated duties. The high levels of exhaustion reported among geriatric healthcare workers during the second lockdown can reflect their physical fatigue, as well as their feelings of being emotionally overextended and exhausted by their workload.","output":"High Exhaustion in Geriatric Healthcare Professionals During the COVID-19 Second Lockdown."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: KIRC is one of the most common cancers with a poor prognosis ACE2 was involved in tumor angiogenesis and progression in many malignancies The role of ACE2 in KIRC is still ambiguous Methods: Various bioinformatics analysis tools were investigated to evaluate the prognostic value of ACE2 and its association with immune infiltration in KIRC Results: ACE2 was shown to be downregulated in KIRC at the mRNA and protein level Low expression of ACE2 protein in KIRC patients was observed in subgroup analyses based on gender, age, weight, tumor grade, and cancer stage Upregulation of ACE2 in KIRC was associated with a favorable prognosis ACE2 mRNA expression showed a positive correlation with the abundance of immune cells (B cells, CD8+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells) and the level of immune markers of different immune cells in KIRC ACE2 expression could affect, in part, the immune infiltration and the advanced cancer stage Moreover, enrichment analysis revealed that ACE2 in KIRC were mainly involved in translation factor activity, immunoglobulin binding, metabolic pathways, transcriptional misregulation in cancerous cells, cell cycle, and ribosomal activity Several ACE2-associated kinases, miRNA, and transcription factor targets in KIRC were also identified Conclusion: ACE2 was downregulated in KIRC and served as a prognostic biomarker It was also shown to be associated with immune infiltration","output":"ACE2 Is a Prognostic Biomarker and Associated with Immune Infiltration in Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma: Implication for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background In contrast to alarming reports of exhaustion and burnout amongst healthcare workers in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, we noticed surprisingly positive staff experiences of working in a COVID-19 field hospital in South Africa. The 862-bed Hospital of Hope was established at the Cape Town International Convention Centre specifically to cope with the effects of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Cape Town. Methods We aimed to systematically describe and assess the effects on staff and the local health system. A cross-sectional descriptive study design was employed using mixed methods including record reviews and interviews with key informants. Results Quantitative results confirmed high job satisfaction and low staff infection rates. The emerging themes from the qualitative data are grouped around a \\"bulls eye\\" of the common purpose of person-centredness, from both patient and staff perspectives, and include staff safety and support, rapid communication, continuous learning and adaptability, underpinned by excellent teamwork. The explanations for the positive feedback included good disaster planning, adequate resources, and an extraordinary responsiveness to the need. Conclusions The Hospital of Hope staff experience produced significant learnings for the design and management of routine health services outside of a disaster situation. The adaptability and responsiveness of the facility and its staff was largely a product of the unprecedented nature of the pandemic, but such approaches could benefit routine health services enormously, as individual hospitals and health facilities realize their place in a system that is more than the sum of its parts.","output":"Tackling the first COVID-19 wave at the Cape Town Hospital of Hope: Why was it such a positive experience for staff?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Governmental and educational organizations advocate for the adoption of inquiry-based, student-centered educational strategies in undergraduate STEM curricula. These strategies are known to benefit students by increasing performance, enhancing mastery of class content, and augmenting affect, particularly in underrepresented racial/ethnic minority students. Among these strategies, case study and project-based learning allow students to master course content while collectively tackling relevant, real-world societal problems. In particular, environmental pollution with paper-based products provide a current problem by which microbiology students learn about the role of microorganisms in paper waste management as well as the microbiological and biochemical processes involved in protein secretion, nutrient uptake, and energy metabolism. Delivered in a flipped, hybrid class in a Technology-Enabled Active Learning (TEAL) laboratory, this lesson taught students about exoenzyme secretion, biopolymer hydrolysis, intracellular transport of sugars, and sugar catabolic reactions. Students demonstrated increased comprehension of exoenzyme function and secretion, as well as how cells uptake the products of exoenzyme hydrolysis. However, students had challenges in placing the transported exoenzyme products within metabolic processes. Our results show increased perceived learning from the students as well as an understanding of the societal implications of these microbiological concepts. Our lesson deviated from knowledge silos in which students learn information in discrete topics. While departing from employing traditional, compartmentalized learning approaches, this student-centered guided lesson frames the systemic nature of the microbiological and biochemical processes underlying the decomposition of organic matter in a real-world context.","output":"Tackling Real-World Environmental Paper Pollution: A Problem-Based Microbiology Lesson About Carbon Assimilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.0c00855.].","output":"Correction to The SARS-COV-2 Spike Protein Binds Sialic Acids, and Enables Rapid Detection in a Lateral Flow Point of Care Diagnostic Device"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serratia marcescens, time and again, has demonstrated its ability to easily adhere and infect vascular access catheters, making them a bona fide source of hospital outbreaks and contributing to adverse patient outcomes.

Nine conserved linear B-cell epitopes and multiple discontinuous B-cell epitopes composed of 69 residues on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S protein were predicted to be highly antigenic. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has a different antigenic profile than that of the SARS-CoV S protein due to the variations in their primary and 3D structures. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 may exploit an immune evasion mechanism through two point mutations in the critical and conserved linear neutralization epitope (overlap with fusion peptide) around a sparsely glycosylated area. These mutations lead to a significant decrease in the antigenicity of this epitope in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. In addition, 62 T-cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were predicted in our study.

This included the cancellation of consultations for patients with rare diseases, such as severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), resulting in potential medication shortage and loss of follow-up. Thus, the aim of the study was to evaluate PH patient health status evolution, access to health care and mental health experience during the early phase of the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online patient survey, available in 16 languages, between 22/05/2020 and 28/06/2020. The survey included questions corresponding to demographic, COVID-19 and PH related information. RESULTS: 1073 patients (or relatives, 27%) from 52 countries all over the world participated in the survey. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of responders reported a diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension and 15% of chronic thromboembolic PH. The COVID-19 related events were few: only 1% of all responders reported a diagnosis of COVID-19. However, 8% of patients reported health deterioration possibly related to PH, and 4% hospitalization for PH. Besides, 11% of the patients reported difficulties to access their PH expert centre, and 3% interruption of treatment due to shortage of medication. Anxiety or depression was reported by 67% of the participants. CONCLUSION: Although COVID-19 incidence in PH patients was low, PH related problems occurred frequently as the pandemic progressed, including difficulties to have access to specialized care. The importance of primary health care was emphasized.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the risk. With the rising importance of human factors and ergonomics (HF&E), a fall prevention programme was introduced by applying HF&E principles to reduce inpatient falls from a systems engineering perspective. The programme was conducted in an acute public hospital with around 750 inpatient beds in Hong Kong. A hospital falls review team (the team) was formed in June 2020 to plan and implement the programme. The Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve and Control (DMAIC) method was adopted. Improvement actions following each fall review were implemented. Fall rates in the pre-COVID-19 period (JanuaryCDecember 2019), COVID-19 period (JanuaryCJune 2020) and programme period (July 2020CAugust 2021) were used for evaluation of the programme effectiveness. A total of 120, 85 and 142 inpatient falls in the pre-COVID-19, COVID-19 and programme periods were reviewed, respectively. Thirteen areas with fall risks were identified by the team where improvement actions applying HF&E principles were implemented accordingly. The average fall rates were 0.476, 0.773 and 0.547 per 1000 patient bed days in these periods, respectively. The average fall rates were found to be significantly increased from the pre-COVID-19 to COVID-19 periods (mean difference=0.297 (95% CI 0.068 to 0.526), p=0.009), which demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic might have affected the hospitals fall rates, while a significant decrease was noted between the COVID-19 and programme periods (mean difference=?0.226 (95% CI ?0.449 to C0.003), p=0.047), which proved that the programme in apply HF&E principles to prevent falls was effective.

However, its biological effects in the kidney are still not clear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the efficiency of licorice in rats with gentamicin (GM)-induced acute tubular necrosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: Rats were randomized into the control group (only saline for 12 days), licorice group (licorice for 12 days), GM group (GM for 12 days), GM + licorice group, and licorice-treated GM group (licorice for 12 days after taking GM for 12 days). Blood urea, creatinine, and uric acid levels were measured and histopathological analyses of the kidneys were performed. The oxidative side of oxidant-antioxidant balance was evaluated by detecting lipid peroxidation (LPO) and total peroxide levels, and antioxidative side was determined by measuring total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in plasma and kidney tissues. RESULTS: The oxidant-antioxidant balance seemed to be shifted to the oxidative side in the GM group when compared with the control and GM + licorice groups. In GM group, biochemical profiles showed a remarkable increase in blood uric acid, urea, and creatinine levels, and depletion of renal tissue and plasma TAC and GSH levels. In addition, histopathologic studies revealed severe acute tubular necrosis, congestion, and hyaline casts, verifying GM-induced nephrotoxicity. Licorice was effective in reduction of blood urea, creatinine, and uric acid levels, and also effective in decreasing the tubular necrosis score. Licorice treatment also significantly reduced LPO and total peroxide levels, and increased TAC and GSH levels in both renal tissue and blood. Moreover, these changes in rats subjected to the combined therapy (GM + licorice) were significantly less than those of GM group. CONCLUSIONS: Licorice ameliorates GM-induced nephrotoxicity and oxidative damage by scavenging oxygen free radicals, decreasing LPO, and improving antioxidant defense.","output":"Protective and Therapeutic Effects of Licorice in Rats With Acute Tubular Necrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A bat-borne disease is any infectious disease whose primary reservoir is any species of bat.

The cut4 mutant and its peptide SRLFRKSNLKPFERD showed highest combined-score 48.23548 and Immunogenicity-Score of 92.0887. The core-sequence SRLFRKSNL showed highest Median Percentile Rank (7 HLA-allele) of 19. CD4+ immunogenicity also confirms representation of CUT4TM2 epitope SRLFRKSNL by MHC Class II. The epitope YNYKYRLFR from CUT4 showed IC50 value of ~30 nM with allele HLA-DRB1*11:01 and HLA-DRB5*01:01. Binding affinity and RMSD score suggest that different epitopic regions of Cut4 mutants interacted MHC II with large number of H-bonds.

Waning immunity and the emergence of new variants will shape the long-term burden and dynamics of COVID-19. We explore the transition to the endemic state, and the endemic incidence, using a combination of modelling approaches. We compare gradual and rapid reopening and reopening at different vaccination levels. We examine how the eventual endemic state depends on the duration of immunity, the rate of importations, the efficacy of vaccines and the transmissibility. These depend on the evolution of the virus, which continues to undergo selection. Slower reopening leads to a lower peak level of incidence and fewer overall infections: as much as a 60% lower peak and a 10% lower total in some illustrative simulations; under realistic parameters, reopening when 70% of the population is vaccinated leads to a large resurgence in cases. The long-term endemic behaviour may stabilize as late as January 2023, with further waves of high incidence occurring depending on the transmissibility of the prevalent variant, duration of immunity, and antigenic drift. We find that long term endemic levels are not necessarily lower than current pandemic levels: in a population of 100,000 with representative parameter settings (Reproduction number 5, 1-year duration of immunity, vaccine efficacy at 80% and importations at 3 cases per 100K per day) there are over 100 daily incident cases in the model.

A CKRT device designed specifically for small children could improve outcomes. The Cardio-Renal Pediatric Dialysis Emergency Machine (CARPEDIEM?) is specifically dedicated to providing CKRT for newborns and small infants. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis comparing patient severity of illness and outcomes between the ppCRRT and CARPEDIEM registries, involving 6 Italian pediatric intensive care units. Thirty-eight subjects from the CARPEDIEM registry and 84 subjects from the ppCRRT registry < 10 kg were screened for comparison. We compared patient outcomes with a weight-matched cohort (< 5 kg) of 34 patients from the CARPEDIEM registry and 48 patients from the ppCRRT registry. RESULTS: The ppCRRT subjects had higher rates of vasoactive medication at CKRT initiation. Survival to CKRT termination was higher for CARPEDIEM subjects (33/34 vs. 21/48, p < 0.0001). Multivariable logistic regression showed that CARPEDIEM registry cohort was the only variable to retain an association with survival to CKRT discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest children receiving CKRT using CARPEDIEM have excellent survival. Our data should be interpreted with caution given the retrospective comparison across two eras more than a decade apart.

Travel bans-herein defined as the complete restriction of travel from at least one geographic region to at least one other international geographic region-are a potential policy solution to control the global spread of disease. The social, economic, and health-related consequences of travel bans, as well as the available evidence on the effectiveness of travel restrictions in preventing the global spread of influenza, have been previously described. However, the effectiveness of travel bans in reducing the spread of noninfluenza EIDs, characterized by different rates and modes of transmission, is less well understood. This study employs an integrative review approach to summarize the minimal evidence on effectiveness of travel bans to decrease the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola virus disease (EVD), and Zika virus disease (ZVD). We describe and qualify the evidence presented in six modeling studies that assess the effectiveness of travel bans in controlling these noninfluenza EID events.

The baseline and follow-up surveys were conducted from February 25-27, 2020, and April 1-6, 2020, respectively. Participants were asked how often they implemented the five personal protective measures recommended by the World Health Organization (hand hygiene, social distancing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, respiratory etiquette, and self-isolation) in the baseline and follow-up surveys. RESULTS: Three of the five personal protective measures' availability significantly improved during the community transmission phase compared to the early phase. Social distancing measures showed significant improvement, from 67.4% to 82.2%. However, the prevalence of avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth, which had the lowest prevalence in the early phase, showed no significant improvement (approximately 60%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that men and persons of low-income households made fewer improvements than women and persons of high-income households.

Likewise, when considering whether to prioritize health care workers for the vaccine, their crucial role in keeping the health care system operational, and right to a safe work environment need to be factored in.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Outcomes from consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous tenotomy with the TX-1 device were compared with outcomes from consecutive patients who underwent surgical tenotomy. Patients were contacted to retrospectively assess their outcomes at 4 time points: before treatment, 2 weeks after treatment, 3 to 6 months after treatment, and 12 months after treatment. Outcomes were assessed using the quick disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand score (QuickDASH) and the Oxford elbow score (OES). Student's t tests were used to compare postprocedural versus preprocedural scores and percutaneous versus surgical tenotomy scores. RESULTS: Response rates were 23 of 43 and 10 of 47 for surveyed percutaneous and surgical tenotomy patients, respectively. There were significant improvements from preprocedural scores in all primary outcome measures at 3-to-6-month and 12-month time points for both procedures. No significant changes from preprocedural scores were seen for either procedure at 2 weeks after treatment or between percutaneous and surgical tenotomy in preprocedural or postprocedural scores for any outcome measure. At 2 weeks, improved percutaneous tenotomy scores approached significance compared with percutaneous preprocedural QuickDASH (p = 0.060) and surgical 2-week OES function domain (p = 0.074) scores.

Despite progress on early multidrug therapy for COVID-19 patients, the current mandate is to immunize the world population as quickly as possible. The lack of thorough testing in animals prior to clinical trials, and authorization based on safety data generated during trials that lasted less than 3.5 months, raise questions regarding vaccine safety. The recently identified role of SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein for inducing endothelial damage characteristic of COVID-19, even in absence of infection, is extremely relevant given that most of the authorized vaccines induce endogenous production of Spike. Given the high rate of occurrence of adverse effects that have been reported to date, as well as the potential for vaccine-driven disease enhancement, Th2-immunopathology, autoimmunity, and immune evasion, there is a need for a better understanding of the benefits and risks of mass vaccination, particularly in groups excluded from clinical trials. Despite calls for caution, the risks of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have been minimized or ignored by health organizations and government authorities. As for any investigational biomedical program, data safety monitoring boards (DSMB) and event adjudication committees (EAC), should be enacting risk mitigation. If DSMBs and EACs do not do so, we will call for a pause in mass vaccination. If DSMBs and EACs do not exist, then vaccination should be halted immediately, in particular for demographic groups at highest risk of vaccine-associated death or serious adverse effects, during such time as it takes to assemble these boards and commence critical and independent assessments.

Here, we evaluate heterozygous transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor driven by the epithelial cell cytokeratin-18 gene promoter (K18-hACE2) as a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice results in high levels of viral infection in lung tissues with additional spread to other organs. Remarkably, a decline in pulmonary function, as measured by static and dynamic tests of respiratory capacity, occurs 4 days after peak viral titer and correlates with an inflammatory response marked by infiltration into the lung of monocytes, neutrophils, and activated T cells resulting in pneumonia. Cytokine profiling and RNA sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues show a massively upregulated innate immune response with prominent signatures of NF-kB-dependent, type I and II interferon signaling, and leukocyte activation pathways.

Design/methodology/approach Monthly based data measuring the tourism industry's performance for these urban destinations has been collected. This data includes airlines' and hotels' performance, as well as potential tourists' online searches. The obtained data has been combined using a principal component analysis, generating the UTPI.

In the short term, many people are still unvaccinated, VOCs continue to emerge and spread, and mobility and population mixing is expected to increase over the summer. Therefore, policies that lift restrictions too much and too early risk another damaging wave. This challenge remains despite the reduced opportunities for transmission due to vaccination progress and reduced indoor mixing in the summer. In autumn 2021, increased indoor activity might accelerate the spread again, but a necessary reintroduction of NPIs might be too slow. The incidence may strongly rise again, possibly filling intensive care units, if vaccination levels are not high enough. A moderate, adaptive level of NPIs will thus remain necessary.

In 2020, household participation in FAFH expenditures declined in all income deciles and regions, but the impact on household shares is far from uniform. Using a detailed national database of household income and expenditures (N = 87,274), an Engel curve of the Working-Lesser functional form for FAFH including 19 independent variables was estimated using the Heckman method appropriate for censored response data. The results provide statistically significant estimates for income, which both increases the probability of participation in this expenditure and has a negative relationship with its budget share. The number of older adults and the exposure to food insecurity during the pandemic similarly limit participation and increase the budget share. In addition, remittances encourage participation and decrease the budget share. The corrected conditional income elasticity for FAFH is 0.4609;the sign and magnitude indicate that FAFH behaved as a necessary good in Mexico for the proportion of households that maintained spending during the lockdown conditions (about one-third of the sample). An increase or decrease in income will lead to a corresponding change in FAFH expenditure, but the change will be less than proportional.","output":"Food-Away-from-Home Expenditure in Mexico during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Micro-Econometric Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Identifying the biological subclasses of septic shock might provide specific targeted therapies for the treatment and prognosis of septic shock.

Convergent findings from antibody studies suggest that prenatal maternal infection with Toxoplasma gondii is associated with increased schizophrenia risk in the offspring, while associations with HSV-2 infection are likely attributable to confounding. Maternal influenza infection remains a viable candidate for schizophrenia, based on an early serological study, though there has been only one attempt to replicate this finding, with a differing methodology. A prior association between maternal serologically confirmed cytomegalovirus infections require further study. Clinically diagnosed maternal infection, particularly bacterial infection, also appears to be associated with increased risk of offspring schizophrenia, and heterogeneity in these findings is likely due to methodological differences between studies. Further clarification may be provided by future studies that address the timing, type, and clinical features of infections.

[1, 2] However, fertility care is a uniquely personal journey and patient attitudes towards telehealth are relatively unknown. We evaluated attitudes of fertility patients across the United States towards telehealth using a validated telehealth satisfaction and usefulness questionnaire. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey study. An anonymous, web-based survey was distributed to national infertility groups between Feb-April 2021.The survey gathered demographic information and included the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ), which assesses aspects of telehealth usability with a 7-point Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). We solicited general comments regarding telehealth for fertility care. The primary outcome was overall satisfaction using telehealth. We computed descriptive statistics to compare satisfied vs unsatisfied participants. Results: 104 respondents initiated and 74 completed the survey. Participants represented 24 different states and all regions of the United States. Most respondents were white (81.1%) with a median age of 35 years old. Most participants (80%) were satisfied using telehealth. Given low frequency of patient dissatisfaction, we were unable to perform statistical tests to compare demographic differences between satisfied and unsatisfied participants. Most (86.5%) respondents would use telehealth again. When given an option, 63.5% prefer in person for new patient visits. For follow up visits, 47.3% prefer telehealth and 27% had no preference. Only 25.7% preferred a follow up visit in person. Conclusions: Telehealth can improve access to care with high rates of patient satisfaction. Most fertility patients still prefer new visits be conducted in person.

Guided by the revolutionary thinking of complexity theory, this leadership perspective details leadership for sustainability. Leadership for sustainability suggests systems are comprised of dynamic relationships, including social and socialCecological relationships, in which every action, and interaction, creates an opportunity to disrupt the system. It is through system disruption that change emerges, as relationships throughout the system form new patterns of equilibrium. In leadership for sustainability, each individual within the system has the capacity to initiate change and the responsibility to continually adjust interactions in support of system sustainability, defined as ecological viability, social equity, and economic prosperity. This leadership perspective explores the implications of leadership for sustainability during and after the global COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing how leadership scholarship and practice must change to equip all individuals with the capacity to disrupt systems, collaborate across differences, learn continuously, and build relationships in an effort to collectively advance toward a more ecologically, socially, and economically sustainable future. ? 2021 University of Phoenix","output":"Emergent Opportunities in Complexity, Leadership, and Sustainability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to characterize the material, health (general and diabetes-specific), and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Hispanic adults with type 2 diabetes who did not experience COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This cross-sectional and longitudinal study used surveys within a clinical trial of 79 Hispanic adult clinic patients with type 2 diabetes. Cross-sectional measures included the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, items from the Coronavirus Impact Scale, and the Pandemic Impacts Inventory. Longitudinal measures included the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care, health care utilization, and measures of diabetes self-efficacy, social support, and quality of life. RESULTS: Participants were majority low-income, Spanish-speaking females with poor diabetes control. Coronavirus anxiety was low despite majority of participants having an affected family member and frequent access barriers. More than half of participants reported moderate/severe pandemic impact on their income. Diabetes self-care behaviors did not change between prepandemic and pandemic measures. Diabetes self-efficacy and quality of life improved despite fewer diabetes-related health care visits.

Improvements in care and clinician confidence may shorten the time spent as an inpatient, or the need for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU). On the other hand, limited resources at times of high demand may lead to rationing. Nevertheless, these variables may be used as static proxies for disease severity, as outcome measures for trials, and to inform planning and logistics. METHODS: We investigate these time trends in an extremely large international cohort of 142,540 patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Investigated are: time from symptom onset to hospital admission, probability of ICU/HDU admission, time from hospital admission to ICU/HDU admission, hospital case fatality ratio (hCFR) and total length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Time from onset to admission showed a rapid decline during the first months of the pandemic followed by peaks during August/September and December 2020. ICU/HDU admission was more frequent from June to August. The hCFR was lowest from June to August. Raw numbers for overall hospital stay showed little variation, but there is clear decline in time to discharge for ICU/HDU survivors.

We aimed to describe the epidemiology of systemic viral infections and their predictive values for excluding serious bacterial infections (SBIs), including bacteremia, meningitis and urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children presenting to the ED with suspected systemic infections. METHODS: We enrolled children who presented to the ED with suspected systemic infections who had blood cultures obtained at seven healthcare facilities. Whole blood specimens were analyzed by an experimental multiplexed PCR test for 7 viruses. Demographic and laboratory results were abstracted. RESULTS: Of the 1114 subjects enrolled, 245 viruses were detected in 224 (20.1%) subjects. Bacteremia, meningitis and UTI frequency in viral bloodstream-positive patients was 1.3, 0 and 10.1% compared to 2.9, 1.3 and 9.7% in viral bloodstream-negative patients respectively. Although viral bloodstream detections had a high negative predictive value for bacteremia or meningitis (NPV = 98.7%), the frequency of UTIs among these subjects remained appreciable (9/89, 10.1%) (NPV = 89.9%). Screening urinalyses were positive for leukocyte esterase in 8/9 (88.9%) of these subjects, improving the ability to distinguish UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Viral bloodstream detections were common in children presenting to the ED with suspected systemic infections. Although overall frequencies of SBIs among subjects with and without viral bloodstream detections did not differ significantly, combining whole blood viral testing with urinalysis provided high NPV for excluding SBI.

This study aimed to determine if patterns of combined predictors may better identify risk of infection and mortality. Methods: For the period of March 2nd to 10th 2020, the first 9 days of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia, we selected all 18 confirmed cases, of which 6 died, and all 60 suspected cases, of which 1 died; and 28 putatively negative patients with pneumonia and no travel history. We recorded data for travel, contact history, symptoms, haematology, comorbidities, and chest x-ray. Hierarchical cluster analyses (HCA) and principal component analyses (PCA) identified cluster and covariance patterns for symptoms or haematology which were analysed with other predictors of infection or mortality using logistic regression. Results: For univariate analyses, no significant association with infection was seen for fever, cough, dyspnoea, headache, runny nose, sore throat, gastrointestinal complaints (GIC), or haematology. A PCA symptom component for fever, cough, and GIC tended to increase risk of infection (OR 3.41; 95% CI 1.06 - 14; p=0.06), and a haematology component with elevated monocytes decreased risk (OR 0.26; 0.07 - 0.79; 0.027). Multivariate analysis revealed that an HCA cluster of 3-5 symptoms, typically fever, cough, headache, runny nose, sore throat but little dyspnoea and no GIC tended to reduce risk (aOR 0.048; <0.001 - 0.52; 0.056). In univariate analyses for death, an HCA cluster of cough, fever and dyspnoea had increased risk (OR 5.75; 1.06 - 31.3, 0.043), but no other individual predictor, cluster or component was associated. Other significant predictors of infection were age >= 45, international travel, contact with COVID-19 patient, and pneumonia. Diabetes and history of contact were associated with higher mortality. Conclusions: Cluster groups and co-variance patterns may be stronger correlates of SARS-CoV-2 infection than individual predictors.

Airborne precaution personal protective equipment and preventative measures are universally mandated for medical procedures deemed to be aerosol generating. The implementation of these measures is having a huge impact on healthcare provision. There is currently a lack of quantitative evidence on the number and size of airborne particles produced during aerosol-generating procedures to inform risk assessments. To address this evidence gap, we conducted real-time, high-resolution environmental monitoring in ultraclean ventilation operating theatres during tracheal intubation and extubation sequences. Continuous sampling with an optical particle sizer allowed characterisation of aerosol generation within the zone between the patient and anaesthetist. Aerosol monitoring showed a very low background particle count (0.4 particles.l-1 ) allowing resolution of transient increases in airborne particles associated with airway management. As a positive reference control, we quantitated the aerosol produced in the same setting by a volitional cough (average concentration, 732 (418) particles.l-1 , n = 38). Tracheal intubation including facemask ventilation produced very low quantities of aerosolised particles (average concentration, 1.4 (1.4) particles.l-1 , n = 14, p < 0.0001 vs. cough). Tracheal extubation, particularly when the patient coughed, produced a detectable aerosol (21 (18) l-1 , n = 10) which was 15-fold greater than intubation (p = 0.0004) but 35-fold less than a volitional cough (p < 0.0001). The study does not support the designation of elective tracheal intubation as an aerosol-generating procedure. Extubation generates more detectable aerosol than intubation but falls below the current criterion for designation as a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure. These novel findings from real-time aerosol detection in a routine healthcare setting provide a quantitative methodology for risk assessment that can be extended to other airway management techniques and clinical settings. They also indicate the need for reappraisal of what constitutes an aerosol-generating procedure and the associated precautions for routine anaesthetic airway management.","output":"A quantitative evaluation of aerosol generation during tracheal intubation and extubation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current appearance of the new SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and it quickly spreading across the world poses a global health emergency.

There is a need to identify effective health behaviors to mitigate the negative mental health impact of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to (1) examine the regional differences in mental health and COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress, in light of the state-level prevalence of COVID-19 cases; (2) estimate the associations between mental health and COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress and health behavior engagement (ie, physical activity, mindfulness meditation); and (3) explore the mediating effect of health behavior engagement on the associations between mental health and COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to a sample of US adult paying subscribers to the Calm app (data were collected from April 22 to June 3, 2020). The survey assessed COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress; health behavior engagement; and mental health (ie, perceived stress, posttraumatic stress disorder, and anxiety and depression). Statistical analyses were performed using R software. Differences in COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress and mental health by location were assessed using t tests and chi-square tests. Logistic and ordinary least squares models were used to regress mental health and health behavior on COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress; moreover, causal mediation analysis was used to estimate the significance of the mediation effects. RESULTS: The median age of the respondents (N=8392) was 47 years (SD 13.8). Participants in the Mid-Atlantic region (New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania) reported higher levels of stress, more severe depression symptoms, greater worry about COVID-19, paying more attention to COVID-19-related news, and more stress related to social distancing recommendations than participants living in other regions. The association between worry about COVID-19 and perceived stress was significantly mediated by changes in physical activity (P<.001), strength of meditation habit (P<.001), and stopping meditation (P=.046). The association between worry about COVID-19 and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms was significantly mediated by changes in physical activity (P<.001) and strength of meditation habit (P<.001).

We evaluated the adoption of evidence-based treatment in the post-MAGIC era and its impact on survival. METHODS: A total of 7058 patients with resectable gastric adenocarcinoma undergoing definitive surgical resection between 2004 and 2015 were analyzed using the National Cancer Database. RESULTS: Over the study period, the proportion of patients receiving adjuvant CRT decreased from 19.1% to 9.1%, while perioperative chemotherapy increased from 1.9% to 28.6%. Utilization of perioperative chemotherapy surpassed adjuvant CRT in 2011. Evidence-based treatment (either perioperative chemotherapy or adjuvant CRT) had better overall survival (OS) than other treatments for clinical stage IICIII patients (p < 0.05). On multivariate analysis of the whole study period, evidence-based treatments were associated with better OS (HR 0.67 [0.60C0.74], p < 0.05). Only 360/1262 (28.5%) patients in the perioperative chemotherapy group completed postoperative therapy, which was associated with improved OS (p < 0.05). For clinical stage III patients (n = 2402), only 806 (33.6%) received evidence-based treatment, while 487 (22.2%) underwent surgery alone. On multivariate analysis of these patients between 2010 and 2015, both perioperative chemotherapy (HR 0.49 [0.35C0.68]) and adjuvant CRT (HR 0.31 [0.21C0.44]) were associated with better OS than surgery alone (p < 0.05).

Methods: Using reportable disease data at Public Health Ontario which captures COVID-19 cases in Ontario, we conducted a cross-sectional study comparing demographic, exposure, and clinical variables between HCWs and non-HCWs with COVID-19 as of 14 May 2020. We calculated rates of infections over time and determined the frequency of within household transmissions using natural language processing. Results: There were 4,230 (17.5%) HCW COVID-19 cases in Ontario, of whom 20.2% were nurses, 2.3% were physicians, and the remaining 77.4% other specialties. HCWs were more likely to be between 30-60 years of age and female. HCWs were more likely to present asymptomatically (8.1% versus 7.0%, p=0.010) or with atypical symptoms (17.8% versus 10.5%, p<0.001). The mortality among HCWs was 0.2% compared to 10.5% of non-HCWs. HCWs commonly had exposures to a confirmed case or outbreak (74.1%), however only 3.1% were confirmed to be nosocomial. The rate of new infections was 5.5 times higher in HCWs than non-HCWs, but mirrored the epidemic curve. We identified 391 (9.8%) probable secondary household transmissions. Interpretation: HCWs represent a disproportionate number of COVID-19 cases in Ontario but with low confirmed numbers of nosocomial transmission. The data support substantial testing bias and under-ascertainment of general population cases.

This may be of particular importance for patients with MM, a condition characterized by considerable heterogeneity in PROs at different timepoints within a patient's disease journey (TA King et al, Semin Oncol Nurs. 2017;33(3):299-315;R Abonour et al, Ann Hematol. 2018;97(12):2425-36). There is also a growing body of evidence to support that digital platforms in healthcare can have an impact on patients' lives and improve the patient care experience across diverse medical settings. Web-based platforms that provide education and allow patients to track data have demonstrated improvement across a range of PROs measuring empowerment, self-efficacy, and mastery when compared against standard of care in a variety of disease states (MR Fu et al, Internet Interv. 2016;5:56-64;G Bouma et al, Support Care Cancer. 2017;25(7):2075-2083). This may be particularly relevant in light of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic. Patient-reported outcome data (e.g., symptoms) that can be readily shared with healthcare professionals (HCPs) can support clinical decision making and impact patient outcomes (E Basch et al, JAMA. 2017 Jul 11;318(2):197-8). Data collected through wearables (such as emoji scales and activity) have been shown to be correlated with traditional, validated PRO measures in patients with cancer (CA Thompson et al, Blood. 2017;130(Suppl 1):2179). Digital medication tracking has led to better medication adherence, increased prescription refills, and better clinical outcomes. Centralized disease management digital platforms have shown potential to reduce patients risk of complications (S Kumar et al, Abstract for the 77th American Diabetes Association. 2017). Despite this body of evidence supporting the potential impact of the use of digital platforms, there is little evidence specifically in MM. The MyHOPE? for MM Solution is a validated investigational digital technology platform designed to provide patients with a comprehensive set of tools and resources to support the patient throughout their overall experience with MM and to collect biometrics and self-reported data such as symptom tracking, medication adherence, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with the ability to share this data with the patient's care team. MyHOPE? for MM is the first prospective study evaluating the impact of a digital intervention for patients with hematological malignancies. Study Design and Methods: This is a multi-center, randomized, pilot trial of the MyHOPE? for MM Solution. Approximately 126 adult patients ( 18 years of age) with a diagnosis of MM and who reside in the USA will be recruited from approximately 30 study sites within the USA, reflecting both community and academic centers. Patients will be stratified according to disease status (newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma transplant-eligible or ineligible, newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma in patients undergoing their first autologous stem cell transplant, or relapsed and/or refractory) and will be randomized in a 2:1 manner to either the Patient App + HCP Portal (Cohort 1) or Patient App Alone (Cohort 2). Primary objectives include feasibility of the platform and patient empowerment and self-efficacy. Other objectives include user satisfaction with the platform, health-related quality of life, and clinical outcomes. Enrolled patients will receive MM-treament regimen according to their physician's care plan. The study is in start-up and recruitment is expected through 2021.

The resource need estimates based on projections for COVID\\\\19 identified a shortfall of medical professionals to care for patients while maintaining 55% of the workforce for regular healthcare across the atolls. The findings show that while the policy of lockdown bought time to increase hospital beds and devices, the country was unable to increase the healthcare workforce. Furthermore, as the lockdown eased, the exponential increase of cases took Maldives to the global one per capita incidence. Despite this, with cautious planning and use of resources, the country has so far managed to maintain low mortality from COVID\\\\19.

To date, several studies have reported positive effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) interventions on physical and psychological well-being in other medical conditions, but no meta-analysis on MBSR programs for hypertension has been conducted. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of MBSR programs for hypertension. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of MBSR on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), anxiety, depression, and perceived stress in people with hypertension or pre-hypertension was conducted. The PubMed/MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were searched in November 2020 to identify relevant studies. Results: Six studies were included. The comparison of MBSR versus control conditions on diastolic BP was associated with a statistically significant mean effect size favoring MBSR over control conditions (MD = ?2.029; 95% confidence interval (CI): ?3.676 to ?0.383, p = 0.016, k = 6; 22 effect sizes overall), without evidence of heterogeneity (I(2) = 0.000%). The comparison of MBSR versus control conditions on systolic BP was associated with a mean effect size which was statistically significant only at a marginal level (MD = ?3.894; 95% CI: ?7.736C0.053, p = 0.047, k = 6; 22 effect sizes overall), without evidence of high heterogeneity (I(2) = 20.772%). The higher the proportion of participants on antihypertensive medications was, the larger the effects of MBSR were on systolic BP (B = ?0.750, z = ?2.73, p = 0.003). Conclusions: MBSR seems to be a promising intervention, particularly effective on the reduction of diastolic BP.

This review examines several aspects during the 1918 influenza pandemic to bring out evidences which might be useful to imagine the possible magnitude of the present coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: In the first part of this review we will examine the origin of the SARS-Coronavirus-2 and 1918 Spanish Influenza Virus and the role played by host and environment in its diffusion. We will also include in our analysis an evaluation of different approaches utilized to restrain the spread of pandemic and to treat infected patients. In the second part, we will try to imagine the magnitude of the present COVID-19 pandemic and the possible measures able to restrain in the present environment its spread. RESULTS: Several factors characterize the outcome in a viral pandemic infection. They include the complete knowledge of the virus, the complete knowledge of the host and of the environment where the host lives and the pandemic develops. CONCLUSION: By comparing the situation seen in 1918 with the current one, we are now in a more favourable position. The experience of the past teaches us that their success is linked to a rapid, constant and lasting application.

MCL1 is a pivotal member of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family, which has been found to play an important role in cell survival, proliferation, differentiation and chemoresistance. Thus, it might be an ideal target for treating oesophageal cancer patients. Although it is known that MCL1 is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, the deubiquitylating enzyme (DUB) responsible for stabilizing MCL1 remains elusive to date. Herein, we demonstrate that Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 20 (USP20) is a novel regulator of the apoptotic signaling pathway. Moreover, USP20 could regulate the deubiquitination of MCL1 to, in turn, regulate its stability. Increased expression of USP20 was correlated with increased levels of MCL1 protein in human patient samples. In addition, depletion of USP20 could increase the polyubiquitination of MCL1, thereby increasing the conversion rate of MCL1 and the sensitivity of cells to chemotherapy. Overall, our findings indicate that the USP20-MCL1 axis might play a key role in the apoptotic signaling pathway.","output":"The deubiquitinating enzyme USP20 regulates the stability of the MCL1 protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transport properties of dense fluids are fundamentally challenging, because the powerful approaches of equilibrium statistical physics cannot be applied.

However, uncertainty remains over how long primary vaccination series remain effective, the ideal timing for booster doses, and the safety of heterologous booster regimens. We aimed to investigate COVID-19 primary vaccine series effectiveness and its waning, and the safety and effectiveness of booster doses, in a UK community setting. METHODS: We used SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates in individuals from a longitudinal, prospective, community-based study (ZOE COVID Study), in which data were self-reported through an app, to assess the effectiveness of three COVID-19 vaccines (ChAdOx1 nCov19 [Oxford-AstraZeneca], BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNtech], and mRNA1273 [Moderna]) against infection in the 8 months after completion of primary vaccination series. In individuals receiving boosters, we investigated vaccine effectiveness and reactogenicity, by assessing 16 self-reported systemic and localised side-effects. We used multivariate Poisson regression models adjusting for confounders to estimate vaccine effectiveness. FINDINGS: We included 620 793 participants who received two vaccine doses (204 731 [330%] received BNT162b2, 405 239 [653%] received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and 10 823 [17%] received mRNA-1273) and subsequently had a SARS-CoV-2 test result between May 23 (chosen to exclude the period of alpha [B.1.1.7] variant dominance) and Nov 23, 2021. 62 172 (100%) vaccinated individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were compared with 40 345 unvaccinated controls (6726 [167%] of whom tested positive). Vaccine effectiveness waned after the second dose: at 5 months, BNT162b2 effectiveness was 821% (95% CI 813C829), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 effectiveness was 757% (749C764), and mRNA-1273 effectiveness was 843% (812C869). Vaccine effectiveness decreased more among individuals aged 55 years or older and among those with comorbidities. 135 932 individuals aged 55 years or older received a booster (2123 [16%] of whom tested positive). Vaccine effectiveness for booster doses in 0C3 months after BNT162b2 primary vaccination was higher than 925%, and effectiveness for heterologous boosters after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was at least 888%. For the booster reactogenicity analysis, in 317 011 participants, the most common systemic symptom was fatigue (in 31 881 [101%] participants) and the most common local symptom was tenderness (in 187 767 [592%]). Systemic side-effects were more common for heterologous schedules (32 632 [179%] of 182 374) than for homologous schedules (17 707 [132%] of 134 637; odds ratio 15, 95% CI 15C16, p<00001). INTERPRETATION: After 5 months, vaccine effectiveness remained high among individuals younger than 55 years. Booster doses restore vaccine effectiveness. Adverse reactions after booster doses were similar to those after the second dose. Homologous booster schedules had fewer reported systemic side-effects than heterologous boosters.

This research paper, anticipates indicative measures that may be taken to revive the economy as well as affected sectors to some extent. First, this paper provides an overview of effect of this lockdown on Indian economy. With no manufacturing activity, it is likely that growth of gross domestic product (GDP) will be slowed down. This will be followed listing of the sectors affected due to COVID-19, which carries the risk of global supply chain disruptions. This includes five import items that are heavily dependent on China - electrical machinery, mechanical appliances, organic chemicals, plastics and surgical instruments C that make up about 28% of Indias import basket could be the mostly affected ones due to this potential shutdown. Next, the paper will present some of the indicative measures to revive the economy and rejuvenate the affected sectors. Protection of workers at the workplace must be given utmost priority followed by adapting to new work arrangements such as work-from-home (WFH). This will be followed by measures to stimulate the economy and labour demand by making and implementing active fiscal policy.

This situation has motivated us not only to look for new approaches to online translator training, which requires a different method than learning foreign languages but in particular to look for new approaches to assess translator performance within online educational environments. Translation quality assessment is a key task, as the concept of quality is closely linked to the concept of optimization. Automatic metrics are very good indicators of quality, but they do not provide sufficient and detailed linguistic information about translations or post-edited machine translations. However, using their residuals, we can identify the segments with the largest distances between the post-edited machine translations and machine translations, which allow us to focus on a more detailed textual analysis of suspicious segments.

Mushrooms have been traditionally used in herbal medicines for many centuries. SCOPE AND APPROACH: There are a variety of medicinal mushrooms mentioned in the current work such as Agaricus, Amanita, Calocybe, Cantharellus, Cordyceps, Coprinus, Cortinarius, Ganoderma, Grifola, Huitlacoche, Hydnum, Lentinus, Morchella, Pleurotus, Rigidoporus, Tremella, Trametes sp., etc., which play a vital role in various diseases because of several metabolic components and nutritional values. Medicinal mushrooms can be identified morphologically on the basis of their size, color (white, black, yellow, brown, cream, pink and purple-brown, etc.), chemical reactions, consistency of the stalk and cap, mode of attachment of the gills to the stalk, and spore color and mass, and further identified at a molecular level by Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) regions of gene sequencing. There are also other methods that have recently begun to be used for the identification of mushrooms such as high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), microscopy, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), DNA sequencing, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), chemical finger printing, ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LCMS-TOF) and high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). Lately, the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) technique is also used for the identification of fungi. KEY FINDING AND CONCLUSION: Medicinal mushrooms possess various biological activities like anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, anti-tumor, anti-viral, anti-parasitic, anti-microbial, hepatoprotective, anti-HIV, anti-diabetic, and many others that will be mentioned in this article.

The panel of evaluation consisted of 94 samples: 69 positive and 25 negative for SARS-CoV-2 by reference RT-PCR. Three extraction-free RT-PCR assays were assessed: (i) PrimeDirect? Probe RT-qPCR Mix (Takara), (ii) PrimeScript?RT-PCR (Takara), and (iii) SARS-CoV-2 SANSURE?BIOTECH Novel Coronavirus (Sansure). The overall sensitivity of PrimeDirect, PrimeScript and Sansure assays was 55.1 %, 69.6 % and 69.6 %, respectively. The sensitivity increased among samples with Ct<30: 91.9 % (n = 34/37), 89.2 % (n = 33/37) and 94.6 % (n = 35/37) for PrimeDirect, PrimeScript and Sansure assays, respectively. The specificity was 88 %, 100 % and 100 % for PrimeDirect, PrimeScript and Sansure assays, respectively. In the present study, we showed a good sensitivity of extraction-free PCR assays, especially for high viral loads (Ct<30), except PrimeDirect that displayed imperfect sensitivity and specificity.

The accepted rule is that mismatches are detrimental as they reduce the hybridization temperatures, yet a more quantitative assessment is rarely performed. METHODS: We calculate the hybridization temperatures of primer/probe sets after aligning to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and non-SARS genomes, considering all possible combinations of single, double and triple consecutive mismatches. We consider the mismatched hybridization temperature within a range of 5 C to the fully matched reference temperature. RESULTS: We obtained the alignments of 19 PCR primers sets that were recently reported for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and to 21665 SARS-CoV-2 genomes as well as 323 genomes of other viruses of the coronavirus family of which 10 are SARS-CoV-1. We find that many incompletely aligned primers become fully aligned to most of the SARS-CoV-2 when mismatches are considered. However, we also found that many cross-align to SARS-CoV-1 and non-SARS genomes. CONCLUSIONS: Some primer/probe sets only align substantially to most SARS-CoV-2 genomes if mismatches are taken into account. Unfortunately, by the same mechanism, almost 75% of these sets also align to some SARS-CoV-1 and non-SARS viruses. It is therefore recommended to consider mismatch hybridization for the design of primers whenever possible, especially to avoid undesired cross-reactivity.","output":"Thermodynamic evaluation of the impact of DNA mismatches in PCR-type SARS-CoV-2 primers and probes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The Window of knowledge in the Contributions of the Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, of the Virtual Health Library on Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine of the Americas (VHL TCIM Americas), is a joint project of the TCIM Americas Network and the Brazilian academic consortium of integrative health CABSIn, coordinated by BIREME/PAHO/WHO.

OBJECTIVE We developed a tracheal tube equipped with two polyvinylchloride (PVC) cuffs with a supplementary port opening between the cuffs through which a continuous positive pressure of 5 cmH2O is provided [double-cuffed PVC (PVCdc)]. We compared this PVCdc with four different cuff types (cylindrical PVC, conical PVC, cylindrical polyurethane and conical polyurethane). DESIGN A comparison study using an in-vitro benchtop model of an artificial rigid trachea. INTERVENTIONS Tracheal tubes were placed in the artificial trachea. Both cuffs were kept inflated at 25 cmH2O. Total 3 ml dyed water was placed above the cuff and leakage recorded under static and dynamic [5 cmH2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) alone or positive pressure ventilation plus 5 cmH2O PEEP] conditions. At the end of the dynamic experiments, PEEP was zeroed (PEEP alone) or the tracheal tubes were disconnected from the ventilator (positive pressure ventilation plus PEEP). RESULTS In the static model, leakage flows [medians (range)] were 9.8 (6.2 to 20) for the cylindrical PVC, 1.3 (0.2 to 3.8) for the conical PVC, 0.03 (0.007 to 0.1) for the cylindrical polyurethane, 0.04 (0.003 to 0.2) for the conical polyurethane and 0.0 (0.0 to 0.0) ml min for the PVCdc cuff (P < 0.001, PVCdc vs. all other cuffs). In the dynamic setting, no leakage was detected for up to 60 min with any of the cuffs studied. Loss of PEEP or tracheal tube disconnection resulted in dye inflow alongside all cuffs except for the PVCdc (P < 0.001, PVCdc vs. all other cuffs). CONCLUSION A 'pressure seal' incorporated in a double-cuffed tracheal tube prevented fluid passage into the lower airways. Clinically, this may translate into absence of inflow of bacteriologically contaminated secretions into the lungs and thus a lower incidence of ventilator-associated infection.","output":"A newly developed tracheal tube offering 'pressurised sealing' outperforms currently available tubes in preventing cuff leakage: A benchtop study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors regret a mistake in Table 1.","output":"Correction to: Phenotypic characteristics and prognosis of inpatients with COVID-19 and diabetes: the CORONADO study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cultural economy poses a significant threat to inclusion and workforce diversity.

Periods of quarantine and inactivity therefore pose limitations on lifestyle modifications and potentially impact both liver-related and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes. This study aims to identify the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and alterations in healthcare access on patients with NAFLD. Methods: This study utilized a prospectively enrolled cohort of patients with NAFLD seen at the Innovative Center for Health and Nutrition in Gastroenterology (ICHANGE), a multidisciplinary clinic which targets treatment of obesity and related diseases in New York. Patients included had a comprehensive initial evaluation during the pre-pandemic period within six months of the first COVID-19 case at our institution (October 1, 2019 to March 3, 2020) and had follow-up with repeat laboratory data. Studied outcomes included changes in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), metabolic markers (hemoglobin A1c and lipids), weight and body composition. 16 patients had follow-up HRQOL data measured by the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ) and Short-Form 26 (SF-36) Health Survey. Secondary analysis compared those with at least three provider visits to those with fewer to evaluate for impact of medical care during this period. Analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Mann-Whitney U test. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Weill Cornell Medicine. Results: Of the 29 patients included patients, the mean age was 52 years and pre-pandemic body mass index 33.54 kg/m2 (Table 1). Overall, there was no significant change in weight during this period (p= 0.07), though skeletal muscle and truncal fat mass both decreased (p=0.02). Hemoglobin A1c and AST decreased upon follow-up (p=0.002 and p=0.04, respectively), though there was no significant change in ALT or lipids. There was an increase in both CLDQ and SF-36 total and composite activity and emotional scores though not to a significant degree, and was irrespective of the number of provider visits (Table 2). Conclusion: This cohort of motivated patients with NAFLD following within a resource abundant multidisciplinary clinic showed mild improvement in select biomarkers and body composition, though there was no significant improvement in the remainder of objective measures to the degree expected, which may have been limited by the COVID-19 pandemic. Though not significant in this cohort, the overall trend in improvement in HRQOL highlights the importance of ongoing targeted care within this at-risk group.

Material and methods. The collection of material was carried out as part of the study One-year cardiovascular observation of patients after COVID-19-associated pneumonia. The study included 103 patients aged 18 to 85 years (mean age 46.615.8 years) who had undergone confirmed COVID-19-associated pneumonia 3 months2 weeks after discharge from the hospital including 51 (49.1%) woman. The GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales were used to assess the signs of anxiety and depression, respectively. The minimum value of anxiety and depression was considered a total score of 5 points. Signs of stress were assessed using Stress Severity Scale 10;the minimum threshold value was 30 point. Results. Signs of anxiety and depression were found in approximately the same number of patients (29.1 and 27.2%, respectively), a combination of signs of anxiety and depression  in 18.4% of patients, stress  in 8.7% of patients. In terms of clinical characteristics, no significant differences were found between the groups of men and women. The prevalence of depression signs differed significantly depending on gender: significantly more often in women (p=0.023).

Logistic regression analysis showed that female gender increases the likelihood of depression by 2.83 times (95% CI 1.35-7.08). Despite the fact that there were no differences in gender in assessing the prevalence of anxiety (18.4 and 10.7% for men and women, respectively;p=0.072) when comparing the values of the median scores of the GAD-7 questionnaire in groups of men and women, the difference was statistically significant (1.00 [0;4.00] and 3.00 [2.00;7.00], respectively;p=0.001). Signs of stress among married people were less common compared with unmarried (2.9% versus 5.8%;p=0.037). Conclusion. Signs of anxiety or depression are characteristic of more than a quarter of patients who have had proven COVID-19-associated pneumonia 3 months after discharge from the hospital. Women experience symptoms of depression 3 times more often than men do. Unmarried patients tend to experience more stress.

This study aimed to explore the case, test, vaccination, positivity rate and Stringency index of countries by economic ranking of countries. Methods: We received open access data from Our World in Data. Data from 210 countries were available. Countries (n=100) without data related to testing, which is a key variable in the present study, were excluded. Consequently, data from 110 countries were used, and the analysis period was set between January 22, 2020 (when COVID-19 was first officially reported) and December 28, 2021. All analyses were stratified by year and the World Bank income group. To analyze the associations among the major variables, we used a longitudinal fixed-effects model. Results: New case per million was similar in lower-middle income (LMI), upper-middle income (UMI) and higher income (HI) countries but lower in lower income (LI) countries. The number of new COVID-19 test were reduced in HI and LMI countries but similar in UMI and LI countries. Stringency Index was negligible in LI countries and similar in LMI, UMI and HI countries.

Various factors have been found to influence the hedonic eating experience and thereby influence eating behaviour, and each factor can be regarded a piece that contributes to parts of the total picture of the hedonic response to food. As a result, the literature on the hedonic response to food-related experiences is comprehensive, but at the same time rather fragmented; and importantly, it is not clear how individuals/segments differ in key drivers of their hedonic experience and the extent to which food pleasure is perceived. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework for the development of a scale (self-report questionnaire) to measure the qualitative and quantitative aspects of food-related pleasure, the Food Pleasure Scale. We introduce the concept of (an)hedonia and scales developed in the past for its measurement, identify the spectrum of characteristics influencing food-related pleasure and explain the relevance of developing such a scale. Based on this theoretical framework, a strategy for the development of the Food Pleasure Scale is proposed.","output":"A Conceptual Framework for Multi-Dimensional Measurements of Food Related PleasureThe Food Pleasure Scale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 poses a significant threat to human health. In this study, recent research on the characteristics of expiratory particles and flow is reviewed, with a special focus on different respiratory activities, to provide guidance for reducing the viral infection risk in the built environment. Furthermore, environmental influence on particle evaporation, dispersion, and virus viability after exhalation and the current methods for infection risk assessment are reviewed. Finally, we summarize promising control strategies against infectious expiratory particles. The results show that airborne transmission is a significant viral transmission route, both in short and long ranges, from infected individuals. Relative humidity affects the evaporation and trajectories of middle-sized droplets most, and temperature accelerates the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 both on surfaces and in aerosols. Future research is needed to improve infection risk models to better predict the infection potential of different transmission routes. Moreover, further quantitative studies on the expiratory flow features after wearing a mask are needed. Systematic investigations and the design of advanced air distribution methods, portable air cleaners, and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation systems, which have shown high efficacy in removing contaminants, are required to better control indoor viral infection.","output":"Recent research on expiratory particles in respiratory viral infection and control strategies: A review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary International collaboration and understanding is becoming increasingly important as we face a soaring number of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.

Our study aimed to assess (1) atrial fibrillation (AF) related LA morpho-functional remodeling using 3D STE and (2) value of LA function parameters in identifying paroxysmal AF (PAF). METHODS: One hundred thirty-nine PAF, 109 persistent AF (Per-AF) and 59 non-AF subjects underwent 3D STE. LA phasic volumes and total LA emptying fraction (LAEF) were obtained and used to calculate passive (pLAEF) and active LA emptying fraction (aLAEF) based on atrial contraction. LA longitudinal and circumferential strain representing reservoir (LASr/LASrc), conduit (LAScd/LAScdc) and pump (LASct/LASctc) function were also assessed. RESULTS: 3D STE was found to have good reproducibility. Increase of LA volumes and decrease of parameters representing LA reservoir and pump function were independently associated with AF as well as AF burden. The correlations between LA emptying fraction and LA circumferential strain representing the same function were always stronger than those with LA longitudinal strain (p < 0.001). Minimal LA volume, LAEF, aLAEF, LASrc and LASctc can be used to accurately differentiate PAF from non-AF subjects (AUC > 0.8) with great sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing LA remodeling in AF using 3D STE was feasible. AF and AF burden were independently associated with LA enlargement and impairment of reservoir and pump function but not conduit function.

Rapid antigen detection tests are less expensive and easier to implement, but their diagnostic performance has been questioned compared to reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Here, we evaluate the performance of the Standard Q COVID-19 antigen test for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection and predicting contagiousness compared to RT-PCR and viral culture, respectively. The antigen test was 100.0% specific but only 40.9% sensitive for diagnosing infection compared to RT-PCR. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 contagiousness is highly unlikely with a negative antigen test since it exhibited a negative predictive value of 99.9% compared to viral culture. Furthermore, a cycle threshold (C(T)) value of 18.1 in RT-PCR was shown to be the one that best predicts contagiousness (area under the curve [AUC], 97.6%). Thus, screening people with antigen testing is a good approach to prevent SARS-CoV-2 contagion and allow returning to daily activities. IMPORTANCE The importance of our results is the excellent agreement between the Standard Q COVID-19 antigen test and the viral culture, indicating that it is important as a marker of contagiousness. Due to its high positive predictive value in situations of a high prevalence of infection, positive results do not require confirmation with another test. Likewise, its high negative predictive value for contagiousness makes possible to use this test as a criterion to discharge patients in isolation and screen people moving into environments that could facilitate the transmission of the virus.

All ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Few studies had reported milder course in children however, severe course of illness has been reported. We aimed to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 in pediatric patients including diagnostic findings and therapeutic interventions in sever disease manifestation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 742 patients with SARS-CoV-2 proven infection at King Abdullah Specialist Childrens Hospital, from April 2020 and July 2020. Inpatients, outpatient, including those with sever manifestation treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were included. We collected data including demographic data, comorbidities, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Among of 742 patients, 71 (9.6%) were hospitalized. The median age of patients was 75 months old and 53.6 were male. A total of 461 (62.1%) had close contact with confirmed cases, 45 (6.1%) had no contact history, and 236 (31.8%) with unknown exposure risk. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (32.5%), respiratory symptoms (21%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (10.3%). Among the entire cohort, 7 patients were admitted to PICU with COVID-19 related symptoms, five patients diagnosed with MIS-C, one patient with Kawasaki, and one patient with pneumonia. All patients received supportive therapy, no antiviral treatment had been used however, in MIS-C patients IVIG had been given to all patients, five patients received Anakinra; and one patient received tocilizumab. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are less likely to develop symptomatic or serious diseases. Among symptomatic children, the most common clinical features were fever and respiratory symptoms followed by gastrointestinal manifestations. The majority of infected children have reported contact with an infected individual. MIS-C associated with COVID-19 is a severe presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection and of a major concern as an overlapping features with other diseases could happen, making the diagnosis challenging.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Children, Clinical Characteristics, Diagnostic Findings and Therapeutic Interventions at a Tertiary Care Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Document: The pandemic resulting from the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, could become a pivotal event in world history Long before the outbreak, the rise of China was gathering force, raising the specter of major structural changes in international politics The pandemic is likely to accelerate some trends that were already underway while introducing new issues China's response to the coronavirus - from the standpoints of public health, domestic politics, the economy, and foreign policy - promises to have important geopolitical ramifications China's prestige has taken a hit, but its leaders may nevertheless view the crisis as an opportunity to pursue their foreign policy ambitions In Europe, China's image suffered as the Chinese government attempted to divert blame and claim credit for its handling of the crisis The pandemic has also contributed to growing tensions in US-China relations, raising questions about the appropriate European response COVID-19 (Disease);International relations","output":"Coronavirus: A Double-Edged Sword for China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"GetSetUp started as a technology learning platform for older adults.

However, it is not yet clear whether a telemedicine smoking cessation programme is helpful for nicotine-dependent people who use HTPs. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness of a telemedicine smoking cessation programme for nicotine-dependent tobacco product users, comparing short- and long-term continuous abstinence rates (CAR) from 9 to 24 weeks (CAR9-24) and 9 to 52 weeks (CAR9-52). We divided programme participants into 1) exclusively cigarette users, 2) exclusively HTP users, and 3) dual users. Using logistic regression with inverse probability weighting, an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for CAR was calculated to compare the differences among the three groups. Results: We analysed 733 telemedicine smoking cessation programme participants (exclusively cigarette users, 52%; exclusively HTP users, 31%; and dual-users, 16%) dating August 2018 to October 2020. HTP users had higher CARs than the exclusively cigarettes group in CAR9-24 (aOR, 1.12; CI, 1.02-1.23; p=0.02) and CAR9-52 (aOR 1.09; CI, 0.99-1.19; p=0.08).

However, whether obesity is a risk factor in cancer pts remains unknown. Herein, we have conducted a systematic review/meta-analysis of obesity and all-cause mortality in cancer pts with COVID-19. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines,a systematic search of PubMed and Embase as well as major conference proceedings (ASCO/ESMO/AACR) was conducted for publications from inception to 14 January 2020. Observational studies that reported all-cause mortality in cancer pts with lab confirmation or clinical diagnosis of COVID19 and BMI (obese (>30 kg/m2 ) vs. non-obese) were included in the analysis. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated with the fixed-effects model based on low heterogeneity. Small sample publication bias was evaluated using the Begg's Funnel Plot and Egger's test. Results: After reviewing 3387 studies,3 retrospective cohort studies of 419 obese and 1694 non-obese cancer pts (N=2117) with COVID-19 in both inpatient/outpatient settings that reported outcomes based on obesity were found. The 3 studies were conducted multi-nationally in North America, in France, and in the Netherlands respectively. The median ages of the cohorts ranged 66-68. All studies included various cancers of various stages and were of high quality per Newcastle Ottawa scale (scores 7-9). Fixed effects metaanalysis showed no association between obesity and all-cause mortality (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.74- 1.23) in cancer pts with COVID-19. Heterogeneity was low (I2= 33%). No significant funnel plot asymmetry was detected per Egger's test (P=0.2273). The reported OR of each study is outlined in the table. Conclusions: In contrast to the general population, our analysis reveals that obesity is not associated with increased all-cause mortality in cancer pts with COVID-19. Limitations of this study include a limited number of included studies, reliance on retrospective studies, non-use of ethnicityspecific WHO BMI criteria, and limited granularity of the study-reported BMI.

Moyamoya disease (MMD) with autoimmune disease is a rare entity and usually presents with intracranial hemorrhage in adults. PATIENT CONCERNS: We reported a 40-year-old female patient with Sjogren disease and autoimmune thyroiditis, who had received the second dose of Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccination. Three days later, she presented with left intraventricular and intracerebral hemorrhage as a complication. DIAGNOSIS: After a series of diagnostic workups, left intracranial hemorrhage was associated with MMD. INTERVENTIONS: Emergent external ventricular drainage and subsequent stereotactic evacuation of hematoma with insertion of intracranial pressure monitoring were performed. OUTCOMES: Under the care of the neurocritical care team, her physical condition improved gradually. The neurological sequelae was noted by defects of cognitive function, apraxia, agnosia, and impaired executive function. She was discharged after eight weeks with a follow-up in the vascular neurology clinic planning for performing revascularization.

Moreover, Artificial Intelligence has been adopted in many medical applications to diagnose many diseases, even baffling experienced doctors. Therefore, this survey paper explores the methodologies proposed that can aid doctors and researchers in early and inexpensive methods of diagnosis of the disease. Most developing countries have difficulties carrying out tests using the conventional manner, but a significant way can be adopted with Machine and Deep Learning. On the other hand, the access to different types of medical images has motivated the researchers. As a result, a mammoth number of techniques are proposed.

In Ethiopia, more specifically in the capital city of Addis Ababa, a sudden increase in the number of confirmed positive cases in high risk groups of the community has been observed over the last few weeks of the first case. Therefore, this study aims to assess knowledge, practices and associated factors that can contribute to the prevention of COVID-19 among high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. Methods A cross-sectional in-person survey (n=6007) was conducted from 14-30 April 2020 following a prioritization within high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. The study area targeted bus stations, public transport drivers, air transport infrastructure, health facilities, public and private pharmacies, hotels, government-owned and private banks, telecom centers, trade centers, orphanages, elderly centers, prison, prisons and selected slum areas where the people live in a crowed. A questionnaire comprised of four sections (demographics, knowledge, practice and reported symptoms) was used for data collection. The outcomes (knowledge in the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 and practices) were measured using four items. Multivariable logistic regression was applied with adjustment for potential confounding. Results About half (48%, 95% CI: 46,49) of the study participants had poor knowledge on the transmission mode of COVID-19 whereas six out of ten (60%, 95% CI: 58,61) had good knowledge on prevention methods for COVID-19. The practice of preventive measures towards COVID-19 was found to be low (49%, 95% CI: 48,50). Factors that influence knowledge on COVID-19 transmission mechanisms were female gender, older age, occupation (health care and grocery worker), lower income and the use of the 8335 free call centre. Older age, occupation (being a health worker), middle income, experience of respiratory illness and religion were significantly associated with being knowledgeable about the prevention methods for COVID-19. The study found that occupation, religion, income, knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 were associated with the practice of precautionary measures towards COVID-19. Conclusion The study highlighted that there was moderate knowledge about transmission modes and prevention mechanism. Similarly, there was moderate practice of measures that contribute towards the prevention of COVID-19 among these priority high-risk communities of Addis Ababa. There is an urgent need to fill the knowledge gap in terms of transmission mode and prevention methods of COVID-19 to improve preventions practices and control the spread of COVID-19.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of CT examinations in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection yielded 103 instances. An age- and gender-matched cohort of patients without COVID-19 was found. CT examinations were evaluated for peripancreatic stranding or edema, fluid collection, or necrosis, without any other explanation. Depicted pulmonary parenchyma was evaluated for possible COVID-19-related changes. Clinical and laboratory data were retrieved from the clinical database. RESULTS: Peripancreatic fat stranding (n = 8) or fluid collection (n = 2) without any other cause was found in 10 (10%) patients. Abdominal complaints were reported in 4 (40%) patients. Elevated serum amylase or lipase levels were documented in 5 (50%) patients who also satisfied the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis. From the study sample of 103 patients with COVID-19, pulmonary parenchyma was depicted in 102 (99%), and from these, 57 (55%) had an evidence of pulmonary changes compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia. This proportion was not significantly different between patients with and without peripancreatic changes (p = 0.35).

Several empirical studies included in this review reported a sudden upward change in screen time across different population groups. A higher number of people with increased screen time compared to their pre-pandemic state and prolonged duration of total screen time substantiates such assertions. The available evidence suggests that screen time is associated with obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, myopia, depression, sleep disorders, and several non-communicable diseases. This elevated burden of diseases is more prevalent among individuals who have sedentary lifestyles and other unhealthy behaviors that are likely to increase during quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19. Hence, it is critical to assess the adverse health outcomes that may appear as long-term consequences of such behavior. Researchers and practitioners need to revisit the available guidelines and incorporate evidence-based interventions for preventing unhealthy screen time among the affected individuals. Such interventions may address harmful behaviors associated with screen time and promote active lifestyles that may improve health across populations during and after this pandemic.","output":"Digital screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic: a public health concern (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Following stringent social distancing measures, some European countries are beginning to report a slowed or negative rate of growth of daily case numbers testing positive for the novel coronavirus The notion that the first wave of infection is close to its peak begs the question of whether future peaks or second waves are likely We sought to determine the current size of the effective (i e susceptible) population for seven European countriesto estimate immunity levels following this first wave Methods: We used Bayesian model inversion to estimate epidemic parameters from the reported case and death rates from seven countries using data from late January 2020 to April 5th 2020 Two distinct generative model types were employed: first a continuous time dynamical-systems implementation of a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, and second a partially observable Markov Decision Process or hidden Markov model (HMM) implementation of an SEIR model Both models parameterise the size of the initial susceptible population (S0), as well as epidemic parameters Results: Both models recapitulated the dynamics of transmissions and disease as given by case and death rates Crucially, maximum a posteriori estimates of S0 for each country indicated effective population sizes of below 20% (of total population size), under both the continuous time and HMM models Using a Bayesian weighted average across all seven countries and both models, we estimated that 6 4% of the total population would be immune From the two models, the maximum percentage of the effective population was estimated at 19 6% of the total population for the UK, 16 7% for Ireland, 11 4% for Italy, 12 8% for Spain, 18 8% for France, 4 7% for Germany and 12 9% for Switzerland Conclusion: Our results indicate that after the current wave, a large proportion of the total population will remain without immunity","output":"Estimating required lockdown cycles before immunity to SARS-CoV-2: model-based analyses of susceptible population sizes, S0, in seven European countries, including the UK and Ireland [version 1;peer review: awaiting peer review]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The endoplasmic reticulum plays an important role in many cellular processes, which includes protein synthesis, folding and post-translational processing of newly synthesized proteins. It is also the site for quality control of misfolded proteins and entry point of extracellular proteins to the secretory pathway. Hence at any given point of time, endoplasmic reticulum contains two different cohorts of proteins, (i) proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum-specific function, which reside in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, called as endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins and (ii) proteins which are in process of moving to the extracellular space. Thus, endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins must somehow be distinguished from newly synthesized secretory proteins, which pass through the endoplasmic reticulum on their way out of the cell. Approximately only 50% of the proteins used in this study as training data had endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, which shows that these signals are not essentially present in all endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins. This also strongly indicates the role of additional factors in retention of endoplasmic reticulum-specific proteins inside the endoplasmic reticulum. METHODS: This is a support vector machine based method, where we had used different forms of protein features as inputs for support vector machine to develop the prediction models. During training leave-one-out approach of cross-validation was used. Maximum performance was obtained with a combination of amino acid compositions of different part of proteins. RESULTS: In this study, we have reported a novel support vector machine based method for predicting endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins, named as ERPred. During training we achieved a maximum accuracy of 81.42% with leave-one-out approach of cross-validation. When evaluated on independent dataset, ERPred did prediction with sensitivity of 72.31% and specificity of 83.69%. We have also annotated six different proteomes to predict the candidate endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins in them. A webserver, ERPred, was developed to make the method available to the scientific community, which can be accessed at http://proteininformatics.org/mkumar/erpred/index.html. DISCUSSION: We found that out of 124 proteins of the training dataset, only 66 proteins had endoplasmic reticulum retention signals, which shows that these signals are not an absolute necessity for endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins to remain inside the endoplasmic reticulum. This observation also strongly indicates the role of additional factors in retention of proteins inside the endoplasmic reticulum. Our proposed predictor, ERPred, is a signal independent tool. It is tuned for the prediction of endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins, even if the query protein does not contain specific ER-retention signal.","output":"Prediction of endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins using fragmented amino acid composition and support vector machine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Fellow Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Pneumomediastinum is a rare entity in viral pneumonias. Only about 1% of patients in the ARDSNet trials developed pneumomediastinum as an early complication in the first four days of mechanical ventilation. With SARS-CoV-1, there were reports of late development of barotrauma complications, but there are very few case reports of pneumomediastinum in the current pandemic. We present a case of a tension pneumomediastinum and pneumoperitoneum as a complication of SARS-CoV-2. CASE PRESENTATION: An 86-year-old female was hospitalized for respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. She was treated and discharged to a nursing facility requiring supplemental oxygen. Two days later, she developed worsening respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation with pressure-regulated volume control mode. CT imaging on admission revealed only viral pneumonia changes. Despite open lung ventilation strategy, she required plateau pressures of 32cmH20 to maintain adequate gas exchange. Hospital day 10, her respiratory failure worsened with increased plateau pressures of 40cmH20 despite no changes in her ventilator settings. She required paralysis and proning at that time with no changes on chest x-ray and no abnormalities were appreciated on exam other than developing ventilator dyssynchrony. She deteriorated further on hospital day 15 with development of shock and chest x-ray demonstrating possible free air in the mediastinum and abdomen. CT confirmed massive amounts of intraperitoneal, retroperitoneal, and mediastinal air without pneumothorax. Given her poor prognosis, she was transitioned to comfort measures and expired. DISCUSSION: COVID-19-related pneumomediastinum is thought to develop from diffuse alveolar injury and fibrosis leading to increased alveolar pressures, which ultimately rupture. Barotrauma from mechanical ventilation exacerbates this. Patients may be asymptomatic or they may have signs of tachycardia, tachypnea, and/or subcutaneous emphysema with upper chest and neck swelling. Tension pneumomediastinum is an exceedingly rare but life threatening development in critically ill patients. The development of pneumomediastinum related to SARS-CoV-2 seems to occur later in the disease course when compared to ARDSNet trials, however this may be similar to reports in SARS-CoV-1. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the rare occurrence of pneumomediastinum in viral pneumonia, providers should be aware of this potential late complication in SARS-CoV-2 and take measures for prevention and early recognition. Without adjusting treatment, tension pneumomediastinum may develop and lead to a significant increase in mortality. REFERENCE #1: Chu CM, et al.

DESIGN: Single-center, observational. SETTING: Four coronavirus disease 2019 designated ICUs at an urban Greek teaching hospital. PATIENTS: All adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 consecutively admitted to ICU during the first (n = 50) and second (n = 212) waves of the pandemic. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The percentage of intubated ICU patients dropped from 82% during the first wave to 66% during the second wave (p = 0.042). However, the absolute number of intubated ICU patients was lower during the first than the second wave (41 vs 140 patients). ICU or hospital mortality of intubated patients increased from 39% during the first wave to 60% during the second wave (p = 0.028). The binary logistic regression for hospital mortality as the dependent variable in intubated patients and covariates the age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, cardiovascular comorbidity, lactate, positive end-expiratory pressure, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and wave, distinguished only Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (odds ratio, 1.40 with 95% CI, 1.141.72; p = 0.001) as the sole independent predictor of hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological adaptations and other measures may have led to fewer intubations over time. However, these changes do not seem to be translated into improved outcomes of intubated patients. Perhaps the same change in the use of drugs and protocols that could cause fewer intubations of ICU patients might be a reason of increased mortality in those patients who are eventually intubated. Furthermore, the relative staff inexperience and overall increase in patients comorbidities during the second wave could have contributed to increased Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and mortality of intubated patients.","output":"Fewer Intubations but Higher Mortality Among Intubated Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients During the Second Than the First Wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Consumer tests are classified in terms of the location of testing as laboratory tests or central location tests (CLTs) and home use tests (HUTs).

In order to investigate the error occurrence and efforts required to minimize errors, three groups of tests were designed differing time and order control and evaluation was conducted using six snacks with texture differences. Errors related to time, order, and consumer or sample number were higher for more controlled conditions, however, most errors were recoverable using identification information except for cases of no response. Additionally, consumers preferred to consume all snacks in the evening at home, which differed from the typical 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. evaluation time in CLT. However, the timing differed for consumers with self-reported snacking time. The research title that included the term home might have influenced the participants choice of location for evaluation.

Researchers and policymakers have been working strenuously to end the pandemic completely. Methodology/ Principal Findings: Infectious disease dynamics could be well-explained at an individual level with established contact networks and disease models that represent the behaviour of the infection. Hence, an Agent-Based Model, SHIVIR (Susceptible, Infected, Admitted, ICU, Ventilator, Recovered, Immune) that can assess the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and the effects of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) was developed. Two models were developed using to test the synthetic populations of Rangareddy, a district in Telangana state, and the state itself respectively. NPI such as lockdowns, masks, and social distancing along with the effect of post-recovery immunity were tested across scenarios. The actual and forecast curves were plotted till the unlock phase began in India. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error of scenario MD100I180 was 6.41 percent while those of 3 other scenarios were around 10 percent each. Since the model anticipated lifting of lockdowns that would increase the contact rate proportionately, the forecasts exceeded the actual estimates. Some possible reasons for the difference are discussed. Conclusions: Models like SHIVIR that employ a bottom-up Agent-Based Modelling are more suitable to investigate various aspects of infectious diseases owing to their ability to hold details of each individual in the population. Also, the scalability and reproducibility of the model allow modifications to variables, disease model, agent attributes, etc. to provide localized estimates across different places.","output":"SHIVIR - An Agent-Based Model to assess the transmission of COVID-19 in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Streaming data routinely generated by mobile phones, social networks, e-commerce, and electronic health records present new opportunities for near real-time surveillance of the impact of an intervention on an outcome of interest via causal inference methods. However, as data grow rapidly in volume and velocity, storing and combing data become increasingly challenging. The amount of time and effort spent to update analyses can grow exponentially, which defeats the purpose of instantaneous surveillance. Data sharing barriers in multi-center studies bring additional challenges to rapid signal detection and update. It is thus time to turn static causal inference to online causal learning that can incorporate new information as it becomes available without revisiting prior observations. In this paper, we present a framework for online estimation and inference of treatment effects leveraging a series of datasets that arrive sequentially without storing or re-accessing individual-level raw data. We establish estimation consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed framework for online causal inference. In particular, our framework is robust to biased data batches in the sense that the proposed online estimator is asymptotically unbiased as long as the pooled data is a random sample of the target population regardless of whether each data batch is. We also provide an R package for analyzing streaming observational data that enjoys great computation efficiency compared to existing software packages for offline analyses. Our proposed methods are illustrated with extensive simulations and an application to sequential monitoring of adverse events post COVID-19 vaccine.","output":"Online Causal Inference with Application to Near Real-Time Post-Market Vaccine Safety Surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for depression, anxiety, and insomnia. eHealth interventions provide a promising and accessible treatment alternative to face-to-face interventions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the effectiveness of eHealth interventions in preventing and treating depression, anxiety, and insomnia during pregnancy. Secondary aims are to identify demographic and intervention moderators of effectiveness. METHODS: A total of 5 databases (PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and Cochrane) were searched from inception to May 2021. Terms related to eHealth, pregnancy, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), depression, anxiety, and insomnia were included. RCTs and pilot RCTs were included if they reported an eHealth intervention for the prevention or treatment of depression, anxiety, or insomnia in pregnant women. Study screening, data extractions, and quality assessment were conducted independently by 2 reviewers from an 8-member research team (KAS, PRS, Hangsel Sanguino, Roshni Sohail, Jasleen Kaur, Songyang (Mark) Jin, Makayla Freeman, and Beatrice Valmana). Random-effects meta-analyses of pooled effect sizes were conducted to determine the effect of eHealth interventions on prenatal mental health. Meta-regression analyses were conducted to identify potential moderators. RESULTS: In total, 17 studies were included in this review that assessed changes in depression (11/17, 65%), anxiety (10/17, 59%), and insomnia (3/17, 18%). Several studies included both depression and anxiety symptoms as outcomes (7/17, 41%). The results indicated that during pregnancy, eHealth interventions showed small effect sizes for preventing and treating symptoms of anxiety and depression and a moderate effect size for treating symptoms of insomnia. With the exception of intervention type for the outcome of depressive symptoms, where mindfulness interventions outperformed other intervention types, no significant moderators were detected. CONCLUSIONS: eHealth interventions are an accessible and promising resource for treating symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia during pregnancy. However, more research is necessary to identify ways to increase the efficacy of eHealth interventions for this population.

Our objective was to longitudinally assess persistence of symptoms and clusters of symptoms up to 12 months after hospitalization for COVID-19, and to assess determinants of the main persistent symptoms. Methods: In this multicenter prospective cohort study patients with COVID-19 are followed up for 2 years with measurements at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after hospital discharge. Here, we present interim results regarding persistent symptoms up to 12 months. Symptoms were clustered into physical, respiratory, cognitive and fatigue symptoms. Results: We included 492 patients; mean age was 60.2 years, 335 (68.1%) males, median length of hospital stay 11 days. At 3 months after discharge 97.0% of the patients had at least 1 persisting symptom, this declined to 95.5% and 92.0% at 6 and 12 months, respectively (p=0.010). Muscle weakness, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and memory and concentration problems were the most prevalent symptoms with rates over 50% during follow-up. Over time, muscle weakness, hair loss, and exertional dyspnea decreased significantly (p<0.001), while other symptoms, such as fatigue, concentration and memory problems, anosmia, and ageusia persisted. Symptoms from the physical and respiratory cluster declined significantly over time, in contrast to symptoms from the fatigue and cognitive clusters. Female gender was the most important predictor of persistent symptoms and co-occurrence of symptoms from all clusters. Shorter hospital stay and treatment with steroids were related with decreased muscle weakness; comorbidity and being employed were related with increased fatigue; and shorter hospital stay and comorbidity were related with memory problems. Conclusion: The majority of patients experienced COVID-19 sequelae up to 12 months after hospitalization. Whereas physical and respiratory symptoms showed slow gradual decline, fatigue and cognitive symptoms did not evidently resolve over time.

The increasing number of cases of confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China is striking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between chest CT findings and the clinical conditions of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease). RESULTS. Patients 21-50 years old accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). Lesions present on CT images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83 [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 [54.5%]) and multifocal (55 [54.5%]). Patients in the emergency group were older than those in the non-emergency group. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and CT involvement score aided in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease. CONCLUSION. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases and in evaluation of the severity and extent of disease.

The data on transmission dynamics of IBV in China are limited. The complete genome sequences of 212 IBV isolates in China during 1985C2020 were analyzed as well as the characteristics of the phylogenetic tree, recombination events, dN/dS ratios, temporal dynamics, and phylogeographic relationships. The LX4 type (GI-19) was found to have the highest dN/dS ratios and has been the most dominant genotype since 1999, and the Taiwan-I type (GI-7) and New type (GVI-1) showed an increasing trend. A total of 59 recombinants were identified, multiple recombination events between the field and vaccine strains were found in 24 isolates, and the 4/91-type (GI-13) isolates were found to be more prone to being involved in the recombination. Bayesian phylogeographic analyses indicated that the Chinese IBVs originated from Liaoning province in the early 1900s. The LX4-type viruses were traced back to Liaoning province in the late 1950s and had multiple transmission routes in China and two major transmission routes in the world. Viral phylogeography identified three spread regions for IBVs (including LX4 type) in China: Northeastern China (Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and Jilin), north and central China (Beijing, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, and Jiangsu), and Southern China (Guangxi and Guangdong). Shandong has been the epidemiological center of IBVs (including LX4 type) in China. Overall, our study highlighted the reasons why the LX4-type viruses had become the dominant genotype and its origin and transmission routes, providing more targeted strategies for the prevention and control of IB in China.","output":"Phylogenetic and Spatiotemporal Analyses of the Complete Genome Sequences of Avian Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus in China During 1985C2020: Revealing Coexistence of Multiple Transmission Chains and the Origin of LX4-Type Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) are the primary forms of inorganic nitrogen (N) taken up by plant roots, and a lack of these N sources commonly limits plant growth. To better understand how NO3- and NH4+ differentially affect root system architecture, we analyzed the expression profiles of microRNAs and their targets in poplar roots treated with three forms of nitrogen S1 (NO3-), S2 (NH4NO3, normal), and S3 (NH4+) via RNA sequencing. RESULTS: The results revealed a total of 709 miRNAs. Among them, 57 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs and 28 differentially expressed miRNA-target pairs showed correlated expression profiles in S1 vs. S2. Thirty-six significantly differentially expressed miRNAs and 12 differentially expressed miRNA-target pairs showed correlated expression profiles in S3 vs. S2. In particular, NFYA3, a target of upregulated ptc-miR169i and ptc-miR169b, was downregulated in S1 vs. S2, while NFYA1, a target of upregulated ptc-miR169b, was downregulated in S3 vs. S2 and probably played an important role in the changes in root morphology observed when the poplar plants were treated with different N forms. Furthermore, the miRNA-target pairs ptc-miR169i/b-D6PKL2, ptc-miR393a-5p-AFB2, ptc-miR6445a-NAC14, ptc-miR172d-AP2, csi-miR396a-5p_R + 1_1ss21GA-EBP1, ath-miR396b-5p_R + 1-TPR4, and ptc-miR166a/b/c-ATHB-8 probably contributed to the changes in root morphology observed when poplar plants were treated with different N forms.

However, there is only limited knowledge concerning the impact of chatbots at the individual, group, and societal level. Furthermore, a number of challenges remain to be resolved before the potential of chatbots can be fully realized. In response, chatbots have emerged as a substantial research area in recent years. To help advance knowledge in this emerging research area, we propose a research agenda in the form of future directions and challenges to be addressed by chatbot research. This proposal consolidates years of discussions at the CONVERSATIONS workshop series on chatbot research. Following a deliberative research analysis process among the workshop participants, we explore future directions within six topics of interest: (a) users and implications, (b) user experience and design, (c) frameworks and platforms, (d) chatbots for collaboration, (e) democratizing chatbots, and (f) ethics and privacy. For each of these topics, we provide a brief overview of the state of the art, discuss key research challenges, and suggest promising directions for future research.

Such parameters are typically estimated by measuring various characteristics (such as the number of infected and recovered individuals) of the infected populations over time. However, these measurements also incur certain costs, depending on the population being tested and the times at which the tests are administered. We thus formulate the epidemic parameter estimation problem as an optimization problem, where the goal is to either minimize the total cost spent on collecting measurements, or to optimize the parameter estimates while remaining within a measurement budget. We show that these problems are NP-hard to solve in general, and then propose approximation algorithms with performance guarantees.

The current study aims to determine the existing knowledge and perception of people living in Karachi about isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment. METHODS: This cross-sectional online survey was conducted during the months of March and April 2020. The study included men and women of age 18 years and above quarantined during COVID-19. Convenience sampling followed by snowball sampling technique was used. An online structured questionnaire was developed using Google Form. It included questions on socio demographic information, public knowledge and perception about isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment. Chi-square test was used for categorical variables and p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 548 participants were involved in this survey, 34% (n = 184) males with a mean age of 28  10 years ranging from 18 to 75 years. The major source of hearing about COVID-19 was social media (72%, n = 393). Overall knowledge scores revealed that 27% (n = 146) participants had excellent knowledge about symptoms and prevention of the COVID-19. Excellent knowledge of quarantining, isolation and community containment and social distancing was 38% among participants. Participants who had good and excellent knowledge were more likely to have positive perception of isolation (p-value < 0.001). Majority participants (89%, n = 487) felt isolation may or may not be against human rights and this perception was found significantly associated with moderate to excellent knowledge about community mitigation measures (p-value = 0.009). CONCLUSION: This study concludes that optimal public knowledge and perception related to certain aspects of isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment exists however knowledge gaps and misperceptions prevail that need to be addressed.

A recent Cochrane meta-analysis concluded that GnRHa trigger was associated with reduced live birth rates (LBRs) in fresh autologous IVF cycles compared to hCG trigger. However, the evidence is not unequivocal, and recent trials have found encouraging reproductive outcomes among couples undergoing GnRHa trigger and individualized luteal LH activity support. Thus, the aim was to compare GnRHa trigger followed by luteal LH activity support with hCG trigger in IVF patients undergoing fresh embryo transfer. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials published until December 14, 2016. The population was infertile patients submitted to IVF/ICSI cycles with GnRH antagonist cotreatment who underwent fresh embryo transfer. The intervention was GnRHa trigger followed by LH activity luteal phase support (LPS). The comparator was hCG trigger followed by a standard LPS. The critical outcome measures were LBR and OHSS rate. The secondary outcome measures were number of oocytes retrieved, clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates, and miscarriage rates. RESULTS A total of five studies met the selection criteria comprising a total of 859 patients. The LBR was not significantly different between the GnRHa and hCG trigger groups (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62, 1.14). OHSS was reported in a total of 4/413 cases in the GnRHa group compared to 7/413 in the hCG group (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.15, 1.60). We observed a slight, but non-significant increase in miscarriage rate in the GnRHa triggered group compared to the hCG group (OR 1.85; 95% CI 0.97, 3.54). CONCLUSION GnRHa trigger with LH activity LPS resulted in comparable LBRs compared to hCG trigger. The most recent trials reported LBRs close to unity indicating that individualization of the LH activity LPS improved the luteal phase deficiency reported in the first GnRHa trigger studies. However, LPS optimization is needed to further limit OHSS in the subgroup of normoresponder patients (<14 follicles  11 mm).

Sepsis-3 was established to improve risk stratification among patients with infection based on organ failures, but it has been still controversial compared with previous definitions. Therefore, we aimed to describe characteristics of patients who met sepsis-2 (severe sepsis) and sepsis-3 definitions. METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective cohort study conducted by 22 intensive care units (ICUs) in Japan. Adult patients ( 16 years) with newly suspected infection from December 2017 to May 2018 were included. Those without infection at final diagnosis were excluded. Patients characteristics and outcomes were described according to whether they met each definition or not. RESULTS: In total, 618 patients with suspected infection were admitted to 22 ICUs during the study, of whom 530 (85.8%) met the sepsis-2 definition and 569 (92.1%) met the sepsis-3 definition. The two groups comprised different individuals, and 501 (81.1%) patients met both definitions. In-hospital mortality of study population was 19.1%. In-hospital mortality among patients with sepsis-2 and sepsis-3 patients was comparable (21.7% and 19.8%, respectively). Patients exclusively identified with sepsis-2 or sepsis-3 had a lower mortality (17.2% vs. 4.4%, respectively). No patients died if they did not meet any definitions. Patients who met sepsis-3 shock definition had higher in-hospital mortality than those who met sepsis-2 shock definition. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with infection admitted to ICU meet sepsis-2 and sepsis-3 criteria. However, in-hospital mortality did not occur if patients did not meet any criteria. Better criteria might be developed by better selection and combination of elements in both definitions.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old woman referred to the emergency department complaining of pain on the right side of her lower abdomen. Her past medical history was RYGB surgery, COVID-19 with 40% pulmonary involvement, and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Rapid progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) was predicted based on extensive laboratory test results. A kidney biopsy demonstrated oxalate nephropathy. Along with the findings from the kidney biopsy, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis with tubular injury secondary oxalosis was diagnosed. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: RYGB surgery and chronic kidney disease, can increase the risk of secondary oxalosis. Recent studies introduce enteric hyperoxaluria as an important marker for diagnosing end-stage kidney disease. Renal biopsy is often prescribed for absolute recognition of oxalosis. On the other hand, our patient has a recent history of COVID-19 infection. The use of anti-Covid-19 drugs in patients with renal insufficiency should be considered with caution.

In this cross-sectional population-based study we used cumulative data on the first dose of vaccine received by 01-01-2022 at Middle Super Output Area level in England. We used Bayesian hierarchical spatial models and investigated if the geographical differences in vaccination uptake can be explained by a range of community-level characteristics covering socio-demographics, political view, COVID-19 health risk awareness and targeting of high risk groups and accessibility. Deprivation is the covariate most strongly associated with vaccine uptake (Odds Ratio 0.55, 95%CI 0.54-0.57; most versus least deprived areas). The most ethnically diverse areas have a 38% (95%CI 36-40%) lower odds of vaccine uptake compared with those least diverse. Areas with the highest proportion of population between 12 and 24 years old had lower odds of vaccination (0.87, 95%CI 0.85-0.89).

Bedside LUS was performed in all subjects; chest computed tomography was performed on the same day as bedside LUS in 23 cases. The LUS protocol consisted of 12 scanning zones. LUS score based on B-lines and lung consolidation was evaluated. RESULTS: The most common abnormality of LUS was the various forms of B-lines, detected in 93 (96.9%) subjects; as the second most frequent abnormality, 80 (83.3%) subjects exhibited lung consolidation, mainly located in the posterior lung region. Twenty-four (25.0%) subjects had pleural line abnormalities, and 16 (16.7%) had pleural effusion; 78 (81.3%) subjects had &#8805; 2 abnormal LUS patterns, and 93 (96.9%) had bilateral lung involvement. The proportion of bilateral or unilateral lung consolidation and pleural effusion in the critical COVID-19 group were higher than that in the severe group (P < .05). The lung consolidation of critical subjects showed a marked increase in most lung areas, including bilateral lateral lung, posterior lung, and left anterior-inferior lung area.

Human activities, especially the combustion of fossil fuels, contribute to the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and thus to the pace of climate change. The effects of climate change are already being felt, and the resulting damage will most likely be enormous worldwide. Because global impacts vary widely and will lead to very different national vulnerability to climate impacts, each country, depending on its economic background, has different options to ward off negative impacts. Decisions have to be made to mitigate climate consequences according to the preparedness and the vulnerability of countries against the presumed impacts. This requires a profound scientific basis. To provide sound background information, a bibliometric study was conducted to present global research on climate change using established and specific parameters. Bibliometric standard parameters, established socioeconomic values, and climate change specific indices were used for the analyses. This allowed us to provide an overall picture of the global research pattern not only in terms of general aspects, but also in terms of climate change impacts, its effects and regional differences. For this purpose, we choose representative indices, such as the CO(2) emissions for the responsibility of countries, the global climate risk index as a combination value for the different types of damage that countries can expect, the increase in sea level as a specific parameter as a measure of the huge global environmental impacts, and the readiness and vulnerability index for the different circumstances of individual countries under which climate change will take place. We hope to have thus made a comprehensive and representative selection of specific parameters that is sufficient to map the global research landscape. We have supplemented the methodology accordingly. RESULTS: In terms of absolute publication numbers, the USA was the leading country, followed by the UK, and China in 3rd place. The steep rise in Chinese publication numbers over time came into view, while their citation numbers are relatively low. Scandinavian countries were leading regarding their publication numbers related to CO(2) emission and socioeconomic indices. Only three developing countries stand out in all analyses: Costa Rica, the Fiji Atoll, and Zimbabwe, although it is here that the climate impact will be greatest. A positive correlation between countries preparedness for the impacts of climate change and their publication numbers could be shown, while the correlation between countries vulnerability and their publication numbers was negative. CONCLUSIONS: We could show that there exists an inequity between national research efforts according to the publication output and the demands and necessities of countries related to their socioeconomic status. This inequity calls for a rethink, a different approach, and a different policy to improve countries' preparedness and mitigation capacity, which requires the inclusion of the most affected regions of the world in a strengthened international cooperation network.","output":"Climate change: Does international research fulfill global demands and necessities?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the incidence of distress in youth, some children show increased resilience, emphasizing the need to better understand the predictors of distress in youth. OBJECTIVE: This longitudinal study aimed to assess the combined impact of known socio-emotional predictors of stress-related psychopathology, namely anxiety sensitivity, anxiety trait, intolerance to uncertainty, and rumination, on COVID-related distress in healthy youth. METHOD: A total of 92 parent-child dyads that previously participated in a laboratory-based experiment assessing observational fear learning in families between 2017 and 2019 (T0) were recontacted. Of them, 84 children aged between 9 and 14 agreed to participate. They completed online questionnaires in June 2020 (T1), September 2020 (T2), December 2020 (T3), and March 2021 (T4). Participants were free of mental illness at T0 and T1. To create a socio-emotional composite score (SECS), we measured anxiety sensitivity (Childhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index) at T0, trait anxiety (Trait subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAI-C)), intolerance to uncertainty (Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale for Children), and trait rumination (Childrens Response Style Scale) at T1 and created a weighted z-score. To assess symptoms of anxiety, post-traumatic stress (PTS), and depression in reaction to COVID-19, participants completed the State subscale of the STAI-C, the Childrens Revised Impact of Event Scale, and the Childrens Depression Inventory at T1CT4. Three general linear models were run with sex, age group (9C11 and 12+ years old), and SECS as predictors. RESULTS: Analyses revealed a SECS*Time interaction, with higher SECS predicting elevated anxiety symptoms at T1 and T4, and elevated PTS symptoms at T1 and T2. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that healthy youth endorsing high levels of socio-emotional vulnerability to psychopathology have a higher risk of suffering from anxiety and PTS, but not depressive symptoms, in the year following a major stressor.","output":"A longitudinal investigation of psychological distress in children during COVID-19: the role of socio-emotional vulnerability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Esophagectomy is a pivotal curative modality for localized esophageal or esophagogastric junction cancer (EC or EJC). Postoperative anastomotic leakage (AL) remains problematic. The use of fibrin sealant (FS) may improve the strength of esophageal anastomosis and reduce the incidence of AL. AIM To assess the efficacy and safety of applying FS to prevent AL in patients with EC or EJC. METHODS In this single-arm, phase II trial (Clinicaltrial.gov identifier: NCT03529266), we recruited patients aged 18-80 years with resectable EC or EJC clinically staged as T1-4aN0-3M0. An open or minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy was performed with a circular stapled anastomosis. After performing the anastomosis, 2.5 mL of porcine FS was applied circumferentially. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with AL within 3 mo. RESULTS From June 4, 2018, to December 29, 2018, 57 patients were enrolled. At the data cutoff date (June 30, 2019), three (5.3%) of the 57 patients had developed AL, including two (3.5%) with esophagogastric AL and one (1.8%) with gastric fistula. The incidence of anastomotic stricture and other major postoperative complications was 1.8% and 17.5%, respectively. The median time needed to resume oral feeding after operation was 8 d (Interquartile range: 7.0-9.0 d). No adverse events related to FS were recorded. No deaths occurred within 90 d after surgery. CONCLUSION Perioperative sealing with porcine FS appears safe and may prevent AL after esophagectomy in patients with resectable EC or EJC.

However, little is known on what factors influence the risk of developing these symptoms. While some studies suggest that exposure to pollution is associated with higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, its role is unknown in the development of neurologic symptoms in COVID-19 patients. The response of the central nervous system (CNS) to a SARS-CoV-2 infection may be influenced by its inflammatory state. Interestingly, environmental pollutants such as particulate matter may have neuroinflammatory effects, providing a possible link between exposure to these pollutants and the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the CNS.

Instead of enforcing consistency, we propose to evaluate how concordant or discordant sources are as a measure of trustworthiness (the more discordant are the sources, the less we can trust their data). Thus, we define the discord measurement problem in which given a set of uncertain raw observations or aggregate results (such as case/hospitalization/death data relevant to COVID-19) and information on the alignment of different data (for example, cases and deaths), we wish to assess whether the different sources are concordant, or if not, measure how discordant they are.

SARS-CoV-2 engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) receptors for cellular entry. While ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes are upregulated in the cortex of alcohol-dependent individuals, information on expression in specific brain regions and neural populations implicated in SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion, particularly monoaminergic neurons, is limited. We sought to clarify how chronic alcohol exposure affects ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in monoaminergic brainstem circuits and other putative SARS-CoV-2 entry points. C57BL/6J mice were exposed to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor for 4 weeks and brains were examined using immunofluorescence. We observed increased ACE2 levels in the olfactory bulb and hypothalamus following CIE, which are known to mediate SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion. Total ACE2 immunoreactivity was also elevated in the raphe magnus (RMG), raphe obscurus (ROB), and locus coeruleus (LC), while in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), ROB, and LC we observed increased colocalization of ACE2 with monoaminergic neurons. ACE2 also increased in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and decreased in the amygdala. Whereas ACE2 was detected in most brain regions, TMPRSS2 was only detected in the olfactory bulb and DRN but was not significantly altered after CIE. Our results suggest that previous alcohol exposure may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion and render brain circuits involved in cardiovascular and respiratory function as well as emotional processing more vulnerable to infection, making adverse outcomes more likely. Additional studies are needed to define a direct link between alcohol use and COVID-19 infection.","output":"Repeated ethanol exposure and withdrawal alters ACE2 expression in discrete brain regions: Implications for SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The engineering curriculum includes core courses, projects and elective courses.

Face-to-face teaching, laboratory assignments, course projects, mini, minor and capstone projects are essential components that provide a holistic view of courses studied and practical hands-on experiences. Teachers' course delivery plan as per the schedule, contact hours, discussion, and continuous assessment are vital practices that make students on the learning wheel complete degree completion successfully. But, the COVID-19 pandemic has created the most significant disruption of education systems in human history, affecting nearly 1.6 billion learners in more than 200 countries. Lock down in schools, institutions, and other learning spaces have impacted more than 94% of the world's student population. This scenario has brought far-reaching changes in all aspects of our lives. Social distancing and restrictive movement policies have significantly disturbed traditional educational practices. In this paper, authors discuss challenges faced by students and faculty in the project space. We propose a novel collaborated approach for monitoring and carrying out projects during the pandemic in engineering at Under Graduate (UG) level. The success of this approach is based on collaboration and coordination between faculty and Students. Our proposed method uses tools and pedagogy approaches such as Learning Management System (LMS), MS Team (Microsoft), and Google Apps for documents to administrate student activities and communication. Also, phase-wise reviews helped to monitor the progress of projects. Significant challenges during this online monitoring and assessment were internet bandwidth and follow-up of individual contributions. The main advantages of this approach are improvement in communication skills, time management, distantly work in a team, sharing the code and project management.

BA.1 and BA.2 harbors different mutational profile. One of the important change in both the subvariants is the presence of 69-70 deletion in BA.1 and absence of this deletion in BA.2. This deletion can be used as tool for the detection of omicron sub variants using real time PCR.

As viral attachment machinery is a key target for therapeutic and prophylactic interventions, rapid identification of viral spike proteins from sequence can significantly accelerate the development of medical countermeasures. For five families of respiratory viruses, covering the vast majority of airborne and droplet-transmitted diseases, host cell entry is mediated by the binding of viral surface glycoproteins that interact with a host cell receptor. In this report it is shown that sequence data for an unknown virus belonging to one of the five families above provides sufficient information to identify the protein(s) responsible for viral attachment and to permit an assignment of viral family. Random forest models that take as input a set of respiratory viral sequences can classify the protein as spike vs. non-spike based on predicted secondary structure elements alone (with 97.8 % correctly classified) or in combination with N-glycosylation related features (with 98.1 % correctly classified). In addition, a Random Forest model developed using the same dataset and only secondary structural elements was able to predict the respiratory virus family of each protein sequence correctly 89.0 % of the time. Models were validated through 10-fold cross-validation as well as bootstrapping. Surprisingly, we showed that secondary structural element and N-glycosylation features were sufficient for model generation.

We investigated changes in the time between viral load (VL) checks for people with HIV associated with the pandemic. Methods: This was an observational analysis of VLs of people with HIV in routine care at a large subspecialty clinic. At pandemic onset, the clinic temporarily closed its onsite laboratory. The exposure was time period (time-varying): pre-pandemic (January 1st 2019-March 15th, 2020);pandemic lab-closed (March 16th-July 12th, 2020);and pandemic lab-open (July 13th-December 31st, 2020). We estimated time from an index VL to a subsequent VL, stratified by whether the index VL was suppressed (200 copies/mL). We also calculated cumulative incidence of a non-suppressed VL following a suppressed index VL, and of re-suppression following a loss of viral suppression. Results: Compared to pre-pandemic, hazard ratios for next VL check were: 0.34 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.37, lab-closed) and 0.73 (CI: 0.68, 0.78, lab-open) for suppressed patients;0.56 (CI: 0.42, 0.79, lab-closed) and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.10, lab-open) for non-suppressed patients. The 12-month cumulative incidence of loss of suppression was the same in the pandemic lab-open (4%) and pre-pandemic period (4%). The hazard of re-suppression following loss of suppression was lower during the pandemic lab-open versus the pre-pandemic period (hazard ratio: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.92). Conclusions: Early pandemic restrictions and lab closure significantly delayed VL monitoring. Once the lab re-opened, non-suppressed patients resumed normal monitoring.

A modelling tool was developed for providers to identify babies still awaiting screening or audiological assessment using the national IT system, SMaRT4Hearing (S4H) and audiology data. This information was used to track screening completion and to support restoration of hearing screening prioritising babies with the greatest chance of permanent childhood hearing impairment (PCHI).ObjectivesDevelopment of a modelling tool toprovide assurance of screening pathway completion,map additional audiology capacity required for babies deferred from screening andprioritise babies that need to be seen first on the basis of risk to minimise delays in the diagnosis of PCHIMethodsWeekly data reports extracted from S4H highlighting services with less than 90% coverage and more than 40% of screen referrals awaiting audiology to support commissioner assurance of screening and audiological capacity.Development of a modelling tool for use by screening providers and audiology servicesResultsThe programme saw a significant reduction in the number of babies with a completed screen outcome, a slight rise in the number referred to audiology and an increasing number of babies awaiting diagnostic assessment.1.

Providers with <90% coverage, >40% screening referrals awaiting audiologyTracking of progress by highlighting services meeting these criteria in a national summary report for screening commissioners supported by detailed metrics for each provider.3. Comparison of diagnosis of permanent childhood hearing impairmentThe number of unilateral and bilateral cases of permanent childhood hearing impairment diagnosed within the screening programme in 2020/21 is compared to 2019/20 tracking babies deferred for behavioural testing in audiology at the age 7C9 months.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic initially impacted the coverage for the newborn screening programme. Coverage has improved over time but there remains a proportion of babies that were not offered initial screening or deferred screening until audiological assessment at 7C9 months of age. These babies are now reaching the age to be seen in audiology. Weekly reporting and use of the modelling tool to support screening and audiology capacity mapping has provided assurance to screening commissioners that the babies at greatest risk have been prioritised. Final full year figures will estimate the potential number of delayed diagnoses of permanent childhood hearing impairment in 2020/21. Paediatric services need to be aware of the impact of COVID-19 on newborn hearing screening and should check if screening has been completed or that babies are referred for audiological assessment.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on the English newborn hearing screening programme C minimising delays in the identification of permanent childhood hearing impairment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Friedreich Ataxia (FA) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the deficiency of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein. In primary cultures of dorsal root ganglia neurons, we showed that frataxin depletion resulted in decreased levels of the mitochondrial calcium exchanger NCLX, neurite degeneration and apoptotic cell death. Here we describe that frataxin-deficient dorsal root ganglia neurons display low levels of ferredoxin 1, a mitochondrial Fe/S cluster-containing protein that interacts with frataxin and, interestingly, is essential for the synthesis of calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D. We provide data that calcitriol supplementation, used at nanomolar concentrations, is able to reverse the molecular and cellular markers altered in DRG neurons. Calcitriol is able to recover both ferredoxin 1 and NCLX levels and restores mitochondrial membrane potential indicating an overall mitochondrial function improvement. Accordingly, reduction of apoptotic markers and neurite degeneration was observed and, as a result, cell survival was also recovered. All these beneficial effects would be explained by the finding that calcitriol is able to increase the mature frataxin levels in both, frataxin-deficient DRG neurons and cardiomyocytes; remarkably, this increase also occurs in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from FA patients. In conclusion, these results provide molecular bases to consider calcitriol for an easy and affordable therapeutic approach for FA patients.","output":"Calcitriol increases frataxin levels and restores mitochondrial function in cell models of Friedreich Ataxia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the first week after the first COVID-19 patient was reported in the Netherlands, we conducted a pre-registered momentary assessment study (7 surveys per day, 50 participants, 7 days) to study the dynamic relationship between individuals occupation with and worries about COVID-19 in daily life, and the moderating role of neuroticism in this relationship.

Our hernia center has a growing experience with redo-transversus abdominis release (redo-TAR) to address large, complex hernia recurrences after failed TAR. Here, we describe our outcomes after abdominal wall reconstruction with redo-TAR. STUDY DESIGN Adults undergoing elective open, redo-TAR at our institution from January 2015 to February 2021 were queried from a prospectively collected database in the Abdominal Core Health Quality Collaborative. The primary outcome was 30-day wound morbidity. Secondary outcomes were long-term composite hernia recurrence and patient-reported quality of life. RESULTS Sixty-five patients underwent redo-TAR. Median age was 60 years, 50.8% were female, and median BMI 31.8 kg/m2. Median recurrent hernias were 16 cm wide by 25 cm long. Frequent mechanisms of recurrence included linea semilunaris injury (27.7%), mesh fracture (18.5%), infection (16.9%), and posterior sheath disruption (15.4%). Wound complications occurred in 33.8% and 16.9% required procedural intervention. With median clinical and PRO follow-up of 12 and 19 months, respectively, the composite hernia recurrence rate was 22.5% and patients reported significantly improved quality of life (HerQLes: median + 36.7, PROMIS: median - 9.5).

However, assessing the effectiveness of those intervention practices hinges on the understanding of virus transmission, which remains uncertain. Here we show that airborne transmission is highly virulent and represents the dominant route to spread the disease. By analyzing the trend and mitigation measures in Wuhan, China, Italy, and New York City, from January 23 to May 9, 2020, we illustrate that the impacts of mitigation measures are discernable from the trends of the pandemic. Our analysis reveals that the difference with and without mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping the pandemic trends in the three epicenters. This protective measure alone significantly reduced the number of infections, that is, by over 78,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and over 66,000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9. Other mitigation measures, such as social distancing implemented in the United States, are insufficient by themselves in protecting the public. We conclude that wearing of face masks in public corresponds to the most effective means to prevent interhuman transmission, and this inexpensive practice, in conjunction with simultaneous social distancing, quarantine, and contact tracing, represents the most likely fighting opportunity to stop the COVID-19 pandemic.

While most residents hunted large-bodied species to maximize revenues from wildlife trade, many low-trophic level smaller species were harvested to meet local subsistence demands because they were more palatable and could be captured using artisanal traps near hunters households. Mainly low-trophic level species were killed in retaliation for crop-raiding or livestock depredation. Considering all game species sampled in this study, 96% were captured to attend two or more motivations. In addition, hunting associated with different motivations was partitioned in terms of age and gender, with prey acquisition for the wildlife trade primarily carried out by adult men, while hunting to meet local subsistence needs and inhibit human-wildlife conflicts were carried out by adult men and women, children and even the elderly. In natural savannah areas lacking fish as a source of protein, a higher number of species was selected to supply both the meat trade and subsistence, while more species in forest areas were targeted for trade in animal body parts and conflict retaliation. Finally, local commerce in bushmeat and other body parts accrued higher domestic revenues compared to any alternative sources of direct and indirect income. However, these financial benefits were at best modest, largely unsustainable in terms of prey population collapses, and generated high long-term costs for the local to regional scale economy and native biodiversity.","output":"Intrinsic and extrinsic motivations governing prey choice by hunters in a post-war African forest-savannah macromosaic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic presents the challenge for medical education to teach practical skills without practical training To provide an alternative to hands-on training during the COVID-19 lockdown, we created a virtual curriculum to teach practical skills using videos combined with online exams on a virtual e?learning platform The goal was to convey different theoretical and practical aspects of urology MATERIALS AND METHODS: The videos were produced by department employees using a predefined concept The students had access to the virtual curriculum via the university's Moodle e?learning platform To assess the success of training, participating students had to pass an online exam about the curriculum's contents, followed by an evaluation of the course RESULTS: A total of 164 participants took part in the virtual curriculum The overall evaluation and feedback was very positive The acceptance of the virtual alternative to hands-on teaching was high DISCUSSION: The virtual curriculum offered a fast and contactless alternative to the regular hands-on teaching","output":"[Virtual skills-training in urology : Teaching at the Technical University of Munich during the COVID-19-pandemic]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study Objectives: Recent reports indicate that the presence of cardiac injury [troponin level > the 99th percentile upper reference limit (99th % URL) using mostly contemporary assays] is predictive of death within 30 days during hospitalization of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Troponin values ordered in the emergency department (ED) or after hospitalization were used for these analyses. Our objective was to determine the 28 day survival prognostic value of ED resulted high sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) measurements in COVID-19 patients. Methods: We established an ED centric electronic database of COVID-19 patients (nasopharyngeal swab testing within 1 week prior to or during the ED visit) having at least 1 hs-cTnI (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA;level of quantitation (LoQ) 4ng/L, non sex specific 99th percentile URL 18 ng/L) value reported during a visit to an urban, academic ED in the United States. All patients, whether admitted and expired in the hospital or hospital discharged or sent home directly from the ED were followed for 28 days to determine all-cause mortality. Kaplan Meir survival curves were constructed to compare outcomes amongst predetermined initial hs- cTnI value intervals. Results: From March 16-November 2, 2020 1476 consecutive ED COVID-19 patients were identified with 1044 (70.7%) having at least 1 hs-cTnI value resulted in the ED. Patients mean age and body mass index were 60.8  16.1 years and 32.4  11.3 kg/m2 respectively. 531 (50.9%) were male, 804 (77.0%) self-identified as African American and 615 (58.9%) had 2 or more comorbidities with hypertension (42.5%), diabetes (37.4%) and hyperlipidemia (27.23%) commonest. Frequent primary presenting complaints were shortness of breath (37.7%), fever/chills (14.5%) and cough (11.9%). Hs-cTnI interval values were: 147 (14.1%) < 4 (LoQ), 359 (34.4%) 4-10 and 151 (14.5%) 11-18 ng/L.

Each of the interval initial ED hs-cTnI values was associated with a different (p < 0.001) 28 day survival curve (Figure). Conclusions: Most COVID-19 patients had a hs-cTnI value obtained with 85.9% of these > 4 ng/L. No one with an initial hs-cTnI < 4 ng/L died within 28 days while increasing presenting hs-cTnI values > 4 ng/L were associated with decreased 28 day survival.

For such samples the localization and orientation of the molecular species or probe within the lipid bilayer environment is the focus of research prior to an evaluation of their dynamic or mechanistic behavior. X-ray scattering is a powerful method to study peptide/lipid interactions in the fluid, fully hydrated state of a lipid bilayer. For one, the lipid response can be revealed by observing membrane thickening and thinning as well as packing in the membrane plane; at the same time, the distinct positions of peptide moieties within lipid membranes can be elucidated at resolutions of up to several angstroms by applying heavy-atom labeling techniques. In this study, we describe a generally applicable X-ray scattering approach that provides robust and quantitative information about peptide insertion and localization as well as peptide/lipid interaction within highly oriented, hydrated multilamellar membrane stacks. To this end, we have studied an artificial, designed -helical peptide motif in its homodimeric and hairpin variants adopting different states of oligomerization. These peptide lipid complexes were analyzed by grazing incidence diffraction (GID) to monitor changes in the lateral lipid packing and ordering. In addition, we have applied anomalous reflectivity using synchrotron radiation as well as in-house X-ray reflectivity in combination with iodine-labeling in order to determine the electron density distribution (z) along the membrane normal (z axis), and thereby reveal the hydrophobic mismatch situation as well as the position of certain amino acid side chains within the lipid bilayer. In the case of multiple labeling, the latter technique is not only applicable to demonstrate the peptides reconstitution but also to generate evidence about the relative peptide orientation with respect to the lipid bilayer.

Recent studies have demonstrated correlated geographic patterns for leaf epiphytic community composition and leaf morphology, also coinciding with different levels of water turbidity and nutrient concentrations. Based on these observations, workers have suggested an environmental microbial fingerprint, which may reflect various environmental stress factors seagrasses have experienced, and may add a holobiont level of plasticity to seagrasses, assisting their acclimation to changing environments and through range expansion. However, it is difficult to tease apart environmental effects from host-diversity dependent effects, which have covaried in field studies, although this is required in order to establish that differences in microbial community compositions among sites are driven by environmental conditions rather than by features governed by the host. RESULTS: In this study we carried out a mesocosm experiment, in which we studied the effects of warming and nutrient stress on the composition of epiphytic bacterial communities and on some phenological traits. We studied H. stipulacea collected from two different meadows in the Gulf of Aqaba, representing differences in the host and the environment alike. We found that the source site from which seagrasses were collected was the major factor governing seagrass phenology, although heat increased shoot mortality and nutrient loading delayed new shoot emergence. Bacterial diversity, however, mostly depended on the environmental conditions. The most prominent pattern was the increase in Rhodobacteraceae under nutrient stress without heat stress, along with an increase in Microtrichaceae. Together, the two taxa have the potential to maintain nitrate reduction followed by an anammox process, which can together buffer the increase in nutrient concentrations across the leaf surface. CONCLUSIONS: Our results thus corroborate the existence of environmental microbial fingerprints, which are independent from the host diversity, and support the notion of a holobiont level plasticity, both important to understand and monitor H. stipulacea ecology under the changing climate.","output":"Teasing apart the host-related, nutrient-related and temperature-related effects shaping the phenology and microbiome of the tropical seagrass Halophila stipulacea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Who could have predicted that 2020, designated by the World Health Organization as the Year of the Nurse and Midwife, would so quickly become a year in which nursing plays such a central role?

The management of PAD is multidisciplinary, involving primary care physicians and vascular specialists with varying expertise in diagnostic and treatment modalities. PAD represents a broad spectrum of disease from asymptomatic through severe limb ischemia. The Society for Vascular Surgery Lower Extremity Practice Guidelines committee reviewed the evidence supporting clinical care in the treatment of asymptomatic PAD and intermittent claudication (IC). The committee made specific practice recommendations using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. There are limited Level I data available for many of the critical questions in the field, demonstrating the urgent need for comparative effectiveness research in PAD. Emphasis is placed on risk factor modification, medical therapies, and broader use of exercise programs to improve cardiovascular health and functional performance. Screening for PAD appears of unproven benefit at present. Revascularization for IC is an appropriate therapy for selected patients with disabling symptoms, after a careful risk-benefit analysis. Treatment should be individualized based on comorbid conditions, degree of functional impairment, and anatomic factors. Invasive treatments for IC should provide predictable functional improvements with reasonable durability. A minimum threshold of a >50% likelihood of sustained efficacy for at least 2 years is suggested as a benchmark. Anatomic patency (freedom from restenosis) is considered a prerequisite for sustained efficacy of revascularization in IC. Endovascular approaches are favored for most candidates with aortoiliac disease and for selected patients with femoropopliteal disease in whom anatomic durability is expected to meet this minimum threshold. Conversely, caution is warranted in the use of interventions for IC in anatomic settings where durability is limited (extensive calcification, small-caliber arteries, diffuse infrainguinal disease, poor runoff). Surgical bypass may be a preferred strategy in good-risk patients with these disease patterns or in those with prior endovascular failures. Common femoral artery disease should be treated surgically, and saphenous vein is the preferred conduit for infrainguinal bypass grafting. Patients who undergo invasive treatments for IC should be monitored regularly in a surveillance program to record subjective improvements, assess risk factors, optimize compliance with cardioprotective medications, and monitor hemodynamic and patency status.","output":"Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities: management of asymptomatic disease and claudication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It is currently unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 reinfection will remain a rare event, only occurring in individuals who fail to mount an effective immune response, or whether it will occur more frequently when humoral immunity wanes following primary infection. METHODS: A case of reinfection was observed in a Belgian nosocomial outbreak involving 3 patients and 2 health care workers. To distinguish reinfection from persistent infection and detect potential transmission clusters, whole genome sequencing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs of all individuals including the reinfection case's first episode. IgA, IgM, and IgG and neutralizing antibody responses were quantified in serum of all individuals, and viral infectiousness was measured in the swabs of the reinfection case. RESULTS: Reinfection was confirmed in a young, immunocompetent health care worker as viral genomes derived from the first and second episode belonged to different SARS-CoV-2 clades. The symptomatic reinfection occurred after an interval of 185 days, despite the development of an effective humoral immune response following symptomatic primary infection. The second episode, however, was milder and characterized by a fast rise in serum IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Although contact tracing and virus culture remained inconclusive, the health care worker formed a transmission cluster with 3 patients and showed evidence of virus replication but not of neutralizing antibodies in her nasopharyngeal swabs.

A registered dietitian advised all subjects on food selection and followed them through the intervention to ensure compliance. Participants underwent a 2-week washout with no eggs or spinach (a source of dietary lutein and zeaxanthin) and were randomly allocated to consume spinach (70 g) with either two eggs (EGG) or the equivalent amount of egg substitute (SUB) for breakfast for 4 weeks. After a 3-week washout, they were allocated the alternate breakfast. A total of 24 participants (13 women/11 men) finished the intervention. Plasma lipids, glucose, insulin, anthropometrics, plasma lutein, zeaxanthin, choline and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) were assessed at baseline and the end of each intervention. When we compared individuals consuming the EGG versus the SUB breakfast, we observed a lower body weight (p < 0.02) and a higher HDL cholesterol (p < 0.025) after the EGG diet. There were no differences in plasma LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, or blood pressure. The number of large HDL particles measured by NMR was higher after EGG (p < 0.01) as compared to SUB. Plasma choline was higher in both treatments (p < 0.01) compared to baseline (8.3  2.1 mol/L). However, plasma choline values were higher in EGG (10.54  2.8 mol/L) compared to SUB (9.47  2.7 mol/L) p < 0.025. Both breakfasts increased plasma lutein compared to baseline (p < 0.01), while plasma zeaxanthin was only increased in the egg intervention (p < 0.01). These results indicate that consuming a plant-based diet in combination with whole eggs increases plasma HDL cholesterol, choline and zeaxanthin, important biomarkers in subjects with MetS.","output":"Eggs Improve Plasma Biomarkers in Patients with Metabolic Syndrome Following a Plant-Based DietA Randomized Crossover Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Therapeutic lipiodol lymphangiography for postoperative chyle leakage due to lymph duct damage has recently been attracting attention.

All the patients were treated by HFNC. According to whether the patient subsequently received non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or invasive positive pressure ventilation, patients were divided into the HFNC success group and the HFNC failure group. Parameters in the two groups such as basic characteristics, lactic acid, number of chest radiographs, APACHE II, lymphocyte count, baseline respiratory rate, baseline percutaneous oxygen saturation, baseline PaO2/FiO2, baseline ROX index, and ROX index after 2, 6 and 12 h HFNC treatment were analyzed with t test, Chi-square test or rank sum test. Results: A total of 57 cases were included in this study. There were no significant differences in sex, age, comorbidities, lactic acid, quadrants of chest radiograph lung infection, APACHE II, lymphocyte count, and baseline respiratory frequency, transcutaneous oxygen saturation, oxygenation index, and ROX index between the HFNC success group and the HFNC faliure group (P>0.05).

Forty participants underwent a fear conditioning procedure on Day 1, and separate memory recall and generalization tests on Day 2. We focused on two aspects of perceptual memory: namely memory bias (i.e., over- or underestimation of stimulus magnitude) and uncertainty. We found that memory bias predicted the pattern of generalized self-reported (expectancy ratings) and psychophysiological responses (fear-potentiated startle responses). Memory uncertainty was measured in two ways: self-reported uncertainty ratings and variability in stimulus recall. We found that higher levels of self-reported memory uncertainty corresponded with a broader generalization gradient on US expectancy, while greater variability in memory recall was associated with a broader generalization gradient on fear-potentiated startle responses. Taken together, our findings suggest that memory is an important determinant of generalized behavior and illustrate the need to account for these interindividual differences in perceptual memory when examining the generalization of learned responses.","output":"Differences in perceptual memory determine generalization patterns."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence and preferences of moderate-to-vigorous physical activities (MVPA) in patients with advanced lung cancer, explore the social cognitive factors that were associated with MVPA and interest in PA counseling and program, and examine the mediating role of social cognitive factors.

Questionnaires on PA levels, PA counseling and programming preferences, and social cognitive variables (social support and self-efficacy) were administered to 105 patients with advanced lung cancer. Linear regression model was used to explore the social cognitive factors associated with MVPA, and logistic regression model was used to explore the factors associated with interest in PA counseling and program. Mediation analysis was used to examine the mediating role of self-efficacy on social support and MVPA. RESULTS Merely 30.5% of patients met the recommended level of MVPA; however, the majority of patients (89.5%) were interested in PA program. Social support ( = 0.60; p = 0.007) and self-efficacy ( = 1.06; p = 0.027) were positively associated with MVPA.

Off-target immune activation leads to immune-related adverse events affecting multiple organ systems, including the cardiovascular system. In this review, we discuss the current literature describing the epidemiology, mechanisms and proposed management of cardiotoxicities related to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies and bispecific T-cell engagers. ICIs are monoclonal antibody antagonists that block a co-inhibitory pathway used by tumour cells to evade a T cell-mediated immune response. ICI-associated cardiotoxicities include myocarditis, pericarditis, atherosclerosis, arrhythmias and vasculitis. ICI-associated myocarditis is the most recognised and potentially fatal cardiotoxicity with mortality approaching 50%. Recently, ICI-associated dysregulation of the atherosclerotic plaque immune response with prolonged use has been linked to early progression of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. Treatment strategies include immunosuppression with corticosteroids and supportive care. In CAR T-cell therapy, autologous T cells are genetically engineered to express receptors targeted to cancer cells. While stimulating an effective tumour response, they also elicit a profound immune reaction called cytokine release syndrome (CRS). High-grade CRS causes significant systemic abnormalities, including cardiovascular effects such as arrhythmias, haemodynamic compromise and cardiomyopathy. Treatment with interleukin-6 inhibitors and corticosteroids is associated with improved outcomes. The evidence shows that, although uncommon, immunotherapy-related cardiovascular toxicities confer significant risk of morbidity and mortality and benefit from rapid immunosuppressive treatment.

However, the temporal relationship of detecting virus-laden particles at nonhealthcare locations vs surveillance data obtained by conventional means has not been fully assessed. METHODS: From October 2016 to June 2018, air was sampled weekly from a university campus in Hong Kong. Viral genomes were detected and quantified by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Logistic regression models were fitted to examine the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of ecological and environmental factors associated with the detection of virus-laden airborne particles. RESULTS: Influenza A (16.9% [117/694]) and influenza B (4.5% [31/694]) viruses were detected at higher frequencies in air than rhinovirus (2.2% [6/270]), respiratory syncytial virus (0.4% [1/270]), or human coronaviruses (0% [0/270]).

The HeLa cell-derived TZM-bl reporter cell line is widely used for the estimation of lentiviruses neutralization by immune sera. The cell line is highly permissive to infection by most strains of HIV, SIV, and SHIV. Here we demonstrated that TZM-bl cells express a 48 kDa non-glycosylated protein (p48) recognized by broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2F5 targeting the ELDKWA (aa 669C674) epitope of gp41TM of HIV-1. A significant amount of p48 was found in the cell supernatant. The protein was identified as human kynureninase (KYNU), which has the ELDKWA epitope. The protein is further called p48 KYNU. The HIV-1 neutralization by mAb 2F5 and 4E10 in the presence of p48KYNU was tested on Jurkat and TZM-bl cells. It was demonstrated that p48KYNU reduces neutralization by 2F5-like antibodies, but it has almost no effect on mAb 4E10. Therefore, p48KYNU can attenuate HIV-1 neutralization by 2F5-like antibodies and hence create false-negative results.

The incremental diagnostic yield of ES over CMA/karyotype was calculated and pooled in a meta-analysis. Sub-group analyses investigated effects of case selection and fetal phenotype on diagnostic yield. RESULTS: We identified 72 reports from 66 studies, representing 4350 fetuses. The pooled incremental yield of ES was 31% (95% CI 26-36%, p<0.0001). Diagnostic yield was significantly higher for cases pre-selected for likelihood of monogenic aetiology compared to unselected cases (42% vs 15%, p<0.0001).

Using different statistical approaches, we compared the functional independence rates at 3 months among patients undergoing primary endovascular therapy and patients treated only with IV thrombolysis. METHODS We used data from a prospective, government-mandated and externally audited registry of reperfusion therapies for ischemic stroke (January 2011 to November 2012). Patients were selected if treated with either IV thrombolysis alone (n = 1,582) or primary endovascular thrombectomy (n = 250).

Understanding of heterogeneous ice nucleation is particularly key for understanding the formation of ice in clouds, which impacts weather and climate. While many effective ice nucleators are known, the mechanisms of their actions remain poorly understood. Some inorganic nucleators have been found to nucleate ice at warmer temperatures in dilute ammonium solution than in pure water. This is surprising, analogous to salty water melting at a warmer temperature than pure water. Here, the magnitude of this effect is rationalized as being due to thermodynamically favorable ammonium-induced disordering of the hydrogen bond network of ice critical clusters formed on inorganic ice nucleators. Theoretical calculations are shown to be consistent with new experimental measurements aimed at finding the maximum magnitude of the effect. The implication of this study is that the ice-nucleating sites and surfaces of many inorganic ice nucleators are either polar or charged and, therefore, tend to induce formation of hydrogen-ordered ice clusters. This work corroborates various literature reports, indicating that some inorganic ice nucleators are most effective when nominally neutral, and implies a commonality in mechanism between a wide range of inorganic ice nucleators.","output":"Disordering effect of the ammonium cation accounts for anomalous enhancement of heterogeneous ice nucleation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented burden on the delivery of intensive care services worldwide.

After T2DM-related target identification, 39 cross targets of GQWTF and T2DM were obtained, and 30 key targets highly responsible for the beneficial effect of GQWTF on T2DM were identified by PPI analysis. GO analysis of these key targets showed that many biological processes of GQWTF in treating T2DM are key in the occurrence and development of T2DM, including components related to inflammatory/immune response, insulin, and metabolism. KEGG analysis revealed the regulation of multiple signalling pathways, such as insulin resistance, PPAR signalling pathway, FoxO signalling pathway, Fc epsilon RI signalling pathway, and pathways that influence diabetes primarily by regulating metabolism as well as other T2DM directly related pathways. Furthermore, a \\"formula-compound-pathway-symptom\\" network was constructed to represent a global view of GQWTF in the treatment of T2DM. CONCLUSIONS This study explored the mechanism of action of GQWTF in T2DM by multi-component and multi-target multi pathways, which could provide a theoretical basis for the development and clinical application of GQWTF.","output":"Mechanism exploration of Gouqi-wentang formula against type 2 diabetes mellitus by phytochemistry and network pharmacology-based analysis and biological validation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I present here longitudinal evaluation of T and B cell immunity to SARS-CoV2 and variants of concern (VOC) from a single subject (me) over an entire year post vaccination.

ACE2 receptor blocking antibodies, antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of variants of concern, ex vivo IFN ELISpot responses, intracellular cytokine assays and B cell ELISpot assays were carried out in a sub-cohort.Findings: Of the 327/504 individuals who were baseline seronegative, 88.7% seroconverted, with significantly lower seroconversion rates in those >60-years old (p-value = 0.004) and significantly lower than previously seen with AZD1222 (p=0.018). 82.6% developed ACE2 receptor blocking antibodies, although the levels were significantly lower than seen following natural infection (p=0.0009) and following a single dose of AZD1222 (p<0.0001). Similar titres of antibodies were observed to the RBD of the WT, B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 compared to AZD1222, while the levels for B.1.351 were significantly higher (p=0.006) for Gam-COVID-Vac. 30% of individuals developed ex vivo IFN ELISpot responses, and high frequency of CD107a expressing T cells along with memory B cell responses. The ex vivo IFN responses for spike protein were significantly higher (p<0.0001) for AZD1222 than for Gam-COVID-Vac.Interpretation: A single dose of Sputnik V Gam-COVID-Vac induced high seroconversion rates although lower responses in older age groups in Sri Lankan adults. The overall antibody responses, ACE2 receptor blocking antibody responses and ex vivo T cell responses appear to be significantly lower than previously seen with AZD1222, and so there is likely to be benefit from delivery of the second dose.Funding: We are grateful to the World Health Organization, UK Medical Research Council. theForeign and Commonwealth Office and NIH, USA (grant number 5U01AI151788-02) for support.T.K.T. is funded by the Townsend-Jeantet Charitable Trust (charity number 1011770) and the EPACephalosporin Early Career Researcher Fund.Declaration of Interest: None of the authors have any conflicts of interest.Ethical Approval: Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Review Committee of University of Sri Jayewardenepura (COVID 01/21).","output":"Immune Responses Following the First Dose of the Sputnik V (Gam-COVID-Vac)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with sepsis and immobility in the intensive care unit are associated with muscle weakness, and early mobilisation can counteract it. However, during septic shock, mobilisation is often delayed due to the severity of the illness. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) may be an alternative to mobilise these patients early. This study aims to identify whether NMES performed within the first 72 hours of septic shock diagnosis or later is safe from a metabolic perspective. METHODS: This is the analysis of two randomised controlled crossover studies. Patients with acute septic shock (within the first 72 hours of diagnosis) and sepsis and septic shock in the late phase (after 72 hours of diagnosis) were eligible. Patients were submitted in a random order to the intervention protocol (dorsal decubitus position with the lower limbs raised and NMES) and control (dorsal decubitus position with the lower limbs raised without NMES). The patients were allocated in group 1 (intervention and control) or group 2 (control and intervention) with a wash-out period of 4 to 6 hours. Metabolic variables were evaluated by indirect calorimetry. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were analysed in the acute septic shock study and 21 in the late sepsis/septic shock study. There were no significant differences between Oxygen Consumption (VO(2)) values in the acute phase of septic shock when the baseline period, intervention, and control protocols were compared (186.59  46.10; 183.64  41.39; 188.97  44.88, p>0.05- expressed in mL/Kg/min). The same was observed when the VO(2) values in the late phase were compared (224.22  53.09; 226.20  49.64; 226.79  58.25, p>0.05). The other metabolic variables followed the same pattern, with no significant differences between the protocols. When metabolic variables were compared between acute to late phase, significant differences were observed (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: As metabolic rates in septic shock patients had no increase during NMES, either in the first 72 hours of diagnosis or later, NMES can be considered safe from a metabolic viewpoint, even despite the higher metabolic demand in the acute phase of shock.

In this article, we used a topic search method to search for relevant literature on respiratory muscle training and obtained 58 and 32 literature studies from CNKI and Wanfang Data, respectively. As a result of the screening, 36 and 28 documents were obtained. In this paper, 64 selected articles were studied. The authors make statistics on the literature of designing serum content index and multislice spiral CT (Member of the Society of Cardiological Technicians) image of patients, so as to analyze the influence of CT image and inspiratory muscle training on respiratory muscle function. The study showed that FVC, FEV1, MIP, and diaphragm mobility of the experimental group were significantly improved after treatment in more than 85% of the studies (P < 0.05), while those of the control group were not significantly improved (P > 0.05). The comparison between the two groups after treatment showed that FVC, FEV1, MIP, and diaphragm mobility of the experimental group were higher than those of the control group (P < 0.05). The application of multislice spiral CT image analysis technology can effectively evaluate the effect of inspiratory muscle training on respiratory dysfunction in stroke patients, the mechanism of which regulates the expression of related pathways, suppresses the inflammatory response, and can reduce oxidative stress damage. Therefore, respiratory muscle training can improve the function of respiratory muscle and reduce the death rate of cerebellar hemorrhage in patients with stroke and other vascular diseases.","output":"Multislice Spiral CT Image Analysis and Meta-Analysis of Inspiratory Muscle Training on Respiratory Muscle Function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infections with the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant are rapidly increasing worldwide.

METHODS: Baseline biochemical data for 22 common tests from 311 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients presenting to hospital in April 2020 in whom ethnicity data were available was retrospectively collected and evaluated. Data comparisons between ethnic minority and white groups were made for all patient data and for the subset of patients subsequently admitted to intensive care. RESULTS: When all patient data were considered, the ethnic minority population had statistically significant higher concentrations of C reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, while troponin T was higher in the white group. A greater proportion of ethnic minority patients were subsequently admitted to intensive care, but when the presenting biochemistry of this subset of patients was compared, no significant differences were observed between ethnic minority and white groups.

Patients who received prophylactic Ronapreve (casirivimab-imdevimab, n = 39) and those who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the fifth wave of the pandemic (n = 14) served as negative and positive controls, respectively. After a median interval from injection of 29 days (interquartile range 29-33 days), only 9.5% of patients who received Evusheld were able to neutralize the omicron variant compared to 71% of patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 2.6% of those who received Ronapreve.

A high interindividual variability in anti-RBD IgG titers was observed after Evusheld (range: 262-7032 BAU/mL). This variability was largely explained by the patients' body mass index, which showed an inverse correlation with anti-RBD IgG titers.

Simultaneous multi-omics data integration is a growing field of research as it has strong potential to unlock information on previously hidden biological relationships leading to early diagnosis, prognosis and expedited treatments. Many tools for multi-omics data integration are being developed. However, these tools are often restricted to highly specific experimental designs, and types of omics data. While some general methods do exist, they require specific data formats and experimental conditions. A major limitation in the field is a lack of a single or multi-omics pipeline which can accept data in an unrefined, information-rich form pre-integration and subsequently generate output for further investigation. There is an increasing demand for a generic multi-omics pipeline to facilitate general-purpose data exploration and analysis of heterogeneous data.

We enabled limited checkpointing where intermediate output is staged to allow continuation after errors or interruptions in the pipeline and generate a script for reproducing the analysis to improve reproducibility. A seamless integration with the mixOmics R package is achieved, as the R data object can be loaded and manipulated with mixOmics functions.

The direct effect of COVID-19 on mortality through acute respiratory failure is well-established. However, there are a growing number of publications suggesting that the prevalence and outcome of sudden cardiac death may also be indirectly affected by the pandemic. Public health measures, such as lockdowns and reorganisation of hospitals, can alter the access to healthcare services and therefore might have contributed to the excess number of cardiac arrests which were seen over the last year. Our aim was to review the currently available publications regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on out-of-hospital and in-hospital cardiac arrests. A recent study reported a 3-fold growth in the incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests during the 2020 COVID-19 period compared to the year before. In general, the number of non-shockable rhythms increased, bystander-witnessed cases and bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation were reduced and ambulance response times were significantly delayed during the pandemic. Return of spontaneous circulation and survival to discharge substantially decreased compared to the time before the pandemic. The difference between the rate of mortality following in-hospital cardiac arrest during and before the pandemic is controversial according to published data. The incidence of out-of-hospital and in-hospital cardiac arrests significantly increased during the pandemic compared to previous years suggesting direct effects of COVID-19 infection and indirect effects from new public health measures. The disruption of the chain of survival could have contributed to the increased mortality following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Animal studies showed evidences for a transgenerational transmission of epigenetic characteristics. CONCLUSIONS Our findings support the hypothesis that epigenetic mediate gene-environment interactions and psychiatric disorders.

Studies have shown that thrombus resolution with catheter-directed thrombolysis in patients with iliofemoral DVT reduces postthrombotic morbidity, although patients unsuccessfully treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) do not enjoy the same long-term benefit. The purpose of this study is to objectively assess whether the amount of clot reduction at the time of acute therapy correlates with long-term postthrombotic morbidity. METHODS Forty-two patients who underwent catheter-directed and/or pharmacomechanical lysis of iliofemoral DVT were quantitatively evaluated. Patients had their degree of clot lysis quantified and were divided into two main groups for comparison. Group I (n = 33) had >50% clot lysis (mean, 84%) and group II (n = 9) had < or =50% lysis (mean, 42%). At a mean follow-up interval of 14 months, the degree of chronic venous disease was assessed by evaluators blinded to the degree of clot lysis. Evaluation of postthrombotic morbidity was performed using the Villalta scale, and the clinical class of CEAP, and quality-of-life (QOL) was assessed using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). RESULTS Mean CEAP scores were 0.85 and 3.13 (P = .005), and Villalta scores were 2.38 and 6.25 (P = .009) in group I and group II, respectively. Patient QOL in group I was higher than group II in all parameters. Physical functioning (P = .035), role physical (P = .012), general health (P = .014), vitality (P < .001), and social functioning (P = .012) were all significantly better in group I. Bodily pain (P = .117), role emotional (P = .624), and mental health (P = .096) strongly favored group I patients but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION Patients with extensive DVT treated with catheter-based interventions to eliminate thrombus suffer relatively little postthrombotic morbidity. The degree of clot lysis directly correlates with long-term outcome. Improved QOL, the Villalta scale, and clinical class of CEAP are linearly correlated with the amount of clot resolution.","output":"Quantity of clot lysed after catheter-directed thrombolysis for iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis correlates with postthrombotic morbidity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the COVID-19 outbreak, four citiesWuhan, Beijing, Urumqi and Dalianhave experienced the process from outbreak to stabilization. According to the China Statistical Yearbook and China Center for Disease Control records, regional, pathological, medical and response attributes were selected as regional vulnerability factors of infectious diseases. Then the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was used to build a regional vulnerability index model for the infectious disease. The influence of the COVID-19 outbreak at a certain place was assessed computationally in terms of the number of days of epidemic duration and cumulative number of infections, and then fitted to the city data. The resulting correlation coefficient was 0.999952. The range of the regional vulnerability index for COVID-19 virus was from 0.0513 to 0.9379. The vulnerability indexes of Wuhan, Urumqi, Beijing and Dalian were 0.8733, 0.1951, 0.1566 and 0.1119, respectively. The lack of understanding of the virus became the biggest breakthrough point for the rapid spread of the virus in Wuhan.

Early clinical experiences have demonstrated the wide spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 presentations, including various reports of atypical presentations of COVID-19 and possible mimic conditions.This article summarises the current evidence surrounding atypical presentations of COVID-19 including neurological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, otorhinolaryngology and geriatric features. A case from our hospital of pneumocystis pneumonia initially suspected to be COVID-19 forms the basis for a discussion surrounding mimic conditions of COVID-19. The dual-process model of clinical reasoning is used to analyse the thought processes used to make a diagnosis of COVID-19, including consideration of the variety of differential diagnoses.While SARS-CoV-2 is likely to remain on the differential diagnostic list for a plethora of presentations for the foreseeable future, clinicians should be cautious of ignoring other potential diagnoses due to availability bias. An awareness of atypical presentations allows SARS-CoV-2 to be a differential so that it can be appropriately investigated. A knowledge of infectious mimics prevents COVID-19 from overshadowing other diagnoses, hence preventing delayed diagnosis or even misdiagnosis and consequent adverse outcomes for patients.","output":"COVID-19: to be or not to be; that is the diagnostic question"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic. Since then hospitals have reduced inpatient and outpatient workflow and cancelled or suspended all non-emergent and routine surgical procedures. Our objective is to determine whether, during the COVID-19 period, there has been any modification in urological services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied the data from January-May 2020 and 2019 about the variables: number of operations, waiting list, visits in outpatient department, bladder instillations and urological emergencies and admission rates. RESULTS: Cancer cases high-risk for stage progression and surgical emergencies, were elected to proceed directly to treatment. The number of the operations was reduced by 43-65% from March-May 2020. Our surgical list had a waiting time of 6-8 weeks before the pandemic and now the waiting time has expanded to 12 weeks. Urological emergencies were reduced about 23-57%. Admission rates were dropped 10-51%. Visits in outpatient clinics were reduced 100-50% and outpatient procedures for elective cases were all deferred. Unfortunately, the hospital did not offer synchronous telehealth appointments. Bladder instillations of BCG or chemotherapeutics were not suspended but start of new cases had a delay of 2-3 weeks. There were no cases of COVID-19 in our department. CONCLUSION: All the variables of our urologic practice were affected during the COVID era. The impact of the reduced model of outpatient and inpatient workflow on the health of our patients is unknown. However, longer waiting lists are expected.

The subject matter of this research involves exploring the relevant literature regarding passive immunity in fight against the virus. It is expected that different vaccine platforms such as traditional recombinant protein, macromolecule DNA and mRNA, and nonreplicating and replicating viral vectors could be helpful if utilized properly. This article is going to discuss all these platforms and recent developments regarding the formulation of the vaccine. It is going to highlight the need for the production and distribution of the medicines along with challenges that are present in this task. The facts involving social, political, and economic aftermath would also be discussed in the current research. There is no doubt that biotechnology is going to provide a sound foundation to fight with upcoming health-related challenges. Along with the exploration of this fact, the article is going to prove a case for effective collaboration among all stakeholders such as government, academia, health sector, and civil society.

Nubeam represents nucleotides by matrices, transforms a read into a product of matrices, and assigns numbers to reads based on the product matrix. Nubeam capitalizes on the noncommutative property of matrix multiplication, such that different reads are assigned different numbers and similar reads similar numbers. A sample, which is a collection of reads, becomes a collection of numbers that form an empirical distribution. We demonstrate that the genetic difference between samples can be quantified by the distance between empirical distributions. Nubeam includes the k-mer method as a special case, but unlike the k-mer method, it is convenient for Nubeam to account for GC bias and nucleotide quality. As a reference-free approach, Nubeam avoids reference bias and mapping bias, and can work with organisms without reference genomes. Thus, Nubeam is ideal to analyze data sets from metagenomics whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing, where the amount of unmapped reads is substantial. When applied to a WGS sequencing data set to quantify distances between metagenomics samples from various human body habitats, Nubeam recapitulates findings made by mapping-based methods and sheds light on contributions of unmapped reads. Nubeam is also useful in analyzing 16S rRNA sequencing data, which is a more prevalent type of data set in metagenomics studies. In our analysis, Nubeam recapitulated the findings that natural microbiota in mouse gut are resilient under challenges, and Nubeam detected differences in vaginal microbiota between cases of polycystic ovary syndrome and healthy controls.","output":"The Nubeam reference-free approach to analyze metagenomic sequencing reads"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged from Wuhan, China, causing symptoms in humans similar to those caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Since the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, extensive structural analyses have revealed key atomic-level interactions between the SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. Here, we analyzed the potential receptor usage by 2019-nCoV, based on the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the newly released sequence of 2019-nCoV. First, the sequence of 2019-nCoV RBD, including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2, is similar to that of SARS-CoV, strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its receptor. Second, several critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Gln493) provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with 2019-nCoV's capacity for human cell infection. Third, several other critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Asn501) are compatible with, but not ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that 2019-nCoV has acquired some capacity for human-to-human transmission. Last, while phylogenetic analysis indicates a bat origin of 2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoV also potentially recognizes ACE2 from a diversity of animal species (except mice and rats), implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for 2019-nCoV infections. These analyses provide insights into the receptor usage, cell entry, host cell infectivity and animal origin of 2019-nCoV and may help epidemic surveillance and preventive measures against 2019-nCoV.IMPORTANCE The recent emergence of Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) puts the world on alert. 2019-nCoV is reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 to 2003. Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. One of the goals of SARS-CoV research was to build an atomic-level iterative framework of virus-receptor interactions to facilitate epidemic surveillance, predict species-specific receptor usage, and identify potential animal hosts and animal models of viruses. Based on the sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, we apply this predictive framework to provide novel insights into the receptor usage and likely host range of 2019-nCoV. This study provides a robust test of this reiterative framework, providing the basic, translational, and public health research communities with predictive insights that may help study and battle this novel 2019-nCoV.","output":"Receptor Recognition by the Novel Coronavirus from Wuhan: an Analysis Based on Decade-Long Structural Studies of SARS Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In today's tormented world, it appears useful to take advantage of communication channels to promote life-course immunization and affirm its major role in healthy ageing.

We therefore aimed to estimate the impact of coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza on the disease outcomes compared with the single infection of SARS-CoV-2. Materials and Methods: We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI) to identify relevant articles up to July 9, 2021. Studies that assessed the effect of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza coinfection on disease outcomes or those with sufficient data to calculate risk factors were included. Risk effects were pooled using fixed or random effects model. Results: We ultimately identified 12 studies with 9,498 patients to evaluate the risk effects of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza coinfection on disease severity. Results indicated that coinfection was not significantly associated with mortality (OR = 0.85, 95%CI: 0.51, 1.43; p = 0.55, I(2) = 76.00%). However, mortality was found significantly decreased in the studies from China (OR = 0.51, 95%CI: 0.39, 0.68; I(2) = 26.50%), while significantly increased outside China (OR = 1.56, 95%CI: 1.12, 2.19; I(2) = 1.00%). Moreover, a lower risk for critical outcomes was detected among coinfection patients (OR = 0.64, 95%CI: 0.43, 0.97; p = 0.04, I(2) = 0.00%). Additionally, coinfection patients presented different laboratory indexes compared with the single SARS-CoV-2 infection, including lymphocyte counts and APTT. Conclusion: Our study revealed that coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza had no effect on overall mortality. However, risk for critical outcomes was lower in coinfection patients and different associations were detected in the studies from different regions and specific laboratory indexes.

Studies conducted early in the pandemic demonstrated dramatic decreases in outpatient antibiotic prescribing, particularly amongst agents typically used for respiratory infections. We observed a 33% decline in urgent care antibiotics prescribing during the COVID-19 pandemic in our urgent care clinics. We investigated the prescriber experience to elucidate factors influencing antibiotic use for respiratory conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic at two academic urgent care clinics. METHODS: We employed a mix method approach, first distributing a survey to all full-time prescribers. We then followed up with qualitative interviews (12 of 22 prescribers) which was conducted by a single, trained interviewer using a standardized guide. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Each transcription was independently reviewed and coded by two blinded investigators using standardized themes and adjudicated by a third investigator for stability, robustness, and interrater reliability. Individually, researchers identified and coded key themes and statements. These themes were then discussed as a group and combined where they shared meaning. This project was reviewed and deemed to be non-human subjects research by the Stanford University School of Medicine Panel on Human Subjects in Medical Research. RESULTS: A total of 20 of the 22 prescribers (13 MDs and 9 APPs) completed the survey (91% response rate). Notably, only 25% of prescribers agreed that COVID-19 had changed their antibiotic prescribing practices for patients with respiratory infections despite objective data that all prescribed less. In the qualitative interviews, we identified four major themes impacting the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing practices as shown in Table 1. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Urgent care prescribers attributed a decrease in antibiotic prescribing during COVID-19 to changes in patient expectations and knowledge base, a switch to telemedicine-based encounters, and changing epidemiology. These shifts could be utilized by outpatient antimicrobial stewardship efforts to sustain low prescribing rates for conditions in which antibiotics are generally not indicated.

The same applies to domestic hedgehogs, which are increasingly kept as pets. Considering the potential risk of infection to humans through close contact with hedgehogs or the contaminated environment they inhabit, current data on the prevalence of various zoonotic pathogens in these animals is desirable. ABSTRACT: Hedgehogs are small insectivorous mammals common across Europe, Asia, and Africa. The increased encroachment of humans into hedgehog habitats has disrupted the human-animal-environment interface. With growing interest in the zoonotic diseases of wildlife species, more studies have been devoted to this subject in the last few years. These papers provide information about known and new emerging diseases. Here we review the current knowledge regarding bacterial, viral, protozoic, and mycotic pathogens with zoonotic potential and assess the importance of hedgehogs as their carriers. Both wild and pet hedgehogs were included in the review. Data from several countries and various hedgehog species were included. The study shows the importance of hedgehogs as carriers of zoonotic diseases and reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens in varied habitats.","output":"Hedgehogs as a Potential Source of Zoonotic PathogensA Review and an Update of Knowledge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The importance of complete mental health in school context has recently begun to attract a lot of attention.

Even before the pandemic shutdowns, the incorporation of virtual laboratories within classroom education had brought transformations in teaching laboratory courses. Virtual laboratories were integrated as training platforms for complementing learning objectives in laboratory education especially during this pandemic imposed shutdown. In context of suspended face-to-face teaching, this study explores the role of virtual laboratories as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in ensuring the continuity of teaching-learning, providing alternative ways for skill training from home. As an innovative approach, the study presents push-pull mooring theory to analyze switching intention of users from offline conventional education to online education. The study explores the complements of physical experiments brought in with animations, simulations, and remote laboratory set-ups for providing skill trainings to learners. To test whether virtualization techniques have global impact in education sector, the study included a comparative analysis of student users during the academic year 2019 (before-COVID) who had a blended approach of learning and those of the year 2020 (post-COVID), with remote learning. Initial before-COVID behavioral analysis on university students (n = 1059) indicated the substantial popularity of virtual laboratories in education for skill training and instructor dependency. Usage adoption of virtual laboratories increased during the pandemic-imposed lockdowns and learners were being less instructor dependent. 24% of students accessed more 10 times a week without the instructor being present and overall, 90% contributed to a minimum of 5 usages a week. In terms of Kolb's learning styles, most of the virtual laboratory learners were assimilators. The results suggest virtual laboratories may have a prominent role in inquiry based and self-guided education with minimum instructor dependency, which may be crucial for complementing practice skills and planning online tools to add to this post-COVID-19 teaching and learning scenarios.","output":"What virtual laboratory usage tells us about laboratory skill education pre- and post-COVID-19: Focus on usage, behavior, intention and adoption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[RESUMEN].

Review of the mechanistic entry, sexual transmission and viral impacts for patients during major recent viral outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV), Ebola virus (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV), and SARS-coronavirus 2 (CoV-2) (the virus which causes COVID-19) provides a framework to discuss this potential. AIM: Comparative analysis of prior viral presence on seminal fluid against current (preliminary) findings for SARS-CoV-2 to predict biological implications of the novel coronavirus upon current sexual transmissibility, viral presence, and reproductive health. METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: Literature review was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar databases. ZIKV and EBOV were found to be present in semen and to be sexually transmitted, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to update their guidelines on prevention of the two viruses to include refraining from sexual contact. There are conflicting studies regarding the presence of SARS-CoV in male reproductive tissue, but it has been linked to testicular atrophy and orchitis. To date, two studies have detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in semen, while seven studies have reported no positive detection. CONCLUSIONS: Though unlikely in the majority of cases, SARS-CoV-2 can potentially be present in seminal fluid, although there are no reports of sexual transmission to date. Prior epidemics raise significant concerns regarding the long-term reproductive health capacity for patients who are affected by entry of Sars-CoV-2 into the reproductive tract, therefore more study is needed to clarify the impacts to reproductive health.","output":"Comparative analysis of viral infection outcomes in human seminal fluid from prior viral epidemics and Sars-CoV-2 may offer trends for viral sexual transmissibility and long-term reproductive health implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The treatment of endocrinopathies in haemoglobinopathies is a continually expanding research area; therefore, recommendations supporting the appropriateness of treatments are a pressing need for the medical community.

Material and Methods: Key informants were interviewed and available online materials were used. Results: The pandemic has resulted to a significant increase in unemployment. The uncertainty, instability, and insecurity is high particularly those in non-standard forms of employment, and informal workers. This situation has led to low morale and self-esteem, high stress and anxiety. Womens vulnerability during the pandemic is multi-dimensional. Denial of access to health services is experienced. As frontline health workers, there is no PPE fit for their ergonomic requirements and are more likely to get infected from the virus than men. They also bear the burden of psychological effects of increased patients death, physical burnout, and long shifts. Those who need to isolate themselves from their families, the feeling of guilt is overwhelming as they are torn between their productive and reproductive roles. Second shift is also a concern for women on work from home arrangement. Their time to rest and sleep are disrupted. For working women living in poverty, the endless anxiety of finding ways to make both ends meet, lack of basic services at home, and cramp spaces make the situation harder to bear.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of MNT on the improvement of steatohepatitis in patients with NAFLD taking antihyperlipidemic medications. Methods: Nondiabetic patients with dyslipidemia were prospectively randomized (1:1) either to the MNT group or the control group with standard advice for 48 weeks with simultaneous statin/ezetimibe combination pharmacotherapy at three tertiary centers in Korea.

Contact tracing using smartphone technology is a powerful tool that may be employed to limit disease transmission during an epidemic or pandemic; yet, contact tracing apps present significant privacy concerns regarding the collection of personal data such as location. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop an effective contact tracing smartphone app that respects user privacy by not collecting location information or other personal data. METHODS: We propose the use of an anonymized graph of interpersonal interactions to conduct a novel form of contact tracing and have developed a proof-of-concept smartphone app that implements this approach. Additionally, we developed a computer simulation model that demonstrates the impact of our proposal on epidemic or pandemic outbreak trajectories across multiple rates of adoption. RESULTS: Our proof-of-concept smartphone app allows users to create checkpoints for contact tracing, check their risk level based on their past interactions, and anonymously self-report a positive status to their peer network. Our simulation results suggest that higher adoption rates of such an app may result in a better controlled epidemic or pandemic outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed smartphone-based contact tracing method presents a novel solution that preserves privacy while demonstrating the potential to suppress an epidemic or pandemic outbreak. This app could potentially be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as other epidemics or pandemics in the future to achieve a middle ground between drastic isolation measures and unmitigated disease spread.","output":"Peer-to-Peer Contact Tracing: Development of a Privacy-Preserving Smartphone App"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper provides an estimation of the accumulated detection rates and the accumulated number of infected individuals by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Worldwide, on July 20, it has been estimated above 160 million individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 Moreover, it is found that only about 1 out of 11 infected individuals are detected In an information context in which population-based seroepidemiological studies are not frequently available, this study shows a parsimonious alternative to provide estimates of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals By comparing our estimates with those provided by the population-based seroepidemiological ENE-COVID study in Spain, we confirm the utility of our approach Then, using a cross-country regression, we investigated if differences in detection rates are associated with differences in the cumulative number of deaths The hypothesis investigated in this study is that higher levels of detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections can reduce the risk exposure of the susceptible population with a relatively higher risk of death Our results show that, on average, detecting 5 instead of 35 percent of the infections is associated with multiplying the number of deaths by a factor of about 6 Using this result, we estimated that 120 days after the pandemic outbreak, if the US would have tested with the same intensity as South Korea, about 85,000 out of their 126,000 reported deaths could have been avoided ?

Currently, various initiatives collect sales data of veterinary antimicrobials, thereby providing an overview of quantities on the market. However, sales data collected at the level of wholesalers or marketing authorization holders are of limited use to associate with the prevalence of bacterial resistances at species level. We converted sales data to the number of potential treatments of calves and pigs in Switzerland for the years 2011 to 2015 using animal course doses (ACD). For each authorized product, the number of potential therapies was derived from the sales at wholesaler's level and the ACD in mg per kg. For products registered for use in multiple species, a percentage of the sales was attributed to each authorized species according to their biomass distribution. We estimated a total of 5,914,349 therapies for pigs and 1,407,450 for calves in 2015. Using the number of slaughtered animals for that year as denominator, we calculated a treatment intensity of 2.15 therapies per pig and 5.96 per calf. Between 2011 and 2015, sales of veterinary antimicrobials decreased by 30%. The calculated number of potential therapies decreased by 30% for pigs and 15% for calves. An analysis of treatment intensity at antimicrobial class level showed a decrease of 64% for colistin used in pigs, and of 7% for macrolides used in both pigs and calves. Whereas the use of 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins in calves decreased by 15.8%, usage of fluoroquinolones increased by 10.8% in the same period. Corresponding values for pigs were ?16.4 and +0.7%. This is the first extrapolation of antimicrobial usage at product level for pigs and calves in Switzerland. It shows that calves were more frequently treated than pigs with a decreasing trend for both number of therapies and use of colistin, macrolides and cephalosporins 3rd and 4th generations. Nonetheless, we calculated an increase in the usage of fluoroquinolones. Altogether, this study's outcomes allow for trend analysis and can be used to assess the relationship between antimicrobial use and resistance at the national level.","output":"Extrapolating Antibiotic Sales to Number of Treated Animals: Treatments in Pigs and Calves in Switzerland, 2011C2015"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In mammals, temperature-sensitive TRP channels make membrane conductance of cells extremely temperature dependent, allowing the detection of temperature ranging from noxious cold to noxious heat.

Deletion of the last 36 amino acids of the CTD transforms TRPM8 into a reduced temperature-sensitivity channel (Q10 4). Exposing the intracellular domain to a denaturing agent increases the energy required to open the channel indicating that cold drives channel gating by stabilizing the folded state of the CTD. Experiments in the presence of an osmoticant agent suggest that channel gating involves a change in solute-inaccessible volume in the CTD of 1,900 ?3 This volume matches the void space inside the coiled coil according to the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of TRPM8.

In Japan, states of emergency have been declared in specific prefectures to reduce public movement and control COVID-19 transmission. We investigated how familiarity with the COVID-19 infection affected self-restraint related to outing behaviors during state of emergency declarations in Japan. MethodsA prospective cohort study was conducted among workers aged 20-65 years using data from an internet survey. The baseline survey was conducted on December 22-25, 2020, and a follow-up survey was on February 18-19, 2021. There were 19,941 participants who completed both surveys and were included in the final analysis. We set self-restraint regarding outing behaviors after the second state of emergency was declared in January 2021 as the dependent variable, and levels of familiarity with COVID-19 infection as independent variables. Odds ratios were estimated using multilevel logistic analyses. ResultsSignificant differences by familiarity with COVID-19 infection were identified: compared with people without a history of COVID-19 or close contact with cases of confirmed COVID-19, and those whose acquaintances had not been diagnosed with COVID-19, people with a history of COVID-19 did not refrain from most outing behaviors. People with an acquaintance diagnosed with COVID-19 were significantly more likely to refrain from most outing behaviors. There was no significant difference in any outing behavior for people with a history of close contact only.

However, the major challenge in regard to recovering metals from SLBs using traditional bioleaching is the low Co yield. To overcome this issue, a mixed culture of Acidithiobacillus caldus and Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans was designed for use in SLBs leaching in this study. With the assistance of Fe2+ as a reductant, 99% of Co and 100% of Li were leached using the above mixed-culture bioleaching (MCB) process, thus solving the problem of low metal leaching efficiency from SLBs. Analysis of the underlying mechanism revealed that the effective extraction of metals from SLBs by the Fe2+-MCB process relied on Fe2+-releasing electrons to reduce refractory Co(III) to Co(II) that can be easily bioleached. Finally, the hazardous SLBs was transformed into a non-toxic material after treatment utilizing the Fe2+-MCB process. However, effective SLBs leaching was not achieved by the addition of Fe0 to the MCB system. Only 25% Co and 31% Li yields were obtained, as the addition of Fe0 caused acid consumption and bacterial apoptosis. Overall, this study revealed that reductants that cause acid consumption and harm bacteria should be ruled out for use in reductant-assisted bioleaching processes for extracting metals from SLBs.","output":"Feasibility of reduced iron species for promoting Li and Co recovery from spent LiCoO2 batteries using a mixed-culture bioleaching process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To justify the allocation of human and financial resources, this study aims to identify multiple stakeholders views of medical education research priorities in Pakistan for the next five years.

Presumably, the pandemic will have a by far bigger impact on the UK African trade than a no-deal Brexit. In Sub-Saharan Africa, South Africa had been arguably the hardest hit country both by Brexit and Corona. However, the poor, mainly working in the informal sector, were more concerned about the economic impact of the pandemic than the disease itself. In Nigeria, many people envisaged Corona as a plague of the rich and the elite. President Buhari shared the hubris of many British that they are less vulnerable to the pandemic and could continue with high-flying Post-Brexit plans. Ghana counts among those countries in Sub-Sahara Africa which has been most severely hit by the Corona pandemic. But unlike South Africa and Nigeria, the direct effects of the pandemic on the downturn of its economy are not as significant as in other African states. In Kenya the number of Corona-death had been much lower than for the SARS pandemic of 2003, but the transmission of the COVID-19 virus had been significantly greater. Nevertheless, many Kenyans saw the Brexit as a disguised blessing because they pined their hope on massive FDI by UK investors. In any case, it is clear beyond doubt that those who are to suffer most by the combined effects of the Corona-pandemic and Brexit in Africa (and presumably world-wide) are the poor and vulnerable.

En Afrique subsaharienne, l'Afrique du Sud a probablement t le pays le plus durement touch par le Brexit et Corona. Cependant, les pauvres, travaillant principalement dans le secteur informel, taient plus proccups par l'impact conomique de la pandmie que par la maladie elle-mme.

Nanmoins, de nombreux Kenyans ont vu le Brexit comme une bndiction dguise, car ils portaient leur espoir sur le IDE massif des investisseurs britanniques. En tout tat de cause, il est clair, sans aucun doute, que ceux qui souffriront le plus des effets combins de la pandmie Corona et du Brexit en Afrique (et vraisemblablement dans le monde entier) sont les pauvres et les vulnrables.

Those of current concern harbor mutations within the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that may be associated with viral escape to immune responses. In our geographical area a viral variant we named Marseille-4 harbors a S477a?N substitution in this RBD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We aimed to implement an in-house one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) assay with a hydrolysis probe that specifically detects the SARS-CoV-2 Marseille-4 variant. RESULTS: All 6 cDNA samples from Marseille-4 variant strains identified in our institute by genome next-generation sequencing (NGS) tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR, whereas all 32 cDNA samples from other variants tested negative. In addition, 39/42 (93 %) respiratory samples identified by NGS as containing a Marseille-4 variant strain and 0/26 samples identified as containing non-Marseille-4 variant strains were positive. Finally, 2018/3960 (51%) patients SARS-CoV-2-diagnosed in our institute, 10/277 (3.6 %) respiratory samples collected in Algeria, and none of 207 respiratory samples collected in Senegal, Morocco, or Lebanon tested positive using our Marseille-4 specific qPCR. DISCUSSION: Our in-house qPCR system was found reliable to detect specifically the Marseille-4 variant and allowed estimating it is involved in about half of our SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses since December 2020. Such approach allows the real-time surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants, which is warranted to monitor and assess their epidemiological and clinical characterics based on comprehensive sets of data.","output":"Implementation of an in-house real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay for the rapid detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Marseille-4 variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious coryza, caused by Avibacterium paragallinarum, is an acute respiratory disease of poultry that can result in substantial morbidity, mortality, and economic losses.

Antemortem evaluation revealed severe neurologic signs, including disorientation, torticollis, and opisthotonos. Swollen head-like syndrome and sinusitis were also present. Histologically, severe sinusitis, cranial osteomyelitis, otitis media and interna, and meningoencephalitis were noted, explaining the clinical signs described. A. paragallinarum was readily isolated from the upper and lower respiratory tract, brain, and cranial bones. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was also detected by PCR, and IBV was isolated in embryonated chicken eggs. Based on sequencing analysis, the IBV appeared 99% homologous to strain CA1737. A synergistic effect between A. paragallinarum and IBV, resulting in exacerbation of clinical signs and increased mortality, may have occurred in this case.

We hypothesized that interhospital transfer to endovascular-capable centers would result in treatment delays and worse clinical outcomes compared with direct presentation. METHODS STRATIS (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke) was a prospective, multicenter, observational, single-arm study of real-world MT for acute stroke because of anterior-circulation large-vessel occlusion performed at 55 sites over 2 years, including 1000 patients with severe stroke and treated within 8 hours. Patients underwent MT with or without intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and were admitted to endovascular-capable centers via either interhospital transfer or direct presentation. The primary clinical outcome was functional independence (modified Rankin Score 0-2) at 90 days. We assessed (1) real-world time metrics of stroke care delivery, (2) outcome differences between direct and transfer patients undergoing MT, and (3) the potential impact of local hospital bypass. RESULTS A total of 984 patients were analyzed. Median onset-to-revascularization time was 202.0 minutes for direct versus 311.5 minutes for transfer patients (P<0.001). Clinical outcomes were better in the direct group, with 60.0% (299/498) achieving functional independence compared with 52.2% (213/408) in the transfer group (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.79; P=0.02). Likewise, excellent outcome (modified Rankin Score 0-1) was achieved in 47.4% (236/498) of direct patients versus 38.0% (155/408) of transfer patients (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.92; P=0.005). Mortality did not differ between the 2 groups (15.1% for direct, 13.7% for transfer; P=0.55). Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator did not impact outcomes. Hypothetical bypass modeling for all transferred patients suggested that intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 12 minutes, but MT would be performed 91 minutes sooner if patients were routed directly to endovascular-capable centers. If bypass is limited to a 20-mile radius from onset, then intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 7 minutes and MT performed 94 minutes earlier. CONCLUSIONS In this large, real-world study, interhospital transfer was associated with significant treatment delays and lower chance of good outcome. Strategies to facilitate more rapid identification of large-vessel occlusion and direct routing to endovascular-capable centers for patients with severe stroke may improve outcomes.

Key groups where young workers are likely at a higher risk for occupational exposure to carcinogens were identified. Our work shows that young workers in construction, outdoor occupations, and farming are key groups that warrant further investigation. These specific groups are highlighted because of the large number of young workers employed in these sectors/situations, the high number of possible carcinogen exposures, and the potential for higher risk behavior patterns that typically occur in these types of jobs. While there is no data available to develop carcinogen exposure estimates specific to young workers, it is our perspective that young workers are likely at a higher risk for occupational exposure to carcinogens.

Ang (1C7) is part of the angiotensin\\\\converting enzymeCAng (1C7)CMas pathway which is considered to antagonize the reninCangiotensinCaldosterone system (RAAS). Since DPP3 inhibits the counteracting pathway of the RAAS, we hypothesize that DPP3 might be deleterious in the setting of heart failure. However, no data are available on DPP3 in chronic heart failure. We therefore investigated the clinical characteristics and outcome related to elevated DPP3 concentrations in patients with worsening heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: Dipeptidyl peptidase 3 was measured in 2156 serum samples of patients with worsening heart failure using luminometric immunoassay (DPP3\\\\LIA) by 4TEEN4 Pharmaceuticals GmbH, Hennigsdorf, Germany. Predictors of DPP3 levels were selected using multiple linear regression with stepwise backward selection. Median DPP3 concentration was 11.45 ng/mL with a range from 2.8 to 84.9 ng/mL. Patients with higher DPP3 concentrations had higher renin [78.3 (interquartile range, IQR 26.3C227.7) vs. 120.7 IU/mL (IQR 34.74C338.9), P < 0.001, for Q1C3 vs. Q4] and aldosterone [88 (IQR 44C179) vs. 116 IU/mL (IQR 46C241), P < 0.001, for Q1C3 vs. Q4] concentrations. The strongest independent predictors for higher concentration of DPP3 were log\\\\alanine aminotransferase, log\\\\total bilirubin, the absence of diabetes, higher osteopontin, fibroblast growth factor\\\\23 and N\\\\terminal pro\\\\B\\\\type natriuretic peptide concentrations (all P < 0.001). In univariable survival analysis, DPP3 was associated with mortality and the combined endpoint of death or heart failure hospitalization (P < 0.001 for both). After adjustment for confounders, this association was no longer significant. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with worsening heart failure, DPP3 is a marker of more severe disease with higher RAAS activity. It may be deleterious in heart failure by counteracting the Mas receptor pathway.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology and susceptibility profiles of Mucorales isolates in the United States over a 52-month period. Species identification was performed by combined phenotypic characteristics and DNA sequence analysis, and antifungal susceptibility testing was performed by CLSI M38 broth microdilution for amphotericin B, isavuconazole, itraconazole, and posaconazole. During this time frame, 854 isolates were included, representing 11 different genera and over 26 species, of which Rhizopus (58.6%) was the predominant genus, followed by Mucor (19.6%). The majority of isolates were cultured from the upper and lower respiratory tracts (55%). Amphotericin B demonstrated the most potent in vitro activity, with geometric mean (GM) MICs of 0.25 g/ml against all genera with the exception of Cunninghamella species (GM MIC of 1.30 g/ml).

Since inflammation is one of the major causes of COVID-19 complications, the associated molecular mechanisms have been the focus of many studies to better understand this disease and develop improved treatments for patients contracting SARS-CoV-2. Among these, strong emphasis has been placed on pro-inflammatory cytokines, associating severity of COVID-19 with so-called \\"cytokine storm.\\" More recently, peptide bradykinin, its dysregulated signaling or \\"bradykinin storm,\\" has emerged as a primary mechanism to explain COVID-19-related complications. Unfortunately, this important development may not fully capture the main molecular players that underlie the disease severity. To this end, in this focused review, several lines of evidence are provided to suggest that in addition to bradykinin, two closely related vasoactive peptides, substance P and neurotensin, are also likely to drive microvascular permeability and inflammation, and be responsible for development of COVID-19 pathology. Furthermore, based on published experimental observations, it is postulated that in addition to ACE and neprilysin, peptidase neurolysin (Nln) is also likely to contribute to accumulation of bradykinin, substance P and neurotensin, and progression of the disease.

These cells express a vast array of membrane receptors that allow them to recognize and eliminate infectious agents effectively and respond appropriately to microenvironmental stimuli that regulate neutrophil functions, such as activation, migration, generation of reactive oxygen species, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, and mediator secretion, among others. Currently, it has been realized that activated neutrophils can accomplish their effector functions and simultaneously activate mechanisms of cell death in response to different intracellular or extracellular factors. Although several studies have revealed similarities between the mechanisms of cell death of neutrophils and other cell types, neutrophils have distinctive properties, such as a high production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS), that are important for their effector function in infections and pathologies such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and immunodeficiencies, influencing their cell death mechanisms. The present work offers a synthesis of the conditions and molecules implicated in the regulation and activation of the processes of neutrophil death: apoptosis, autophagy, pyroptosis, necroptosis, NETosis, and necrosis. This information allows to understand the duality encountered by PMNs upon activation. The effector functions are carried out to eliminate invading pathogens, but in several instances, these functions involve activation of signaling cascades that culminate in the death of the neutrophil. This process guarantees the correct elimination of pathogenic agents, damaged or senescent cells, and the timely resolution of the inflammation that is essential for the maintenance of homeostasis in the organism.

Aggregate numbers of cases are essential in modeling the epidemic and planning responses; however, more detailed analysis of risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are needed. Our study provides an initial examination of characteristics associated with receiving a doctor's diagnosis of COVID-19 among a nationally representative sample of Brazilians aged 50 and over. Data are derived from the second wave of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil) and a telephone follow-up survey to ELSI-Brazil participants, known as the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative. The telephone survey was conducted between 26 May and 8 June 2020. Results show that about 2.4% (n = 70) of the sample reported being told by a doctor they had COVID-19, however, only about half of these individuals (n = 37) reported receiving a diagnostic confirmation from viral testing (RT-PCR). Demographic factors (aged 50-60 years), socioeconomic factors (lower household income), health-related factors (obesity, three or more chronic conditions), and geography (living in the Northern region of the country) were positively associated with reporting a COVID-19 diagnosis. Despite the descriptive and preliminary nature of these findings, results reported here suggest the need for more targeted approaches to enhance personal protection and provide greater viral testing options, especially for older, sicker and more vulnerable adults in Brazil.","output":"Prevalence and characteristics of Brazilians aged 50 and over that received a doctor's diagnosis of COVID-19: the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is an inherited, neurodegenerative rare disease that can result in devastating symptoms of blindness, gait disturbances, and spastic quadriparesis due to progressive demyelination.

With limited treatments available, efforts to determine an effective therapy that can alter disease progression or mitigate symptoms have been undertaken for many years, particularly through drug repurposing. Repurposing has generally been guided through clinical experience and small trials. At this time, none of the drug candidates have been approved for use, which may be due, in part, to the lack of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) information on the repurposed medications in the target patient population. Greater consideration for the disease pathophysiology, drug pharmacology, and potential drug-target interactions, specifically at the site of action, would improve drug repurposing and facilitate drug development.

However, nearly no empirical studies or reports have been carried out to investigate the effectiveness of those measures. Aim: This study aimed at examining the effectiveness of business response measures to COVID-19 impact on business outcome. Setting: This study focused on businesses that are value-added tax (VAT) registered. Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was used. The authors applied logistic regression technique to analyse the effectiveness of business response measures on business outcome. Results: The authors found evidence that business responses such as virtual connection, innovative e-commerce and increasing working hours are more effective business responses, whilst decreasing work hours, laying off workers temporarily and ordinary e-commerce are less effective measures against the impact of the outbreak. Furthermore, business characteristics such as industry type (e.g. agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing and electricity, gas and water supply) are more resilient to COVID-19 shock, whilst pure export market and small businesses, secondary and tertiary, are significantly less resilient. Conclusions: Firstly, the study shows that some business responses are more effective in remediating the adverse impact of COVID-19 and therefore recommends policy intervention and industrial actions to promote them. Secondly, it is also recommended that financial bailout and/or Internet infrastructure and domestic support for small and export businesses could make them more resilient to the adverse impact of the outbreak.","output":"Business response to COVID-19 impact: Effectiveness analysis in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to construct chimeric cDNAs that encode the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (G) linked to the cytoplasmic domain of either the immunoglobulin mu membrane heavy chain, the hemagglutinin glycoprotein of influenza virus, or the small glycoprotein (p23) of infectious bronchitis virus. Biochemical analyses and immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that these hybrid genes were correctly expressed in eukaryotic cells and that the hybrid proteins were transported to the plasma membrane. The rate of transport to the Golgi complex of G protein with an immunoglobulin mu membrane cytoplasmic domain was approximately sixfold slower than G protein with its normal cytoplasmic domain. However, this rate was virtually identical to the rate of transport of micron heavy chain molecules measured in the B cell line WEHI 231. The rate of transport of G protein with a hemagglutinin cytoplasmic domain was threefold slower than wild type G protein and G protein with a p23 cytoplasmic domain, which were transported at similar rates. The combined results underscore the importance of the amino acid sequence in the cytoplasmic domain for efficient transport of G protein to the cell surface. Also, normal cytoplasmic domains from other transmembrane glycoproteins can substitute for the G protein cytoplasmic domain in transport of G protein to the plasma membrane.

As the pandemic spread throughout Italy, mental health concerns increased for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), who are at greater risk. The aim was to pilot a Telehealth Psychological Support Intervention for pwCF and caregivers to reduce stress, depression, and anxiety during the lockdown in Italy in March 2020. METHODS: This intervention utilized cognitive behavioral skills (e.g., cognitive reframing). Participants included 16 pwCF and 14 parents, who completed four individual telehealth sessions with a psychologist. Stress ratings, Patient Health Questionnaire and General Anxiety Disorder, PHQ-8 and GAD-7, were completed, in addition to Feasibility and Satisfaction ratings. RESULTS: Ratings of stress significantly decreased from pre- to post-testing for pwCF (paired t(14) = -4.06, p < .01) and parents (paired t = -5.2, p < .001). A large percentage of both groups scored in the clinical range for depression and anxiety at baseline (pwCF: depression/anxiety = 71%; parents: depression = 57%; anxiety = 79%); a large proportion (20%-40%) reported moderate to severe symptomatology. Significant reductions in depression for pwCF were found (pre: M = 8.0 to post: M = 4.7; paired t(14) = 2.8, p < .05) but not anxiety (pre: M = 6.9 to post: M = 5.6, t(14) = 1.2, p = NS-non-significant). Parental depression decreased for parents (pre: M = 6.4 to post: M = 5.1, t(14) = -2.5, p < .05), but not anxiety (pre: M = 8.1 to post: M = 7.9, t(14) = -0.2, p = NS). Feasibility and Satisfaction were positive. CONCLUSION: This telehealth intervention yielded reductions in stress and depression for participants.

Thus, in the present study, we examined whether MCLR exposure affects seizures induced by a low dose of kainic acid (KA; 0.05a?g, i.c.v.) administration. KA-induced seizure occurrence and seizure score significantly increased after repeated exposure to MCLR (2.5 or 5.0a?g/kg, i.p., once a day for 10 days), but not after acute MCLR exposure (2.5 or 5.0a?g/kg, i.p., 2a?h and 30a?min prior to KA administration), and hippocampal neuronal loss was consistently facilitated by repeated exposure to MCLR. In addition, repeated MCLR significantly elevated the membrane expression of kainate receptor GluK2 subunits, p-pan-protein kinase C (PKC), and p-extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) at 1a?h after KA. However, KA-induced membrane expression of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) was significantly reduced by repeated MCLR exposure. Consistent with the enhanced seizures and neurodegeneration, MCLR exposure significantly potentiated KA-induced oxidative stress and microglial activation, which was accompanied by increased expression of p-ERK and p-PKC? in the hippocampus.

The intervention has been derived from our systematic review and meta-analysis findings and optimised through patient and public involvement and multidisciplinary team input. Methods: This study is a multicentre randomised controlled parallel arm trial with a three month follow up. 210 eligible people aged 65 and over, no more than mildly frail, will be recruited in seven PC practices in Ireland and randomly assigned to 'intervention' or 'usual care'. Intervention participants will be provided a leaflet with strength exercises, protein dietary guidance and educational discussion. Baseline measurements will include demographics, health indicators, comorbidities, malnutrition universal screening tool (MUST), frailty status (SHARE-FI, CFS) and muscle mass (bioelectrical impedance).

This hyper-proinflammatory state involves activation of signaling by NFB and ENaC, and expression of high levels of cytokines and chemokines. Post-infection inflammation may contribute to \\"Long COVID\\", and there are also other long term consequences of acute severe COVID-19, which double or triple the chances of dying from any cause within a year. Enhanced signaling by NFB and ENaC also marks the airway of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, a lethal proinflammatory genetic disease due to inactivating mutations in the CFTR gene. We therefore hypothesized that inflammation in the COVID-19 airway might similarly be due to inhibition of CFTR signaling by SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Methods This hypothesis was tested using the hTERT-transformed BCi-NS1.1 basal stem cell, previously derived from small airway epithelia, which were differentiated into a model of small airway epithelia on an air-liquid-interface (ALI). Cyclic AMP-activated CFTR chloride channel activity was measured using an Ussing Chamber. Cell surface-CFTR was labeled with the impermeant biotin method. Results Exposure of differentiated airway epithelia to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein resulted in loss of CFTR protein expression. As hypothesized, TNF/NFB signaling was activated, based on increased protein expression of TRADD, the first intracellular adaptor for the TNF/TNFR1 complex, TNFR1, the TNF receptor, phosphorylated IB, and the chemokine IL8. ENaC activity was also activated, based on specific changes in molecular weights for  and  ENaC. Exposure of the epithelia to viral Spike protein suppressed cAMP-activated CFTR chloride channel activity. However, addition of 30 nM concentrations of cardiac glycoside drugs ouabain, digitoxin and digoxin, prevented loss of channel activity. ACE2 and CFTR were found to co-immunoprecipitate (co-IP) in both basal cells and epithelia, suggesting that the mechanism for Spike-dependent CFTR loss might involve ACE2 as a bridge between Spike and CFTR. In addition, Spike exposure to the epithelia resulted in failure of endosomal recycling to return CFTR to the plasma membrane, suggesting that failure of CFTR recovery from endosomal recycling might be a mechanism for Spike-dependent loss of CFTR. Conclusion Based on experiments with this model of small airway epithelia, we predict that inflammation in the COVID-19 airway may be mediated by inhibition of CFTR signaling by SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, thus inducing a CFTR-null, cystic fibrosis-like clinical phenotype. Descriptions of COVID-19 in CF carriers with only one copy of wildtype CFTR suggest that this model-based conclusion might be consistent with patient-based experience.","output":"Inflammation in the COVID-19 airway is due to inhibition of CFTR signaling by the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the lives of graduate student workers within university settings.

On the MoCA test, executive functions, particularly phonemic fluency, and attention, were impaired. In contrast, the total MoCA score, and memory and orientation subscores did not differ from expected ranges. Disease severity, premorbid condition, pulmonary function tests and hypoxia did not contribute to cognitive performance. Cognitive decline may affect otherwise healthy patients post-COVID, independent of disease severity. Our examination identified abnormalities in executive function, attention, and phonemic fluency.

While there is some knowledge on how high-tech product exports affect carbon dioxide emissions, the mechanisms involved in that link have not been adequately addressed in previous studies. This study is based on Chinas inter-provincial panel data from 2006 to 2017 and uses the stepwise regression method and the bootstrap method to systematically investigate the mediating effects of industrial structure supererogation, low-carbon technological innovation, and human capital accumulation, operating in the impact of high-tech product export trade on regional carbon performance. Since the Pesarans CD test and the P&Y slope homogeneity test confirm the presence of cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity in the panel data, we use the CADF and CIPS unit root tests to verify the stationarity of the variables and therefore employ the CCEMG and DCCE estimators for regression estimation. The research results show that high-tech product exports can help improve regional carbon performance. The mediating variables, industrial structure supererogation, low-carbon technological innovation, and human capital accumulation separately have positive and complete mediating effects on the link between high-tech product export trade and regional carbon performance. The research results highlight the important part of expanding high-tech product exports in improving regional carbon performance and have significance in promoting Chinas green and low-carbon transition.","output":"The impact of high-tech product export trade on regional carbon performance in China: the mediating roles of industrial structure supererogation, low-carbon technological innovation, and human capital accumulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has become a general practice worldwide to wear a face mask serving as a barrier against the transmission of pathogens.

First, the number of excess deaths has contributed to an immense number of bereaved individuals. Second, recent literature has shown that circumstances associated with COVID-19 deaths may be contributing to increased risk for the development of prolonged grief disorder. OBJECTIVE: To best support those affected by loss during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to inform clinicians and researchers about the development, the nature and the treatment of prolonged grief disorder and employ sound research. METHOD: In this editorial, we discuss important themes regarding prolonged grief disorder in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, to gather and present useful information for clinicians and researchers. RESULTS: The following themes were addressed: 1. Harmonization in the diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder. 2. Screening tools and interventions. 3. Pharmacotherapy. 4. Special attention for the elderly. 5. Special attention for children and adolescents. 6. A causal system perspective for understanding grief and prolonged grief disorder.

Understanding spatial heterogeneity in relation to the socio-environmental determinant and COVID-19-related outcomes is central to target interventions toward a vulnerable population. Objectives: To determine the spatial variability of COVID-19 related outcomes among the elderly in France at the department level. We also aimed to assess whether a geographic pattern of Covid-19 may be partially explained by spatial distribution of both long-term exposure to air pollution and deprived living conditions. Methods: This study considered four health events related to COVID-19 infection over the period of 18 March and 02 December 2020: (i) hospitalization, (ii) cases in intensive health care in the hospital, (iii) death in the hospital, and (iv) hospitalized patients recovered and returned back home. We used the percentage of household living in an overcrowding housing to characterize the living conditions and long-term exposure to NO(2) to analyse the implication of air pollution. Using a spatial scan statistic approach, a Poisson cluster analysis method based on a likelihood ratio test and Monte Carlo replications was applied to identify high-risk clusters of a COVID-19-related outcome. Result: our results revealed that all the outcomes related to COVID-19 infection investigated were not randomly distributed in France with a statistically significant cluster of high risk located in Eastern France of the hospitalization, cases in the intensive health care at the hospital, death in the hospital, and recovered and returned back home compared to the rest of France (relative risk, RR = 1.28, p-value = 0.001, RR = 3.05, p = 0.001, RR = 2.94, p = 0.001, RR = 2.51, p = 0.001, respectively). After adjustments for socio-environmental determinants, the crude cluster shifts according to different scenarios suggested that both the overcrowding housing level and long-term exposure to largely NO(2) explain the spatial distribution of COVID-19-related outcomes. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the geographic pattern of COVID-19-related outcomes is largely explained by socio-spatial distribution of long-term exposure to NO(2). However, to better understand spatial variations of COVID-19-related outcomes, it would be necessary to investigate and adjust it for other determinants.

A systematic search of six academic databases was conducted through October 2020. Studies were included if they reported full economic evaluations of interventions aimed at preventing overweight or obesity, or interventions aimed at improving obesity-related behaviors, with at least one intervention component delivered by telephone (telehealth) or web-based technology (eHealth). Findings were reported narratively, based on the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards. Twenty-seven economic evaluations were included from 20 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Sixteen of the included interventions had a telehealth component, whereas 11 had an eHealth component. Seventeen interventions were evaluated using cost-utility analysis, five with cost-effectiveness analysis, and five undertook both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses. Only eight cost-utility analyses reported that the intervention was cost-effective. Comparison of results from cost-effectiveness analyses was limited by heterogeneity in methods and outcome units reported. The evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness of interventions with a telehealth or eHealth delivery component is currently inconclusive.

The typical low abundance of membrane proteins in their natural hosts makes it necessary to overexpress these proteins either in heterologous systems or through in vitro translation/cell-free expression. Heterologous expression of proteins, in turn, leads to multiple obstacles, owing to the unpredictability of compatibility of the target protein for expression in a given host. The highly hydrophobic and (or) amphipathic nature of membrane proteins also leads to challenges in producing a homogeneous, stable, and pure sample for structural studies. Circumventing these hurdles has become possible through the introduction of novel protein production protocols; efficient protein isolation and sample preparation methods; and, improvement in hardware and software for structural characterization. Combined, these advances have made the past 10-15 years very exciting and eventful for the field of membrane protein structural biology, with an exponential growth in the number of solved membrane protein structures. In this review, we focus on both the advances and diversity of protein production and purification methods that have allowed this growth in structural knowledge of membrane proteins through X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).","output":"Current strategies for protein production and purification enabling membrane protein structural biology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we report that acute reduction in mitochondrial translation fidelity (MTF) causes ubiquitination of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) proteins, including TRAP1 and CPOX, which occurs selectively in mitochondria with a severed outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM).

This process occurs downstream of the accumulation of cytochrome c/CPOX in a subset of mitochondria heterogeneously distributed throughout the cell (\\"mosaic distribution\\"). Formation of mosaic mitochondria, OMM severing, and IMM ubiquitination require active mitochondrial translation and mitochondrial fission, but not the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak. In contrast, in Parkin-overexpressing cells, MTF reduction does not lead to the severing of the OMM or IMM ubiquitination, but it does induce Drp1-independent ubiquitination of the OMM. Furthermore, high-cytochrome c/CPOX mitochondria are preferentially targeted by Parkin, indicating that in the context of reduced MTF, they are mitophagy intermediates regardless of Parkin expression. In sum, Parkin-deficient cells adapt to mitochondrial proteotoxicity through a Drp1-mediated mechanism that involves the severing of the OMM and autophagy targeting ubiquitinated IMM proteins.","output":"Parkin-independent mitophagy via Drp1-mediated outer membrane severing and inner membrane ubiquitination."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Risk assessment is a prominent feature of managed migration regimes How risk is conceptualised and operationalised, however, is highly contested terrain The extent to which immigration detention represents an appropriate response to specific risks posed by people with contingent or no legal status is particularly hotly debated In the UK, an early adopter and until recently an eager developer of detention , the policy is that immigration officers carry out individualised risk assessments on each person detained, considering removal prospects, risk of flight, and offending as well as the risk of harm to the individual Drawing on published reports, government statistics, and interviews with close observers, this article explores the premises, policy, practice, and outcomes of these processes The analysis flags multiple issues, suggesting that risk evaluation in relation to immigration detention is far from a well-oiled and reliable machine, causes unnecessary human harm, operates in a way that generates unforeseen risks for wider society, and points to other logics shaping detention","output":"What are we afraid of?

From an apparently rare clinical condition occurring only sporadically or in small outbreaks before the late nineteenth century, poliomyelitis had, by the early 1950s, developed into a globally distributed epidemic disease. But, from 1955, continued growth was suddenly and dramatically reversed by the mass administration of inactivated (killed) and live (attenuated) poliovirus vaccines. After almost half a century of vaccine control, the world now stands on the brink of the global eradication of the disease. Against this background, the article draws upon information included in the U.S. Public Health Service's Public Health Reports and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report to examine the spatial dynamics of poliomyelitis during the phases of epidemic emergence (1910-1955) and vaccine-induced retreat (1955-1971) in the United States. It is shown that epidemic emergence was accompanied by shifts in the spatial center of activity from early diffusion poles in the northeastern states, to the western seaboard, and then finally to cover all the states of the Union. This was accompanied by accelerating epidemic propagation. The introduction of mass vaccination from the mid-1950s realigned spatial transmission of the disease, producing increased spatial volatility in the geographical center of activity and heightened dependence of epidemic outbreaks upon endemic reservoirs in the most populous states. Finally, the empirical results are generalized to suggest that the emergence and reemergence of many infectious diseases is a distinctively geographical process.","output":"The Spatial Dynamics of Poliomyelitis in the United States: From Epidemic Emergence to Vaccine-Induced Retreat, 1910-1971."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Idiopathic edema (IE), a disorder of females, is characterized by edema and weight gains exceeding 1.4 kg while assuming an upright position followed by nocturia and returning to a non-edematous baseline weight in the morning.

We present four cases with differing degrees of IE who were successfully managed by manipulating Starling's forces. While we could not alter the increase in VMP, manipulating oncotic and hydrostatic pressures between both compartments were untenable except to decrease intravascular hydrostatic pressure by sodium restriction. All four cases virtually eliminated daily weight gains and nocturia to improve quality of life considerably, two with the assistance of daily hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and all four by furosemide to accelerate recovery from the weight gain to permit occasional dietary indiscretions to improve quality of life. Two cases with milder forms of IE did not quantify sodium intake as meticulously as cases one and four, who appeared to have greater increases in VMP. IE can be treated successfully by sodium restriction with or without use of HCTZ and furosemide to eliminate the distressing edema, weight gain and nocturia with marked improvement in emotional instability after understanding that the weight gains and nocturia were linked to dietary intake of sodium.","output":"Pathophysiologic Approach to Understanding and Successfully Treating Idiopathic Edema: Unappreciated Importance of Nocturia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell cultures has been shown to be inhibited by ivermectin.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at evaluating the safety of a novel ivermectin inhalable formulation in rats as a pre-clinical step. METHODS: Hydroxy propyl--cyclodextrin (HP--CD) was used to formulate readily soluble ivermectin lyophilized powder. Adult male rats were used to test lung toxicity for ivermectin-HP--CD formulations in doses of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg for 3 successive days. RESULTS: The X-ray diffraction for lyophilized ivermectin-HP--CD revealed its amorphous structure that increased drug aqueous solubility 127-fold and was rapidly dissolved within 5 seconds in saline. Pulmonary administration of ivermectin-HP--CD in doses of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg showed dose-dependent increase in levels of TNF-, IL-6, IL-13 and ICAM-1 as well as gene expression of MCP-1, protein expression of PIII-NP and serum levels of SP-D paralleled by reduction in IL-10. Moreover, lungs treated with ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg) revealed mild histopathological alterations, while severe pulmonary damage was seen in rats treated with ivermectin at doses of 0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg. However, ivermectin-HP--CD formulation administered in doses of 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg revealed safety profiles. CONCLUSION: The safety of inhaled ivermectin- HP--CD formulation is dose-dependent.

To facilitate the dynamic and efficient allocation of service resources, it is crucial to understand the factors linked with use of the services and number of hospital admissions arising from PE link service. METHODS: We initially use the Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) with polynomial effect functions of relevant covariates. If the time series of residuals from fitting the Poisson GLM reveals significant serial correlation, a Poisson generalized linear autoregressive moving average (GLARMA) model is refitted to the data to account for the auto-correlation among the time series of daily call numbers. If the data is overdispersed relative to the best fitting Poisson GLARMA model, then the negative binomial GLARMA model is refitted to account for any overdispersion. In all the models, dummy variables for weekdays and months are included to account for any cyclic trends due weekday effect or month of the year effect. The secular time trend is modeled by a polynomial function of calendar time over the study period. Finally any critical temperatures are identified by visually inspecting the graph of the effect function of temperature. RESULTS: The weekday and month effects are both significant with Monday seeing more PE Link calls than Sunday and June seeing less than January. Temperature has significant effect on the PE Link call rate with the effect highly nonlinear. A critical temperature, below which excessive increase in PE link calls that lead to hospital admissions, is identified to be around 15 C.

METHODS: The study was conducted in seven communities in the Ahanta West district of Ghana. This was a qualitative study using in-depth interviews (IDI) and focus group discussions (FGDs) for data collection. Participants were purposively selected from varied backgrounds to represent both beneficiaries and service providers directly involved in NTD programme implementation. Trained and experienced qualitative data collectors conducted the FGD and IDI sessions in the local Twi language, while health worker sessions were conducted in English. Discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed directly into English. Data was analysed using an iterative process. The transcripts were pre-coded using the broad themes, entered into a computer using Microsoft Word, and then imported into the MAXQDA software for thematic content analysis to select relevant representative narratives for presentation. RESULTS: Participants were aware of the COVID-19 pandemic and referred to it appropriately as coronavirus, COVID-19, and often as the new disease. Though many respondents could not describe the route of transmission, most of them reported that it is transmitted through touch or sharing of common items. They reported some signs/symptoms like fever, headache and difficulty breathing, and prevention methods like the use of hand sanitiser, washing of hands and sneezing appropriately. Respondents have reported that COVID-19 has negatively affected their daily lives by limiting their movements and therefore work. It also came to light that COVID-19 has also negatively affected the NTD programme implementation, especially mass drug administration (MDA) activities, leading to the postponement of the yearly MDA. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected clinic attendance; people are afraid that they may be tested for COVID-19 at the clinic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has negatively affected the NTD programme. Education and the provision of personal protective equipment will be required to build the confidence of frontline care providers including community drug distributors and community members in order to enhance quality service and participation in future MDA activities.

However, according to estimates in different countries, agriculture has suffered less than other sectors such as construction, industry and tourism, so agricultural development can be a good option to compensate for the economic damage caused to other sectors. The quality of available water and soil resources for agricultural development is not only limited, but is also decreasing incrementally, so the use of saline and unconventional soil and water resources is inevitable. Biosaline agriculture or haloculture is a system in which highly saline water and soil resources are used sustainably for the economic production of agricultural crops. It seems that in the current situation of the world (with COVID-19's impact on agriculture on the one hand and the quantitative and qualitative decline of freshwater and soil on the other), haloculture with a re-reading of territorial capabilities has good potential to provide a part of human food supply. In this review article, the potential of haloculture to offset the adverse impacts of the pandemic is analyzed from five perspectives: increasing the area under cultivation, using unconventional water, stabilizing dust centers, increasing the body's immune resistance, and reducing losses in agribusiness due to the coronavirus. Overall, haloculture is an essential system, which COVID-19 has accelerated in the agricultural sector.","output":"Haloculture: A system to mitigate the negative impacts of pandemics on the environment, society and economy, emphasizing COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The purpose of this study is to present 12-month follow-up results for a series of patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting with the Gateway-Wingspan stenting system (Boston Scientific) for the treatment of symptomatic intracranial atherostenosis. METHODS Clinical and angiographic follow-up results were recorded for patients from 5 participating institutions. Primary end points were stroke or death within 30 days of the stenting procedure or ipsilateral stroke after 30 days. RESULTS During a 21-month study period, 158 patients with 168 intracranial atherostenotic lesions (50% to 99%) were treated with the Gateway-Wingspan system. The average follow-up duration was 14.2 months with 143 patients having at least 3 months of clinical follow-up and 110 having at least 12 months. The cumulative rate of the primary end point was 15.7% for all patients and 13.9% for patients with high-grade (70% to 99%) stenosis. Of 13 ipsilateral strokes occurring after 30 days, 3 resulted in death. Of these strokes, 76.9% (10 of 13) occurred within the first 6 months of the stenting procedure and no events were recorded after 12 months. An additional 9 patients experienced ipsilateral transient ischemic attack after 30 days. Most postprocedural events (86%) could be attributed to interruption of antiplatelet medications (n=6), in-stent restenosis (n=12), or both (n=1). In 3 patients, the events were of uncertain etiology. CONCLUSIONS After successful Wingspan percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting, some patients continued to experience ipsilateral ischemic events. Most of these ischemic events occurred within 6 months of the procedure and were associated with the interruption of antiplatelet therapy or in-stent restenosis.","output":"U.S. Wingspan Registry: 12-month follow-up results."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Some public health measures restrict personal freedom more than others, and deciding what type of measure will be appropriate and effective has long been a problem for policy makers. Existing bioethical frameworks are often not well suited to address the problems of public health. METHODS: The Nuffield Council on Bioethics set up an expert working party to examine the ethical issues surrounding public health in January 2006. Following evidence gathering and a public consultation exercise, the Council published its conclusions and recommendations in the report Public health: ethical issues in November 2007. RESULTS: A spectrum of views exists on the relationship between the state's authority and the individual. The Council set out a proposal to capture the best of the libertarian and paternalistic approaches, in what it calls the stewardship model. This model suggests guiding principles for making decisions about public health policies, and highlights some key principles including Mill's harm principle, caring for the vulnerable, autonomy and consent. An intervention ladder is also proposed, which provides a way of thinking about the acceptability of different public health measures. The report then applies these principles to a number of case studies: infectious diseases, obesity, alcohol and tobacco, and fluoridation of water supplies. CONCLUSIONS: The idea of a nanny state is often rejected, but the state has a duty to look after the health of everyone, and sometimes that means guiding or restricting people's choices. On the other hand, the state must consider a number of principles when designing public health programmes, and justification is required if any of these principles are to be infringed.","output":"Beyond the nanny state: Stewardship and public health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and importance Faced with the lockdown caused by COVID-19 since March 2020, we have been reorganising the external patient department to get medicines to our patients But how do we notify them that their medication is on its way?

METHODS: The present study was conducted with a qualitative approach among Afghan refugee women in Iran. Data were collected through semi-structured face-to-face and telephone interviews and were saturated with 30 women. Both targeted and snowball sampling were used. Data were analyzed using conventional qualitative content analysis and Graneheim and Lundman method. Guba and Lincoln criteria were observed to evaluate the quality of research results. RESULTS: 143 primary codes, 12 subcategories and five main categories were obtained from data analysis. The main categories include little knowledge and information (limited access to information resources, incomplete knowledge about COVID-19), family challenges (intensified experience of violence and conflict in the family, problems related to childbirth and pregnancy), socio-economic challenges (exacerbation of economic problems, high-risk living conditions, social isolation, limited support of social and health organizations), health issues (problems related to treatment, injustice in providing services and facilities) and problems after the death of a COVID-19 patient (burial challenges for immigrants; lack of funeral rites).

However, spine patients have been poorly studied in past investigations and whether these alterations could influence the refeeding remains unclear. This research aims to observe detectable dysosmias after spine surgery, to explore any amplified affection of halogenates (DESflurane and SEVoflurane) against total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), and to spot potential repercussions on the refeeding. Fifty patients between 50 and 85 years old were recruited before elective spine procedure and tested for odor acuity and discrimination using the Sniffin' Sticks test. The odor abilities were re-assessed within the first 15 h after surgery together with the monitoring of food intakes. The threshold reduced from 4.92  1.61 to 4.81  1.64 (p = 0.237) and the discrimination ability reduced from 10.50  1.83 to 9.52  1.98 (p = 0.0005). Anesthetic-specific analysis showed a significant reduction of both threshold (p = 0.004) and discrimination (p = 0.004) in the SEV group, and a significant reduction of discrimination abilities (p = 0.016) in the DES group. No dysosmias were observed in TIVA patients after surgery. Food intakes were lower in the TIVA group compared to both DES (p = 0.026) and SEV (p = 0.017). The food consumed was not associated with the sniffing impairment but appeared to be inversely associated with the surgical time. These results confirmed the evidence on inhalation anesthetics to cause smell alterations in spine patients. Furthermore, the poor early oral intake after complex procedures suggests that spinal deformity surgery could be a practical challenge to early oral nutrition.","output":"Perioperative Anesthesia and Acute Smell Alterations in Spine Surgery: A Sniffing Impairment Influencing Refeeding?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I provide evidence on the direct effects of legal same-sex marriage in the United States by studying Massachusetts, the first state to legalize it in 2004 by court order.

MEASUREMENTS: Frailty was defined using the physical frailty phenotype (PFP), frailty index (FI), and Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), and comorbidity using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). PFP and FI were available at baseline, whereas HFRS and CCI were assessed both at baseline and concurrently with the start of the pandemic. Inpatient COVID\\\\19 cases were confirmed by PCR and/or hospital records. COVID\\\\19 mortality was ascertained from death registers. RESULTS: Overall, 514 individuals died of COVID\\\\19. In the full sample, all frailty and comorbidity measures were associated with higher COVID\\\\19 mortality risk after adjusting for age and sex.

METHODS: A CC-inactivated split-virus influenza A/Indonesia/5/2005(H5N1) vaccine derived from the EB66 cell line (hereafter, CC-H5N1) was investigated in a phase 1 randomized, blinded study. Healthy adults (n = 521) received 2 vaccine doses (days 0 and 21) of either investigational CC-H5N1 vaccine (1.9 g or 3.75 g of hemagglutinin antigen [HA] with the AS03 adjuvant system or 15 g of plain HA), embryonated-egg-derived vaccines (3.75 g of HA with AS03 or 15 g of plain HA), or placebo. Assessment of the adjuvant effect and immunogenicity was performed using Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research acceptability criteria 21 days after dose 2. Safety was assessed until month 12. RESULTS: AS03-adjuvanted CC-H5N1 elicited a homologous hemagglutination inhibition antibody response that satisfied immunogenicity criteria 21 days after dose 2 and persisted at month 12. Adjuvant effect and immune response against a drift-variant strain were demonstrated. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. The immunogenicity and safety of the CC-H5N1 formulation containing 3.75 g of HA and AS03 appeared to be similar to those for the licensed egg-derived AS03-adjuvanted control vaccine.

We show here that an anti-SEB monoclonal antibody (mAb), 6D3, can bind this viral motif at its polybasic (PRRA) insert to inhibit infection in live virus assays. The overlap between the superantigenic site of the spike and its proteolytic cleavage site suggests that the mAb prevents viral entry by interfering with the proteolytic activity of cell proteases (furin and TMPRSS2). The high affinity of 6D3 for this site originates from a polyacidic segment at its heavy chain CDR2.

This is known as the quarantine paradox that also includes a surge in the cases of gender-based violence. However, there exists a clear gap of rigorous literature exploring the issue. Hence, the current paper attempts to understand gender-based violence as an aspect of the COVID-19 lockdown. It reviews the pattern of rise in gender violence cases and the resultant psychological and social issues and attempts to create awareness by initiating a discourse urging for change in the response towards the victims of gender-based violence. The paper further attempts to suggest measures to mitigate the issues arising out of gender violence during quarantine. Method: The current paper reviews the literature on the rise of gender-based violence in the times of current and past pandemics. The paper also reviews the published reports in scientific as well as mass media literatures focusing on the rise of gender-based violence during the imposed lockdown, its consequences, and the measures taken by the governments to tackle the issue. Results: The present review reveals that similar to the previous pandemics and epidemics, there has been an alarming rise in the incidents of gender-based violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present review further reveals various other risk factors that have been found attributive to the surge of gender-based violence such as economic insecurity and alcohol consumption. The results of the review indicate that despite its global prevalence, gender-based violence has been one of the most neglected outcomes of pandemics. Moreover, the legislatures and services available for such victims are often inadequate and, thus, worsening their situation.

However, reports about the association between changes in cerebral oxygenation and clinical parameters at hemodialysis initiation, including hemoglobin level, are lacking. METHODS This study included 33 patients at the hemodialysis initiation phase. Cerebral rSO2 was monitored using an INVOS 5100C. Included patients were assessed twice (at hemodialysis initiation and 42.7  20.8 days after the first measurement), and changes in cerebral rSO2 were compared with changes in clinical parameters. RESULTS Cerebral rSO2 at the second measurement significantly increased compared with that at hemodialysis initiation (57.2  6.8% vs 54.4  8.8%, p < 0.05). Changes in cerebral rSO2 represented a significant correlation with changes in hemoglobin level, pulse rate, and serum albumin level. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed using significant factors in simple linear regression analysis. Changes in hemoglobin (standardized coefficient: 0.37) and serum albumin (standardized coefficient: 0.45) levels were identified as independent factors influencing the changes in cerebral rSO2. CONCLUSION Cerebral rSO2 was low in the presence of low hemoglobin levels at hemodialysis initiation and improved in response to hemoglobin increase in addition to changes in serum albumin levels. Attention should be paid to changes in hemoglobin levels even at hemodialysis initiation to prevent the deterioration of cerebral oxygenation, and this might contribute to the maintenance of cognitive function in patients undergoing hemodialysis.","output":"Cerebral oxygenation improvement is associated with hemoglobin increase after hemodialysis initiation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Knowledge about the localization and outcome of iatrogenic dissection (ID) during endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is limited.

The ID localization and morphology were analyzed and related to the interventional techniques. Baseline clinical and radiological findings, treatment modality and outcome were compared with patients without ID. RESULTS Out of 866 patients 18 (2%) suffered an ID (44% female, median age 64 years). Localization was extracranial in 15 (83%, 14 internal carotid artery and 1 vertebral artery) and intracranial in 3 (17%; 1 vertebrobasilar dissection and 2 in the anterior circulation). Of the IDs 5 (28%) resulted in a high-degree, 3 (17%) in a moderate, 5 (28%) in a mild and 5 (28%) in no stenosis and 8 IDs were stented in the acute phase.

COVID-19 also presents with multiple ancillary systemic diseases and often involves cardiovascular, inflammatory, and/or neurological complications. Pathological viral genomes consisting of ssvRNA, like cellular messenger RNA (mRNA), are susceptible to attack, destruction, neutralization, and/or modulation by naturally occurring small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) within the host cell, some of which are known as microRNAs (miRNAs). This paper proposes that the actions of the 2650 known human miRNAs and other sncRNAs form the basis for an under-recognized and unappreciated innate-immune regulator of ssvRNA viral genome activities and have implications for the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 invasion, infection, and replication. Recent research indicates that both miRNA and mRNA abundance, speciation, and complexity varies widely amongst human individuals, and this may: (i) In part explain the variability in the innate-immune immunological and pathophysiological response of different human individuals to the initiation and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple tissue types; and (ii) further support our understanding of human biochemical and genetic individuality and the variable resistance of individuals to ssvRNA-mediated viral infection and disease. This commentary will briefly address current findings and concepts in this fascinating research area of non-coding RNA and innate-immunity with special reference to natural host miRNAs, SARS-CoV-2, and the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"microRNA Heterogeneity, Innate-Immune Defense and the Efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 InfectionA Commentary"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The actual strategy to improve current therapies in advanced prostate cancer involves targeting genes activated by androgen withdrawal, either to delay or prevent the emergence of the castration-refractory phenotype. However, these genes are often implicated in several physiological processes, and long-term inhibition of survival proteins might be accompanied with cytotoxic effects. To avoid this problem, an alternative therapeutic strategy relies on the identification and use of compounds that disrupt specific protein-protein interactions involved in androgen withdrawal. Specifically, the interaction of the chaperone protein Hsp27 with the initiation factor eIF4E leads to the protection of protein synthesis initiation process and enhances cell survival during cell stress induced by castration or chemotherapy. Thus, in this work we aimed at i) identifying the interaction site of the Hsp27/eIF4E complex and ii) interfere with the relevant protein/protein association mechanism involved in castration-resistant progression of prostate cancer. By a combination of experimental and modeling techniques, we proved that eIF4E interacts with the C-terminal part of Hsp27, preferentially when Hsp27 is phosphorylated. We also observed that the loss of this interaction increased cell chemo-and hormone-sensitivity. In order to find a potential inhibitor of Hsp27/eIF4E interaction, BRET assays in combination with molecular simulations identified the phenazine derivative 14 as the compound able to efficiently interfere with this protein/protein interaction, thereby inhibiting cell viability and increasing cell death in chemo- and castration-resistant prostate cancer models in vitro and in vivo.","output":"Targeting Hsp27/eIF4E interaction with phenazine compound: a promising alternative for castration-resistant prostate cancer treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Today there exists only limited knowledge regarding the care of critically ill nontrauma (CINT) patients in the resuscitation room (RR) in Germany. The goal of this observational study was to describe the management of CINT patients in the RR of a nonuniversity emergency department. METHODS: Data of adult nontrauma patients in the RR were prospectively collected in this study from 26 January 2019 to 18 May 2021 using the OBSERvE?2 evaluation protocol. RESULTS: In all, 213 patients were included in the study (age: 70  15 years, 55% male; admission to the RR by emergency medical service 93%). 28% were brought in after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Leading admission causes were C (47%) and B problems (39%). Diagnoses at the end of RR treatment were 30% pulmonary and 26% cardiovascular diseases without myocardial infarction as well as pulmonary embolism (8% and 5%, respectively). Measures performed were airway protection (20%), invasive (46%) and noninvasive ventilation (25%), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (13%), catecholamine therapy (34%), emergency ultrasound (62%). The initial treatment lasted for 41  22 min. Computed tomography was subsequently performed in 51%. On average 4C5 persons were involved in the treatment during the RR period. In total, 9% of the patients died during RR treatment and 40% in the hospital. CONCLUSION: Patients in a nonuniversity nontrauma RR are resource-intensive and have a high in-hospital lethality. RR care can be completed within 60 min. In order to achieve better comparability between patient populations of different locations, it is necessary to uniformly define admission criteria for the nontrauma resuscitation room.","output":"Nichttraumatologisches Schockraummanagement in einer nichtuniversit?ren Notaufnahme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has shone a light on the complex relationship between science and policy. Policymakers have had to make decisions at speed in conditions of uncertainty, implementing policies that have had profound consequences for people's lives. Yet this process has sometimes been characterised by fragmentation, opacity and a disconnect between evidence and policy. In the United Kingdom, concerns about the secrecy that initially surrounded this process led to the creation of Independent SAGE, an unofficial group of scientists from different disciplines that came together to ask policy-relevant questions, review the evolving evidence, and make evidence-based recommendations. The group took a public health approach with a population perspective, worked in a holistic transdisciplinary way, and were committed to public engagement. In this paper, we review the lessons learned during its first year. These include the importance of learning from local expertise, the value of learning from other countries, the role of civil society as a critical friend to government, finding appropriate relationships between science and policy, and recognising the necessity of viewing issues through an equity lens.","output":"Open science communication: the first year of the UK's Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine hesitancy is currently recognized by the WHO as a major threat to global health. Recently, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in the role of social media in the propagation of false information and fringe narratives regarding vaccination. Using a sample of approximately 60 billion tweets, we conduct a large-scale analysis of the vaccine discourse on Twitter. We use methods from deep learning and transfer learning to estimate the vaccine sentiments expressed in tweets, then categorize individual-level user attitude towards vaccines. Drawing on an interaction graph representing mutual interactions between users, we analyze the interplay between vaccine stances, interaction network, and the information sources shared by users in vaccine-related contexts. We find that strongly anti-vaccine users frequently share content from sources of a commercial nature; typically sources which sell alternative health products for profit. An interesting aspect of this finding is that concerns regarding commercial conflicts of interests are often cited as one of the major factors in vaccine hesitancy. Further, we show that the debate is highly polarized, in the sense that users with similar stances on vaccination interact preferentially with one another. Extending this insight, we provide evidence of an epistemic echo chamber effect, where users are exposed to highly dissimilar sources of vaccine information, depending the vaccination stance of their contacts. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding and addressing vaccine mis- and dis-information in the context in which they are disseminated in social networks.","output":"Characterizing polarization in online vaccine discourseA large-scale study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading exponentially, increasing fear, depression, and other mental health disorders in the general public.

Such mass monitoring may have the effect of containing and managing the pandemic, but it has brought about prevalent concerns of privacy. Undoubtedly, China is confronted with fulfilling the task of public health surveillance while, at the same time, protecting personal privacy. However, there are three factors that have caused these balancing efforts to falter. The first factor is the lack of strong and solid legal foundations to authorize and control the surveillance while giving sufficient support for personal privacy. The second factor is the huge social mobilization that entails the involvement of a large number of different entities and individuals in the mass surveillance, for whom the general principles of privacy protection proposed by public authorities and academia may not be well understood and/or may be difficult to follow in practice. The third factor is the collectivist thinking and obedience to, and in many cases reverence for, the authority that is deeply entrenched in Chinese culture and easily overwhelms the individualism-oriented modern privacy culture. To get rid of these handicaps in a short time and, hence, to strengthen privacy would be an extravagant hope.

However, there is not a systematic evaluation of all aspects of this association. Therefore, this meta-analysis aimed to assess the association between all underlying comorbidities in COVID-19 infection severity. METHODS: Electronic literature search was performed via scientific search engines. After the removal of duplicates and selection of articles of interest, 28 studies were included. A fixed-effects model was used; however, if heterogeneity was high (I2 > 50%) a random-effects model was applied to combine the data. RESULTS: A total of 6,270 individuals were assessed (1,615 severe and 4,655 non-severe patients). The median age was 63 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 49-74) and 47 (95% CI: 19-63) years in the severe and non-severe groups, respectively. Moreover, about 41% of patients had comorbidities. Severity was higher in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease: OR 4.85 (95% CI: 3.11-7.57). The odds of being in a severe group increase by 4.81 (95% CI: 3.43-6.74) for a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This was 4.19 (95% CI: 2.84-6.19) for chronic lung disease and 3.18, 95% CI: 2.09-4.82 for cancer.

First, human milk components and hormones may directly affect child eating and satiety characteristics. Second, human milk constituents can affect child microbiota that, in turn, may influence child eating and weight outcomes. Third, human milk composition may affect child eating and weight outcomes through flavor exposure. We reviewed a few very recent findings from well-powered longitudinal or experimental human research with regard to these three pathways. Moreover, we provide a research agenda for future intervention research with the overarching aim to prevent excessive pediatric weight gain during lactation and beyond.

The hip abductors and adductors muscles appear to be important in determining the performance of some functional tasks; however, little is known about the relationship of the hip abductor/adductors muscle strength, activation, and size with functional performance. This study aimed to investigate the relationship of maximum torque, rate of torque development (RTD), rate of activation (RoA), and muscle thickness of the hip abductors [tensor fascia latae (TFL) and gluteus medius (GM)] and adductor magnus muscle with the Four Square Step Test (FSST) and the two-leg hop test in healthy young adults. Twenty participants (five males) attended one testing session that involved ultrasound image acquisition, maximal isometric voluntary contractions (hip abduction and hip adduction) while surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded, and two functional tests (FSST and two-leg side hop test). Bivariate correlations were performed between maximum voluntary torque (MVT), RTD at 50, 100, 200, and 300ms, RoA at 0-50, 0-100, 0-200, and 0-300, and muscle thickness with the dynamic stability tests. For the hip abduction, MVT (r=-0.455, p=0.044) and RTD300 (r=-0.494, p=0.027) was correlated with the FSST. GM RoA50 (r=-0.481, p=0.032) and RoA100 (r=-0.459, p=0.042) were significantly correlated with the two-leg side hop test.

Results: Gene expression and DNA methylation analysis revealed activation of innate immunity related antiviral signaling networks, involving IFN, chemotaxis and immunometabolic pathways. Furthermore, phosphopeptide based kinome activity profiling and pharmacological inhibitor experiments with filgotinib confirm a key role for Janus Kinase (JAK)-1 dependent gene expression changes in innate immune signaling. Finally, Echinaforce? treatment induces DNA hypermethylation at intergenic CpG, long/short interspersed nuclear DNA repeat elements (LINE, SINE) or long termininal DNA repeats (LTR). This changes transcription of flanking endogenous retroviral sequences (HERVs), involved in an evolutionary conserved (epi)genomic protective response against viral infections. Conclusions: Altogether, our results suggest that Echinaforce? phytochemicals strengthen antiviral innate immunity by JAK1 responsive gene expression and epigenetic regulation of HERVs in monocytes, which supports its prophylactic use against common cold corona viruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and new occurring strains such as SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Standardized Echinacea purpurea extract primes an IFN specific innate immune monocyte response via JAK1-STAT1 dependent gene expression and epigenetic control of endogenous retroviral sequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the emergence of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in March 2020, many people in Germany have become ill.

We collected electronic medical record (EMR) data, which included the full clinical profiles of patients, from a designated TCM hospital in Wuhan. The structured data of symptoms and drugs from admission notes were obtained through an information extraction process. Other key clinical entities were also confirmed and normalized to obtain information on the diagnosis, clinical treatments, laboratory tests, and outcomes of the patients. A total of 293 COVID-19 inpatient cases, including 207 moderate and 86 (29.3%) severe cases, were included in our research.

METHODS: A categorized and comprehensive search in the literature has been conducted by 10 April 2021 using international databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library in line with the PRISMA guidelines recommendations. PICO strategy was used to formulate the research question. The following terms were used: urology, COVID-19, coronavirus, BPH, inflammation, androgen receptors, LUTS, IPSS, PSA, and SARS-CoV-2 or a combination of them. Studies with irrelevant purposes and duplicates were excluded. The selected studies were performed on humans and published in English. RESULTS: The research revealed 89 articles. After title screening and considering exclusion criteria, 52 papers were included for the systematic review. BPH is a common condition affecting older men. SARS-CoV-2 infects the host cell by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A hyperactivated RAS system during infection with SARS-CoV-2 may lead to activation of pro-inflammatory pathways and increased cytokine release. Thus, this virus can lead to exacerbation of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and trigger inflammatory processes in the prostate gland. Since androgen receptors (AR) play an important role in the BPH pathophysiology and infection with SARS-CoV-2 may be androgen-mediated, BPH progression and its related symptoms can be a complication of COVID-19 through AR involvement and metabolic disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current findings, SARS-CoV-2 can possibly damage the prostate and worsen BPH and its related LUTS through ACE2 signaling, AR-related mechanisms, inflammation, and metabolic derangement.

However, wide-spread adoption of telehealth as a delivery model in school-based practice is lacking in the OT evidence literature. While the COVID-19 global health emergency propelled many OTPs into the use of telehealth technologies, in some cases with minimal preparation, an investigation was conducted into the likelihood of telehealth adoption when comprehensive training was provided so that appropriateness of student fit for telehealth could be determined and essential planning could take place. OBJECTIVE: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, a comprehensive training program was developed incorporating detailed perceptions of OTPs experienced in and new to telehealth in school-based practice as measured via surveys with the goal of increasing adoption of telehealth technologies for the delivery of OT services. Following the completion of the online New to Telehealth Pre-training Survey, OTPs new to telehealth were invited to complete the OT Telehealth Primer: School-based Practice training program. Analysis of pre- and post-training surveys yielded information about attitudinal changes experienced post-training. METHODS: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, school-based occupational therapy practitioners (OTP) experienced in telehealth were invited to complete a survey exploring benefits and barriers encountered in the delivery of OT services using telehealth. OTPs new-to-telehealth were invited to complete a different survey intended to explore attitudes about the potential use of telehealth. Data collected from both surveys were used to develop a comprehensive training program, The OT Telehealth Primer for School-based Practice. OTPs new-to-telehealth were invited to complete the training program and a post-training survey. A descriptive data analysis was completed on responses from pre- to post-training surveys and the chi-square test of independence was used to evaluate difference in reported likelihood of adopting telehealth into practice before and after training. RESULTS: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, the top benefits identified by the OTP Experienced Telehealth-User Survey included: 1) service access, 2) collaboration and carry-over with team members, 3) efficiency themes, and4) student engagement and comfort. Top benefits identified by the OTP New to Telehealth Survey identified the same top benefits after participating in the training program. A significant decrease in perceived barriers was noted in scores from pre- to post-training by OTPs new to telehealth. The perceived barriers that did not significantly decrease post-training suggest the need for future education and future protocol development. These included: unreliable internet, lack of hands-on opportunity and e-helpers' (parent, caregiver or support system available to assist the student in person during a telehealth session) decreased comfort with technology. Of the participants who completed the OT Telehealth Primer: School-based Practice, 80% reported being likely to add telehealth as a delivery model for future OT practice. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, completion of the comprehensive training program OT Telehealth Primer: School-based Practice program yielded improved perceived benefits and an increased likelihood of telehealth adoption into practice by OTPs. However, both OTPs and school administrators require ongoing education for successful widespread adoption to be achieved thus offsetting the global shortage of OTPs and increasing service access. Future research, particularly related to available training and support for the rapid adoption of telehealth technologies during the COVID-19 global health emergency, will yield helpful information about the likelihood of continued use of telehealth in practice.","output":"Telehealth in school-based practice: Perceived viability to bridge global OT practitioner shortages prior to COVID-19 global health emergency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) may disproportionately affect people with cardiovascular disease. Concern has been aroused regarding a potential harmful effect of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in this clinical context. METHODS: Using an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, we evaluated the relationship of cardiovascular disease and drug therapy with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 who were admitted between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and were recorded in the Surgical Outcomes Collaborative registry as having either died in the hospital or survived to discharge as of March 28, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 8910 patients with Covid-19 for whom discharge status was available at the time of the analysis, a total of 515 died in the hospital (5.8%) and 8395 survived to discharge. The factors we found to be independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death were an age greater than 65 years (mortality of 10.0%, vs. 4.9% among those &#8804;65 years of age; odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 2.41), coronary artery disease (10.2%, vs. 5.2% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.08 to 3.51), heart failure (15.3%, vs. 5.6% among those without heart failure; odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.79), cardiac arrhythmia (11.5%, vs. 5.6% among those without arrhythmia; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.86), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.2%, vs. 5.6% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.00 to 4.40), and current smoking (9.4%, vs. 5.6% among former smokers or nonsmokers; odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.47). No increased risk of in-hospital death was found to be associated with the use of ACE inhibitors (2.1% vs. 6.1%; odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.54) or the use of ARBs (6.8% vs. 5.7%; odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.74). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascular disease is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among patients hospitalized with Covid-19. Our results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital death in this clinical context.

Polyamines are key aliphatic molecules that perform important roles in cellular growth and proliferation. They are also needed for the successful multiplication of various viruses. Little is known about the effects of polyamines on Arteriviridae infections. Here, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an economically prominent porcine virus, was used to investigate virusCpolyamine interactions. We found that PRRSV infection significantly downregulated the levels of cellular polyamines. Using an inhibitor or specific short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of ornithine decarboxylase 1, a key anabolic enzyme involved in the classical de novo biosynthesis of polyamines, we found that polyamine depletion abrogated PRRSV proliferation, and this effect was recoverable by adding exogenous spermidine and spermine, but not putrescine to the cells, suggesting that the host inhibits polyamine biosynthesis to restrict PRRSV proliferation. Further analysis revealed that the expression level of spermidine-spermine acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1), a catabolic enzyme that reduces spermidine and spermine levels, was upregulated during PRRSV infection, but conversely, SAT1 had an inhibitory effect on PRRSV reproduction. Our data show that polyamines are important molecules during PRRSV-host interactions, and polyamines and their biosynthetic pathways are potential therapeutic targets against PRRSV infection.","output":"Polyamine regulation of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection depends on spermidine-spermine acetyltransferase 1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Concerns have been raised regarding proceeding with kidney transplantation using standard immunosuppression in COVID-19 endemic areas. METHODS We performed a single-center review of all adult kidney transplants performed during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Patients were managed with standard immunosuppression protocols, including lymphocyte depleting induction and trough-guided tacrolimus. Retrospective data were collected for 3 months from the date of transplantation or until study conclusion (5/7/2020). The primary outcomes assessed included patient and allograft survival as well as COVID-19 related hospital readmission. RESULTS 30 kidney transplants were performed during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. After a median follow-up of 51.5 days, 93.3% of patients were alive with 100% death-censored allograft survival. 9 patients were readmitted to the hospital during the study period, 4 (13.3%) related to infection with COVID-19. Infections were mild in 3/4 patients, with one patient developing severe disease leading to respiratory failure. Patients readmitted with COVID-19 were numerically more likely to be African American, have a BMI > 30 kg/m2, have a lymphocyte count  300 cells/mL, and be on maintenance corticosteroids.

Most MCC tumors express MCPyV large T (LT) antigens and play an important role in the growth-promoting activities of oncoproteins. Truncated LT promotes tumorigenicity as well as host cell proliferation by activating the viral replication machinery, and inhibition of this protein in humans drastically lowers cellular growth linked to the corresponding cancer. Our study was designed with the aim of identifying small molecular-like natural antiviral candidates that are able to inhibit the proliferation of malignant tumors, especially those that are aggressive, by blocking the activity of viral LT protein. To identify potential compounds against the target protein, a computational drug design including molecular docking, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion), toxicity, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) approaches were applied in this study. Initially, a total of 2190 phytochemicals isolated from 104 medicinal plants were screened using the molecular docking simulation method, resulting in the identification of the top five compounds having the highest binding energy, ranging between ?6.5 and ?7.6 kcal/mol. The effectiveness and safety of the selected compounds were evaluated based on ADME and toxicity features. A 250 ns MD simulation confirmed the stability of the selected compounds bind to the active site (AS) of the target protein. Additionally, MM-GBSA analysis was used to determine the high values of binding free energy (G bind) of the compounds binding to the target protein.

Obtaining consent for epidural analgesia during labour can be challenging and information on labour analgesia should be provided for mothers in a variety of formats.1 Our hospital recently implemented an online patient education video on epidural anaesthesia. We conducted this study to assess video uptake and response, how patients receive information on epidurals and to determine preferred timing of epidural information delivery. Methods: We surveyed postpartum women who had received epidural analgesia during labour using a questionnaire-based study. Participants were recruited by convenience sampling. Responses were collected from 100 participants and data were analysed using Google Sheets. Results: Of the 100 women audited, only 41 (41%) were aware of the information video and 33 (80.5%) had watched it. The videos usefulness was highly regarded among those who had watched it, with 76% rating it [Formula presented]/10 and remaining 24% rating it [Formula presented]/10. 88% of patients who were unaware of the video stated that they would have watched it if its existence was known. 94% of women received information on epidural anaesthesia prior to procedure. Most patients received information before active labour;pre-pregnancy (n = 49);before onset of labour (n = 43) and the remainder (n = 23) received information for the first time while labouring. Patients obtained information from several sources including antenatal class (n = 46), friends/family (n = 42), online (n = 37), and anaesthetic clinic (n = 23). The most frequently cited information formats were written information leaflet (n = 49), discussion with doctor (n = 33) and online video (n = 33). Patient preference regarding the timing of provision of epidural information differed. 27% stated that antenatal information would be preferred, 25% would prefer information on admission and 26% preferred information to be provided at time of epidural insertion. 21% of patients surveyed stated they would prefer to receive epidural information both antenatally and again during labour. It was also interesting to note that 28 women (28%) felt that significant misinformation existed in the community regarding epidurals. Discussion: A discrepancy exists between current practice and patient preference for receiving information about epidurals. To facilitate this, especially considering current Covid-19 restrictions, an online video information tool proves beneficial and has been well received. To improve engagement, the video has been highlighted on hospital social media sites and advertised at the anaesthetic clinic, antenatal classes, and outpatient appointments.

Our purpose in this report is to collect, summarize, and articulate all essential information about antiviral drugs that may or may not be efficient for treating COVID-19. Clinical evidence about these drugs and their possible mechanisms of action are also discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS To conduct a comprehensive review, different keywords in various databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar, were searched relevant articles, especially the most recent ones, were selected and studied. These selected original research articles, review papers, systematic reviews, and even letters to the editors were then carefully reviewed for data collection. RESULTS SARS-CoV-2 is the newest member of the coronavirus family, and there are still no promising therapies or particular antiviral compounds to fight it. After entering the body, SARS-CoV-2 penetrates the cells by attaching to specific lung cell receptors, called angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. Then, by employing cell division machinery, it replicates through a complex mechanism and spreads throughout the patient's body. Various antiviral drugs, including anti-influenza/HIV/HCV drugs, have been applied for treating COVID-19 patients. Due to the similarity of the structure and transcriptional mechanism of COVID-19 to a number of viruses, some of the listed drugs have been beneficial against SARS-CoV-2. However, the effectiveness of others is in an aura of ambiguity and doubt. CONCLUSIONS Some of the antiviral medications listed and discussed in this article have been effective in the treatment of COVID-19 patients or preventing the virus from spreading further. However, other drugs have to be investigated to reach a reliable conclusion about their effectiveness or ineffectiveness.","output":"Antiviral drugs proposed for COVID-19: action mechanism and pharmacological data."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Discontinuation from randomised treatment is a common intercurrent event in clinical trials.

A missing-at-random assumption is commonly made in this setting, but it may not always be viewed as appropriate. Another potential approach is to assume missing values are similar to data collected after treatment discontinuation. This idea has been previously proposed in the context of recurrent event data. Here we extend this approach to time-to-event outcomes using the hazard function. We propose imputation models that allow for different hazard rates before and after treatment discontinuation and use the posttreatment discontinuation hazard to impute events for participants with missing follow-up periods due to study withdrawal.

Predictive analyses coupled with database-deposited data suggested that YY1 binds the promoter of the BIRC5/survivin anti-apoptotic gene. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) analyses of several B-NHL repositories revealed a conserved positive correlation between YY1 and survivin, both highly expressed, especially in aggressive B-NHLs. Further validation experiments performed in Raji Burkitt's lymphomas cells, demonstrated that YY1 silencing was associated with survivin downregulation and sensitized the cells to apoptosis. Overall, our results revealed that: (1) YY1 and survivin are positively correlated and overexpressed in B-NHLs, especially in BLs; (2) YY1 strongly binds to the survivin promoter, hence survivin may be suggested as YY1 transcriptional target; (3) YY1 silencing sensitizes Raji cells to drug-induced apoptosis via downregulation of survivin; (4) both YY1 and survivin are potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of resistant/relapsed B-NHLs.","output":"Role of the Transcription Factor Yin Yang 1 and Its Selectively Identified Target Survivin in High-Grade B-Cells Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas: Potential Diagnostic and Therapeutic Targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The current study argues that population prevalence estimates for mental health disorders, or changes in mean scores over time, may not adequately reflect the heterogeneity in mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic within the population. METHODS: The COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study is a longitudinal, nationally representative, online survey of UK adults. The current study analysed data from its first three waves of data collection: Wave 1 (March 2020, N = 2025), Wave 2 (April 2020, N = 1406) and Wave 3 (July 2020, N = 1166). Anxiety-depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (a composite measure of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7) and COVID-19-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the International Trauma Questionnaire. Changes in mental health outcomes were modelled across the three waves. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify subgroups of individuals with different trajectories of change in anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Latent class membership was regressed on baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of anxiety-depression remained stable, while COVID-19 PTSD reduced between Waves 2 and 3. Heterogeneity in mental health response was found, and hypothesised classes reflecting (i) stability, (ii) improvement and (iii) deterioration in mental health were identified. Psychological factors were most likely to differentiate the improving, deteriorating and high-stable classes from the low-stable mental health trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: A low-stable profile characterised by little-to-no psychological distress ('resilient' class) was the most common trajectory for both anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD.

At the same time, the health system also faces challenges related to shortages of health professionals, low public financing, and informal payments. With the added pressure from the COVID-19 pandemic, Hungarian policymakers acted rapidly to pass a sweeping regulation aimed at these issues. Over two days, the Hungarian parliament introduced and unanimously approved a new regulation, Act C of 2020 on the Employment Status of Health Workers, that replaces the existing public employment relationship between health professionals, public providers and their controlling authorities. The Act, passed on 6 October 2020, brings the employment of health workers under strict central control by introducing a new employment status similar to that of the armed forces. The Act also provides doctors with an unprecedented 120% salary increase and criminalizes informal payments. The reception has been overwhelmingly negative, with thousands of health professionals indicating that they would not sign the new contracts, and the policy also contains serious technical and feasibility concerns. Although the first statistics show that only about 3-5% of the active workforce did not sign the contract by 1 March 2021, the implementation of the reform still faces serious challenges.","output":"The 2020 reform of the employment status of Hungarian health workers: Will it eliminate informal payments and separate the public and private sectors from each other?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to examine the relationship between active coping and hope during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigate the underlying mechanism based on meaning making theory.

In the wake of the current pandemic caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, furin has become the center of attraction for researchers as the spike protein contains a polybasic furin cleavage site. In the present work, we have searched for novel inhibitors against this interesting human target from FDA-approved antiviral. To enhance the selection of new inhibitors, we employed Kohonens artificial neural network-based self-organizing maps for ligand-based virtual screening. Promising results were obtained which can help in drug repurposing and network pharmacology studies can address the errors generated due to promiscuity/polypharmacology. We found 15 existing FDA antiviral drugs having the potential to inhibit furin. Among these, six compounds have targets on important human proteins (LDLR, FCGR1A, PCK1, TLR7, DNA, and PNP). The role of these 15 drugs inhibiting furin can be established by studying further on patients infected with number of viruses including SARS-CoV-2. Here we propose two promising candidate FDA drugs GS-441524 and Grazoprevir (MK-5172) for repurposing as inhibitors of furin. The best results were observed with GS-441524.

The value of such positional goods lies in their distribution among the populationthe rarer they are, the more desirable they become. At the same time, higher income, often associated with higher status, has been studied in its relation to unethical behavior. Here we present research that shows how a particular Veblen good, illicit behavior, and wealth, combine to produce the display of illegality as a status symbol. We gathered evidence at a large, country-level, scale of a particular form of consumption of an illictly acquired good for status purposes. We show that in Greece, a developed middle-income country, where authorities cannot issue custom vanity license plates, people acquire distinguishing plate numbers that act as vanity plate surrogates. We found that such license plates are more common in cars with bigger engines and in luxury brands, and are therefore associated with higher value vehicles. This cannot be explained under the lawful procedures for allocating license plates and must therefore be the result of illegal activities, such as graft. This suggests a pattern of conspicuous corruption, where individuals break the law and use their gains as status symbols, knowing that the symbols hint at rule-breaking, as long as the unlawful practice cannot be incontestably established.","output":"Conspicuous corruption: Evidence at a country level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to a global pandemic. The World Health Organization has also declared an infodemic (ie, a plethora of information regarding COVID-19 containing both false and accurate information circulated on the internet). Hence, it has become critical to test the veracity of information shared online and analyze the evolution of discussed topics among citizens related to the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This research analyzes the public discourse on COVID-19. It characterizes risk communication patterns in four Asian countries with outbreaks at varying degrees of severity: South Korea, Iran, Vietnam, and India. METHODS: We collected tweets on COVID-19 from four Asian countries in the early phase of the disease outbreak from January to March 2020. The data set was collected by relevant keywords in each language, as suggested by locals. We present a method to automatically extract a time-topic cohesive relationship in an unsupervised fashion based on natural language processing. The extracted topics were evaluated qualitatively based on their semantic meanings. RESULTS: This research found that each government's official phases of the epidemic were not well aligned with the degree of public attention represented by the daily tweet counts. Inspired by the issue-attention cycle theory, the presented natural language processing model can identify meaningful transition phases in the discussed topics among citizens. The analysis revealed an inverse relationship between the tweet count and topic diversity. CONCLUSIONS: This paper compares similarities and differences of pandemic-related social media discourse in Asian countries. We observed multiple prominent peaks in the daily tweet counts across all countries, indicating multiple issue-attention cycles. Our analysis identified which topics the public concentrated on; some of these topics were related to misinformation and hate speech. These findings and the ability to quickly identify key topics can empower global efforts to fight against an infodemic during a pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 Discourse on Twitter in Four Asian Countries: Case Study of Risk Communication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two large wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), covering around 2.7 M inhabitants, which represents around 85% of the metropolitan area of Barcelona, were sampled before, during and after the implementation of a complete lockdown. Five one-step RT-qPCR assays, targeting the polymerase (IP2 and IP4), the envelope E and the nucleoprotein (N1 and N2) genome regions, were employed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in 24-h composite wastewater samples concentrated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation.SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a sewage sample collected 41 days ahead of the declaration of the first COVID-19 case. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies in wastewater evidenced the validity of water-based epidemiology to anticipate COVID-19 outbreaks, to evaluate the impact of control measures and even to estimate the burden of shedders, including presymptomatic, asymptomatic, symptomatic and undiagnosed cases. For this latter objective, a model was applied for the estimation of the total number of shedders, evidencing a high proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals. In this way, an infection prevalence of 2.0-6.5% was figured. On the other hand, a proportion of around 0.12% and 0.09% of the total population was determined to be required for positive detection in the two WWTPs.At the end of the lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 RNA apparently disappeared in the WWTPs but could still be detected in grab samples from four urban sewers. Sewer monitoring allowed for location of specific hot spots of COVID-19, enabling the rapid adoption of appropriate mitigation measures.IMPORTANCE Water-based epidemiology (WBE) is a valuable early warning tool for tracking the circulation of the virus among the population, including not only symptomatic patients, but also asymptomatic, presymptomatic and misdiagnosed carriers, which represent a high proportion of the infected population. In the specific case of Barcelona, wastewater surveillance anticipated several weeks not only the original COVID-19 pandemic wave, but also the onset of the second wave. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 occurrence in wastewater evidenced the efficacy of the adopted lockdown measures on the circulation of the virus.","output":"Time-evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater during the first pandemic wave of COVID-19 in the metropolitan area of Barcelona"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The analysis of spontaneous EEG activity and evoked potentialsis a cornerstone of the instrumental evaluation of patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC).

METHODS Twenty-one patients with peripheral vestibular hypofunction were randomly assigned to intervention-then-control (n = 12) or control-then-intervention (n = 9) groups. The task consisted of either x1 (control) or IVA training, once daily every day for 15 minutes over 6-months, followed by a 6-month washout, then repeated for arm 2 of the crossover. Primary outcome: vestibulo-ocular reflex gain. Secondary outcomes: compensatory saccades, dynamic visual acuity, static balance, gait, and subjective symptoms. Multiple imputation was used for missing data. Between-group differences were analyzed using a linear mixed model with repeated measures. RESULTS On average patients trained once daily 4 days per week. IVA training resulted in significantly larger VOR gain increase (active: 20.6%  12.08%, P = 0.006; passive: 30.6%  25.45%, P = 0.016) compared with x1 training (active: -2.4%  12.88%, P = 0.99; passive: -0.6%  15.31%, P = 0.68) (P < 0.001). The increased IVA gain did not significantly reduce with approximately 27% persisting over the washout period. x1 training resulted in greater reduction of compensatory saccade latency (P = 0.04) and increase in amplitude (P = 0.02) compared with IVA training. There was no difference between groups in gait and balance measures; however, only the IVA group had improved total Dizziness Handicap Inventory (P = 0.006). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest IVA improves VOR gain and reduces perception of disability more than conventional x1 training.

Despite some evidence of improvements in mortality over recent decades, ARDS remains a major public health problem with 30% 28-day mortality in recent cohorts. Pulmonary vascular dysfunction is one of the pivot points of the pathophysiology of ARDS, resulting in a certain degree of pulmonary hypertension, higher levels of which are associated with morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary hypertension develops as a result of endothelial dysfunction, pulmonary vascular occlusion, increased vascular tone, extrinsic vessel occlusion, and vascular remodeling. This increase in right ventricular (RV) afterload causes uncoupling between the pulmonary circulation and RV function. Without any contractile reserve, the right ventricle has no adaptive reserve mechanism other than dilatation, which is responsible for left ventricular compression, leading to circulatory failure and worsening of oxygen delivery. This state, also called severe acute cor pulmonale (ACP), is responsible for excess mortality. Strategies designed to protect the pulmonary circulation and the right ventricle in ARDS should be the cornerstones of the care and support of patients with the severest disease, in order to improve prognosis, pending stronger evidence. Acute cor pulmonale is associated with higher driving pressure (18 cmH2O), hypercapnia (PaCO2  48 mmHg), and hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 < 150 mmHg). RV protection should focus on these three preventable factors identified in the last decade. Prone positioning, the setting of positive end-expiratory pressure, and inhaled nitric oxide (INO) can also unload the right ventricle, restore better coupling between the right ventricle and the pulmonary circulation, and correct circulatory failure. When all these strategies are insufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which improves decarboxylation and oxygenation and enables ultra-protective ventilation by decreasing driving pressure, should be discussed in seeking better control of RV afterload. This review reports the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension in ARDS, describes right heart function, and proposes an RV protective approach, ranging from ventilatory settings and prone positioning to INO and selection of patients potentially eligible for veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO).","output":"Right Ventricular Function in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Impact on Outcome, Respiratory Strategy and Use of Veno-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Shortly after the emergence of COVID-19, researchers rapidly mobilized to study numerous aspects of the disease such as its evolution, clinical manifestations, effects, treatments, and vaccinations. This led to a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19Crelated publications. Identifying trends and areas of interest using traditional review methods (eg, scoping and systematic reviews) for such a large domain area is challenging. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to conduct an extensive bibliometric analysis to provide a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 literature. METHODS: We used the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) that consists of a large number of research articles related to all coronaviruses. We used a machine learningCbased method to analyze the most relevant COVID-19Crelated articles and extracted the most prominent topics. Specifically, we used a clustering algorithm to group published articles based on the similarity of their abstracts to identify research hotspots and current research directions. We have made our software accessible to the community via GitHub. RESULTS: Of the 196,630 publications retrieved from the database, we included 28,904 in our analysis. The mean number of weekly publications was 990 (SD 789.3). The country that published the highest number of COVID-19Crelated articles was China (2950/17,270, 17.08%). The highest number of articles were published in bioRxiv. Lei Liu affiliated with the Southern University of Science and Technology in China published the highest number of articles (n=46). Based on titles and abstracts alone, we were able to identify 1515 surveys, 733 systematic reviews, 512 cohort studies, 480 meta-analyses, and 362 randomized control trials. We identified 19 different topics covered among the publications reviewed. The most dominant topic was public health response, followed by clinical care practices during the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical characteristics and risk factors, and epidemic models for its spread. CONCLUSIONS: We provide an overview of the COVID-19 literature and have identified current hotspots and research directions. Our findings can be useful for the research community to help prioritize research needs and recognize leading COVID-19 researchers, institutes, countries, and publishers. Our study shows that an AI-based bibliometric analysis has the potential to rapidly explore a large corpus of academic publications during a public health crisis. We believe that this work can be used to analyze other eHealth-related literature to help clinicians, administrators, and policy makers to obtain a holistic view of the literature and be able to categorize different topics of the existing research for further analyses. It can be further scaled (for instance, in time) to clinical summary documentation.

Although predictors such as age, gender, and disease staging are of considerable predictive value, the accuracy often ranges between 60 and 80%. An accurate prognosis assessment is required for making effective clinical decisions. METHODS: We proposed an extended prognostic model based on clinical covariates with adjustment for additional variables that were radio-graphically induced, termed imaging biomarkers. Eight imaging biomarkers were introduced and investigated in a cohort of 68 non-small cell lung cancer subjects with tumor internal characteristic. The subjects comprised of 40 males and 28 females with mean age at 68.7 years. The imaging biomarkers used to quantify the solid component and non-solid component of a tumor. The extended model comprises of additional frameworks that correlate these markers to the survival ends through uni- and multi-variable analysis to determine the most informative predictors, before combining them with existing clinical predictors. Performance was compared between traditional and extended approaches using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, Area under the ROC curves (AUC), Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves, Cox Proportional Hazard, and log-rank tests (p-value). RESULTS: The proposed hybrid model exhibited an impressive boosting pattern over the traditional approach of prognostic modelling in the survival prediction (AUC ranging from 77 to 97%). Four developed imaging markers were found to be significant in distinguishing between subjects having more and less dense components: (P = 0.002C0.006). The correlation to survival analysis revealed that patients with denser composition of tumor (solid dominant) lived 1.6C2.2 years longer (mean survival) and 0.5C2.0 years longer (median survival), than those with less dense composition (non-solid dominant). CONCLUSION: The present study provides crucial evidence that there is an added value for incorporating additional image-based predictors while predicting clinical endpoints. Though the hypotheses were confirmed in a customized case study, we believe the proposed model is easily adapted to various clinical cases, such as predictions of complications, treatment response, and disease evolution.","output":"Leveraging hybrid biomarkers in clinical endpoint prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: incubation period for COVID-19, 2-14 (average 5-6) days.

METHODS: we utilized data on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed cases to investigate symptom onset timing, from 21(st) March to 4(th) September 2020. Since timing of COVID-19 symptom onset is highly likely to be an interval rather than a point estimate, we generated 3-tertile categories: 1(st), 2(nd) and 3(rd) tertile denoting symptom presentation within 3, 4 to 6 and at least 7 days. We considered all signs and symptoms in the database and analysed using Chi-square test and multinomial logistic regression, controlling for age and sex. RESULTS: we analysed a total of 420 symptomatic case-patients; 72.0% were males, median age of 33 years. Common symptoms were cough (47.6%), running nose (46.2%), fever (27.4%), headache (26.4%) and sore throat (20.5%). We utilized 293 cases with clinical symptom onset date recorded. Most of the patients, 37.5%, presented symptom within 3 days, 31.4% had symptoms in the 2(nd) and 31.4% in 3(rd) tertile, denoting 4 to 6 days and at least 7 days after exposure. Running nose (RRR=0.45, 95%CI: 0.24-0.84) and chest pain (RRR=0.64, 95%CI: 0.09-0.72) were more likely to occur in 3(rd) tertile than 1(st) or 2(nd) tertile.

Therefore, it is required to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on pre-existing diseases of patients, such as cancer and other infectious diseases. In the current study, we report that SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins and some currently used anti-COVID-19 drugs are able to induce lytic reactivation of Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), one of major human oncogenic viruses, through manipulation of intracellular signaling pathways. Our data indicate that those KSHV + patients especially in endemic areas exposure to COVID-19 or undergoing the treatment may have increased risks to develop virus-associated cancers, even after they have fully recovered from COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 proteins and anti-COVID-19 drugs induce lytic reactivation of an oncogenic virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe a method of automatic feedback provision for students learning computational science and data science methods in Python.

With our implementation, students typically submit work for assessment, and receive feedback by email within a few minutes after submission. The choice of tests and the reporting back to the student is chosen to optimise the educational value for the students. The system very significantly reduces the staff time required to establish whether a students solution is correct, and shifts the emphasis of computing laboratory student contact time from assessing correctness to providing guidance. The self-paced nature of the automatic feedback provision supports a student-centred learning approach.

The purpose of this review was to discuss the incidence, characteristics, diagnostic criteria, biomarkers, and outcomes of hospitalized patients diagnosed with CAPA. A literature search was performed through Pubmed and Web of Science databases for articles published up to 20th March 2021. In 1421 COVID-19 patients, the overall CAPA incidence was 13.5% (range 2.5-35.0%). The majority required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The time to CAPA diagnosis from illness onset varied between 8.0 and 16.0 days. However, the time to CAPA diagnosis from intensive care unit (ICU) admission and IMV initiation ranged between 4.0-15.0 days and 3.0-8.0 days. The most common diagnostic criteria were the modified AspICU-Dutch/Belgian Mycosis Study Group and IAPA-Verweij et al. A total of 77.6% of patients had positive lower respiratory tract cultures, other fungal biomarkers of bronchoalveolar lavage and serum galactomannan were positive in 45.3% and 18.2% of patients. The CAPA mortality rate was high at 48.4%, despite the widespread use of antifungals. Lengthy hospital and ICU stays ranging between 16.0-37.5 days and 10.5-37.0 days were observed.

Using nation-wide interpretation of satellite imagery, and sample-based error calibration, we estimated the impact of large-scale (industrial) and smallholder oil palm plantations on natural old-growth (primary) forests from 2001 to 2019 in Indonesia, the worlds largest palm oil producer. Over nineteen years, the area mapped under oil palm doubled, reaching 16.24 Mha in 2019 (64% industrial; 36% smallholder), more than the official estimates of 14.72 Mha. The forest area declined by 11% (9.79 Mha), including 32% (3.09 Mha) ultimately converted into oil palm, and 29% (2.85 Mha) cleared and converted in the same year. Industrial plantations replaced more forest than detected smallholder plantings (2.13 Mha vs 0.72 Mha). New plantations peaked in 2009 and 2012 and declined thereafter. Expansion of industrial plantations and forest loss were correlated with palm oil prices. A price decline of 1% was associated with a 1.08% decrease in new industrial plantations and with a 0.68% decrease of forest loss. Deforestation fell below pre-2004 levels in 2017C2019 providing an opportunity to focus on sustainable management.

There is emerging evidence that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has number of other presenting features which might not be related to the severity of the respiratory disease. We have previously described a case of hypoactive delirium as the first manifestation of COVID-19 without profound lung disease. Here we present five cases of elderly patients, without a prior history of dementia and had no overt COVID-19-related pneumonia, who presented with the acute onset of delirium as the primary manifestation of COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study performed a health informatics search to produce a list of patients who were admitted with acute confusion and tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus between March 1 and June 30, 2020. The electronic medical admission notes were screened for all patients with confusion who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients with a history of dementia and a high risk of delirium were excluded, such as severe COVID-19-related pneumonia or any other infection, malignancy, drugs, or severe illness of any kind. RESULTS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic our hospital experienced just over 3,000 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, and 45 of them had documented confusion upon admission. Secondary causes for their acute confusion were excluded. Five patients were identified as having delirium as the initial presentation of COVID-19-related illness without significant COVID-19-related pneumonitis. None of them had overt chest symptoms or a previous history of confusion, and the 3 patients who underwent head CT scans had normal findings.

METHODS A systematic review of the literature was performed following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines in five electronic databases (Cochrane, CINAHL, Scopus, Medline and Web of Science) investigating the effect of exogenous CCK or analogues on satiation and body weight. The search strategy was limited to peer-reviewed articles in human trials published in the English language since the journal inception until end July 2020. A meta-analysis of studies that infused CCK and measured satiation via changes in food/energy intake was also conducted. RESULTS A total of 1054 studies were found using the search terms which was reduced to 15 studies suitable for inclusion. Of the twelve studies measuring the effect on the weight of food ingested or energy intake, eleven showed a decrease. Of the ten studies which measured the effect on satiation via VAS scale, nine showed a significant effect. An analogue of CCK which can be administered orally failed to produce any weight loss at 24 weeks. The meta-analysis found the effect of CCK on satiation dosed at physiological levels was significant with a standardised mean difference of 0.57 (CI 95%: 0.30, 0.85, p < 0.0001). By comparison, CCK dosed at higher, pharmacological levels also had a significant effect with a standardised mean difference of 0.91 (CI 95%: 0.46, 1.36, p < 0.0001). Eight of the ten studies in the meta-analysis combined CCK infusion with some means to facilitate stomach distension. CONCLUSIONS The present review found evidence that exposure to either the CCK-8 or CCK-33 variants of CCK results in an increase in satiation but no evidence for weight loss over the long term.

Here, we studied the contribution of CD154 in a mouse model of toxic liver injury with carbon tetrachloride and a model of absorbable suture graft. In both models, granulomas are triggered in response to endogenous persistent liver calcified necrotic lesions or by grafted sutures. CD154-deficient mice showed delayed clearance of carbon tetrachloride-induced liver calcified necrotic lesions and impaired progression of suture-induced granuloma. In vitro, CD154 stimulated phagocytosis of opsonized erythrocytes by macrophages, suggesting a potential mechanism for the altered granulomatous inflammation in CD154KO mice.

Previously we showed that site-specific monoubiquitination on Rab5 downregulates its function. Rab7 acts in the downstream of Rab5. Although site-specific ubiquitination of Rab7 can affect its function, it remains elusive how the ubiquitination is involved in modulation of the function of Rab7 at molecular level. Here, we report molecular basis for the regulation of Rab7 by site-specific monoubiquitination. Rab7 was predominantly monoubiquitinated at multiple sites in the membrane fraction of cultured cells. Two major ubiquitination sites (K191 and K194), identified by mutational analysis with single K mutants, were responsible for membrane localization of monoubiquitinated Rab7. Using small-angle X-ray scattering, we derived structural models of site-specifically monoubiquitinated Rab7 in solution. Structural analysis combined with molecular dynamics simulation corroborated that the ubiquitin moieties on K191 and K194 are key determinants for exclusion of Rab7 from the endosomal membrane. Ubiquitination on the two major sites apparently mitigated colocalization of Rab7 with ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2, potentially deterring the egression of SARS-CoV-2. Our results establish that the regulatory effects of a Rab protein through site-specific monoubiquitination are commonly observed among Rab GTPases while the ubiquitination sites differ in each Rab protein.","output":"Structural mechanism for regulation of Rab7 by site-specific monoubiquitination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The US astronomy/astrophysics community comes together to create a decadal report that summarizes grant funding priorities, observatory&instrumental priorities as well as community accomplishments and community goals such as increasing the number of women and the number of people from underrepresented groups. In the 2010 US National Academies Decadal Survey of Astronomy (National Research Council, 2010), it was suggested that having to move so frequently which is a career necessity may be unattractive to people wanting to start a family, especially impacting women. Whether in Europe or elsewhere, as postdocs, astrophysicists will relocate every two to three years, until they secure a permanent position or leave research altogether. Astrophysicists do perceive working abroad as important and positive for their careers (Parenti, 2002); however, it was found that the men at equal rank had not had to spend as much time abroad to further their careers (Fohlmeister&Helling, 2012). By implication, women need to work abroad longer or have more positions abroad to achieve the same rank as men. Astrophysicists living in the United Kingdom prefer to work in their country of origin, but many did not do so because of worse working conditions or difficultly finding a job for their spouse (Fohlmeister&Helling, 2014). In sum, mobility and moving is necessary for a career in astrophysics, and even more necessary for women, but astrophysicists prefer not to move as frequently as needed to maintain a research career.

Despite the benefits of breastfeeding for both infant and mother, clinical support for problems such as maternal nipple pain remains a research frontier. Maternal pharmaceutical treatments, and infant surgery and bodywork interventions are commonly recommended for lactation-related nipple pain without evidence of benefit. The pain is frequently attributed to mammary dysbiosis, candidiasis, or infant anatomic anomaly (including to diagnoses of posterior or upper lip-tie, high palate, retrognathia, or subtle cranial nerve abnormalities). Although clinical protocols universally state that improved fit and hold is the mainstay of treatment of nipple pain and wounds, the biomechanical parameters of pain-free fit and hold remain an omitted variable bias in almost all clinical breastfeeding research. This article reviews the research literature concerning aetiology, classification, prevention, and management of lactation-related nipple-areolar complex (NAC) pain and damage. Evolutionary and complex systems perspectives are applied to develop a narrative synthesis of the heterogeneous and interdisciplinary evidence elucidating nipple pain in breastfeeding women. Lactation-related nipple pain is most commonly a symptom of inflammation due to repetitive application of excessive mechanical stretching and deformational forces to nipple epidermis, dermis and stroma during milk removal. Keratinocytes lock together when mechanical forces exceed desmosome yield points, but if mechanical loads continue to increase, desmosomes may rupture, resulting in inflammation and epithelial fracture. Mechanical stretching and deformation forces may cause stromal micro-haemorrhage and inflammation. Although the environment of the skin of the nipple-areolar complex is uniquely conducive to wound healing, it is also uniquely exposed to environmental risks. The two key factors that both prevent and treat nipple pain and inflammation are, first, elimination of conflicting vectors of force during suckling or mechanical milk removal, and second, elimination of overhydration of the epithelium which risks moisture-associated skin damage. There is urgent need for evaluation of evidence-based interventions for the elimination of conflicting intra-oral vectors of force during suckling.","output":"Re-thinking lactation-related nipple pain and damage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral infections have recently emerged not only as a health threat to people but rapidly became the cause of universal fatality on a large scale.

In the presence of SARS-CoV-2 N-gene, the immobilized aptamer strands changed their conformation to specifically bind with N-gene. It thus increased the contact area or enlarged the distance between aptamer and the SPR chip, resulting in a change of the SPR signal irradiated by the laser (He-Ne) with the wavelength () of 633 nm. Nb(2)C QDs were derived from Nb(2)C MXene nanosheets via a solvothermal method, followed by functionalization with octadecanethiol through a self-assembling method. Subsequently, the gold chip for SPR measurements was modified with Nb(2)C-SH QDs via covalent binding of the Au-S bond also by self-assembling interaction. Nb(2)C-SH QDs not only resulted in high bioaffinity toward aptamer but also enhanced the SPR response. Thus, the Nb(2)C-SH QD-based SPR aptasensor had low limit of detection (LOD) of 4.9 pg mL(?1) toward N-gene within the concentration range 0.05 to 100 ng mL(?1).

METHODS: This was a proof-of-concept study involving patients with moderate to severe AHRF secondary to COVID-19 admitted to the general ward of a public hospital. The intervention consisted of applying CPAP via the ELMO interface integrated with oxygen and compressed air flow meters (30 L/min each) and a PEEP valve (CPAP levels = 8-10 cmH(2)O), forming the ELMOcpap system. The patients were monitored for cardiorespiratory parameters, adverse events, and comfort. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the study protocol. The ELMOcpap system was well tolerated, with no relevant adverse effects. Its use was feasible outside the ICU for a prolonged amount of time and was shown to be successful in 60% of the patients. A CPAP of 10 cmH(2)O with a total gas flow of 56-60 L/min improved oxygenation after 30-to 60-min ELMOcpap sessions, allowing a significant decrease in estimated FIO(2) (p = 0.014) and an increase in estimated PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio (p = 0.008) within the first hour without CO(2) rebreathing. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ELMOcpap has proven to be feasible and effective in delivering high-flow CPAP to patients with COVID-19-related AHRF outside the ICU.

To investigate the differences in pathogenesis and epigenetic mechanisms between the two strains, differential expression and correlation analyses of the microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA in swine testicular (ST) cells infected with YN15, YN144, and mock were performed on three comparison groups (YN15 vs Control, YN144 vs Control, and YN15 vs YN144). The mRNA and miRNA expression profiles were obtained using next-generation sequencing (NGS), and the differentially expressed (DE) (p-value < 0.05) mRNA and miRNA were obtained using DESeq R package. mRNAs targeted by DE miRNAs were predicted using the miRanda algortithm. 8039, 8631 and 3310 DE mRNAs, and 36, 36, and 22 DE miRNAs were identified in the three comparison groups, respectively. 14,140, 15,367 and 3771 DE miRNACmRNA (targeted by DE miRNAs) interaction pairs with negatively correlated expression patterns were identified, and interaction networks were constructed using Cytoscape. Six DE miRNAs and six DE mRNAs were randomly selected to verify the sequencing data by real-time relative quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Based on bioinformatics analysis, we discovered the differences were mostly involved in host immune responses and viral pathogenicity, including NF-B signaling pathway and bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, etc. This is the first comprehensive comparison of DE miRNACmRNA pairs in YN15 and YN144 infection in vitro, which could provide novel strategies for the prevention and control of PED.","output":"Differential expression and correlation analysis of miRNACmRNA profiles in swine testicular cells infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) are mustelids of special relevance to laboratory studies of respiratory viruses and have been shown to be susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and onward transmission. Here, we report the results of a natural experiment where 29 ferrets in one home had prolonged, direct contact and constant environmental exposure to two humans with symptomatic disease, one of whom was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. We observed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to ferrets based on viral and antibody assays. To better understand this discrepancy in experimental and natural infection in ferrets, we compared SARS-CoV-2 sequences from natural and experimental mustelid infections and identified two surface glycoprotein Spike (S) mutations associated with mustelids. While we found evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme II provides a weak host barrier, one mutation only seen in ferrets is located in the novel S1/S2 cleavage site and is computationally predicted to decrease furin cleavage efficiency. These data support the idea that host factors interacting with the novel S1/S2 cleavage site may be a barrier in ferret SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and that domestic ferrets are at low risk of natural infection from currently circulating SARS-CoV-2. We propose two mechanistically grounded hypotheses for mustelid host adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, with possible effects that require additional investigation.","output":"Host barriers to SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated by ferrets in a high-exposure domestic setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Public health measures introduced to limit transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19), also disrupted various healthcare services in many regions worldwide, including British Columbia (BC), Canada.

The European corn borer (ECB), Ostrinia nubilalis (Hbner), is a devastating pest that feeds the lignocellulose-rich tissues of maize plants. However, the potential role of ECB gut microbes in degrading maize cellulose remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the gut microbiota of ECB fed with different diets and their potential function in maize lignocellulose degradation. The diversity and composition of gut bacterial communities varied dramatically between the ECB larva fed with artificial diets (ECB-D) and maize plants (ECB-M). Draft genomes of the microbial consortia from ECB-D and ECB-M showed that the principal degraders of cellulose mainly belonged to Firmicutes or Proteobacteria and they were primarily found in the midgut. The cellulolytic microbial consortia contained genes encoding various carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZyme). Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy revealed significant breakdown of lignocellulose in maize treated by the two microbial consortia for 9 days in vitro. Metabolomic analyses show that maize particles treated by two microbial consortia generate distinctive metabolomic profiles, with enrichment for different monosaccharides (i.e., Glucose, Rhamnofuranose, Isomaltose, and Cellobiose) and amino acids (i.e., Threonine, Histidine, and Lysine). The results indicated that the diet of the host impacted the composition and function of its gut microbiota and ECB exploited specific gut microbes to digest maize lignocellulose with distinctive products.

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, EuropePMC, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Database, and medRxiv with the search terms, Heart failure and COVID-19. The outcome of interest was mortality and poor prognosis (defined by incidence of severe COVID-19 infection, admission to ICU, and use of ventilator) in patients with preexisting heart failure with coronavirus disease. RESULTS: We identified 204 potential articles from our search, and 22 duplicates were removed. After screening of the titles and abstracts of the remaining 182 articles we identified 92 potentially relevant articles. We excluded 74 studies due to the following reasons: four studies were systematic reviews, two studies were meta-analyses, three articles were literature reviews, and 65 articles did not report on the outcome of interest.

DESIGN: Analysis of longitudinal records between 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2018. SETTING: UK primary care database: The Health Improvement Network (THIN). PARTICIPANTS: 11 831 850 eligible patients from 787 contributing practices. Childhood maltreatment and domestic abuse (women only) were defined as the presence of a recorded Read code. OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence rate (IR) and prevalence of childhood maltreatment (in children aged 0C18 years) and domestic abuse (in women aged over 18) between 1996 and 2017. An adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) is given to examine the differences in IRs based on sex, ethnicity and deprivation. RESULTS: The age and gender breakdown of THIN has been previously reported to be representative of the UK population, however, there is substantial missing information on deprivation quintiles (<20%) and ethnicity (approximately 50%). The IR (IR 60.1; 95% CI 54.3 to 66.0 per 100 000 child years) and prevalence (416.1; 95% CI 401.3 to 430.9 per 100 000 child population) of childhood maltreatment rose until 2017. The aIRR was greater in patients from the most deprived backgrounds (aIRR 5.14; 95% CI 4.57 to 5.77 compared with least deprived) and from an ethnic minority community (eg, black aIRR 1.25; 1.04 to 1.49 compared with white). When examining domestic abuse in women, in 2017, the IR was 34.5 (31.4 to 37.7) per 100 000 adult years and prevalence 368.7 (358.7 to 378.7) per 100 000 adult population. Similarly, the IR was highest in the lowest socioeconomic class (aIRR 2.30; 2.71 to 3.30) and in ethnic minorities (South Asian aIRR 2.14; 1.92 to 2.39 and black aIRR 1.64; 1.42 to 1.89).

A secondary objective was to explore if GPs individual characteristics and type of practice determined their adaptation. DESIGN: Observational study using an online questionnaire. Organisational changes were measured by a main question and detailed in two specific outcomes. To identify which GPs characteristics impacted organisational changes, successive multivariate logistic modelling was performed. First, we identified the GPs characteristics related to organisational changes with a univariate analysis. Then, we tested the adjusted associations between this variable and the following GPs characteristics: age, gender and type of practice. SETTING: The questionnaire was administered online between 14 March and 21 March 2020. Practitioners were recruited by email using the contact lists of different French scientific GP societies. PARTICIPANTS: The target population was GPs currently practising in France (n=46 056). We obtained a total of 7481 responses. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome: Proportion of GPs who adapted their practice. Secondary outcome: GPs characteristics related to organisational changes. RESULTS: Among the 7481 responses, 5425 were complete and were analysed. 3849 GPs (70.9%) changed their activity, 3605 GPs (66.5%) increased remote consultations and 2315 GPs (42.7%) created a specific pathway for probable patients with COVID-19.

Therefore, cardiovascular short-term and long-term side effects gain crucial importance for overall outcome. Cardiotoxicity not only presents as heart failure, but also as treatment-resistant hypertension, acute coronary ischemia with plaque rupture or vasospasm, thromboembolism, arrhythmia, pulmonary hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, acute myocarditis and others. Recent recommendations have proposed baseline cardiac risk assessment and surveillance strategies. Major challenges are the availability of monitoring and imaging resources, including echocardiography with speckle tracking longitudinal strain (GLS), serum biomarkers such as natriuretic peptides (NT-proBNP) and highly sensitive cardiac troponins. This Austrian consensus encompasses cardiotoxicity occurrence in frequent antiproliferative cancer drugs, radiotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors and cardiac follow-up considerations in cancer survivors in the context of the Austrian healthcare setting. It is important to optimize cardiovascular risk factors and pre-existing cardiac diseases without delaying oncological treatment. If left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) deteriorates during cancer treatment (from >10% to <50%), or myocardial strain decreases (>15% change in GLS), early initiation of cardioprotective therapies (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin or beta receptor blockers) is recommended, and LVEF should be reassessed before discontinuation. Lower LVEF cut-offs were recently shown to be feasible in breast cancer patients to enable optimal anticancer treatment.

The rate of seroconversion was not significantly lower in allo-transplanted patients than controls with 24% (12/50) and 6% (3/50) of patients remaining seronegative after the first and second vaccination, respectively. However, 58% of transplanted patients lacked T-cell responses against S1 peptides after 1 vaccination compared with 19% of controls (OR 0.17; P=0.009, Fishers exact test) with a similar trend after the second vaccination where 28% of patients were devoid of detectable specific T-cell immunity, compared with 6% of controls (OR 0.18, P=0.02, Fishers exact test).

Conversely, laparoscopic surgical treatment has to be considered when symptoms relief are not optimal or with signs of bowel occlusion. METHODS Retrospective experience of consecutive series of patients who referred to a third-level referral center with suspected bowel DE and failure of multiple medical treatments. After an intraoperative evaluation of nodule size with a rectal shaving of its external portion, patients underwent radical DE eradication with concomitant disc excision in rectal nodules < 3 cm with no signs of substantial full-thickness infiltration. RESULTS A total of 371 patients were considered eligible for analysis, with a median age of 37 years. The median operative time of was 180 min, with an estimated blood loss of 100 mL and a median diameter of removed rectal nodule of 25 mm. Early postoperative procedure-related complications were 47 cases of acute rectal bleeding (12.7%), that were managed by rectal endoscopy, 3 bowel anastomotic dehiscence (0.8%), 8 hemoperitoneum (2.2%) and 3 ureteral fistula (0.8%). 22 patients experienced postoperative hyperpyrexia (5.9%), while 17 women underwent transient bladder deficiency (4.6%).

These channels modulate cellular excitability, input resistance, and response to synaptic stimulation. TASK-channel inhibition led to membrane depolarization. TASK-3 is expressed in different cancer cell types and neurons. Thus, the discovery of novel TASK-3 inhibitors makes these bioactive compounds very appealing to explore new cancer and neurological therapies. TASK-3 channel blockers are very limited to date, and only a few heterofused compounds have been reported in the literature. In this article, we combined a pharmacophore hypothesis with molecular docking to address for the first time the rational design, synthesis, and evaluation of 5-(indol-2-yl)pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridines as a novel family of human TASK-3 channel blockers. Representative compounds of the synthesized library were assessed against TASK-3 using Fluorometric imaging plate readerMembrane Potential assay (FMP). Inhibitory properties were validated using two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) methods. We identified one active hit compound (MM-3b) with our systematic pipeline, exhibiting an IC(50)  30 M. Molecular docking models suggest that compound MM-3b binds to TASK-3 at the bottom of the selectivity filter in the central cavity, similar to other described TASK-3 blockers such as A1899 and PK-THPP. Our in silico and experimental studies provide a new tool to predict and design novel TASK-3 channel blockers.","output":"5-(Indol-2-yl)pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridines as a New Family of TASK-3 Channel Blockers: A Pharmacophore-Based Regioselective Synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Dysphagia affects several children in USA and around the globe. Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS) and Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) are the most objective studies to define swallowing function. The presence of tracheal aspiration during VFSS or FEES in children with dysphagia is associated with an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia. However, the association of laryngeal penetration with aspiration pneumonia remains unclear. This systematic review aims to assess the risk of aspiration pneumonia in children with dysphagia with laryngeal penetration on VFSS/FEES and compare it with children with tracheal aspiration and children with neither tracheal aspiration nor laryngeal penetration. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This study will be a systematic review and meta-analysis. Systematic electronic searches will be conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINHAL, Scopus, Cochrane CENTRAL, LILACS and WHO Global Index Medicus. We will include studies published through 6 October 2021. Primary outcome will be the incidence of aspiration pneumonia. Secondary outcomes will be incidence of hospitalisation, paediatric intensive care unit admission, enteral tube requirement, growth, symptoms improvement and mortality. The Cochrane Risk of Bias In Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions tool will be used to assess the risk of bias. Meta-analysis will be used to pool the studies. We will pool dichotomous outcomes to obtain an odd ratio (OR) and report with 95% CI. Continuous outcomes will be pooled to obtain mean difference and reported with 95% CI.

Bicyclic somatostatin-based radiopeptides have not been studied yet. Hypothesizing that the introduction of conformational constraints may lead to receptor subtype selectivity or may help to delineate structural features determining pansomatostatin potency, we developed and evaluated first examples of this new class of potential radiotracers for imaging or therapy of neuroendocrine tumors. METHODS The bicyclic peptides were synthesized by standard solid-phase peptide synthesis. DOTA was coupled to the resin-assembled peptide for labeling with (177)Lu and (68)Ga. Binding affinity and receptor subtype profile were determined using human ssts. Ca(2+) flux, internalization, and efflux were studied in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-sst(2) and HEK-sst(3) cell lines. Biodistribution and PET/CT studies were performed in corresponding nude mice models. RESULTS Some of the new analogs showed high affinity for sst(2) and sst(3) and moderate affinity for sst(1), sst(4), and sst(5), while exhibiting agonistic properties. The analog AM3, comprising an octreotide ring and a head-to-tail-coupled Arg-diaminobutyric acid(DOTA) cycle, showed the highest receptor affinity and agonist potency. (177)Lu-AM3 showed high and receptor-mediated uptake in vivo in sst(2) and sst(3) tumors with low background. Kidneys were the only other tissue accumulating radioactivity that could be reduced by a preinjection of lysine. PET/CT studies of (68)Ga-AM3 at 1 h after injection were characterized by clear localization of the tumor, visualization of the kidneys, and negligible background. CONCLUSION The high rigidity of these new bicyclic somatostatin-based radiopeptides led to agonistic ligands with good affinity for all 5 ssts. The pharmacokinetic data of (177)Lu/(68)Ga-AM3 make this peptide an excellent candidate as an imaging--and especially as a PET--radiotracer.","output":"Radiolabeled bicyclic somatostatin-based analogs: a novel class of potential radiotracers for SPECT/PET of neuroendocrine tumors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Testing strategies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in school settings are needed to assess the efficacy of infection mitigation strategies and inform school reopening policies. We hypothesized that supervised serial self-collected non-nasopharyngeal testing in summer camp settings would be acceptable and feasible. Methods: We performed a cohort study at two urban day camps for kindergarten-8th graders in June and July 2020. Eligible participants were campers, up to two adult household contacts, and camp staff. We assessed participation rates for providing, at two time points, supervised, self-collected anterior nares samples for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and saliva samples for antibody testing. We qualitatively assessed testing feasibility and adherence to stated camp infection mitigation strategies. Results: 76% (186/246) of eligible participants consented. The cohort completing both rounds of testing (n=163) comprised 67 campers, 76 household contacts, and 20 staff. Among those present, 100% of campers and staff completed test collection at both time points. Testing was feasible to implement, including staff participation supervising camper test collection. No virus was detected by RT-PCR; seven participants had antibodies. Observed adherence to stated camp mitigation policies for masking, physical distancing, and stable cohorting was generally high. Conclusions: Supervised, self-collected serial anterior nasal and saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 testing was acceptable, with successful repeated participation by children ages 5-14.

METHODS: Global, regional and country-level DALY numbers and rates due to URE among adolescents were acquired from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 database. Human Development Index (HDI), Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) and other country-level data were obtained from other open databases as potential indicators. Regression analysis was used to evaluate associations between DALY rates among adolescents and potential predictors. RESULTS: Global DALYs due to URE among adolescents rose by 8% between 1990 and 2019 but moderately decreased by 4.8% during this period after adjusting for population size. Female adolescents showed higher DALY rates. DALY rates sharply increased from 5 to 9 years of age, then rose more slowly, reaching a plateau before 20 years of age. Country-level DALY rates in 2019 were positively associated with HDI, SDI, and urbanization rates but negatively correlated with primary school dropout rates. Higher disease burden of adolescents visually impaired from URE was associated with lower primary school dropout rates ( = ? 0.257, 95% CI ? 0.376 to ? 0.138, P < 0.001) and higher urbanization rates ( = 0.257, 95% CI 0.067 to 0.256, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Higher socioeconomic status, urbanization rates and education levels are associated with a heavier disease burden of URE among adolescents.

For 3, two polymorphs are known, namely 3red and 3yellow. Both polymorphs of 3 were analyzed and discussed. All the molecules adopt an enol-imine tautomer, stabilized by two intramolecular OCH[Formula: see text] N hydrogen bonds. The structure of 2 is further stabilized by a couple of additional OCH[Formula: see text] O hydrogen bonds and by intermolecular OCH[Formula: see text] O interactions, yielding a 1D zig-zag supramolecular chain. Molecules of 2, 3red and 3yellow are interlinked through intermolecular CCH[Formula: see text]  interactions, while the crystal packing of 1 and 2 is also described by intermolecular [Formula: see text]  interactions. More than 90% of the total Hirshfeld surface area for all the discussed molecules is occupied by H[Formula: see text] H, H[Formula: see text] C, H[Formula: see text] O and C[Formula: see text] C contacts. The polymorphs 3red and 3yellow, despite being chemically the same, differ geometrically, thus yielding remarkably different Hirshfeld surfaces. The Hirshfeld surface of 3yellow is very similar to that of 2. All structures are mainly characterized by the dispersion energy framework followed by the less significant electrostatic energy framework contribution. Molecular docking studies were employed to inspect the effect of 1C3 on the SARS-CoV-2 protein targets. The docking analysis revealed that the dye 2 showed the best binding energies toward Papain-like protease (PLpro, C10.40 kcal/mol), nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14 (N7-MTase), C10.10 kcal/mol), RdRp-RTP (C9.70 kcal/mol) and nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3_range 207-379-MES, C9.30 kcal/mol).

Despite the extensive efforts taken in the past decades, development of the ideal live attenuated FIPV vaccine was not successful yet. In the present study, we provide data of immunisation experiments with a recombinant FCoV pair differing only in the truncation (PBFIPV-DF-2) or completion (PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i) of their ORF3abc regions. In our previous in vivo studies, these viruses proved to show the characters of low virulent or avirulent FCoV phenotypes, respectively. Therefore, we hypothesised the ability of these viruses, as possible vaccine candidates, in conferring protection in specific pathogen free (SPF) Domestic Shorthair as well as in conventional purebred British Shorthair cats. In SPF cats, after two oronasal and two intramuscular vaccinations with two weeks intervals, both vaccine candidates provided 100% protection against lethal homologous challenge with the highly virulent FIPV DF-2 strain. In contrast, the conventional purebred British Shorthair cats did not develop protection when they were immunised with the same vaccination regimes. In these groups 100% of the PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i immunised animals developed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Prolonged survival was observed in 40% of the animals, while 60% showed fulminant disease course. Genetic and more probably immunological differences between the SPF and non-SPF purebred kittens can explain the different outcome of the vaccination experiment.

Application of the ERAS protocol to colorectal cancer surgery has been limited to a minority of hospitals in Italy. To promote the systematic adoption of ERAS in the entire regional hospital network in Piemonte an Audit and Feedback approach (A&F) has been adopted together with a cluster randomised trial to estimate the true impact of the protocol on a large, unselected population. METHODS: A multicentre stepped wedge cluster randomised trial is designed for comparison between standard perioperative management and the management according to the ERAS protocol. The primary outcome is the length of hospital stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes are: incidence of postoperative complications, time to patients recovery, control of pain and patients satisfaction. With an A&F approach the adherence to the ERAS items is monitored through a dedicated area in the study web site. The study includes 28 surgical centres, stratified by activity volume and randomly divided into four groups. Each group is randomly assigned to a different activation period of the ERAS protocol. There are four activation periods, one every 3 months. However, the planned calendar and the total duration of the study have been extended by 6 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The expected sample size of about 2200 patients has a high statistical power (98%) to detect a reduction of LOS of 1 day and to estimate clinically meaningful changes in the other endpoints.

CENP-A defines the loci by serving as an epigenetic marker that recruits other centromere components for a functional structure. However, the mechanism that controls CENP-A regulation of centromeric chromatin integrity remains to be explored. Separate studies have shown that loss of CENP-A or the Cdk5 regulatory subunit associated protein 2 (Cdk5rap2), a key player in mitotic progression, triggers the occurrence of lagging chromosomes. This prompted us to investigate a potential link between CENP-A and Cdk5rap2 in the maintenance of centromeric chromatin integrity. Here, we demonstrate that loss of Cdk5rap2 causes reduced CENP-A expression while exogenous Cdk5rap2 expression in cells depleted of endogenous Cdk5rap2 restores CENP-A expression. Indeed, we show that Cdk5rap2 is a nuclear protein that acts as a positive transcriptional regulator of CENP-A. Cdk5rap2 interacts with the CENP-A promoter and upregulates CENP-A transcription. Accordingly, loss of Cdk5rap2 causes reduced level of centromeric CENP-A. Exogenous CENP-A expression partially inhibits the occurrence of lagging chromosomes in Cdk5rap2 knockdown cells, indicating that lagging chromosomes induced by loss of Cdk5rap2 is due, in part, to loss of CENP-A. Aside from manifesting lagging chromosomes, cells depleted of Cdk5rap2, and thus CENP-A, show increased micronuclei and chromatin bridge formation. Altogether, our findings indicate that Cdk5rap2 serves to maintain centromeric chromatin integrity partly through CENP-A.","output":"Centromeric chromatin integrity is compromised by loss of Cdk5rap2, a transcriptional activator of CENP-A"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has drastically changed practices inside hospitals, which include oncology routines.

In this report, the preferential recognition of the H-2Db-restricted epitope is confirmed using splenocytes stimulatedin vitrowith either MHV-JHM-infected MC57 cells or with a cell line expressing the S protein and analyzed in secondary CTL assays. To determine whether these results represent a difference in epitope recognition between the spleen and CNS, secondary CTL assays were performed using spleen cells coated with peptides encompassing the CTL epitopes as stimulators. Under these conditions, both epitopes sensitized cells for lysis by spleen-derived CTLs, suggesting that both epitopes were recognized by splenic CD8+T cells after infectionin vivo.Furthermore, limiting dilution analysis indicated that the precursor frequency of splenic CD8+T cells specific for both the H-2Kb- and H-2Db-restricted epitopes were not significantly different. Thus, the results suggest thatin vitrostimulation of splenocytes specific for the H-2Kb-restricted epitope is inefficient after endogenous processing but that this inefficiency can be corrected if peptide is provided exogenously at sufficiently high concentrations.

However, there are limited published data associating the results from commercial assays with neutralizing antibodies. METHODS: 67 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a positive result by the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and 5 control specimens were analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Correlation, concordance, positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated at several cutoffs. Results were compared in patients categorized by clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer (EC(50)) and the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46 respectively. At an EC(50) of 1:32, the concordance kappa with Roche was 0.49 (95% CI; 0.23-0.75), with Abbott was 0.52 (0.28-0.77), and with EUROIMMUN was 0.61 (0.4-0.82). At the same neutralizing titer, the PPA and NPA for the Roche was 100% (94-100) & 56% (30-80); Abbott was 96% (88-99) & 69% (44-86); and EUROIMMUN was 91% (80-96) & 81% (57-93) for distinguishing neutralizing antibodies. Patients who were intubated, had cardiac injury, or acute kidney injury from COVID-19 infection had higher neutralizing titers relative to those with mild symptoms. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients generate an antibody response to multiple viral proteins such that the calibrator ratios on the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays are all associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.

However, serum and lung biomarkers that can predict RPILD development remain unclear. OBJECTIVES To determine potential serum and lung biomarkers that can predict RPILD development in patients with PM/DM-ILD. METHODS In total, 49 patients with PM/DM-ILD were enrolled. We measured the serum levels of 41 cytokines/chemokines, ferritin and anti-MDA5 antibody, compared them between the RPILD (n = 23) and non-RPILD (n = 26) groups, and ranked them by their importance through random forest analysis. To distinguish the two groups, we determined biomarker combinations by logistic regression analysis. We also measured the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) levels of 41 cytokines/chemokines. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined IL-15 expression in lung tissues. The IL-15 production was also investigated using A549 and BEAS-2B cells. RESULTS The RPILD group had significantly higher IL-15, IL-1RA, IL-6, CXCL10, VCAM-1, anti-MDA5 antibody and ferritin serum levels than the non-RPILD group, but it had a significantly low CCL22 level. Meanwhile, anti-MDA5 antibody, IL-15, CXCL8, CCL22, IL-1RA and ferritin were the best combination to distinguish the two groups. IL-15 and CCL22 were also predictive marker for RPILD development in anti-MDA5 antibody-positive patients. Additionally, the RPILD group had significantly high IL-15 levels in BALF. The lung tissues expressed IL-15, which increased after cytokine stimulation in the A549 cells. CONCLUSION This study identified a combination of biomarkers predicting PM/DM-RPILD progression, and IL-15 is an important cytokine for predicting RPILD development and reflecting ILD severity.","output":"IL-15 is a biomarker involved in the development of rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease complicated with polymyositis/dermatomyositis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since aerosol continuously persists in dental settings, where different procedures and patients come in succession, the use of oronasal masks is highly recommended. Among them, respirators known as Filtering Face Pieces (FFP) show a protective superiority compared to surgical masks. Even concerning respirators classified as non-reusable, it is not known how many hours of use are necessary to compromise their filtering capacity. The aim of this study is to investigate the variations of filtering capacity of an FFP2 respirator over time, in order to safely optimize the timing of its use. Five respirators were worn by the same operator during clinical activity for different usage times (8, 16, 24, 32, 40 h), and one respirator was kept unused. All respirators underwent a bacterial filtration efficacy (BFE) test. T-test for paired data with Bootstrap technique and Wilcoxon test for paired data compared BFE values of the five tested FFP2s respectively at each time, and the areas with the corresponding values of the control respirator (FFp2-F). A generalized linear mixed effect model (GLM) was applied considering type of respirator and time as fixed effects and intercept as random effect. No significant statistical differences were present in the BFE of each time. Data obtained by the present study highlight the important ability of FFP2s to maintain their BFE over time, suggesting a long lasting protective function.","output":"Variation of Efficacy of Filtering Face Pieces Respirators over Time in a Dental Setting: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present work aims to expand the application of machine learning models in predicting and identifying traffic flow data and provide a reference for the scheduling and management of shared traffic against the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. First, a time segmentation-based prediction model is proposed considering the classification superiority of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and combining the Optimal Segmentation Algorithm (OSA), denoted as OSA-SVM. Second, an algorithm for generating a shared traffic flow sequence is proposed based on the historical data of shared traffic flow. Finally, a shared traffic flow moment identification model is constructed based on the label propagation algorithm and the Random Forest (RF) model. Comparative analysis suggests that the OSA-SVM regression prediction model can accurately fit the fluctuations caused by the shared traffic flow data; however, its overall effect is not good, with deviation from the actual traffic sequence. Introducing historical data for weighting processing improves the goodness-of-fit of the regression prediction model significantly, maintaining at the level of 0.66C0.71 after one week. The stochastic gradient descent algorithm can provide a better weighted processing effect. The RF model shows the best recognition effect for the shared traffic data stream compared with other models, presenting an excellent performance in dealing with the imbalance and instability problems.

Dalbavancin is a novel antibiotic with a long plasmatic half-life and simplified weekly administration regimens, thus representing a promising option for the outpatient treatment of Gram-positive infections and the early discharge of hospitalized patients. Dalbavancin is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs). Many preliminary data seem to support its use in other indications, such as osteomyelitis, prosthetic joint infections, and infective endocarditis. AREAS COVERED: A search in the literature using validated keywords (dalbavancin, Gram-positive infections, Gram-positive cocci, ABSSSI, intravenous treatment, and long-acting antibiotics) was conducted on biomedical bibliographic databases (PubMed and Embase) from 2004 to 30 September 2020. Results were analyzed during two consensus conferences with the aim to review the current evidence on dalbavancin in Gram-positive infections, mainly ABSSSI, osteomyelitis, and infective endocarditis, highlight the main limitations of available studies and suggest possible advantages of the molecule. EXPERT OPINION: The board identifies some specific subgroups of patients with ABSSSIs who could mostly benefit from a treatment with dalbavancin and agrees that the design of homogenous and robust studies would allow a broader use of dalbavancin even in other clinical settings.","output":"The role of dalbavancin for Gram positive infections in the COVID-19 era: state of the art and future perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several non-pharmaceutical interventions have been proposed to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. On the large scale, these empirical solutions, often associated with extended and complete lockdowns, attempt to minimize the costs associated with mortality, economic losses and social factors, while being subject to constraints such as finite hospital capacity. Here we pose the question of how to mitigate pandemic costs subject to constraints by adopting the language of optimal control theory. This allows us to determine top-down policies for the nature and dynamics of social contact rates given an age-structured model for the dynamics of the disease. Depending on the relative weights allocated to life and socioeconomic losses, we see that the optimal strategies range from long-term social-distancing only for the most vulnerable, to partial lockdown to ensure not over-running hospitals, to alternating-shifts with significant reduction in life and/or socioeconomic losses. Crucially, commonly used strategies that involve long periods of broad lockdown are almost never optimal, as they are highly unstable to reopening and entail high socioeconomic costs. Using parameter estimates from data available for Germany and the USA, we quantify these policies and use sensitivity analysis in the relevant model parameters and initial conditions to determine the range of robustness of our policies. Finally we also discuss how bottom-up behavioral changes can also change the dynamics of the pandemic and show how this in tandem with top-down control policies can mitigate pandemic costs even more effectively.","output":"Optimal policies for mitigating pandemic costs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA interference (RNAi) is a sequence-specific, post-transcriptional process of mRNA degradation.

At 6 days post-challenged, the relative survival rates of shrimp injected with siDNApol, siRR2, siTK-TMK, siVP24 and siVP28 (siRNAs for dnapol, rr2, tk-tmk, vp24 and vp28 genes) reached 50%, 50%, 66%, 33% and 33%, respectively. Specific siRNAs of the five WSSV genes could result in suppression of the target genes and a significant reduction in the viral proliferation. In negative controls, sequence-independent siRNA (mutant siRNA) could not inhibit expression of these five genes or viral replication. Consequently, injection of sequence-dependent siRNA could induce anti-WSSV activity in shrimp.

It is very important to establish a rapid, accurate test with large-scale detection potential to prevent the further spread of the epidemic. An optimized RPA-Cas12a-based platform combined with digital microfluidics (DMF), the RCD platform, was established to achieve the automated, rapid detection of influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2. The probe in the RPA-Cas12a system was optimized to produce maximal fluorescence to increase the amplification signal. The reaction droplets in the platform were all at the microliter level and the detection could be accomplished within 30 min due to the effective mixing of droplets by digital microfluidic technology. The whole process from amplification to recognition is completed in the chip, which reduces the risk of aerosol contamination. One chip can contain multiple detection reaction areas, offering the potential for customized detection. The RCD platform demonstrated a high level of sensitivity, specificity (no false positives or negatives), speed (30 min), automation and multiplexing. We also used the RCD platform to detect nucleic acids from influenza patients and COVID-19 patients. The results were consistent with the findings of qPCR. The RCD platform is a one-step, rapid, highly sensitive and specific method with the advantages of digital microfluidic technology, which circumvents the shortcomings of manual operation. The development of the RCD platform provides potential for the isothermal automatic detection of nucleic acids during epidemics.

Methods: In this double-center, observational study, we recruited all consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from January 23 to February 14, 2020 in two designated hospitals in Hunan province, China. Epidemiological and clinical data from patients' electronic medical records were collected and compared between mild, moderate and severe/critical group in detail. Clinical outcomes were followed up to February 20, 2020. Findings: 291 patients with COVID-19 were categorized into mild group (10.0%), moderate group (72.8%) and severe/critical group (17.2%). The median age of all patients was 46 years (49.8% were male). 86.6% patients had an indirect exposure history. The proportion of patients that had been to Wuhan in severe/critical group (48.0% vs 17.2%, p=0.006) and moderate group (43.4% vs 17.2%, p=0.007) were higher than mild group. Fever (68.7%), cough (60.5%), and fatigue (31.6%) were common symptoms especially for severe and critical patients. Typical lung imaging finding were bilateral and unilateral ground glass opacity or consolidation. Leukopenia, lymphopenia and eosinopenia occurred in 36.1%, 22.7% and 50.2% patients respectively. Increased fibrinogen was detected in 45 of 58 (77.6%) patients with available results. 29 of 44 (65.9%) or 22 of 40 (55.0%) patients were positive in Mycoplasma pneumonia or Chlamydia pneumonia antibody test respectively. Compared with mild or moderate group, severe/critical group had a relative higher level of neutrophil, Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio, h-CRP, ESR, CK, CK-MB, LDH, D-dimer, and a lower level of lymphocyte, eosinophils, platelet, HDL and sodium (all p<0.01). Most patients received antiviral therapy and Chinese Medicine therapy. As of February 20, 2020, 159 (54.6%) patients were discharged and 2 (0.7%) patients died during hospitalization.

We constructed an arrayed library of ISGs from rhesus macaques and tested the ability of hundreds of individual macaque and human ISGs to inhibit early and late replication steps for 11 members of the retroviridae from various host species. These screens uncovered numerous ISGs with antiretroviral activity at both the early and late stages of virus replication. Detailed analyses of two antiretroviral ISGs indicate that indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) can inhibit retroviral replication by metabolite depletion while tripartite motif-56 (TRIM56) accentuates ISG induction by IFN and inhibits the expression of late HIV-1 genes.

However, achieving rapid, low-cost, and sensitive detection of short-length target DNA still remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we successfully combine the catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) technique with capillary action to develop a new and cost-effective method, a target DNA- and pH-responsive DNA hydrogelCbased capillary assay, for the naked eye detection of 24 nt short single-stranded target DNA. Upon contact of target DNA, three individual hairpin DNAs hybridize with each other to sufficiently amplify Y-shaped DNA nanostructures (Y-DNA) until they are completely consumed via CHA cycling reactions. Each arm of the resultant Y-DNA contains sticky ends with i-motif DNA structure-forming sequences that can be self-assembled in an acidic environment (pH 5.0) to form target DNA- and pH-responsive DNA hydrogels by means of i-motif DNA-driven crosslinking. When inserting a capillary tube in the resultant solution, the liquid level inside clearly reduces due to the decrease in capillary force induced by the gels. In this way, the developed assay demonstrates sensitive and quantitative detection, with a detection limit of approximately 10 pM of 24 nt short complementary DNA (cDNA) targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA genes at room temperature within 1 h. The assay is further shown to successfully detect target cDNA in serum, and it is also applied to detect several types of target sequences. Requiring no analytic equipment, precise temperature control, or enzymatic reactions, the developed DNA hydrogelCbased capillary assay has potential as a promising naked eye detection platform for target DNA in resource-limited clinical settings.

The current study examines the relationship between alcohol use, EF and alcohol-related problems, in the general population. METHODS: A between-groups cross-sectional design assessed EF across two levels of drinking; hazardous (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score of ?8) and non-hazardous. Alcohol drinkers (n = 666; 136 male; 524 female; six not disclosed; aged 28.02  10.40 years) completed validated questionnaires online assessing subjective EF, alcohol use and alcohol-related problems. RESULTS: Organisation, Strategic Planning, Impulse Control and overall function were significantly impaired in hazardous drinkers. Furthermore, the effect of alcohol on EF, partially mediated the relationship between alcohol use and alcohol-related problems. CONCLUSION: Hazardous drinking was associated with lower subjective EF, and this mediated the effect of alcohol on alcohol-related problems. This may be due to changes in prefrontal brain regions, which could indicate greater risk for the development of alcohol dependence (AD).

Physician responses to a survey were collected. RESULTS Two hundred and thirty-one telemedicine visits were performed by 4 physicians, comprising 20% of visits during the study period. Patients were 47.6% male and 90.9% Caucasian. In addition, 85.7% were established patients and 21.2% were postoperative visits. Diagnoses evaluated by telemedicine included benign and malignant anorectal and colorectal disease as well as inflammatory bowel disease. All providers reported being able to provide adequate care via telemedicine and were planning to continue providing telemedicine. Patients seen via telemedicine were more likely to be Caucasian and less likely to be African American (P < .001) and more likely to be established patients than those seen in person (P < .001).

This study aims to evaluate the adoption of H&S technologies for pandemic management in the construction sector under the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews with eighteen practitioners engaged from construction companies and technology firms were conducted to collect their views on the driving forces and issues of the adoption of H&S technologies for pandemic management in Chinese construction projects. The results reveal that the major H&S technologies used included the health quick response (QR) code system, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered fever monitoring, and site access control system. These technologies were reported to be effective in preventing the spread of the pandemic in workplaces. The findings of the study amplify that the pandemic may serve as an acceleration of the adoption of H&S technologies in the construction sector. Other technologies, such as building information modeling, drones, AI-based safety monitoring, and robotics, however, were seldom used in the studied projects.

We demonstrate that despite its intuitive appeal for reducing conflict, opting not to take sides over moralized issues can harm trust, even relative to siding against an observer's viewpoint outright.

When actors choose not to take sides, observers often ascribe concealed opposition, an attribution of strategic deception which provokes distrust and undermines real-stakes cooperation and partner choice. We further demonstrate that this effect arises only when staying out of it seems strategic: Actors who seem to hold genuine middle-ground beliefs or who lack incentives for impression management are not distrusted for avoiding conflict.

Jugular whole blood samples were collected from Holstein (H) dairy calves (n = 8) artificially fed 5% B.W. colostrum, and from beef calves which were the progenies of Charolais-Limousin (CL; n = 7) and Limousin-Friesian beef suckler cows (LF; n = 7), for subsequent RNA isolation. In dairy calves, there was a surge in pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression possibly due to the stress of separation from the dam. LF calves exhibited early signs of humoral immune development with observed increases in the expression genes coding for Ig receptors, which was not evident in the other breeds by 7 days of age. Immune and health related DEGs identified as upregulated in beef calves are prospective contender genes for the classification of biomarkers for immune-competence development, and will contribute towards a greater understanding of the development of an immune response in neonatal calves.","output":"Blood immune transcriptome analysis of artificially fed dairy calves and naturally suckled beef calves from birth to 7 days of age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To compare the radiographic and clinical effects of 25 versus 10 mg twice-weekly (BIW) etanercept over 52 weeks in Japanese patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Methods: This was a post-hoc analysis of a Phase 3 study where Japanese patients with active RA were randomized to receive BIW etanercept 25 mg (n = 182), etanercept 10 mg (n = 192), or methotrexate (n = 176) for 52 weeks (NCT00445770).

Different stem and progenitor cell types can be isolated from the different perinatal tissues making them particularly interesting candidates for use in cell therapy and regenerative medicine. The primary source of perinatal stem cells is cord blood. Cord blood has been a well-known source of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells since 1974.

A lesser severity compared with adults was described, but knowledge concerning clinical forms and screening strategies was missing. METHODOLOGY: In this retrospective and non-interventional epidemiological study, we aimed to describe the epidemiology and the clinical features of COVID-19 pediatric disease in the first university hospital affected by the epidemic in France. We included all underage patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays on nasopharyngeal smears performed between February 25, 2020 and April 30, 2020. RESULTS: The presence of fever and respiratory signs was frequent (>50%), as was the presence of general or digestive signs, but patients were also frequently asymptomatic, making the discovery of a positive smear fortuitous.

There is evidence that this variability is related to the contributions of Indirect waves (I-waves) recruited in the cortex. The latency of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) can be measured through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), allowing an individual's responsiveness to tDCS to be determined. However, this single-pulse method requires several different orientations of the TMS coil, potentially affecting its reliability. Instead, we propose a paired-pulse TMS paradigm targeting I-waves as an alternative method. This method uses one orientation that reduces inter- and intra-trial variability. It was hypothesized that the paired-pulse method would correlate more highly to tDCS responses than the single-pulse method. In a randomized, double blinded, cross-over design, 30 healthy participants completed two sessions, receiving 20 min of either anodal (2 mA) or sham tDCS. TMS was used to quantify Short interval intracortical facilitation (SICF) at Inter stimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1.5, 3.5 and 4.5 ms. Latency was determined in the posterior-anterior (PA), anterior-posterior (AP) and latero-medial (LM) coil orientations. The relationship between latency, SICF measures and the change in suprathreshold MEP amplitude size following tDCS were determined with Pearson's correlations. TMS measures, SICI and SICF were also used to determine responses to Anodal-tDCS (a-tDCS). Neither of the latency differences nor the SICF measures correlated to the change in MEP amplitude from pre-post tDCS (all P > 0.05). Overall, there was no significant response to tDCS in this cohort. This study highlights the need for testing the effects of various tDCS protocols on the different I-waves.

While climate change education often focuses on the physical dimensions of climate change and the evaluation of political, technological, and behavioral solutions, less attention has been directed to questions of how large-scale transformations to sustainability occur and how educators can help students to perceive an active role for themselves in these efforts. This paper describes an integrative learning process for teaching the how of transformation. This process, which we use in our undergraduate courses on climate change and society, combines the Three Spheres model of transformation with an active learning change experiment. A pilot assessment, conducted via student surveys and focus groups during spring semester 2020, indicated that the learning process: (1) increased the students understanding of transformation and their sense that transformative change is possible; (2) enhanced the students sense of their own agency and ability to make a difference; and, (3) helped students to articulate a role for themselves in processes of transformative change. These initial findings suggest that teaching the how of transformation is possible and that both understanding and experiential realization of the connection between individual and collective change are vital elements for student learning and engagement. While these early findings need to be replicated in other courses and educational settings, they offer promising indications about how universities and climate change educators can play a more prominent role in generating transformative change.","output":"Teaching the how of transformation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Wuhan city, China at the end of 2019 made it urgent to identify the origin of the causal pathogen and its molecular evolution, to appropriately design an effective vaccine. This study analyzes the evolutionary background of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-2) in accordance with its close relative SARS-CoV (SARS-1), which was emerged in 2002. A comparative genomic and proteomic study was conducted on SARS-2, SARS-1, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), which was emerged in 2012. In silico analysis inferred the genetic variability among the tested viruses. The SARS-1 genome harbored 11 genes encoding 12 proteins, while SARS-2 genome contained only 10 genes encoding for 10 proteins. MERS genome contained 11 genes encoding 11 proteins. The analysis also revealed a slight variation in the whole genome size of SARS-2 comparing to its siblings resulting from sequential insertions and deletions (indels) throughout the viral genome particularly ORF1AB, spike, ORF10 and ORF8. The effective indels were observed in the gene encoding the spike protein that is responsible for viral attachment to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor and initiating infection. These indels are responsible for the newly emerging COVID-19 variants CoV, CoV, CoV and CoV. Nowadays, few effective COVID-19 vaccines developed based on spike (S) glycoprotein were approved and become available worldwide. Currently available vaccines can relatively prevent the spread of COVID-19 and suppress the disease. The traditional (killed or attenuated virus vaccine and antibody-based vaccine) and innovated vaccine production technologies (RNA- and DNA-based vaccines and viral vectors) are summarized in this review.

The parameters for bonded interactions are derived by mapping the bonds and angles for 20 amino acids onto target distributions obtained from fully atomistic simulations in explicit solvent. A dual-basin potential is introduced for stabilizing backbone angles, to cover a wide spectrum of protein secondary structures. The backbone dihedral potential enables folding of the protein from an unfolded initial state to the folded native structure. The proposed force field is validated by evaluating the structural properties of several model peptides and proteins including the SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptide, consisting of -helices, ?-sheets, loops and turns. Detailed comparisons with fully atomistic simulations are carried out to assess the ability of the proposed force field to stabilize the different secondary structures present in proteins. The compact conformations of the native states were evident from the radius of gyration and the high intensity peaks of the root mean square deviation histograms, which were found to be within 0.4 nm. The Ramachandran-like energy landscape on the phase space of backbone angles () and dihedrals () effectively captured the conformational phase space of -helices at a( = 50, = 90) and ?-strands at a( = 180, = 90-120).

This policy is mainly related to the availability of handling infrastructure, governance of authority relations and coordination across government levels which are still problematic. The purpose of this study was to determine the handling of strategic policies carried out by the North Maluku Provincial Government in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The method used in this research is descriptive qualitative as well as data reduction approach, data presentation, and conclusion drawing. The research findings show that the fisheries sector as part of a strategic policy is under serious threat due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact is the cessation of the production sector which results in losses for fishermen. The effect that occurs is that there is a gap between fish production and the energy that fishermen must spend. Meanwhile, in the health sector, the Provincial Government of North Maluku took a policy of expanding reserve hospitals by utilizing existing land. In addition, the North Maluku Provincial Government urges the central government to provide polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tools or machines so that the central government provides 1 PCR unit for North Maluku.

Increased adipose tissue is the main cause of harm in obesity. To better understand obesity and its related complications, we analyzed the mRNA expression profiles of adipose tissues from 126 patients with obesity and 275 non-obese controls. Using an integrated bioinformatics method, we explored the functions of 113 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between them. Gene ontology (GO) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses revealed that upregulated DEGs were enriched in immune cell chemotaxis, complement-related cascade activation, and various inflammatory signaling pathways, while downregulated DEGs enriched in nutrient metabolism. The CIBERSORT algorithm indicated that an increase in macrophages may be the main cause of adipose tissue inflammation, while decreased æ T cells reduce sympathetic action, leading to dysregulation of adipocyte thermogenesis. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed using the STRING database, and the top 10 hub genes were identified using the cytoHubba plug-in in Cytoscape. All were confirmed to be obesity-related using a separate dataset. In addition, we identified chemicals related to these hub genes that may contribute to obesity.

Surprisingly, our results revealed that RaTG13 was more efficiently neutralised than SARS-CoV-2. In addition, neutralisation assays using spike mutants harbouring single and combinatorial amino acid substitutions within the RBD demonstrated that both spike proteins can tolerate multiple changes without dramatically reducing neutralisation.

RESULTS: Results suggested that the two white rot fungi responded differently when exposed to the different concentrations of TCS. In general, P. ostreatus exhibited more potential and ligninolytic enzymatic activity compared to T. versicolor. LC-MS/MS analyses also showed that P. ostreatus degraded TCS with higher efficiency compared to T. versicolor. In addition, almost all P. ostreatus biodegradation activity was completed within the first day of sampling. Contrasting, less efficient degradation was observed by T. versicolor, reaching around 88% of TCS biodegradation at concentration of 20a?g mL-1after 10 days. At higher TCS concentrations (&#8805;30a?ga?mL-1), the growth of T. versicolor severely inhibited and led to a drop in enzymatic activity and biodegradation. Furthermore, laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP) were determined as more involved enzymes which significantly correlated to TCS biodegradation by T. versicolor and P. ostreatus, respectively. CONCLUSION: P. ostreatus might be considered as efficient fungus in biodegradation of high amount of TCS in environmental matrices. The results of the present study might provide insights for future investigations on potential of fungi for applications in bioaugmentation-based strategies to remove TCS from wastewater and activated sludge.","output":"Effect of Pleurotus ostreatus and Trametes versicolor on triclosan biodegradation and activity of laccase and manganese peroxidase enzymes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Credible, reliable and consistent information to the public, as well as health professionals and decision makers, is crucial to help navigate uncertainty and risk in times of crisis and concern. Traditionally, information and health communications issued by respected and established government agencies have been regarded as factual, unbiased and credible. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is such an agency that addresses all aspects of health and public health on behalf of the U.S Government for the benefit of its citizens. In July 2020, the CDC issued guidelines on reopening schools which resulted in open criticism by the U.S. President and others, prompting a review and publication of revised guidelines together with a special \\"Statement on the Importance of Reopening Schools under COVID-19.\\" We hypothesize that this statement introduced bias with the intention to shift the public perception and media narrative in favor of reopening of schools. Using a mixed methods approach, including an online text analysis tool, we demonstrate that document title and structure, word frequencies, word choice, and website presentation did not provide a balanced account of the complexity and uncertainty surrounding school reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite available scientific guidance and practical evidence-based advice on how to manage infection risks when reopening schools, the CDC Statement was intentionally overriding possible parent and public health concerns. The CDC Statement provides an example of how political influence is exercised over the presentation of science in the context of a major pandemic. It was withdrawn by the CDC in November 2020.","output":"Presenting or Spinning Facts?

Adversities that are the most prominently studied and shown to bring about the most serious consequences for adjustment across the adult lifespan include job loss, disease and disability onset, and spousal and child bereavement. However, not all individuals show sustained declines to adversity; some are able to bounce back. The resilience literature is built on the premise that individuals are able to bounce back, or adapt to adversity. The past 15-20 years have seen an abundance of resilience research examining resilience to diverse types of adversity across the adult life-span. The overarching goal of this paper is to evaluate psychological concepts of resilience in adulthood and old age and recommend avenues for future research. To do so, I first evaluate and discuss definitions of resilience and their overlap across literatures with an emphasis on sociological approaches to studying adversity across the adult lifespan. Second, I discuss promising conceptual and methodological approaches to advance the resilience literature in adulthood and old age. Conceptual approaches to furthering the resilience literature include incorporating an anticipation component into the definition of resilience. Methodological approaches to furthering the resilience literature include prospective longitudinal designs that incorporate quantitative and qualitative approaches, multidimensional assessments, and the need to examine repeated adversities or multiple adversities that transpire in relatively close proximity to one another.","output":"What Does Resilience Signify?

The introduction of antimicrobial chemotherapy in the 1940s led to the rapid abandonment of many forms of passive antibody therapy. Chemotherapy was more effective and less toxic than antibody therapy. In this last decade of the 20th century the efficacy of antimicrobial chemotherapy is diminishing because of the rapidly escalating number of immunocompromised individuals, the emergence of new pathogens, the reemergence of old pathogens, and widespread development of resistance to antimicrobial drugs. This diminishment in the effectiveness of chemotherapy has been paralleled by advances in monoclonal antibody technology that have made feasible the generation of human antibodies. This combination of factors makes passive antibody therapy an option worthy of serious consideration. We propose that for every pathogen there exists an antibody that will modify the infection to the benefit of the host. Such antibodies are potential antimicrobial agents. Antibody-based therapies have significant advantages and disadvantages relative to standard chemotherapy. The reintroduction of antibody-based therapy would require major changes in the practices of infectious disease specialists.","output":"Return to the Past: The Case for Antibody-Based Therapies in Infectious Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This retrospective and observational cohort study investigated chest computed tomography (CT) findings, cycle threshold (Ct) values in RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 and secondary infection occurrence to predict prognosis in COVID-19 patients.

The article examines the scenarios of the political development of the world depending on the megatrends such as globalization, integration, democratization and the opposite trends - de-globalization, disintegration and de-democratization, as well as the current state of the political organization of the world, including the Westphalian system, the system of interstate relations (system of international relations) and political systems of the modern world states. Methods and materials. The political organization of the world is considered as a system consisting of three subsystems. In this regard, the main approach in the study is the systems approach. Scenario analysis is used as a research method. Analysis. Recently interest in scenarios of the political development of the world has sharply increased, which is reflected in the publications of many Russian and foreign authors. The scenarios of the political development of the world in the 21th century, after the crises associated with the terrorist attacks in 2001, the economic crisis that began in 2008 and the crisis in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, began to be discussed especially intensively. Most researchers consider such scenarios based on ideas about the possible configuration of interstate relations, i.e. parts of the system of international (interstate) relations. It is shown that this parameter of analysis is important, but insufficient. It is proposed to consider the scenarios of the political development of the world on the basis of how megatrends and trends alternative to them will act, as well as how the political organization of the world will develop. Results. Four parameters of scenario analysis are identified: 1) time parameter in actions of (mega) trends;2) differentiated actions (mega) trends in many indicators of economic and social interaction;3) configuration of the leading states in the international arena (part of the system of international relations). This parameter is widely used by various researchers;4) an evolutionary (smooth) or revolutionary (through conflicts, crises, etc.) way of transforming the political organization of the world. The combination of development in these parameters (it is possible to single out additional parameters) gives a picture of world politics in the future.","output":"Political Organization of the World in the Context of Contemporary Megatrends: Scenarios of Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The year of 2020 has been overshadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic Medical workers throughout China have played critical roles in battling severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and saving lives The whole of society has now fully realized the significance of medical workers and many began to think about medical education in China: How can we further improve medical education for the next generation of clinicians, medical scientists, nurses, public-health workers and administrators related to medical care, so that they are well prepared to meet societal needs for medical care in the ever-changing world?

Risks, benefits and likely outcomes should be discussed with patients/relatives. AIM: To investigate impact of intervention on treatment escalation plan (TEP) use during the first wave (W1) and second wave (W2) of pandemic. INTERVENTION: W1: An ethically approved TEP and a Critical Care Decision Aid (CCDA) was added to the admission booklet. W2: The TEP update included a confirm discussed with patient/relatives section. METHOD: W1: We conducted retrospective review of 62 case-notes of patients admitted through COVID-19 pathway and grouped into >80 and  80 years old. Resuscitation, TEP, CCDA and communication with patient/relatives were collected. W2: 60 further case-notes of patients with COVID-19 admitted in January 2021 were analysed. RESULTS: W1: 100% patients had resuscitation decisions and 95% had TEPs in both groups. Significantly higher proportions of Frailty scores were calculated in >80s (58% vs 35% p = 0.04). On average resuscitation and TEPs were made within 13.8 hours of admission (range 1C72 hours). 53.2% of resuscitation decisions and 30% TEPs were discussed with patients of whom higher proportions were discussed in younger age group, majority were discussed at the time of deterioration. W2: 98.3% patients had resuscitation decisions made and 96.7% had TEPs across both groups. On average resuscitation decisions were made within 14.9 hours of admission. In the >80s, 86.7% of resuscitation decisions were discussed and 63.3% of the TEPs were discussed with patient/relatives. In the <80s, 82.8% of resuscitation decisions were discussed and 71.4% of TEPs were discussed with the patient/relatives.

The use of traditional medicines as an adjuvant therapy with western drugs can lower the fatality rate due to the COVID-19. Therefore, in silico molecular docking study was performed to search potential phytochemicals and drugs that can block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells by inhibiting the proteolytic cleavage activity of furin and TMPRSS2. Experimental procedure: The protein-protein docking of the host proteases furin and TMPRSS2 was carried out with the virus spike (S) protein to examine the conformational details and residues involved in the complex formation. Subsequently, a library of 163 ligands containing phytochemicals and drugs was virtually screened to propose potential hits that can inhibit the proteolytic cleavage activity of furin and TMPRSS2. Results and conclusion: The phytochemicals like limonin, gedunin, eribulin, pedunculagin, limonin glycoside and betunilic acid bind at the active site of both furin and TMPRSS2. Limonin and gedunin found mainly in the citrus fruits and neem showed the highest binding energy at the active site of furin and TMPRSS2, respectively. The polyphenols found in green tea can also be useful in suppressing the furin activity. Among the drugs, the drug nafamostat may be more beneficial than the camostat in suppressing the activity of TMPRSS2.","output":"Virtual screening by targeting proteolytic sites of furin and TMPRSS2 to propose potential compounds obstructing the entry of SARS-CoV-2 virus into human host cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fat embolism syndrome (FES) is a multiple organ disorder that can appear after pelvic and long bone fractures.

Medical care of chronic neurological diseases, such as epilepsy, is being sorely neglected. In this national survey, we aimed at understanding the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the care of people with epilepsy (PwE) and identifying PwE risk factors for seizure worsening to direct telemedicine efforts. Methods: We administered a 48-items online survey (published on April 11, 2020) including socio-demographic, epilepsy-related, and psychometric variables (BDI-II for depression, GAD-7 for anxiety, and PSQI for sleep) to PwE and people without epilepsy (PwoE). Regression analysis identified predictors of seizure worsening. Results: We collected responses from 456 PwE (344 females) and 472 PwoE (347 females). Outpatient examinations of PwE were postponed in 95% of cases. One-third of PwE complained of issues with epilepsy management, but only 71% of them reached the treating physician and solved their problems. PwE had worse depressive and anxiety symptoms (higher BDI-II and GAD-7 scores; p &lt; 0.001) than PwoE. Sleep quality was equally compromised in both groups (47 and 42%). Sixty-seven PwE (18%) reported seizure worsening, which was best explained by the number of anti-seizure medications (ASM) of chronic therapy and the severity of sleep disorder. Conclusions: During the current COVID-19 pandemic, a significant percentage of PwE experienced difficulties in follow-up and a seizure number increase, in particular those chronically taking more ASMs and with poor sleep quality.

The COVID-19 pandemic did not create these upstream injuries, but it has brought them to national attention, exacerbated them, and highlighted the need for health care providers to move out of the footprint of their institutions. The breach between community events that seed morbidity and hospitals that attempt rescues has grown in recent years, as the gap between rich and poor has grown and as maternity services in minority communities have closed. COVID-19 has become yet another barrier. For example, professional organizations have recommended a reduced number of prenatal visits, and the platforms hospitals use to substitute for some of these visits are not helpful to people who either lack the technology or the safe space in which to have confidential conversations with providers. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for departments of obstetrics and gynecology.

Studies have shown that the virus can circulate among animals mutate, lead to animal-to-human zoonotic jump, and further onward spread between humans. Infection in pets is unusual, and there are few human-to-pet transmission reports worldwide. OBJECTIVE: To describe the SARS-CoV-2 infection in a domestic animal in Crdoba, Colombian Caribbean region. METHODS: A cross-sectional molecular surveillance study was carried out, oral and rectal swabs were taken from cats and dogs living with people diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was found in a cat living with a person with COVID-19. Genome sequencing showed that the B.1.111 lineage caused the infection in the cat. The owners sample could not be sequenced. The lineage is predominant in Colombia, and this variant is characterised by the presence of the D614D and Q57H mutation. CONCLUSION: The present work is the first report of an infected cat with SARS-CoV-2 with whole-genome sequencing in Colombia. It highlights the importance of detecting SARS-CoV-2 mutations that could promote the transmissibility of this new coronavirus. There is still a significant information gap on human-to-cat-to-human infection; we encourage self-isolation measures between COVID-19 patients and companion animals. The findings of this study give a preliminary view of the current panorama of SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals in Colombia.","output":"First report and genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in a cat (Felis catus) in Colombia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome encodes two envelope glycoproteins (E1 and E2). These glycoproteins interact to formin a noncovalent heterodimeric complex which is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To identify whether E1 and/or E2 contains an ER-targeting signal potentially involved in ER retention of the E1-E2 complex, these proteins were expressed alone and their intracellular localization was studied. Due to misfolding of E1 in the absence of E2, no conclusion on the localization of its native form could be drawn from the expression of E1 alone. E2 expressed in the absence of E1 was shown to be retained in the ER similarly to E1-E2 complex. Chimeric proteins in which E2 domains were exchanged with corresponding domains of a protein normally transported to the plasma membrane (CD4) were constructed to identify the sequence responsible for its ER retention. The transmembrane domain (TMD) of E2 (C-terminal 29 amino acids) was shown to be sufficient for retention of the ectodomain of CD4 in the ER compartment. Replacement of the E2 TMD by the anchor signal of CD4 or a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety led to its expression on the cell surface. In addition, replacement of the E2 TMD by the anchor signal of CD4 or a GPI moiety abolished the formation of E1-E2 complexes. Together, these results suggest that, besides having a role as a membrane anchor, the TMD of E2 is involved in both complex formation and intracellular localization.","output":"A retention signal necessary and sufficient for endoplasmic reticulum localization maps to the transmembrane domain of hepatitis C virus glycoprotein E2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study of spreading phenomena in networks, in particular the spread of disease, has attracted considerable interest in the network science research community. In this paper, we show that the outbreak of an epidemic can be effectively contained and suppressed in a small subnetwork by a combination of antidote distribution and partial quarantine. We improve over existing antidote distribution schemes based on personalized PageRank in two ways. First, we replace the constraint on the topology of this subnetwork described by Chung et al. [Internet Math. 6, 237 (2009)1542-795110.1080/15427951.2009.10129184] that a large fraction of the value of the personalized PageRank vector must be contained in the local cluster, with a partial quarantine scheme. Second, we derive a different lower bound on the amount of antidote. We show that, under our antidote distribution scheme, the probability of the infection spreading to the whole network is bounded, and the infection inside the subnetwork will disappear after a period that is proportional to the logarithm of the number of initially infected nodes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy with numerical simulations of epidemics on benchmark networks. We also test our strategy on two examples of epidemics in real-world networks. Our strategy is dependent only on the rate of infection, the rate of recovery, and the topology around the initially infected nodes, and is independent of the rest of the network.","output":"Containing epidemics in a local cluster via antidote distribution and partial quarantine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present work, 27 triterpene derivatives have been subjected to 3D-QSAR, ADME-Tox, and molecular docking for their insecticidal activity. The selected derivatives are previously semi-synthesized based on compounds obtained from Euphorbia resinifera and Euphorbia officinarum latex. The in silico studies were used to predict and to evaluate the antibacterial and insecticidal properties of the 3D structure of triterpene derivatives. The 3D-QSAR models are developed using CoMFA and CoMSIA techniques, and they have showed excellent statistical results (R(2) = 0.99; Q(2) = 0.672; R(2)(pred) = 0.91 for CoMFA and R(2) = 0.97; Q(2) = 0.61; R(2)(pred) = 0.94 for CoMSIA). The results indicate that the built models are able to describe the relationship between the structure of triterpene derivatives and the pLD(50) bioactivity. Based on contour maps obtained from CoMFA and CoMSIA models, 38 new molecules are designed and their pLD(50) activities are predicted. The drug-like and ADME-Tox properties of the molecule designed are examined and led to the selection of four molecules (55, 56, 59, 64) as promising antibacterial and insecticidal agents. Compounds 55, 56, 59, and 64 are able to inhibit the MurE (PDB code: 1E8C) and EcR (PDB code: 1R20) proteins involved in the process of antibacterial and insecticidal activities. This hypothesis is confirmed by the implementation of a molecular docking test. This test predicted the most important referential interactions that occur between the structure of triterpene derivatives and the targeted receptors. Among the four docked molecules, three molecules (55, 56, and 59) showed greater stability than the reference molecule 16 inside the MurE and EcR receptors pocket. Therefore, the structure of the three new triterpene derivatives can be adopted as reference for the synthesis of antibacterial drugs and also in the development of insecticides.","output":"3D-QSAR, ADME-Tox, and molecular docking of semisynthetic triterpene derivatives as antibacterial and insecticide agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At a time when a global pandemic rightly holds our collective attention, environmental issues have taken a backseat to the ongoing battle against Covid-19 [ ]","output":"Prevalence, Fate and Effects of Plastic in Freshwater Environments: New Findings and Next Steps"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for advanced gastric cancer is rarely performed because of the high morbidity and mortality rates and low survival rate. However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer has improved, and chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab may have a preoperative tumor-reducing effect, especially for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive cases. CASE SUMMARY We report a case of successful radical resection with PD after neoadjuvant S-1 plus oxaliplatin (SOX) and trastuzumab in a patient (66-year-old male) with advanced gastric cancer invading the pancreatic head. Initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy detected a type 3 advanced lesion located on the lower part of the stomach obstructing the pyloric ring. Computed tomography detected lymph node metastasis and tumor invasion to the pancreatic head without distant metastasis. Pathological findings revealed adenocarcinoma and HER2 positivity (immunohistochemical score of 3 +). We performed staging laparoscopy and confirmed no liver metastasis, no dissemination, negative lavage cytological findings, and immobility of the distal side of the stomach due to invasion to the pancreas. Laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy was performed at that time. One course of SOX and three courses of SOX plus trastuzumab were administered. Preoperative computed tomography showed partial response; therefore, PD was performed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and pathological radical resection was achieved. CONCLUSION We suggest that radical resection with PD after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus trastuzumab is an option for locally advanced HER2-positive gastric cancer invading the pancreatic head in the absence of non-curative factors.","output":"Pancreaticoduodenectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for gastric cancer invading the pancreatic head: A case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The deployment of a vaccine that limits transmission and disease likely will be required to end the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Some quantitative research was conducted on clinical characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 and pregnant women's concerns and birth expectations during the COVID-19 pandemic, but no qualitative findings on childbearing women's experiences during the pandemic were published prior to our study. AIM: To explore childbearing experiences of COVID-19 positive mothers who gave birth in the months of March and April 2020 in a Northern Italy maternity hospital. METHODS: A qualitative interpretive phenomenological approach was undertaken. Audio-recorded semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 women. Thematic analysis was completed using NVivo software. Ethical approval was obtained from the research site's Ethics Committee prior to commencing the study. FINDINGS: The findings include four main themes: 1) coping with unmet expectations; 2) reacting and adapting to the 'new ordinary'; 3) 'pandemic relationships'; 4) sharing a traumatic experience with long-lasting emotional impact. DISCUSSION: The most traumatic elements of women's experiences were the sudden family separation, self-isolation, transfer to a referral centre, the partner not allowed to be present at birth and limited physical contact with the newborn. CONCLUSION: Key elements of good practice including provision of compassionate care, presence of birth companions and transfer to referral centers only for the most severe COVID-19 cases should be considered when drafting maternity care pathways guidelines in view of future pandemic waves.","output":"The experiences of childbearing women who tested positive to COVID-19 during the pandemic in northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have never been so aware of masks. They were in short supply in the early days of COVID-19, resulting in significant risk to health care workers. Now they are highly politicized with battles about mask-wearing protocols breaking out in public. Although masks have obtained a new urgency and ubiquity in the context of COVID-19, people have thought about both the literal and metaphorical role of masks in medicine for generations. In this paper, we discuss three such metaphors-the masks of objectivity, of infallibility, and of benevolence-and their powerful role in medicine. These masks can be viewed as inflexible barriers to communication, contributing to the traditional authoritarian relationship between doctor and patient and concealing the authenticity and vulnerability of physicians. COVID masks, by contrast, offer a more nuanced and morally complex metaphor for thinking about protecting people from harm, authentic and trustworthy communication, and attention to potential inequities both in and beyond medical settings. We highlight the morally relevant challenges and opportunities that masks evoke and suggest that there is much to be gained from rethinking the mask metaphor in medicine.","output":"Masks in Medicine: Metaphors and Morality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many aspects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its disease, COVID-19, have been studied to determine its properties, transmission mechanisms, and pathology.

Abstract Introduction: Ischaemic stroke has been reported in patients with COVID-19, particularly in more severe cases. However, it is unclear to what extent this is linked to systemic inflammation and hypercoagulability secondary to the infection. Materials and methods: We describe the cases of 4 patients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19 who were attended at our hospital. Patients are classified according to the likelihood of a causal relationship between the hypercoagulable state and ischaemic stroke. We also conducted a review of studies addressing the possible mechanisms involved in the aetiopathogenesis of ischaemic stroke in these patients. Results: The association between COVID-19 and stroke was probably causal in 2 patients, who presented cortical infarcts and had no relevant arterial or cardioembolic disease, but did show signs of hypercoagulability and systemic inflammation in laboratory analyses. The other 2 patients were of advanced age and presented cardioembolic ischaemic stroke; the association in these patients was probably incidental. Conclusions: Systemic inflammation and the potential direct action of the virus may cause endothelial dysfunction, resulting in a hypercoagulable state that could be considered a potential cause of ischaemic stroke. However, stroke involves multiple pathophysiological mechanisms; studies with larger samples are therefore needed to confirm our hypothesis. The management protocol for patients with stroke and COVID-19 should include a complete aetiological study, with the appropriate safety precautions always being observed.","output":"Ictus isqumico e infeccin por SARS-CoV-2, ?asociacin casual o causal?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) are at high risk for thrombotic arterial and venous occlusions, while lung histopathology often reveals fibrin-based occlusion of small vessels in patients who succumb to the disease. At the same time, bleeding complications have been observed in some patients. Better understanding the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis will help inform optimal approaches to thrombosis prophylaxis and potential utility of fibrinolytic-targeted therapies. Objective: To evaluate fibrinolysis among a large cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients and methods: 118 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. We measured plasma antigen levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and performed spontaneous clot lysis assays. Results: We found markedly elevated levels of tPA and PAI-1 among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Both factors demonstrated a strong correlation with neutrophil counts and markers of neutrophil activation, but not with D-dimer. High levels of tPA and PAI-1 were associated with worse respiratory status. High levels of tPA, in particular, were also strongly correlated with mortality and with a significant enhancement in spontaneous ex vivo clot lysis. Conclusion: While both tPA and PAI-1 are elevated among COVID-19 patients, extremely high levels of tPA enhance spontaneous fibrinolysis and are significantly associated with mortality in some patients. These data indicate that fibrinolytic homeostasis in COVID-19 is complex with a subset of patients expressing a balance of factors that may favor fibrinolysis and suggests that further study of tPA as a potential biomarker is warranted.","output":"Plasma tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to better understand transmission dynamics and appropriately target control and preventive measures, studies have aimed to identify who-infected-whom in actual outbreaks.

We discussed methods according to the data needed as well as the underlying sequence mutation, within-host evolution, transmission, and case observation. In the non-phylogenetic family consisting of eight methods, pairwise genetic distances were estimated. In the phylogenetic families, transmission trees were inferred from phylogenetic trees either simultaneously (nine methods) or sequentially (five methods). While a majority of methods (17/22) modeled the transmission process, few (8/22) took into account imperfect case detection. Within-host evolution was generally (7/8) modeled as a coalescent process.

In addition to high direct medical costs, HSCTs typically require at least one caregiver to take time away from work or other responsibilities, often leading to reduced household income. Using mixed methods, we sought to understand the impact of pediatric HSCT on caregiver employment and financial need. METHODS: We surveyed caregivers of living pediatric patients who underwent HSCT at one of two southeastern transplant centers between 2012 and 2018 (N = 95). We then interviewed a subset of caregivers (N = 18) to understand whether and how employment disruption contributed to financial distress. RESULTS: Among caregivers surveyed, the majority of household wage earners changed their work schedules to attend medical appointments and missed workdays. This resulted in income loss for 87% of families, with 31% experiencing an income reduction of over 50%. Qualitative interviews pointed to four emergent themes: (1) employment disruption exacerbated existing financial challenges; (2) parental division of labor between caregiving and providing financially led to heightened psychological distress; (3) existing employment leave and protection resources were essential but not sufficient; and (4) the ability to work remotely and having a supportive employer facilitated employment maintenance throughout the HSCT process. CONCLUSION: Expanded employment protections and access to accommodations are needed to limit the impact of HSCT on household income, health insurance, and financial hardship. Additionally, interventions are needed to ensure caregivers are equipped with the information necessary to navigate conversations with employers and prepare for the financial and psychological reality of employment disruption.

METHODS Databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), among others, were systematically searched. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool was applied for the assessment of quality, and the bivariate model was used to pool the sensitivity and specificity. The hierarchical summary receiver operator characteristic curves (HSROC) model was utilized to estimate the summary receiver operating characteristics curve (SROC). Sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the association of the study design and patient characteristics with the test accuracy and meta-regression to find the source of heterogeneity. RESULTS Three studies regarding gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and a meta-analysis of 16 non-GDM studies, comprising a total sample size of 12876, were included in the work. Results reveal that the average cut-off values of GA reported for the diagnosis of GDM diagnosis was much lower than those for non-GDM. For non-GDM cases, diagnosing DM with a circulating GA cut-off of 14.0% had a sensitivity of 0.766 (95%CI: 0.539, 0.901), specificity of 0.687 (95%CI: 0.364, 0.894), and area under the curve of 0.80 (95%CI: 0.76, 0.83) for the SROC. The estimated SROC at different GA cut-off values for non-GDM exhibited that the average location parameter lambda of 16 non-GDM studies was 2.354 (95%CI: 2.002, 2.707), and the scale parameter beta was -0.163 (95%CI: -0.614, 0.288). These non-GDM studies with various thresholds had substantial heterogeneity, which may be attributed to the type of DM, age, and body mass index as possible sources. CONCLUSION Glycated albumin in non-DM exhibits a moderate diagnostic accuracy. Further research on the diagnostic accuracy of GA for GDM and combinational measurements of GA and other assays is suggested.","output":"Glycated albumin as a biomarker for diagnosis of diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to identify all public hygiene problems in the Wenchuan quake-affected areas, and also to provide relevant recommendations to local governments, the quake areas were entered for field investigation and consultation.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of using telemedicine in primary health care for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: A systematic search was conducted from database inception to August 2021 in nine databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, EBSCO, CNKI, Wanfang Data, VIP, and CBM. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed for studies that met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4 (Cochrane) and Stata v.16.0SE (College Station, TX, USA). Results: A total of 32 articles were included in this study. Analysis showed a reduction in glycated hemoglobin, fasting glucose, and postprandial glucose after the telemedicine intervention. Systolic blood pressure and self-efficacy improved significantly, but there was no significant improvement in weight, lipid metabolism, or diabetes awareness. Subgroup analysis based on the duration of intervention showed significant improvement in glycated hemoglobin at 6 months of intervention. Conclusions: Telemedicine interventions may help patients with type 2 diabetes to effectively control blood glucose and improve self-management in primary health care. There is only moderate benefit, and the benefit may not be sustained beyond 6 months. However, the evidence for the improvement in lipid metabolism is insufficient and further studies are needed.","output":"A Meta-Analysis of the Effectiveness of Telemedicine in Glycemic Management among Patients with Type 2 Diabetes in Primary Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modular integrated construction (MiC) is a revolutionary construction method. However, the logistics management of MiC has always been a major barrier to the wider adoption of MiC. Nonetheless, this challenge can be tackled by the application of lean techniques, namely, just-in-time (JIT). Numerous studies have identified and evaluated the critical factors (CFs) required to implement JIT; however, there is no consensus among the previous studies on these CFs and their level of importance. Therefore, this research, for the first time, provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of these CFs. The systematic review identifies 42 CFs. To further provide a synthesis analysis of previous studies, a meta-analysis approach is used. This analysis is conducted on the identified CFs to evaluate their importance level and hence rank them. The results indicate that all the 42 CFs are important for applying JIT, of which seven are highly significant for successfully implementing JIT in MiC. Although the ranking obtained by meta-analysis is much more reliable than that provided in the individual studies, however, there is still a high heterogeneity in the results, which depicts the uncertain nature of the construction field. Therefore, sub-group analysis is conducted to investigate this heterogeneity and uncover the hidden patterns in the literature. This is achieved by studying the influence of predictive factors (moderators) on the importance level of CFs. This analysis shows that the economy of a country and the type of project executed are influential factors. The results further indicate that developing economies, in contrast to advanced economies, should pay more attention to three CFs. Also, the results show that seven CFs are much more important in MiC projects than the other project types. This research work is highly beneficial for theory development and for practitioners by identification of significant CFs that warrant management dedication to best apply JIT. Researchers, in particular, can consider the recommendations given here for implementing future meta-analysis studies.","output":"Critical Factors for Successful Implementation of Just-in-time Concept in Modular Integrated Construction: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundAlthough effective vaccines have been developed against COVID-19, the level of neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) induced after vaccination in the real world is still unknown. To evaluate the level and persistence of NAbs induced by two inactivated COVID-19 vaccines in China. Methods and findingsSerum samples were collected from 1,335 people aged 18 and over who were vaccinated with COVID-19 inactivated vaccine in Peking University Peoples Hospital from January 19 to June 23, 2021, for detection of COVID-19 antibodies. The WHO standard of SARS-CoV-2 NAbs was detected. The coefficients of variation between the detection results and the true values of the NAbs detected by the WHO standard were all lower than the WHO international standard 3% after the dilution of the original and the dilution of the theoretical concentrations of 500 IU/mL, 250 IU/mL, 125 IU/mL, 72.5 IU/mL, 36.25 IU/mL and 18.125 IU/mL. On day 11-70, the positive rate of NAbs against COVID-19 was 82% to 100%; From day 71 to 332, the positive rate of NAbs decreased to 27%. The level of NAbs was significantly higher at 3-8 Weeks than at 0-3 Weeks. There was a high linear correlation between NAbs and IgG antibodies in 1335 vaccinated patients. NAbs levels were decreased in 31 of 38 people (81.6%) at two time points after the second dose of vaccine. There was no significant difference in age between the group with increased and decreased neutralizing antibody levels ({chi}2 =-0.034, P>0.05). The positive rate of NAbs in the two-dose vaccine group (77.3%) was significantly higher than that in the one-dose group (18.1%), with statistical difference ({chi}2=312.590, P<0.001). A total of 206 people who were 11-70 days after receiving the second dose were tested and divided into three groups: 18-40 years old, 41-60 years old and >60 years old. The positive rates of NAbs in three groups (18-40 years old, 41-60 years old and >60 years old) were 95.14%, 78.43% and 81.8%, respectively. The positive rate of NAbs was significantly higher in 18-40 years old than in 41-60 years old ({chi}2=12.547, P <0.01). The titer of NAbs in 18-40 years old group was significantly higher than that in 41-60 years old group (t=-0.222, P <0.01). The positive rate of NAbs in male group (89.32%) was lower than in female (91.26%), but there was no significant difference ({chi}2=0.222, P >0.05). ConclusionsThe positive rate of NAbs was the highest from 10 to 70 days after the second dose of vaccine, and the positive rate gradually decreased as time went by. There was a high linear correlation between COVID-19 NAbs and IgM/IgG antibodies in vaccinators, suggesting that in cases where NAbs cannot be detected, IgM/IgG antibodies can be detected instead. The level of NAbs produced after vaccination was affected by age, but not by gender. The highest levels of NAbs were produced between shots 21 to 56 days apart, suggesting that 21 to 56 days between shots is suitable for vaccination.

Despite many other clinical situations, of particular interest for neurosurgery is its occurrence in cerebral vasoespam following subarachnoid hemorrhage, in temporary occlusion of intracranial vessels during neurosurgeries and, in intracranial arterial thrombosis. The cerebral lesion caused by isquemia is time-related and it can aggravated by the reperfusion of the ischemic site. Many clinical and experimental studies have been perfomed aiming the better understanding of these phenomena. This study aimed to analyse the precocious effects of focal isquemia and reperfusion uppon the brain of cats. METHODS: Focal brain ischemia was performed by temporary clipping of the middle cerebral artery for determined times followed by reperfusion during 10 minutes. The effects of isquemia were assessed through mitochondrial respiration analysis in the ischemic tissue. RESULTS: The results showed a significant decrease in O2 consumption in samples of brain tissue submitted to 60 minutes of ischemia and 10 minutes of reperfusion when compared with not ischemic brain tissue, indicating compromising of the mitocondrial function. CONCLUSION: Based on the results we can conclude that time of ischemia was a determinant factor in the mitochondrial respiration alterations in brain tissue of cats submitted to ischemia and reperfusion of short duration (significant alterations observed only after 60 minutes of ischemia followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion).","output":"Anlise da respirao mitocondrial em tecido cerebral de gato aps isquemia e reperfus?o"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 54-year-old female with leukemia presented with COVID-19 and a right upper extremity indwelling PICC line for chemotherapy administration.

In contrast to humans, MERS-CoVCexposed dromedaries develop only very mild infections and exceptionally potent virus-neutralizing antibody responses. These strong antibody responses may be caused by affinity maturation as a result of repeated exposure to the virus or by the fact that dromedariesapart from conventional antibodieshave relatively unique, heavy chainConly antibodies (HCAbs). These HCAbs are devoid of light chains and have long complementarity-determining regions with unique epitope binding properties, allowing them to recognize and bind with high affinity to epitopes not recognized by conventional antibodies. Through direct cloning and expression of the variable heavy chains (VHHs) of HCAbs from the bone marrow of MERS-CoVCinfected dromedaries, we identified several MERS-CoVCspecific VHHs or nanobodies. In vitro, these VHHs efficiently blocked virus entry at picomolar concentrations. The selected VHHs bind with exceptionally high affinity to the receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein. Furthermore, camel/human chimeric HCAbscomposed of the camel VHH linked to a human Fc domain lacking the CH1 exonhad an extended half-life in the serum and protected mice against a lethal MERS-CoV challenge.

Serious coastal disaster events have become more common in recent decades, triggering substantial destruction to the low-lying coastal areas and a high death toll. Further, women living in informal and slum housing along the Vijayawada coastline of Andhra Pradesh (CAP), India, suffer from multiple social, cultural and economic inequalities as well. These conditions accelerate and worsen womens vulnerability among this coastal population. The existing literature demonstrates these communities susceptibility to diverse coastal disasters but fails to offer gender-specific vulnerability in urban informal housing in the Vijayawada area. Accordingly, the current study developed a novel gender-specific Womens Coastal Vulnerability Index (WCVI) to assess the impact of coastal disasters on women and their preparedness in Vijayawada. Field data was collected from over 300 women through surveys (2) and workshops (2) between November 2018 and June 2019, and Arc-GIS tools were used to generate vulnerability maps. Results show that women are more vulnerable than men, with a higher death rate during coastal disaster strikes. The current study also found that gender-specific traditional wear is one of the main factors for this specific vulnerability in this area. Furthermore, the majority of the women tend to be located at home to care for the elders and children, and this is associated with more fatalities during disaster events. Homes, particularly for the urban poor, are typically very small and located in narrow and restricted sites, which are a barrier for women to escape from unsafe residential areas during disasters.

While PFM is important to preserve the wearer from contaminating agents present in the airflow, they are well known to increase the subjective perception of breathing difficulty. Although some studies demonstrated that PFM use worsens exercise tolerance, there are several studies stating that there is no such limitation with the use of PFM. Moreover, no serious adverse effects during physical exercise have been found in the literature. Physical exercise represents a significant challenge to the human body through a series of integrated changes in function that involve most of its physiologic systems. In this respect, cardiovascular and respiratory systems provide the capacity to sustain physical tasks over extended periods. Within this scenario, both convective oxygen (O2 ) transport (product of arterial O2 content x blood flow) to the working locomotor muscles and O2 diffusive transport from muscle capillaries to mitochondria are of paramount importance to endurance performance. Interestingly, the effects of PFM on cardiorespiratory response during aerobic exercise depends on the type of mask and exercise (i.e., walking, running, or cycling), including decrease in ventilatory demands, arterial oxygen levels, maximal oxygen consumption, and endurance performance.

METHODS Psoas muscle and femoral nerve sampled from 35 consecutive autopsies of patients who died following SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 SARS-CoV-2-negative controls were examined under light microscopy. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained by chart review. RESULTS In SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, mean age at death was 67.8 years (range 43-96 years) and the duration of symptom onset to death ranged from 1-49 days. Four patients had neuromuscular symptoms. Peak creatine kinase was elevated in 74% (mean 959 U/L, range 29-8413 U/L). Muscle showed type 2 atrophy in 32 patients, necrotizing myopathy in 9, and myositis in 7. Neuritis was seen in 9. Major histocompatibility complex-1 (MHC-1) expression was observed in all cases of necrotizing myopathy and myositis and 8 additional patients. Abnormal expression of myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) was present on capillaries in muscle in 9 patients and in nerve in 7.

Several restrictive strategies have been implemented by governments in an effort to stem the spread of the disease and salvage public health. Such efforts have severely constrained access to non-essential services, leading to the closure of non-essential points of gathering and business and the enforcement of rigorous social distancing and prolonged lockdowns, in addition to masking and stay-at-home mandates. However necessary, there is no denying that such extremely rigorous, and to most people unprecedented, measures have adversely affected the global economy and the daily lives of everyone of us, including professional and amateur athletes (1). The most important sport events were postponed or cancelled, including the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. But how was the phenomenon of performance-enhancing drug (PED) use impacted and how was the most concerning issue affecting the integrity of sport affected by the pandemic control restrictions? The World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) was established in 1999, whereas its code was implemented in 2004 in order to articulate and enforce doping control initiatives and provide educational strategies aimed at preventing PED use (2). Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the prevalence of PED use among athletes is mostly unchanged since the foundation of WADA. Unfortunately, the use of the performance-enhancing drugs is not limited to athletic performances, but it concerns other settings as well. Nowadays, several strategies for doping control are adopted such as education, deterrence, detection, enforcement and rule of law (3), but the most important anti-dissemination strategy is constituted by information campaigns, especially addressed to youngsters, meant to raise awareness as to the serious health risks involved in PED use. Currently, the primary drivers of anabolic androgenic steroids (ASA) use are 1) the determination to improve performances and prevail no matter what the cost may be; 2) the economic benefits, popularity and fame; 3) greater stamina and resistance. This public health issue has raised particular concerns due to the recent ASA market developments, which is somewhat similar to the illicit market of narcotic drugs. Moreover, it has to be considered that the higher stress and psychosocial condition related to pandemic social restrictions has fueled and exacerbated substance use disorders (4). The prevalence of doping in sport causes unfairness and damages the very fabric of our society, especially insofar as it involves children and young adults who look up to athletes as role models. In this concern, the impact of the COVD-19 pandemic may have led to substantial modifications in substance use patterns and an increased risk of substitution, adulteration, contamination, and dilution with a potentially harmful substance (5, 6). During the COVID-19 lockdown, WADA and stakeholders suspended or scaled down doping control programs, testing and other activities. As a consequence, athletes have seen the unexpected opportunity to misuse AAS without the possible risk of testing positive (7). This has been controversial, considering the measures taken by governments to flatten the pandemic curve in order to safeguard public health. Indeed, all the technologies implemented for teleworking, such as teaching students on-line, telehealth applications, prescriptions and referrals, and treating patients in hospitals/care homes via video links can also be applied to enhance and uphold sport integrity. Conversely, anti-doping testing for professional competitive athletes has increased, due to the lockdown raising suspicion about doping opportunities. The U.S. Anti-doping Agency has put in place novel measures to combat the lack of anti-doping testing during the pandemic: these include a \\"in-home self-test\\" that requires athletes to provide urine and small blood samples at home to be tested in the anti-doping laboratory, under supervision provided by video-conference (8). As such, reports from forensic science and toxicology laboratories are crucial for the early detection and response to such events. Furthermore, toxicology laboratories should assure their continue effort in providing new methods and technologies designed to tackle the consumption of illicit substances and to monitor the constantly changing illegal drug markets (9). The most recent WADA code revision has certainly brought about important progress in the ongoing fight against PED abuse. Indeed, it has introduced the possibility to store the samples for 10 years after the first analysis, maintaining the same legal value if re-tested and use for prosecution purposes (10). In that regard, the prospect of re-testing the same sample with newly developed analytical methods based on innovative technologies may represent a strong deterrent for doping users, since anti-doping research rapidly evolves (6), largely by implementing the same approaches used to fight new psychoactive substances (NPS) use (11,12). It is worth noting that the NPS phenomenon bears several similarities with doping, especially due to the constant emergence of new substances and methods aimed at circumventing current legal restrictions. In Italy, the National Antidoping Organization (NADO-Italia) is in charge of guaranteeing compliance with WADA rules and the transposition of the List of Prohibited Substances and Methods. However, the gap between elite athletes and amateur athletes is still broad and unaddressed, since non-professional sport competitions are not adequately overseen, and neither are the competing athletes . This difference may give rise to an important public health issue, on account of the adverse effects of uncontrolled doping agents consumption. In this concern, the Italian anti-doping law created the \\"Section of the Technical Health Committee for Supervision and Control on Doping and for Health Protection in Sport Activities\\", that carries out, among its other tasks, the following activities on amateur sport: 1) updating each year the list of banned substances and practices, adapting it to the WADA list; 2) determining cases, criteria and methodologies for anti-doping controls; 3) promoting research projects and information/training campaigns meant to protect health in sports and tackle doping (13). In conclusion, regarding the highly complex dynamics triggered by the pandemic, new and unexpected challenges have come to the fore in the ongoing fight against substance abuse in its every aspect, such as NPS (14), ASA consumption by amateur athletes, or other substance abuse settings, e.g. driving under the influence of psychotropic substances (15). The current Italian antidoping approach for amateur athletes seems to be a promising strategy to bridge the gap between professional sports and amateur sports. Moreover, youngsters should be thoroughly educated as to the threats posed by such substances, so that they can realize how profoundly and severely drug abuse can affect not only their sport career, but their health and well-being overall.","output":"The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of the performance-enhancing drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article analyzes the visual operations of contagions and their material aftereffects.

In the clinical care setting of ataxia patients, no systematical and standardized assessment of dysphagia is employed. Its impact on patients' health-related quality of life is not well understood. To assess the impact of dysphagia in ataxia patients on diet, body weight, and health-related quality of life. We conducted a large survey using self-reported questionnaires for swallowing-related quality of life (Swal-QOL) and a food frequency list in combination with retrospective clinical data of 119 patients with cerebellar ataxia treated in the neurological outpatient clinic of a large German university hospital. Seventeen percent of ataxia patients suffered from dysphagia based on the Swal-QOL score. Less than 1% of all patients reported dysphagia as one of their most disabling symptoms. Dysphagia was associated with unintentional weight loss (p = 0.02) and reduced health-related quality of life (p = 0.01) but did not affect individual nutritional habits (p > 0.05; Chi-squared test).

Most industries and businesses were closed, traffic was largely reduced, and people were restrained to their homes. This resulted in the reduction of emissions of trace gases and aerosols, the concentrations of which were strongly reduced in many cities around the country. Satellite imagery from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) showed an enormous reduction of tropospheric NO2 concentrations, but aerosol optical depth (AOD), as a measure of the amount of aerosols, was less affected, likely due to the different formation mechanisms and the influence of meteorological factors. In this study, satellite data and ground-based observations were used together to estimate the separate effects of the Spring Festival and the COVID-19 containment measures on atmospheric composition in the winter of 2020. To achieve this, data were analyzed for a period from 30 days before to 60 days after the Spring Festivals in 2017C2020. This extended period of time, including similar periods in previous years, were selected to account for both the decreasing concentrations in response to air pollution control measures, and meteorological effects on concentrations of trace gases and aerosols. Satellite data from TROPOMI provided the spatial distributions over mainland China of the tropospheric vertical column density (VCD) of NO2, and VCD of SO2 and CO. The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provided the aerosol optical depth (AOD). The comparison of the satellite data for different periods showed a large reduction of, e.g., NO2 tropospheric VCDs due to the Spring Festival of up to 80% in some regions, and an additional reduction due to the COVID-19 containment measures of up to 70% in highly populated areas with intensive anthropogenic activities. In other areas, both effects are very small. Ground-based in situ observations from 26 provincial capitals provided concentrations of NO2, SO2, CO, O3, PM2.5, and PM10. The analysis of these data was focused on the situation in Wuhan, based on daily averaged concentrations. The NO2 concentrations started to decrease a few days before the Spring Festival and increased after about two weeks, except in 2020 when they continued to be low. SO2 concentrations behaved in a similar way, whereas CO, PM2.5, and PM10 also decreased during the Spring Festival but did not trace NO2 concentrations as SO2 did. As could be expected from atmospheric chemistry considerations, O3 concentrations increased. The analysis of the effects of the Spring Festival and the COVID-19 containment measures was complicated due to meteorological influences. Uncertainties contributing to the estimates of the different effects on the trace gas concentrations are discussed. The situation in Wuhan is compared with that in 26 provincial capitals based on 30-day averages for four years, showing different effects across China.","output":"The Impact of the Control Measures during the COVID-19 Outbreak on Air Pollution in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Accurate and rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to prevent nosocomial transmission. Patients with negative COVID-19 tests at admission may still be in the incubation phase during hospitalisation. False negative results can occur when patients are tested too early. The incidence of COVID-19 infections in Montral, Canada started to increase in December 2020. Because of this rise, on January 4(th), 2021, the Infection Control Service of the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) recommended serial COVID-19 testing for all admitted patients on days 5 and 10 after admission. The aim of this study is to examine the diagnostic yield of serial COVID-19 testing. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed SARS-CoV-2 test results for patients admitted to the MUHC between January 4, 2021, and April 30, 2021. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Multiple testing platforms were used (Roche Cobas 6800, Thermo Scientific(TM) King Fisher and Cepheid GeneXpert) because of the high volume of samples. Tests were classified as admission, day 5, and day 10 tests if they were done on days 0 to 2, 3 to 7, and 8 to 12 respectively. Patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 on admission were excluded from the analyses. The diagnostic yield of serial testing for patients admitted during each month was calculated by dividing the number of patients testing positive on day 5 or day 10 by the total number of patients who underwent serial testing during that month. RESULTS: There were 2945 admissions of 5 days or more and 1777 admissions of 10 days or more. Of these, 1509 patients and 841 patients respectively were serially tested for SARS-CoV-2 as recommended for a compliance rate of 51% at day 5 and 47% at day 10. Ten (0.7%) and 12 (1.4%) patients tested positive on days 5 and 10 respectively. The diagnostic yield of serial testing was highest for patients admitted in January 2021 at 2.2%, when the average daily incidence of COVID-19 was highest in Montral (see Figure). [Image: see text] The diagnostic yield of serial testing for each month, compared to the average daily COVID-19 incidence rate in Montral, Qubec, Canada. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic yield of serial SARS-CoV-2 testing in hospitalized patients is low when the overall community incidence is low. However, diagnostic yield of serial testing increases when community incidence of COVID-19 is higher and should be considered in this situation.
