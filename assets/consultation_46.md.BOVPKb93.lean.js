The purpose of our study was to determine the effect on EVT for patients with acute ischemic stroke during the COVID-19 confinement. In this retrospective, observational study, data were collected from November 1, 2019, to April 15, 2020, at 17 stroke centers in countries where confinement measures have been in place since March 2020 for the COVID-19 pandemic (Switzerland, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Canada, and United States). This study included 1600 patients treated by EVT for acute ischemic stroke. Date of EVT and symptom onset-to-groin puncture time were collected. Mean number of EVTs performed per hospital per 2-week interval and mean stroke onset-to-groin puncture time were calculated before confinement measures and after confinement measures. Distributions (non-normal) between the 2 groups (before COVID-19 confinement versus after COVID-19 confinement) were compared using 2-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The results show a significant decrease in mean number of EVTs performed per hospital per 2-week interval between before COVID-19 confinement (9.0 [95% CI, 7.8C10.1]) and after COVID-19 confinement (6.1 [95% CI, 4.5C7.7]), (P<0.001). In addition, there is a significant increase in mean stroke onset-to-groin puncture time (P<0.001), between before COVID-19 confinement (300.3 minutes [95% CI, 285.3C315.4]) and after COVID-19 confinement (354.5 minutes [95% CI, 316.2C392.7]).

In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) to differentiate VAT and VAP. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis based on the data from 2 independent prospective cohorts. Patients of the TAVeM database with a diagnosis of VAT (n = 320) or VAP (n = 369) were included in the derivation cohort. Patients admitted to the Intensive Care Centre of Lille University Hospital between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017 who had a diagnosis of VAT (n = 70) or VAP (n = 139) were included in the validation cohort. The accuracy of the CPIS to differentiate VAT from VAP was assessed within the 2 cohorts by calculating sensitivity and specificity values, establishing the ROC curves and choosing the best threshold according to the Youden index. RESULTS: The areas under ROC curves of CPIS to differentiate VAT from VAP were calculated at 0.76 (95% CI [0.72C0.79]) in the derivation cohort and 0.67 (95% CI [0.6C0.75]) in the validation cohort. A CPIS value  7 was associated with the highest Youden index in both cohorts. With this cut-off, sensitivity and specificity were respectively found at 0.51 and 0.88 in the derivation cohort, and at 0.45 and 0.89 in the validation cohort.

Activity records in the log are very useful to be able to find out the pattern of activity sequences from customers, especially the order of items purchased by customers. However, the management certainly needs more knowledge, not just the order of goods that are often purchased by customers. Does the order of items purchased also provide maximum profit? There have been many methods to get frequent sequential patterns from customer activities, but getting a pattern that chooses more quality by adding utility value needs to be considered. In this research, the method used to obtain frequent sequential patterns is using PrefixSpan (Prefix-projected Sequential PAtterN) and the method used to obtain a high-utility sequential pattern is the USpan (Utility Sequential PAtterN) method. USpan is applied to the BMS (Blue Martini DataSet) dataset, which is the dataset used in KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) CUP 2000 which consists of clickstream data from an e-commerce. The experimental results show that the frequent sequential pattern will always appear in the high-utility sequential pattern but not vice versa. It is certain that a high-utility pattern must be sequential, but a sequential pattern is not necessarily a high-utility sequential. From the results of the high-utility sequential pattern, it can be used as input to provide recommendations to customers to carry out the shopping process on items that can provide greater profits.

The site of maturation is thought to be largely determined by the accumulation of the two spike glycoproteins, G1 and G2, in this organelle. Here we show that the signal for localizing the Uukuniemi virus (a phlebovirus) spike protein complex to the Golgi complex resides in the cytoplasmic tail of G1. We constructed chimeric proteins in which the ectodomain, transmembrane domain (TMD), and cytoplasmic tail (CT) of Uukuniemi virus G1 were exchanged with the corresponding domains of either vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV G), chicken lysozyme, or CD4, all proteins readily transported to the plasma membrane. The chimeras were expressed in HeLa or BHK-21 cells by using either the T7 RNA polymerase-driven vaccinia virus system or the Semliki Forest virus system. The fate of the chimeric proteins was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence, and their localizations were compared by double labeling with markers specific for the Golgi complex. The results showed that the ectodomain and TMD (including the 10 flanking residues on either side of the membrane) of G1 played no apparent role in targeting chimeric proteins to the Golgi complex. Instead, all chimeras containing the CT of G1 were efficiently targeted to the Golgi complex and colocalized with mannosidase II, a Golgi-specific enzyme. Conversely, replacing the CT of G1 with that from VSV G resulted in the efficient transport of the chimeric protein to the cell surface. Progressive deletions of the G1 tail suggested that the Golgi retention signal maps to a region encompassing approximately residues 10 to 50, counting from the proposed border between the TMD and the tail. Both G1 and G2 were found to be acylated, as shown by incorporation of [3H]palmitate into the viral proteins. By mutational analyses of CD4-G1 chimeras, the sites for palmitylation were mapped to two closely spaced cysteine residues in the G1 tail. Changing either or both of these cysteines to alanine had no effect on the targeting of the chimeric protein to the Golgi complex.","output":"A retention signal necessary and sufficient for Golgi localization maps to the cytoplasmic tail of a Bunyaviridae (Uukuniemi virus) membrane glycoprotein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The junction of the bones of the orbit, caudal maxilla and zygoma intersect to form an anatomically intricate region known as the orbitozygomaticomaxillary complex (OZMC).

Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that 7a interacts with Bcl-XL and other prosurvival proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and A1) but not with the proapoptotic proteins (Bax, Bak, Bad, and Bid). A good correlation between the abilities of 7a deletion mutants to induce apoptosis and to interact with Bcl-XL was observed, suggesting that 7a triggers apoptosis by interfering directly with the prosurvival function of Bcl-XL. Interestingly, amino acids 224 and 225 within the C-terminal transmembrane domain of Bcl-XL are essential for the interaction with the 7a protein, although the BH3 domain of Bcl-XL also contributes to this interaction.

As many countries are accelerating efforts to eliminate malaria or to prevent the re-establishment of malaria from recently eliminated countries, the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to cause major interruptions to ongoing anti-malaria operations and risk jeopardizing the gains that have been made so far. Sri Lanka, having eliminated malaria in 2012, was certified by the World Health Organization as a malaria-free country in 2016 and now implements a rigorous programme to prevent its re-establishment owing to the high receptivity and vulnerability of the country to malaria. Sri Lanka has also dealt with the COVID-19 epidemic quite successfully limiting the cumulative number of infections and deaths through co-ordinated efforts between the health sector and other relevant sectors, namely the military, the Police Department, Departments of Airport and Aviation and Foreign Affairs, all of which have been deployed for the COVID-19 epidemic under the umbrella of a Presidential Task Force. The relevance of imported infections and the need for a multi-sectoral response are features common to both the control of the COVID-19 epidemic and the Prevention of Re-establishment (POR) programme for malaria. Sri Lankas malaria POR programme has, therefore, creatively integrated its activities with those of the COVID-19 control programme. Through highly coordinated operations the return to the country of Sri Lankan nationals stranded overseas by the COVID-19 pandemic, many from malaria endemic countries, are being monitored for malaria as well as COVID-19 in an integrated case surveillance system under quarantine conditions, to the success of both programmes. Twenty-three imported malaria cases were detected from February to October through 2773 microscopic blood examinations performed for malaria in quarantine centres, this number being not much different to the incidence of imported malaria during the same period last year.

Although mechanical ventilation is lifesaving, it is also associated with adverse events if not properly managed. The systematic implementation of evidence-based practice through the use of guidelines and protocols has been shown to mitigate risk, yet variation in care remains prevalent. Advances in health-care technology provided the ability to stream data about mechanical ventilation and therapeutic response. Through these advances, a computer system was developed to enable the coupling of physiologic and ventilation data for real-time interpretation. Our aim was to assess the feasibility and utility of a newly developed patient categorization and scoring system to objectively measure compliance with standards of care. METHODS We retrospectively categorized the ventilation and oxygenation statuses of subjects within our pediatric ICU utilizing 15 rules-based algorithms. Targets were predetermined based on generally accepted practices. All patient categories were calculated and presented as a percent score (0-100%) of acceptable ventilation, acceptable oxygenation, barotrauma-free, and volutrauma-free states. RESULTS Two hundred twenty-two subjects were identified and analyzed encompassing 1,578 d of mechanical ventilation. Median age was 3 y, median ideal body weight was 14.7 kg, and 63% were male. The median acceptable ventilation score was 84.6%, and the median acceptable oxygenation score was 70.1% (100% being maximally acceptable). Potential for ventilator-induced lung injury was broken into 2 components: barotrauma and volutrauma. There was very little potential for barotrauma, with a median barotrauma-free state of 100%. Median potential for a volutrauma-free state was 56.1%. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate the first patient categorization system utilizing a coordinated data-banking system and analytics to determine patient status and a surveillance of mechanical ventilation quality.

According to the multivariate analysis, the variables that were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with mortality upon admission were: being referred from a nursing home (OR 1.9); having a high respiratory rate (OR 1,5); having moderate (OR 1.7) or severe (OR 2.9) pneumonia (CURB-65); aspartate aminotransferase transaminase  100 IU/l (OR 2.1); lactate dehydrogenase  360 IU/L (OR 1.6); procalcitonin > 0.5 ng/mL (OR 1.8); creatine kinase  294 U/L (OR 1.5); D-dimer > 3,000 ng/mL (OR 1.5); hemoglobin < 11.6 g/dL (OR 1.4) and C-reactive protein > 120 mg/L (OR 1.2; requiring respiratory support within the first 48 hours (oxygen therapy [OR 2.0], non-invasive ventilation [OR 2.8], and mechanical ventilation [OR 3.5]); and being treated with interferon-beta (OR 1.5). On the contrary, being under 80 years of age was associated with lower mortality. CONCLUSIONS The analysis, based on the data in the RERFAR registry, showed that the factors associated with poorer prognosis were older age, assessed using the CURB-65 scale, level of respiratory support required, severe pneumonia (CURB-65), hypertransaminasemia, elevated creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer levels, anemia, and elevated respiratory rate.","output":"Factors associated with mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Spain.

Although initially, this pandemic was associated with causing severe pulmonary and respiratory disorders, recent case studies reported the association of cerebrovascular-neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, which is also life-threatening. Several SARS-CoV-2 positive case studies have been reported where there are mild or no symptoms of this virus. However, a selection of patients are suffering from large artery ischemic strokes. Although the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus affecting the cerebrovascular system has not been elucidated yet, researchers have identified several pathogenic mechanisms, including a role for the ACE2 receptor. Therefore, it is extremely crucial to identify the risk factors related to the progression and adverse outcome of cerebrovascular-neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Since many articles have reported the effect of smoking (tobacco and cannabis) and vaping in cerebrovascular and neurological systems, and considering that smokers are more prone to viral and bacterial infection compared to non-smokers, it is high time to explore the probable correlation of smoking in COVID-19 patients. Herein, we have reviewed the possible role of smoking and vaping on cerebrovascular and neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, along with potential pathogenic mechanisms associated with it.","output":"Cerebrovascular and Neurological Dysfunction under the Threat of COVID-19: Is There a Comorbid Role for Smoking and Vaping?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liupao tea, a drink homologous to medicine and food.

The objective of this study is to explore the material basis and mechanism of Liupao tea intervention in COVID-19 and to provide a new prevention and treatment programme for COVID-19. We used high performance liquid chromatography to analyze the extract of Liupao tea and establish its fingerprint. The main index components of the fingerprint were determined using SARS-COV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro ), and an in vitro drug screening model based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to evaluate its inhibitory activity in vitro. The fingerprint results showed that the alcohol extract of Liupao tea contained gallic acid, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), caffeine, epicatechin gallate, rutin, and ellagic acid. The molecular docking binding energies of the six index components of SARS-CoV-2 3Clpro were all less than -5.0 kJ/mol and showed strong binding affinity. The results of in vitro activity showed that the IC50 of EGCG was 8.84 mol/L, which could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3Clpro to a certain extent. This study unleashed that EGCG has a certain inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro , and Liupao tea has a certain significance as a tea drink for the prevention of COVID-19.

We reviewed the recommendations on the recent guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention infection control practices for dentistry, American Dental Association, and the World Health Organization. According to the available evidence, COVID-19 may have a negative impact on the oral health due to the infection itself and due to various other consequences such as therapeutic measures, xerostomia, and other complications of the COVID-19. In light of the above facts, dentists should be wary of the disease, its identification, mode of spread and impacts on the oral health. The dental personnel have been identified as at the highest risk of getting COVID-19 due to cross infection from contact with their patients and aerosols generated in routine dental procedures. As such, they should be aware of the modifications that need to be made to the practice to prevent transmission of the disease. It is evident that COVID-19 has a negative impact on the oral health and at the same time a significant transmission risk to the dental personnel and patients who visit the clinic.

The most significant increase was found among the older adults aged 65 or above. METHODS Poisson Regression Models were used to examine impact of the SARS epidemic on older adults suicides in Hong Kong. A complete set of the suicide statistics for the period 1993-2004 from the Coroners' Court were made available for the analysis. Chi-square test was used to compare the profile of the older adult suicide cases in the pre-SARS, peri-SARS and post-SARS periods. RESULTS It showed an excess of older adults suicides in April 2003, when compared to the month of April of the other years. A trough, instead of the usual summer peak, was observed in June, suggesting some of the older adults suicides might have been brought forward. On a year basis, the annual older adult's suicide rates in 2003 and 2004 were significantly higher than that in 2002, suggesting the suicide rate did not return to the level before the SARS epidemic. Based on the Coroners' suicide death records, overall severity of illness, level of dependency and worrying of having sickness among the older adult suicides were found to be significantly different in the pre-SARS, peri-SARS and post-SARS periods. CONCLUSION The SARS epidemic was associated with an increase in older adults' suicide rate in April 2003 and some suicide deaths in June 2003 might have been brought forward. Moreover, an increase in the annual older adults' suicide rate in 2003 was observed and the rate in 2004 did not return to the level of 2002. Loneliness and disconnectedness among the older adults in the community were likely to be associated with the excess older adults' suicides in 2003. Maintaining and enhancing mental well being of the public over the period of epidemic is as important as curbing the spread of the epidemic. Attention and effort should also be made to enhance the community's ability to manage fear and anxiety, especially in vulnerable groups over the period of epidemic to prevent tragic and unnecessary suicide deaths.","output":"A revisit on older adults suicides and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to exponentially rising mortality, particularly in immunosuppressed patients, who inadequately respond to conventional COVID-19 vaccination.

We assigned 60 patients under rituximab treatment, who did not seroconvert after their primary mRNA vaccination with either BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna), to receive a third dose, either using the same mRNA or the vector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca). Patients were stratified according to the presence of peripheral B-cells. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in the SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroconversion rate between vector (heterologous) and mRNA (homologous) vaccinated patients by week four. Key secondary endpoints included the overall seroconversion and cellular immune response; safety was assessed at weeks one and four. Seroconversion rates at week four were comparable between vector (6/27 patients, 22%) and mRNA (9/28, 32%) vaccine (p=0.6). Overall, 27% of patients seroconverted; specific T-cell responses were observed in 20/20 (100%) vector versus 13/16 (81%) mRNA vaccinated patients. Newly induced humoral and/or cellular responses occurred in 9/11 (82%) patients. No serious adverse events, related to immunization, were observed.

We discuss the importance of timely delivery and antenatal steroid administration in a critically ill patient. CASE: A 27-year-old pregnant woman (gravida 2, para 1) with type I diabetes, morbid obesity, hypothyroidism and a previous Caesarean section presented with critical respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 at 32 weeks of gestation. A preterm emergency Caesarean section was performed, after steroid treatment for foetal lung maturation. The patient benefited from prone positioning; however, transient acute renal injury, rhabdomyolysis and sepsis led to prolonged intensive care and mechanical ventilation for 30 days. The baby had an uncomplicated recovery. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection in high-risk pregnancies may result in severe maternal and neonatal outcomes such as critical respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and premature termination of the pregnancy.

Functional variants may influence SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and severity of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well. Therefore, we analyzed the role of SNPs in the gene TMPRSS2 in a German case-control study.

We analyzed the association of the SNPs with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients did not differ regarding their demographics. The CC genotype of TMPRSS2 rs383510 was associated with a 1.73-fold increased SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, but was not correlated to severity of COVID-19.

Instead, given daily admissions counts, we model aggregated counts of observed resource use, such as the number of patients in the general ward, in the intensive care unit, or on a ventilator. In order to explain how individual patient trajectories produce these counts, we propose an aggregate count explicit-duration hidden Markov model, nicknamed the ACED-HMM, with an interpretable, compact parameterization. We develop an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach that draws samples from the posterior distribution over the model's transition and duration parameters given aggregate counts from a specific location, thus adapting the model to a region or individual hospital site of interest. Samples from this posterior can then be used to produce future forecasts of any counts of interest. Using data from the United States and the United Kingdom, we show our mechanistic approach provides competitive probabilistic forecasts for the future even as the dynamics of the pandemic shift.

Following uptake by alveolar macrophages, the pathogen replicates in an acidic phagolysosomal vacuole, the C. burnetii-containing vacuole (CCV). Effector proteins translocated into the host cell by the type IV secretion system (T4SS) are important for the establishment of the CCV. Here we focus on the effector protein AnkF and its role in establishing the CCV. The C. burnetii AnkF knock out mutant invades host cells as efficiently as wild-type C. burnetii, but this mutant is hampered in its ability to replicate intracellularly, indicating that AnkF might be involved in the development of a replicative CCV. To unravel the underlying reason(s), we searched for AnkF interactors in host cells and identified vimentin through a yeast two-hybrid approach. While AnkF does not alter vimentin expression at the mRNA or protein levels, the presence of AnkF results in structural reorganization and vesicular co-localization with recombinant vimentin. Ectopically expressed AnkF partially accumulates around the established CCV and endogenous vimentin is recruited to the CCV in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that AnkF might attract vimentin to the CCV. However, knocking-down endogenous vimentin does not affect intracellular replication of C. burnetii. Other cytoskeletal components are recruited to the CCV and might compensate for the lack of vimentin. Taken together, AnkF is essential for the establishment of the replicative CCV, however, its mode of action is still elusive.","output":"The Coxiella burnetii T4SS Effector AnkF Is Important for Intracellular Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are no pharmacological interventions currently available to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or to treat COVID-19. The development of vaccines against COVID-19 is essential to contain the pandemic. we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Shanghai residents to understand residents willingness to be vaccinated with any future COVID-19 vaccines and take measures to further improve vaccination coverage. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using self-administered anonymous questionnaires from 1 July to 8 September 2020. The main outcome was willingness of participants, and any children or older individuals living with them, to receive future COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore potential factors associated with vaccination willingness. RESULTS: A total of 1071 participants were asked about their willingness to receive future COVID-19 vaccines, for themselves and at least 747 children and 375 older individuals (60 years old) living with them. The highest proportion of expected willingness to vaccinate was among participants (88.6%), followed by children (85.3%) and older individuals (84.0%). The main reasons for reluctance to vaccinate among 119 participants were doubts regarding vaccine safety (60.0%) and efficacy (28.8%). Participants with a self-reported history of influenza vaccination were more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccines for themselves [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.83; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19C2.82], their children (adjusted OR = 2.08; 95%CI: 1.30C3.33), and older individuals in their household (adjusted OR = 2.12; 95%CI: 1.14C3.99).

This devastating occupational health hazard disproportionately affects rural farming communities in tropical countries. This is exacerbated by the distribution and densities of venomous snakes, incidence of encounters, and limited access to advanced healthcare, including antivenom. Before the development of antivenom, desperation and spiritual beliefs led patients to experiment with a wide range of traditional treatments. Many of these treatments still survive today, particularly in regions where access to healthcare is limited. Plants are a major source of bioactive molecules, including several lifesaving medications that are widely used to this day. However, much of the research into the use of traditional plant treatments for SBE are limited to preliminary analysis or have focused on techniques used to confirm antibody efficacy that are not suitable for non-antibody-containing treatments. Modern drugs are developed through a robust pharmaceutical drug discovery and development process, which applies as much to SBE as it does to any other disease.

Multiple regression, age-matched clustering, and structural equation modeling analyses provided evidence that insomnia in young children is indeed strongly linked to the mothers reaction to the pandemic and lockdown. Specifically, reactions such as COVID-19 fear/anxiety and obsessive COVID-19 information seeking coincide with heightened vigilance, cascading into reduced child social contact, outings, and increased screen viewing, ultimately culminating in child insomnia and behavioral problems.

Research Design and Methods: The study population comprised 133 patients with COVID-19 admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) at an academic, urban, quaternary-care center between March 10(th) and April 8(th), 2020. Patients were categorized based on the presence of DM and early-onset hyperglycemia (EHG), defined as a blood glucose >180 mg/dL during the first two days of ICU admission. The primary outcome was 14-day in-hospital mortality; also examined were 60-day in-hospital mortality and the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6, procalcitonin, and lactate. Results: Compared to non-DM patients without EHG, non-DM patients with EHG exhibited higher adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for in-hospital mortality at 14 days (HR 5.76, p=0.008) and 60 days (HR 7.28, p=0.004). Non-DM patients with EHG also featured higher levels of mean CRP (322.3177.7 mg/L, p=0.036), procalcitonin (34.7569.33 ng/mL, p=0.028), and lactate (2.72.1 mmol/L, p=0.023). Conclusions: In patients with critical illness from COVID-19, those without DM with EHG were at greatest risk of 14-day and 60-day in-hospital mortality. The limitations of our study include its retrospective design, and relatively small cohort. However, our results raise the possibility that the combination of elevated glucose and lactate may identify a specific cohort of individuals at high mortality risk from COVID-19, and suggest that glucose testing and control are important in individuals with COVID-19, even in those without pre-existing diabetes.","output":"Hyperglycemia Is Associated With Increased Mortality in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three zoonotic coronaviruses emerged at the beginning of the XXI century: SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus), Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV), the etiologic agent of COVID 19 (Coronavirus disease) pandemic.

In addition, we investigated the performance of a novel discrimination RT-PCR for detection of the H275Y resistance mutation in the neuraminidase gene. Study design Clinical performance of both subtype specific RT-PCR assays was evaluated through analysis of 684 throat swaps collected from individuals meeting the WHO case definition for the novel pandemic influenza virus. Analytical performance was analyzed through testing of 10-fold serial dilutions of RNA derived from the first Dutch sequenced and cultured confirmed case of novel pandemic influenza infection. Specificity and discriminative capacities of the H275Y discrimination assay were performed by testing wild type and recombinant H275Y pandemic influenza. Results 121 throat swaps collected from April 2009 to July 2009 were positive by at least two out of three RT-PCRs, and negative for the seasonal H3/H1 subtype specific RT-PCR assays. 117 of these were tested positive for all three (Ct-values from 15.1 to 36.8).

Significant negative correlation (suggestive of protection) between COVID-19 mortality and haplotypes HLA-A*01~B*08~DRB1*03, HLA-A*29~B*44~DRB1*07 and HLA-A*02~B*44~DRB1*04 was found when analyzing data from cities with at least 50 deaths registered in the entire country.ConclusionsOur results do not support an association of specific HLA haplotypes with an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV2 or dying from COVID-19 in Brazil. Nevertheless, using bone marrow donor registries for testing for associations between HLA variation and COVID-19 outcomes may represent an additional tool for health policymakers in the fight against COVID-19.","output":"HLA Haplotypes and Differential Regional Incidence of COVID-19 in Brazil: A Population Study Based in a Large Bone Marrow Donors Bank Dataset"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The arts therapies include music therapy, dance movement therapy, art therapy and dramatherapy. Preferences for art forms may play an important role in engagement with treatment. This survey was an initial exploration of who is interested in group arts therapies, what they would choose and why. DESIGN: An online cross-sectional survey of demographics, interest in and preferences for the arts therapies was designed in collaboration with patients. The survey took 10 min to complete, including informed consent and 14 main questions. Summary statistics, multinomial logistic regression and thematic analysis were used to analyse the data. SETTING: Thirteen National Health Service mental health trusts in the UK asked mental health patients and members of the general population to participate. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1541 participants completed the survey; 685 mental health patients and 856 members of the general population. All participants were over 18 years old, had capacity to give informed consent and sufficient understanding of English. Mental health patients had to be using secondary mental health services. RESULTS: Approximately 60% of participants would be interested in taking part in group arts therapies. Music therapy was the most frequent choice among mental health patients (41%) and art therapy was the most frequent choice in the general population (43%). Past experience of arts therapies was the most important predictor of preference for that same modality. Expectations of enjoyment, helpfulness, feeling capable, impact on mood and social interaction were most often reported as reasons for preferring one form of arts therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Large proportions of the participants expressed an interest in group arts therapies. This may justify the wide provision of arts therapies and the offer of more than one modality to interested patients. It also highlights key considerations for assessment of preferences in the arts therapies as part of shared decision-making.","output":"Preferences for group arts therapies: a cross-sectional survey of mental health patients and the general population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most common chemogenetic neuromodulatory system, designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), uses a non-endogenous actuator ligand to activate a modified muscarinic acetylcholine receptor that is insensitive to acetylcholine. It is crucial in studies using these systems to test the potential effects of DREADD actuators prior to any DREADD transduction, so that effects of DREADDs can be attributed to the chemogenetic system rather than the actuator drug, particularly in experiments using nonhuman primates. We investigated working memory performance after injections of three DREADD actuators, clozapine, olanzapine, and deschloroclozapine, in four male rhesus monkeys tested in a spatial delayed response task before any DREADD transduction took place. Performance at 0.1 mg/kg clozapine and 0.1 mg/kg deschloroclozapine did not differ from vehicle in any of the four subjects. 0.2 mg/kg clozapine impaired working memory function in three of the four monkeys. Two monkeys were impaired after 0.1 mg/kg olanzapine and two were impaired after 0.3 mg/kg deschloroclozapine. We speculate that the unique neuropharmacology of prefrontal cortex function makes the primate prefrontal cortex especially vulnerable to off-target effects of DREADD actuator drugs with affinity for endogenous monoaminergic receptor systems. These findings underscore the importance of within-subject controls for DREADD actuator drugs in the specific tasks under study to confirm that effects following DREADD receptor transduction are not owing to the actuator drug itself. They also suggest that off-target effects of DREADD actuators may limit translational applications of chemogenetic neuromodulation.","output":"Effect of chemogenetic actuator drugs on prefrontal cortex-dependent working memory in nonhuman primates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: The relationship between physical health and mental health has been considered for years. A number of studies have shown a correlation between depressive states and the progress of somatic diseases.

The aim of this study was to assess the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as well as the assessment of the relationship of psychological symptoms with sociodemographic factors and physical condition. Materials and Methods: The study enrolled 51 COPD patients who underwent a three-week pulmonary rehabilitation program. After admission to the rehabilitation department, the subjects were asked to complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire, the Perception of Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), and a sociodemographic questionnaire. Results: Anxiety states were diagnosed in 70% of respondents and depressive states were diagnosed in 54% of patients. Some of the respondents (14%) also showed a tendency to experience various grounded stresses. Additionally, there were correlations between the mental state and the results of fitness and respiratory tests. Conclusions: Patients with COPD are at risk for mental disorders, which may adversely affect their general health and significantly limit their physical and respiratory efficiencies.

AIMS: In this multicentre study, we compared the psychological outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in various countries in the Asia-Pacific region and identified factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes. METHOD: From 29 April to 4 June 2020, the study recruited healthcare workers from major healthcare institutions in five countries in the Asia-Pacific region. A self-administrated survey that collected information on prior medical conditions, presence of symptoms, and scores on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised were used. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) relating to COVID-19 was compared, and multivariable logistic regression identified independent factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes within each country. RESULTS: A total of 1146 participants from India, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam were studied. Despite having the lowest volume of cases, Vietnam displayed the highest prevalence of PTSD. In contrast, Singapore reported the highest case volume, but had a lower prevalence of depression and anxiety. In the multivariable analysis, we found that non-medically trained personnel, the presence of physical symptoms and presence of prior medical conditions were independent predictors across the participating countries. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that the varied prevalence of psychological adversity among healthcare workers is independent of the burden of COVID-19 cases within each country.

This study aims to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands, considering recovery as a competing risk. METHODS: In this observational multicenter cohort study we included adults with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection that were admitted to one of five hospitals in the Netherlands (March to May 2020). We performed a competing risk survival analysis, presenting cause-specific hazard ratios (HRCS) for the effect of preselected factors on the absolute risk of death and recovery. RESULTS: 1,006 patients were included (63.9% male; median age 69 years, IQR: 58-77). Patients were hospitalized for a median duration of 6 days (IQR: 3-13); 243 (24.6%) of them died, 689 (69.9%) recovered, and 74 (7.4%) were censored. Patients with higher age (HRCS 1.10, 95% CI 1.08-1.12), immunocompromised state (HRCS 1.46, 95% CI 1.08-1.98), who used anticoagulants or antiplatelet medication (HRCS 1.38, 95% CI 1.01-1.88), with higher modified early warning score (MEWS) (HRCS 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.18), and higher blood LDH at time of admission (HRCS 6.68, 95% CI 1.95-22.8) had increased risk of death, whereas fever (HRCS 0.70, 95% CI 0.52-0.95) decreased risk of death.

Unfortunately, there have been limited studies in the Middle East that provide an occupational risk analysis among CPs. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the risk of COVID-19 exposure among Middle Eastern CPs and to identify the infection predictors. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using an online, self-administered questionnaire that was distributed to CPs across KSA, Lebanon, and Jordan between November and December 2020. The bivariate logistic regression test was used to analyse the predictors associated with COVID-19. RESULTS: CPs were more susceptible to acquiring SARS-CoV-2 than the general public (12.9% vs. 1.5%). The significant predictors of infection included a family member with confirmed COVID-19 infection, age <40 years, encountering patients in pharmacy without a protective glass-barrier, and contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients or colleagues with confirmed COVID-19 during practice. Additionally, the mean level of the respondents expected rate of infection was 3.27  1.04 (out of 5). This level was significantly higher among female pharmacists and Lebanese pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that CPs are at a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 compared with the general public.

Our study was aimed to characterize immune response on the level of antibody profiling in convalescent plasma of patients in Georgia. Antibodies against the following SARS-CoV-2 proteins were studied: nucleocapsid and various regions of spike (S) protein: S1, S2 and receptor binding domain (RBD). Convalescent plasma of patients 6-8 weeks after initial confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested. Nearly 80% out of 162 patients studied showed presence of antibodies against nucleocapsid protein. The antibody response to three fragments of S protein was significantly less and varied in the range of 20-30%. Significantly more females as compared to males were producing antibodies against S1 fragment, whereas the difference between genders by the antibodies against nucleocapsid protein and RBD was statistically significant only by one-tailed Fisher exact test. There were no differences between the males and females by antibodies against S2 fragment.

When the field reference range were compared to data from the uncontaminated station (Bronelle), only few deviations were shown. In this way, data coming from uncontaminated station (Bronelle) was integrated in the field reference ranges to improve the evaluation of site variability. The new field reference ranges provided better discrimination of sites and spanned a larger range of fish lengths than the initial reference ranges.

However, little is known about how depression screening affects the likelihood of being diagnosed with a mental disorder or accessing mental health care over time. Methods This longitudinal cohort study used insurance claims data from 57,732 adolescents who had at least one routine well-visit between 2014 and 2017. Using propensity score matching, we compared adolescents who were screened for depression to similar adolescents who were not screened for depression during the well-visit. Diagnostic and treatment-related outcomes were examined over 6-month follow-up and included depression diagnoses, mood-related diagnoses, antidepressant prescriptions, any mental health-related prescriptions, and psychotherapy. We also examined heterogeneity of associations by sex. Results Compared to adolescents who were not screened for depression, adolescents screened for depression were 30% more likely to be diagnosed with depression (RR=1.30, 95% CI=1.11-1.52) and 17% more likely to receive a mood-related diagnosis (RR=1.17, 95% CI=1.08-1.27), but were not more likely to be treated with an antidepressant prescription (RR=1.11, 95% CI=0.82-1.51), any mental health prescription (RR=1.15, 95% CI=0.87-1.53), or psychotherapy (RR=1.13, 95% CI=0.98-1.31).

Although mesh erosion appears to be less associated with an abdominal approach, the long-term outcome has not been studied intensively. This study was set up to determine the long-term mesh erosion rate following abdominal pelvic reconstructive surgery. METHODS A prospective, observational cohort study was conducted in a tertiary care setting. All consecutive female patients who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy and sacrocolporectopexy in 2011 and 2012 were included. Primary outcome was mesh erosion. Preoperative and postoperative evaluation (6 weeks, 1 year, 5 years) with a clinical examination and questionnaire regarding pelvic floor symptoms was performed. Mesh-related complications were assessed using a transparent vaginal speculum, proctoscopy, and digital vaginal and rectal examination. Kaplan-Meier estimates were calculated for mesh erosion. A review of the literature on mesh exposure after minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy was performed (12 months' follow-up). RESULTS Ninety-six of the 130 patients included (73.8%) were clinically examined. Median follow-up time was 48.1 months (range 36.0-62.1). Three mesh erosions were diagnosed (3.1%; Kaplan-Meier 4.9%, 95% confidence interval 0-11.0): one bladder erosion for which mesh resection and an omental patch interposition were performed, and two asymptomatic vaginal erosions (at 42.7 and 42.3 months) treated with estrogen cream in one. Additionally, 22 patients responded solely by questionnaire and/or telephone; none reported mesh-related complaints. The literature, mostly based on retrospective studies, described a median mesh erosion rate of 1.9% (range 0-13.3%).

The threat from swine flu was portrayed as greatest in the spring and summer of 2009 when scientific uncertainties about the impact on the UK and global population were at their height and when swine flu cases in the UK first peaked. Thereafter the number of news articles waned, failing to mirror the October peak in flu cases as the virus failed to be as virulent as first feared. Content analysis found little evidence of the media over-hyping the swine flu pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The news media's role as a disseminator of scientific information is particularly important in areas of risk perception. Despite a succession of health scares in recent years in which the media has been accused of exaggerating the risks and contributing to public misunderstandings of the issues, this analysis suggests that the UK newsprint reporting of swine flu in the 2009C10 outbreak was largely measured. The news media's role as disseminators of factual health information on swine flu is to be welcomed, particularly in relation to their handling and responsible reporting on scientific uncertainty.","output":"UK newspapers' representations of the 2009C10 outbreak of swine flu: one health scare not over-hyped by the media?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: There is a need to develop a medical device which can accurately measure normal and abnormal nasal breathing which the patient can better understand in addition to being able to diagnose the cause for their nasal obstruction. The aim is to evaluate the accuracy of the nasal acoustic device (NAD) in diagnosing the common causes for nasal obstruction and diagnosing normal and abnormal (nasal obstruction) nasal breathing. METHODS: This pilot study recruited 27 patients with allergic rhinitis (AR), chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), and a deviated nasal septum (DNS) which represents the common causes for NO and 26 controls (with normal nasal breathing). Nasal breathing sounds were recorded by the NAD akin to two small stethoscopes placed over the left and right nasal ala. The novel outcome metrics for the NAD include inspiratory nasal acoustic score (INA) score, expiratory nasal acoustic (ENA) score and the inspiratory nasal obstruction balance index (NOBI). The change in acoustic score following decongestant is key in this diagnostic process. RESULTS: Pre\\\\decongestant ENA score was used to detect the presence of nasal obstruction in patients compared to controls, with a sensitivity of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.66\\\\0.96) and a specificity of 0.77 (0.54\\\\1.00). Post\\\\decongestant percentage change in INA score was used to identify the presence of AR or CRS, with a sensitivity of 0.87 (0.69\\\\1.00) and specificity of 0.72 (0.55\\\\0.89) for AR; and a sensitivity of 0.92 (0.75\\\\1.00) and specificity of 0.69 (0.52\\\\0.86) for CRS. Post\\\\decongestant inspiratory NOBI was used to identify DNS, with a sensitivity of 0.77 (0.59\\\\0.95) and specificity of 0.94 (0.82\\\\1.00).

In this review, we summarize 13 relevant risk factors associated with this disease that are important to consider prior to embarking on any related sarcopenia research. We suggest that researchers should concentrate on the biology of sarcopenia to develop a uniform consensus for screening this condition. In this review, we identify 50 biochemical markers across six pathways that have previously been investigated in subjects with sarcopenia. We suggest that these summarized biomarkers can be considered in future diagnosis to determine the biology of this disorder, thereby contributing to further research findings. As a result, a uniform consensus may also need to be established for screening and defining the disease. Sarcopenia is associated with a number of adverse economic and social outcomes, including disability, hospitalization, and death. In relation to this, we propose that we need to develop strategies including exercise interventions in the COVID-19 era to delay the onset and effects of sarcopenia. This suggestion should impact on sarcopenias primary and secondary outcomes, including physical, medical, social, and financial interactions. ABSTRACT: Sarcopenia refers to a progressive and generalized weakness of skeletal muscle as individuals age. Sarcopenia usually occurs after the age of 60 years and is associated with a persistent decline in muscle strength, function, and quality. A comparison of the risk factors associated with sarcopenia based on the European Working Group on Sarcopenia (1 and 2) in Older People, the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (1 and 2), the International Working Group on Sarcopenia, and the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health revealed no consistent patterns. Accordingly, the identification of a single risk factor for sarcopenia is unpredictable due to its multifactorial pathogenesis, with the involvement of a multitude of factors. Therefore, the first aim of this review was to outline and propose that the multiple factors associated with sarcopenia need to be considered in combination in the design of new experimentation in this area. A secondary aim was to highlight the biochemical risk factors that are already identified in subjects with sarcopenia to assist scientists in understanding the biology of the pathophysiological mechanisms affecting the old people with sarcopenia. We also briefly discuss primary outcomes (physical) and secondary outcomes (social and financial) of sarcopenia. For future investigative purposes, this comprehensive review may be useful in considering important risk factors in the utilization of a panel of biomarkers emanating from all pathways involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. This may help to establish a uniform consensus for screening and defining this disease. Considering the COVID-19 pandemic, its impact may be exacerbated in older populations, which requires immediate attention. Here, we briefly suggest strategies for advancing the development of smart technologies to deliver exercise in the COVID-19 era in an attempt regress the onset of sarcopenia. These strategies may also have an impact on sarcopenias primary and secondary outcomes.","output":"A Multifactorial Approach for Sarcopenia Assessment: A Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives : Several interventions have been used around the world trying to contain the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, such as quarantine, prohibition of mass demonstrations, isolation of sick people, tracing of virus carriers, semi-containment, promotion of barrier gestures, development of rapid auto-tests and vaccines among others.

With the challenges of organizing an online symposium in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, its online nature had significant advantages. The symposium drew international scholars inviting a multitude of prospective on STEAM education, while uncovering the challenges faced by educators. The issue aims at examining these challenges through a collection of papers. In this editorial, we introduce some key notions, discourses, and challenges of STEAM education, as a relatively novel concept and briefly discuss the history of STEAM and its evolution over the last decades.

Few COVID-19 therapeutics are available, and the basis for severe infections is poorly understood. Here, we investigated properties of type I (), II (), and III (1) interferons (IFNs), potent immune cytokines that are normally produced during infection and that upregulate IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) effectors to limit virus replication. IFNs are already in clinical trials to treat COVID-19. However, recent studies highlight the potential for IFNs to enhance expression of host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), suggesting that IFN therapy or natural coinfections could exacerbate COVID-19 by upregulating this critical virus entry receptor. Using a cell line model, we found that beta interferon (IFN-) strongly upregulated expression of canonical antiviral ISGs, as well as ACE2 at the mRNA and cell surface protein levels. Strikingly, IFN-1 upregulated antiviral ISGs, but ACE2 mRNA was only marginally elevated and did not lead to detectably increased ACE2 protein at the cell surface. IFN- induced the weakest ISG response but clearly enhanced surface expression of ACE2. Importantly, all IFN types inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner, and IFN- and IFN-1 exhibited potent antiviral activity in primary human bronchial epithelial cells. Our data imply that type-specific mechanisms or kinetics shape IFN-enhanced ACE2 transcript and cell surface levels but that the antiviral action of IFNs against SARS-CoV-2 counterbalances any proviral effects of ACE2 induction. These insights should aid in evaluating the benefits of specific IFNs, particularly IFN-, as repurposed therapeutics.","output":"Antiviral Activity of Type I, II, and III Interferons Counterbalances ACE2 Inducibility and Restricts SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To capture the perspective of prospective urology applicants experiencing unique challenges in the context of COVID-19 METHODS: A voluntary, anonymous survey was distributed online, assessing the impact of COVID-19 on a large sample of US medical students planning to apply to urology residencies Themes of (1) specialty discernment, (2) alterations to medical education, and (3) the residency application process were explored RESULTS: A total of 238 medical students, 87% third- and fourth- years, responded to the survey While 85% indicated that the pandemic had not deterred their specialty choice, they noted substantial impacts on education, including 82% reporting decreased exposure to urology Nearly half of students reported changes to required rotations and 35% reported changes to urology-specific rotations at their home institutions Students shared concerns about suspending in-person experiences, including the impact on letters of recommendation (68% \\"very concerned) and program choice (73% \\"very concerned\\") Looking to the possibility of virtual interactions, students identified the importance of small group and one-on-one communication with residents (83% \\"very important\\") and opportunities to learn about hospital facilities (72% \\"very important\\") CONCLUSIONS: Despite the impacts of COVID-19 on medical education, prospective urology applicants appear to remain confident in their specialty choice Students' biggest concerns involve disruption of away rotations, including impacts on obtaining letters of recommendation and choosing a residency program","output":"Capturing the Perspective of Prospective Urology Applicants: Impacts of COVID-19 on Medical Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Entrapment of the radial nerve at the arcade of Frohse could contribute to symptoms in patients with lateral epicondylalgia or radial tunnel syndrome.

ABSTRACT: Scytovirin (SVN) is an HIV-neutralizing lectin that features two structural domains (SD1 and SD2) that bind to HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins. We expressed SD1 in rice seeds as a potential large-scale production platform and confirmed that rice-derived SD1 binds the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 in vitro. We analyzed the thermodynamic properties of SD1 compared to full-size SVN (produced in E. coli) by isothermal titration and differential scanning calorimetry to characterize the specific interactions between SVN/SD1 and gp120 as well as to high-mannose oligosaccharides. SVN bound with moderate affinity (K(d) = 1.5 M) to recombinant gp120, with 2.5-fold weaker affinity to nonamannoside (K(d) of 3.9 M), and with tenfold weaker affinity to tetramannoside (13.8 M). The melting temperature (T(m)) of full-size SVN was 59.1 C and the enthalpy of unfolding (H(unf)) was 16.4 kcal/mol, but the T(m) fell when SVN bound to nonamannoside (56.5 C) and twice as much energy was required for unfolding (H(unf) = 33.5 kcal/mol). Interestingly, binding to tetramannoside destabilized the structure of SD1 (T(m) ~ 11.5 C) and doubled the enthalpy of unfolding, suggesting a dimerization event. The similar melting phenomenon shared by SVN and SD1 in the presence of oligomannose confirmed their conserved oligosaccharide-binding mechanisms. SD1 expressed in transgenic rice was able to neutralize HIV-1 in vitro.

Advances in genomics knowledge and technologies can add to this endeavor, but also pose a challenge when faced with often conflicting public health (population) and genomic medicine (individual) perspectives. Combining the fields of genomic, population, and social sciences, population genomics or public health genomics looks at the promotion of health and prevention of disease using genomic knowledge through the lens of populations rather than individuals. In this chapter we will survey the three major disciplines contributing to population genomics (genomics, population, and social sciences) and explore two cross-cutting issues: global health and population versus individual health, using specific examples from diseases such as asthma, colon cancer, and cystic fibrosis.","output":"Public and Population Health Genomics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the combination of systemic and targeted chemotherapies is associated with severe adverse side effects and long-term health complications, there is interest in reducing treatment intensity for patients with early-stage breast cancer (EBC). Clinical trials are needed to determine the feasibility of reducing treatment intensity while maintaining 3-year recurrence-free survival of greater than 92%. To recruit participants for these trials, it is important to understand patient perspectives on reducing chemotherapy. METHODS: We collected qualitative interview data from twenty-four patients with Stage II-III breast cancer and sixteen patient advocates. Interviews explored potential barriers and facilitators to participation in trials testing reduced amounts of chemotherapy. As the COVID-19 pandemic struck during data collection, seventeen participants were asked about the potential impact of COVID-19 on their interest in these trials. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed, and researchers used qualitative content analysis to code for dominant themes. RESULTS: Seventeen participants (42.5%) expressed interest in participating in a trial of reduced chemotherapy. Barriers to reducing chemotherapy included (1) fear of recurrence and inefficacy, (2) preference for aggressive treatment, (3) disinterest in clinical trials, (4) lack of information about expected outcomes, (5) fear of regret, and (6) having young children. Facilitators included (1) avoiding physical toxicity, (2) understanding the scientific rationale of reducing chemotherapy, (3) confidence in providers, (4) consistent monitoring and the option to increase dosage, (5) fewer financial and logistical challenges, and (6) contributing to scientific knowledge. Of those asked, nearly all participants said they would be more motivated to reduce treatment intensity in the context of COVID-19, primarily to avoid exposure to the virus while receiving treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with EBC, there is significant interest in alleviating treatment-related toxicity by reducing chemotherapeutic intensity. Patients will be more apt to participate in trials testing reduced amounts of chemotherapy if these are framed in terms of customizing treatment to the individual patient and added benefitreduced toxicities, higher quality of life during treatment and lower risk of long-term complicationsrather than in terms of taking treatments away or doing less than the standard of care.

It aims to optimize physical and psychological health through delivery of a series of tailored interventions including exercise, nutrition, and psychological support. At the core of this prescription is a need for considerable health behavior change, to ensure that patients are engaged with and adhere to these interventions and experience the associated benefits. To date the prehabilitation literature has focused on testing the efficacy of devised exercise and nutritional interventions with a primary focus on physiological and mechanistic outcomes with little consideration for the role of behavioral science, supporting individual behavior change or optimizing patient engagement. Changing health behavior is complex and to maximize success, prehabilitation programs should draw on latest insights from the field of behavioral science. Behavioral science offers extensive knowledge on theories and models of health behavior change to further advance intervention effectiveness. Similarly, interventions developed with a person-centered approach, taking into consideration individual needs and preferences will increase engagement. In this article, we will provide an overview of the extent to which the existing prehabilitation literature incorporates behavioral science, as well as studies that have explored patient's attitudes toward prehabilitation. We will go on to describe and critique ongoing trials in a variety of contexts within oncology prehabilitation and discuss how current scientific knowledge may be enhanced from a behavioral science perspective.

The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of patients treated for COVID-19 with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Methods: : A retrospective cohort study was conducted at 2 hospitals in Busan, South Korea, that treated approximately 90% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Busan during the study period. All patients aged 15 years that were hospitalized with mild-or-moderate COVID-19 received LPV/r or HCQ as their initial treatment and were included in the analysis. Results: : Among the 72 patients with mild-to-moderate disease severity on admission, 45 received LPV/r and 27 received HCQ as their initial therapy. A higher proportion of the LPV group had pneumonia on admission (LPV 49% vs. HCQ 15%), but there were no other significant differences in the demographic or clinical characteristics between groups.Switching therapy due to clinical failure was significantly more common in the HCQ group than in the LPV/r group (41% [11/27] and 2% [1/45], respectively, P= 0.001). Disease progression was also significantly more common in the HCQ group than in the LPV/r group (44% [12/27] and 18% [8/45], respectively, P =0.030).

Individual genetic, biological or hemodynamic factors are inadequate to explain the heterogeneity of ATAA development/progression mechanisms, thus stimulating the analysis of their complex interplay. Here the disruption of the hemodynamic environment in the ATAA is investigated integrating patient-specific computational hemodynamics, CT-based in vivo estimation of local aortic stiffness and advanced fluid mechanics methods of analysis. The final aims are (1) deciphering the ATAA spatiotemporal hemodynamic complexity and its link to near-wall topological features, and (2) identifying the existing links between arterial wall degeneration and hemodynamic insult. Technically, two methodologies are applied to computational hemodynamics data, the wall shear stress (WSS) topological skeleton analysis, and the Complex Networks theory. The same analysis was extended to the healthy aorta. As main findings of the study, we report that: (1) different spatiotemporal heterogeneity characterizes the ATAA and healthy hemodynamics, that markedly reflect on their WSS topological skeleton features; (2) a link (stronger than canonical WSS-based descriptors) emerges between the variation of contraction/expansion action exerted by WSS on the endothelium along the cardiac cycle, and ATAA wall stiffness. The findings of the study suggest the use of advanced methods for a deeper understanding of the hemodynamics disruption in ATAA, and candidate WSS topological skeleton features as promising indicators of local wall degeneration.","output":"Deciphering ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm hemodynamics in relation to biomechanical properties."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a substantial impact on the incidence of cardiac arrest and survival.

We aim to quantify excess stroke-related deaths and characterize its association with social distancing behavior and COVID-19Crelated vascular pathology. METHODS: United States and state-level excess cerebrovascular deaths from January to May 2020 were quantified using National Center for Health Statistic data and Poisson regression models. Excess cerebrovascular deaths were analyzed as a function of time-varying stroke-related emergency medical service (EMS) calls and cumulative COVID-19 deaths using linear regression. A state-level regression analysis was performed to determine the association between excess cerebrovascular deaths and time spent in residences, measured by Google Community Mobility Reports, during the height of the pandemic after the first COVID-19 death (February 29). RESULTS: Forty states and New York City were included. Excess cerebrovascular mortality occurred nationally from the weeks ending March 28 to May 2, 2020, up to a 7.8% increase above expected levels during the week of April 18. Decreased stroke-related EMS calls were associated with excess stroke deaths one (70 deaths per 1000 fewer EMS calls [95% CI, 20C118]) and 2 weeks (85 deaths per 1000 fewer EMS calls [95% CI, 37C133]) later.

Only recently was it known for its coding gene and for its role implicated in cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we have investigated the transcriptional control of S2R by the Bromo/ExtraTerminal epigenetic reader family (BETs, including BRD2, 3, and 4) upon cholesterol perturbation. Cholesterol deprivation was induced in ARPE19 cells using a blocker of lysosomal cholesterol export. This condition up-regulated S2R mRNA and protein, and also SREBP2 but not SREBP1, both transcription factors key to cholesterol/fatty acid metabolism. Silencing BRD2 but not BRD3 or BRD4 (though widely deemed a master regulator) averted S2R up-regulation that was induced by cholesterol deprivation. Silencing SREBP2 but not SREBP1 diminished S2R expression. Furthermore, endogenous BRD2 co-immunoprecipitated with the transcription-active N-terminal half of SREBP2, and chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR signified co-occupancy of BRD2, H3K27ac (histone acetylation), and SREBP2Nterm at the S2R gene promoter. In summary, this study reveals a previously unrecognized BRD2/SREBP2 cooperative regulation of S2R transcription, thus shedding new light on signaling in response to cholesterol deprivation.","output":"BRD2 regulation of sigma-2 receptor upon cholesterol deprivation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Healthcare workers are at the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic and it is essential to monitor the relative infection rate of this group, as compared to workers in other occupations.

For some healthcare workers, these challenges may have contributed to increased stress, burnout, and psychosocial impairment, including symptoms of depression and anxiety. The current study addresses a knowledge gap of associations between pandemic-related experiences and psychosocial risk among medical and nonmedical pediatric healthcare staff. METHODS A sample of 369 staff (90% female) employed at an acute care, freestanding pediatric hospital in Connecticut completed an online survey. The survey assessed specific pandemic-related experiences and perceived impact with the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory, and depression and anxiety risk with the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression screen and 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder screen, respectively. Enrollment and survey completion occurred over a 6-week period during the pandemic (summer 2020). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS High rates of adverse pandemic-related experiences included workplace experiences (e.g., inadequate support, interpersonal difficulties), home life (e.g., childcare difficulties, partner conflict), and experiences reflecting social isolation and quarantine, child and adult mental health difficulties, increased alcohol or substance use, and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. Medical relative to nonmedical staff reported significantly more adverse and fewer positive experiences, and a significantly higher perceived negative impact of workplace experiences. A positive screen for depression or anxiety was significantly predicted by cumulative adverse workplace experiences (OR = 1.15), changes in emotional/physical health (OR = 1.35), and perceived negative impact of workplace experiences (OR = 1.32). APPLICATIONS TO PRACTICE The present study joins recent reports of increased adverse experiences and psychosocial outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings underscore the need for pediatric hospitals to innovate ways to reduce burden and connect staff to mental health services during similar public health crises. Such services might include (1) assisting healthcare staff to navigate disruptions in their home and social lives as a result of new challenges faced at work, (2) adapting the hospital environment and culture to mitigate stress experienced by staff because of these challenges, and (3) bolstering mental health screening and services to address exacerbated or emerging mental health symptoms, such as depression and anxiety.","output":"Pandemic-Related Experiences and Stress Among Children's Hospital Staff Predict Psychosocial Risk."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Clinicians face a multitude of ethical conflicts in their daily practice. There have been no studies on the types of ethical conflicts encountered most frequently and that are of most concern to clinicians in Spain.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our observational cross-sectional study employed a voluntary and anonymous survey aimed at Spanish medical internists and distributed through an ad hoc platform of the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine. RESULTS: The most common and relevant ethical issues for Spanish internists are related to patients end of life (decisions limiting therapeutic effort, use of palliative treatments, the establishment of do-not-resuscitate orders), the conflicts arising within the doctor-patient/family relationship, and making decisions with noncompetent patients. These results are similar to those of other English and European series. The ethical problems further complicate the healthcare activity of clinicians who more often notice these problems (50.3%) than those who do not notice them (16%). CONCLUSIONS: The most common and relevant ethical conflicts among Spanish internists are related to managing patients end of life, followed by those related to the doctor-patient relationship and the management of noncompetent patients.

As nurses and midwives have the most contact with patients and as an important first step in improving compliance, this study sought to explore nurses' and midwives' knowledge on the role of the environment in infection prevention and control and identify challenges in maintaining clean patient environments. METHODS: Cross-sectional online survey of 96 nurses (RN/EN) and midwives (RW) employed in clinical settings (e.g. hospital, aged care, medical centre, clinic) in Australia. RESULTS: Nurses and midwives broadly stated that they understood the importance of cleaning. However, cleaning responsibilities varied and there was confusion regarding the application of different disinfectants when cleaning after patients with a suspected or diagnosed infection post-discharge. Most would not be confident being placed in a room where a previous patient had a diagnosed infection such as multi-drug resistant organism. CONCLUSION: Greater organisational support and improving applied knowledge about infection control procedures is needed.

The American College of Surgeons and the Society of Surgical Oncology have released guidelines for triage of these procedures. We seek to synthesize available evidence on delayed resection and oncologic outcomes, while also providing a critical assessment of the released guidelines. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify literature between 2005 and 2020 investigating the impact of time to surgery on oncologic outcomes in colorectal, pancreatic, and gastric cancer. RESULTS: For colorectal cancer, 1066 abstracts were screened and 43 papers were included. In primarily resected colon cancer, delay over 30 to 40 days is associated with lower survival. In rectal cancer, time to surgery over 7 to 8 weeks following neoadjuvant therapy is associated with decreased survival. Three hundred ninety-four abstracts were screened for pancreatic cancer and nine studies were included. Two studies demonstrate increased unexpected progression with delayed surgery over 30 days. Out of 633 abstracts screened for gastric cancer, six studies were included. No identified study demonstrated worse survival with increased time to surgery. CONCLUSION: Moderate evidence suggests that delayed resection of colorectal cancer worsens survival; the impact of time to surgery on gastric and pancreatic cancer outcomes is uncertain. Early resection of gastrointestinal malignancies provides the best chance for curative therapy.

Our study was designed to determine the serostatus and relative levels of anti-S and neutralizing antibodies in patients who were administered either ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccine. In addition, we investigated whether the antibody response to each vaccine differed according to sex and age. METHODS: Healthcare workers (HCWs) at a general hospital who were vaccinated with two doses of either ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 were invited to participate in this prospective cohort study. Blood samples of HCWs vaccinated with both ChAdOx1 doses over a period of 12 weeks were collected at weeks 4 and 8 post first vaccination and 2 weeks post second vaccination. Blood samples of HCWs vaccinated with BNT162b2 were collected in the third week after the first dose, and the second dose was then administered on the same day; two weeks post second dose (5 weeks after the first dose), blood samples were collected to assess the antibody response. The titers of anti-S antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain and the neutralizing antibodies in the collected blood were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 309 HCWs enrolled in the study, 205 received ChAdOx1 and 104 received BNT162b2. Blood samples from participants receiving either the ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccine exhibited substantial anti-S and neutralizing antibody seropositivity subsequent to the second dose. All participants (100%) from both vaccine groups were seropositive for anti-S antibody, while 98% (201/205) of ChAdOx1-vaccinated individuals and 100% (104/104) of BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals were seropositive for neutralizing antibodies. The median levels of anti-S and neutralizing antibodies were significantly higher in the BNT162b2-vaccinated group than the ChAdOx1-vaccinated group; in particular, anti-S antibody titers of 1,020 (interquartile range, 571.0C1,631.0) U/mL vs. 2,360 (1,243C2,500) U/mL, P < 0.05, were recorded for the ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 groups, respectively, and neutralizing antibody titers of 85.0 (65.9C92.1%) vs. 95.8 (94.4C96.6%), P < 0.05, were recorded for the ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 groups, respectively. In the ChAdOx1 vaccine group, the neutralizing antibody level was significantly higher in women than in men (85.7 [70.3C92.5%] vs. 77.7 [59.2C91.0%], P < 0.05); however, the neutralizing antibody titer in the BNT162b2 vaccine group did not vary between the two sexes (95.9 [95.2C96.6%] vs. 95.2 [93.5C96.3%], P = 0.200). Analysis of the correlation of antibody profiles with age revealed that the levels of anti-S antibodies and signal inhibition rate (SIR) of neutralizing antibodies decreased significantly with age. CONCLUSION: Both the ChAdOx1- and BNT162b2-vaccinated groups showed high seropositivity for anti-S and neutralizing antibodies. The SIR of neutralizing antibodies in the ChAdOx1 vaccine group was higher in women than in men. Enhanced antibody responses were observed in participants vaccinated with BNT162b2 compared to those vaccinated with the ChAdOx1 vaccine.","output":"Comparison of Antibody Response Elicited by ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores public value and public management through the lens of economic factors - an unusual stance since public management research mostly features the economy as background rather than foreground.

Little is known about the subjective burden, views, and COVID-19 infection status of HCWs. The aim of this work was to evaluate the subjective burden, the perception of the information policies, and the agreement on structural measures in a large cohort of German HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. This country-wide anonymous online survey was carried out from April 15th until May 1st, 2020. 25 content-related questions regarding the subjective burden and other dimensions were evaluated. We evaluated different dimensions of subjective burden, stress, and perspectives using 5-point Likert-scale questions. Moreover, the individual COVID-19 infection status, the amount of people infected in circle of friends and acquaintances and the hours working overtime were assessed. A total of 3669 HCWs provided sufficient responses for analyses. 2.8% of HCWs reported to have been tested positive for COVID-19. Nurses reported in principle higher ratings on all questions of subjective burden and stress than doctors and other hospital staff. Doctors (3.6%) and nurses (3.1%) were more likely to be tested positive for COVID-19 than other hospital staff (0.6%, Chi((2))(2) = 17.39, p < 0.0005). HCWs who worked in a COVID-19 environment reported higher levels of subjective burden and stress compared to all other participants.

However, studies have not reported this particular comparison done with viral copy numbers. Twenty-two genetically confirmed -positive saliva samples for wild-type strain and 32 Delta variants were statistically compared for viral copy number per milliliter determined by real-time qPCR combined with synthesized viral RNA and Poissons null distribution equation between the groups of wild and variant strains and between whole saliva and centrifugal supernatant in each group. We found that the copy number of the Delta variants was 15.1 times higher than wild-type strains of the whole saliva. In addition, the viral load of both strains in the whole saliva was higher than the pertinent supernatant, indicating that most viruses in the whole saliva are associated with host cells. Meanwhile, more than a million virions per milliliter of the viral load of the variants in the supernatants were 4.0 times higher but not significant than wild-type strains.

High binding antibody levels against WT SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) were detected 28 days after vaccination with both mRNA vaccines (mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2), which significantly decreased after 6 months. In contrast, antibody levels were lower after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination but did not wane. Neutralization assays with authentic virus showed consistent cross-neutralization of the Beta and Delta variants in study participants, but Omicron-specific responses were significantly lower or absent (up to a 34-fold decrease compared to D614G). Notably, BNT162b2 booster vaccination after either two mRNA-1273 immunizations or Ad26.COV.2 priming partially restored neutralization of the Omicron variant, but responses were still up to-17-fold decreased compared to D614G. CD4+ T-cell responses were detected up to 6 months after all vaccination regimens; S-specific T-cell responses were highest after mRNA-1273 vaccination. No significant differences were detected between D614G- and variant-specific T-cell responses, including Omicron, indicating minimal escape at the T-cell level.

First, we delivered the bolus at 12 mL/min at epimysium, perineural tissue, epineurium and in subepineurium at 48 peripheral nerve sites on three cadavers. Second, we delivered the bolus at using three infusion rates: 1 mL/min, 6 mL/min and 12 mL/min on epineurium at 70 peripheral nerve sites on five cadavers. Third, we repeated three injections (12 mL/min) at 24 epineural sites over the median and sciatic nerves of three cadavers. RESULTS: Mean (95%) injection pressure was greater at epineurium compared with subepineurium (geometric ratio 1.2 (95% CI: 0.9 to 1.6)), p=0.04, and perineural tissue (geometric ratio 5.1 (95% CI: 3.7 to 7.0)), p<0.0001.

Obesity and older age were the only independent, significant predictors for MV. Comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma, and increased D-dimer levels were significantly associated with higher mortality risk, regardless of age, body mass index, and MV. Obesity in young and middle-aged adults is a strong predictor of a more complicated COVID-19, without, however, evidence of a significant effect on in-hospital mortality.

The oil and gas industry is increasingly reliant on unconventional deposits such as heavy crude oil and bitumen for reasons of accessibility, scale, and geopolitics. Unconventional deposits such as the Canadian Oil Sands in Northern Alberta contain more than one-third of the worlds viscous oil reserves and are vital linchpins to meet the energy needs of rapidly industrializing populations. Heavy oil is typically recovered from subsurface deposits using thermal recovery approaches such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). In this perspective article, we discuss several aspects of materials science challenges in the utilization of heavy crude oil with an emphasis on the needs of the Canadian Oil Sands. In particular, we discuss surface modification and materials design approaches essential to operations under extreme environments of high temperatures and pressures and the presence of corrosive species. The demanding conditions for materials and surfaces are directly traceable to the high viscosity, low surface tension, and substantial sulfur content of heavy crude oil, which necessitates extensive energy-intensive thermal processes, warrants dilution/emulsification to ease the flow of rheologically challenging fluids, and engenders the need to protect corrodible components. Geopolitical reasons have further led to a considerable geographic separation between extraction sites and advanced refineries capable of processing heavy oils to a diverse slate of products, thus necessitating a massive midstream infrastructure for transportation of these rheologically challenging fluids. Innovations in fluid handling, bitumen processing, and midstream transportation are critical to the economic viability of heavy oil. Here, we discuss foundational principles, recent technological advancements, and unmet needs emphasizing candidate solutions for thermal insulation, membrane-assisted separations, corrosion protection, and midstream bitumen transportation. This perspective seeks to highlight illustrative materials technology developments spanning the range from nanocomposite coatings and cement sheaths for thermal insulation to the utilization of orthogonal wettability to engender separation of waterCoil emulsions stabilized by endogenous surfactants extracted during SAGD, size-exclusion membranes for fractionation of bitumen, omniphobic coatings for drag reduction in pipelines and to ease oil handling in containers, solid prills obtained from partial bitumen solidification to enable solid-state transport with reduced risk of damage from spills, and nanocomposite coatings incorporating multiple modes of corrosion inhibition.

METHODS: Chest CT images of patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive COVID-19 were categorized according to the CORADS and RSNA classifications by radiologists with different levels of experience and who were initially unaware of the RT-PCR results. The inter- and intra-observer concordances for each of the classifications were calculated, as were the concordances between classifications. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were included in this study. The RSNA classification showed an almost perfect inter-observer agreement between reviewers with similar experience levels, with a kappa coefficient of 0.892 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.788-0.995). CORADS showed substantial agreement among reviewers with similar experience levels, with a kappa coefficient of 0.642 (95% CI, 0.491-0.793).

Materials and Methods We retrieved data for 329,942 SARS-CoV-2 records uploaded to the GISAID database from the beginning of the pandemic until the 8th of January 2021. To process the data, a Python variant detection script was developed, using pairwise2 from the BioPython library. Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, were applied to visualize the data. Genomic coordinates were obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/). Sequence alignments were performed for every gene separately. Genomes less than 26,000 nucleotides long were excluded from the research. Clustering was performed using HDBScan. Results Here, we addressed the genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2 using 329,942 worldwide samples. The analysis yielded 155 genome variations (SNPs and deletions) in more than 0.3% of the sequences. Nine common SNPs were present in more than 20% of the samples. Clustering results suggested that a proportion of people (2.46%) were infected with a distinct subtype of the B.1.1.7 variant. The subtype may be characterized by four to six additional mutations, with four being a more frequent option (G28881A, G28882A, and G28883 in the N gene, A23403G in S, A28095T in ORF8, G25437T in ORF3a). Two clusters were formed by mutations in the samples uploaded predominantly by Denmark and Australia, which may indicate the emergence of Danish and Australian variants. Five clusters were linked to increased/decreased age, shifted gender ratio, or both. According to a correlation coefficient matrix, 69 mutations correlate with at least one other mutation (correlation coefficient greater than 0.7). We also addressed the completeness of the GISAID database, where between 77% and 93% of the fields were either left blank or filled incorrectly. Metadata mining analysis has led to a hypothesis about gender inequality in medical care in certain countries. Finally, we found ORF6 and E as the most conserved genes (96.15% and 94.66% of the sequences totally match the reference, respectively), making them potential targets for vaccines and treatment. Our results indicate areas of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that researchers can focus on for further structural and functional analysis.","output":"Analysis of 329,942 SARS-CoV-2 records retrieved from GISAID database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID 19 is an acute respiratory disease caused by infection by the virus SARS-COV-2 and has been declared as a pandemic whose specific treatment is still not established. One of the options in the treatment is Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy when there is presence of required amount of neutralizing antibodies in the plasma of recovered COVID patients. Our objective was to analyze the challenges and the constraints encountered in motivation of COVID 19 recovered persons to come for the screening procedures and to convince the selected persons to come for Plasma donation voluntarily. MATERIAL & METHODS: The present retrospective observational study was conducted for a period of five and half months. Out of 1515 number of persons contacted telephonically for Plasma donation, 1291 persons came for screening of whom 1028 persons were eligible for donation, 263 cases were deferred and 966 persons finally donated. RESULTS: Maximum number of acceptance cases were from males-(98.7%). Of the accepted cases, (41.73%) were from the 18-30 years' age group. 33.94% were from blood group 'O' Rh D positive giving maximum contribution from any blood group. 38.3% of the accepted cases had resolution of all COVID symptoms within time period of 28-40 days. Maximum number of accepted individuals (39.75%) had suffered from multiple symptoms followed by 39.02% of asymptomatic persons. Highest number of Plasma donation was contributed by Odisha Government Police personnel (51.56%). DISCUSSION: In this global ongoing pandemic, the \\"Fear Factor of contracting the disease\\" has acted as a major challenge in motivating and convincing a COVID recovered patient for plasma donation. The challenge before the medical professionals was to motivate, educate and convince the potential donors and the society about the likely benefits of convalescent plasma.

The HSQF requires a large outdoor workforce walking outdoor pathways to provide individual care in the ambient climate. The personal protective equipment (PPE) required for the safety of quarantine workers varies between workgroups and limits body heat dissipation that anecdotally contributes to excessive sweating, which combined with heat stress symptoms of fatigue, headache, and irritability, likely increases the risk of workplace injuries including infection control breaches. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was the description of qualitative and quantitative assessment for HSQF workers exposed to tropical environmental conditions and provision of evidenced-based strategies to mitigate the risk of heat stress in an outdoor quarantine and isolation workforce. METHODS: The study comprised two components - a cross-sectional physiological monitoring study of 18 workers (eight males/ten females; means: 41.4 years; 1.69m; 80.6kg) during a single shift in November 2020 and a subjective heat health survey completed by participants on a minimum of four occasions across the wet season/summer period from November 2020 through February 2021. The physiological monitoring included continuous core temperature monitoring and assessment of fluid balance. RESULTS: The mean apparent temperature across first-half and second-half of the shift was 34.7C (SD = 0.8) and 35.6C (SD = 1.9), respectively. Across the work shift (mean duration 10.1 hours), the mean core temperature of participants was 37.3C (SD = 0.2) with a range of 37.0C - 37.7C. The mean maximal core temperature of participants was 37.7C (SD = 0.3). In the survey, for the workforce in full PPE, 57% reported feeling moderately, severely, or unbearably hot compared to 49% of those in non-contact PPE, and the level of fatigue was reported as moderate to severe in just over 25% of the workforce in both groups. CONCLUSION: Heat stress is a significant risk in outdoor workers in the tropics and is amplified in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) frontline workforce required to wear PPE in outdoor settings. A heat health program aimed at mitigating risk, including workplace education, limiting exposure times, encouraging hydration, buddy system, active cooling, and monitoring, is recommended to limit PPE breaches and other workplace injuries in this workforce.","output":"Heat Health Management in a Quarantine and Isolation Facility in the Tropics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper proposes a comparative analysis of the projection matrices and dictionaries used for compressive sensing (CS) of electrocardiographic signals (ECG), highlighting the compromises between the complexity of preprocessing and the accuracy of reconstruction.

This requires an evaluation of the long-term impact of such a program on the burden of influenza across all age groups, using a transmission model that accounts for the seasonal variability in vaccine effectiveness and the shorter duration of protection following vaccination as compared to natural infection. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a stochastic dynamic transmission model that has been calibrated to reported GP visits with influenza-like illness in the Netherlands over 11 seasons (2003/2004 to 2014/2015). We analyzed the costs and effects of extending the current program with vaccination of children aged 2C16 years at 50% coverage over 20 consecutive seasons. We measured the effects in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and we adopted a societal perspective. RESULTS: The childhood vaccination program is estimated to have an average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 3944 per QALY gained and is cost-effective in the general population (across 1000 simulations; conventional Dutch threshold of 20,000 per QALY gained). The childhood vaccination program is not estimated to be cost-effective for the target-group itself with an average ICER of 57,054 per QALY gained. Uncertainty analyses reveal that these ICERs hide a wide range of outcomes. Even though introduction of a childhood vaccination program decreases the number of infections, it tends to lead to larger epidemics: in 23.3% of 1000 simulations, the childhood vaccination program results in an increase in seasons with a symptomatic attack rate larger than 5%, which is expected to cause serious strain on the health care system. In 6.4% of 1000 simulations, the childhood vaccination program leads to a net loss of QALYs. These findings are robust across different targeted age groups and vaccination coverages. CONCLUSIONS: Modeling indicates that childhood influenza vaccination is cost-effective in the Netherlands. However, childhood influenza vaccination is not cost-effective when only outcomes for the children themselves are considered. In approximately a quarter of the simulations, the introduction of a childhood vaccination program increases the frequency of seasons with a symptomatic attack rate larger than 5%.

Learning success was analyzed using self-evaluation forms and external assessment by an experienced ultrasonographer. Comparing pre- and post-training self-evaluation, all participants showed statistically significant learning progress. In the external assessment, the overall scores in both groups did not differ significantly. The courses themselves were positively evaluated by all participants. Herein, we present the first feasibility study of a web-based head and neck-ultrasound course for medical students. The methodology provides the potential for future changes in telemedical education and sustainable improvements in telemedical teaching and global intra-clinical and interdisciplinary patient care.","output":"AHead Start or a Pain in theNeck?Establishment and Evaluation of a Video-Based Hands-On Head and Neck Ultrasound Course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The lab professionals at one end are at increased risk of contracting the infection while on the other end have to deal with the various challenges during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.

This study aimed to analyze the association between socio-economic conditions and having developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a population-based sample in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland. Methods Data was obtained from a population-based serosurvey of adults in Geneva and their household members, between November and December, 2020, towards the end of the second pandemic wave in the canton. Participants were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Socio-economic conditions representing different dimensions were self-reported. Mixed effects logistic regressions were conducted for each predictor to test its association with seropositive status as the main outcome. Results 2,889 adults completed the study questionnaire and were included in the final analysis. Retired participants and those living in suburban areas had lower odds of a seropositive result when compared to employed participants (OR 0.42, 95% CI - 0.20 - 0.87) and those living in urban areas (OR 0.67, 95% CI - 0.46 - 0.97), respectively. People facing financial hardship for less than a year had higher odds of a seropositive result compared to those who had never faced them (OR 2.23, 95% CI - 1.01 - 4.95).

However, the effect of holding such beliefs is unclear. We therefore propose that these beliefs affect people differently depending on their BMI. When confronted with negative, self-related feedback, peoples coping strategies are often reflected in the ways they relate to their self. We examine three such self-to-self relations (i.e., reassured, inadequate, and hated self). Extending prior research, we predict that weight controllability beliefs are related to positive self-to-self relations for adults with a low, and to negative self-to-self relations for adults with a high BMI. Accordingly, we expected that weight controllability beliefs would be associated with defensive avoidance among people with a high, but not with a low BMI. We tested our hypotheses in a sample of 348 adults who participated in an online survey. Weight controllability beliefs were associated with increased defensive avoidance in people with high BMI, and with decreased defensive avoidance in adults with a low BMI. Forms of self-to-self relating fully mediated this association, demonstrating positive effects on adults with a low, and negative effects on adults with a high BMI. Additionally, in an open ending section, we found seven social settings that deprive people from satisfying their need to belong and to be accepted due to their weight.

However, studies show that thermography suffers from low sensitivity and specificity. To achieve higher screening accuracy, we developed a screening system based on the acquisition of multiple vital-signs. This multimodal approach increases accuracy, but introduces the need for sophisticated classification methods. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the multimodal approach to infection screening from a machine learning perspective. Methods: We conduct an empirical study applying six classification algorithms to measurements from the multimodal screening system and comparing their performance among each other, as well as to the performance of thermography. In addition, we provide an information theoretic view on the use of multiple vital-signs for infection screening. The classification methods are tested using the same clinical data, which has been analyzed in our previous study using linear discriminant analysis. A total of 92 subjects were recruited for influenza screening using the system, consisting of 57 inpatients diagnosed to have seasonal influenza and 35 healthy controls. Results: Our study revealed that the multimodal screening system reduces the misclassification rate by more than 50% compared to thermography. At the same time, none of the multimodal classifiers needed more than 6 ms for classification, which is negligible for practical purposes. Conclusion: Among the tested classifiers k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine and quadratic discriminant analysis achieved the highest cross-validated sensitivity score of 93%.

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of COVID-19 on arrhythmia occurrence. This prospective study included patients with COVID-19 treated at the Leishenshan Temporary Hospital of Wuhan City, China, from February 24 to April 5, 2020. Demographic, comorbidity, and arrhythmias data were collected from patients with COVID-19 (n = 84) and compared with control data from patients with bacterial pneumonia (n = 84) infection. Furthermore, comparisons were made between patients with severe and nonsevere COVID-19 and between older and younger patients. Compared with patients with bacterial pneumonia, those with COVID-19 had higher total, mean, and minimum heart rates (all P < 0.01). Patients with severe COVID-19 (severe and critical type diseases) developed more atrial arrhythmias compared with those with nonsevere symptoms. Plasma creatine kinase isoenzyme (CKMB) levels (P=0.01) were higher in the severe group than in the nonsevere group, and there were more deaths in the severe group than in the nonsevere group (6 (15%) vs. 3 (2.30%); P=0.05). Premature atrial contractions (PAC) and nonsustained atrial tachycardia (NSAT) were significantly positively correlated with plasma CKMB levels but not with high-sensitive cardiac troponin I or myoglobin levels.

Identifying characteristics of possible super spreaders, suggested as a dominant cause of rapid spreading transmission, will help us to design proper prevention strategies. Methods: We conducted a nation-wide online survey to investigate the relationship of perception and anxiety levels about COVID-19 to the possible risk behaviors for spread of the virus in Japan. We recruited a total of 4,000 citizens, who responded to the questionnaire including several questions regarding the level of fear and anxiety about COVID-19, infection preventive behaviors and access to media with trust level about the virus as well as some demographic and socioeconomic data during March 27th and 28th, 2020. Findings: Thirteen-point-three percent of the participants rated 1 on a nine-point Likert with respect to the knowledge about COVID-19. Ten-point-one percent and 11.7% presented no anxiety of being infected and transmission to others. Ten-point-eight percent showed no worry about symptomatic aggravation. Eight-point-one percent had no serious concern about expanding infection. The distribution of these items was highly correlated with each other. Participants with the low level of knowledge about COVID-19 were likely to less frequently access any information sources and neither trust them. They were less anxious about their health status, and less likely to put precautionary behaviors such as washing hands and avoiding crowded spaces, suggested by statistical analyses.

A quality improvement (QI) project that included streamlining the stroke care pathway and simulation-based training was followed by a significant reduction in median door-to-needle time (27 to 13 min) and improved patient outcomes after stroke thrombolysis at our centre. Here, we present a retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis of the QI project. METHODS Costs for implementing and sustaining QI were assessed using recognised frameworks for economic evaluations. Effectiveness was calculated from previously published outcome measures. Cost-effectiveness was presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios including costs per minute door-to-needle time reduction per patient, and costs per averted death in the 13-month post-intervention period. We also estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for a projected 5-year post-intervention period and for varying numbers of patients treated with thrombolysis. Furthermore, we performed a sensitivity analysis including and excluding costs of unpaid time. RESULTS All costs including fixed costs for implementing the QI project totalled US$44 802, while monthly costs were US$2141. We calculated a mean reduction in door-to-needle time of 13.1 min per patient and 6.36 annual averted deaths. Across different scenarios, the estimated costs per minute reduction in door-to-needle time per patient ranged from US$13 to US$29, and the estimated costs per averted death ranged from US$4679 to US$10 543. CONCLUSIONS We have shown that a QI project aiming to improve stroke thrombolysis treatment at our centre can be implemented and sustained at a relatively low cost with increasing cost-effectiveness over time. Our work builds on the emerging theory and practice for economic evaluations in QI projects and simulation-based training.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been found at very high concentrations in swab and sputum samples from such individuals. Objective: To estimate the virus levels released from individuals with asymptomatic to moderate COVID-19 into different aerosol sizes by normal breathing and coughing, and to determine what exposure could result from this in a room shared with such individuals. Design, Setting, and Participants: This mathematical modeling study combined the size-distribution of exhaled breath microdroplets for coughing and normal breathing with viral swab and sputum concentrations as approximation for lung lining liquid to obtain an estimate of emitted virus levels. Viral data were obtained from studies published as of May 20, 2020. The resulting emission data fed a single-compartment model of airborne concentrations in a room of 50 m3, the size of a small office or medical examination room. Main Outcomes and Measures: Modeling was used to estimate the viral load emitted by individuals breathing normally or coughing, and the concentrations expected in the simulated room at different ventilation rates. Results: The mean estimated viral load in microdroplets emitted by simulated individuals while breathing regularly was 0.0000049 copies/cm3, with a range of 0.0000000049 to 0.637 copies/cm3. The corresponding estimates for simulated coughing individuals were a mean of 0.277 copies/cm3 per cough, with a range of 0.000277 to 36 030 copies/cm3 per cough. The estimated concentrations in a room with an individual who was coughing frequently were very high, with a maximum of 7.44 million copies/m3 from an individual who was a high emitter. However, regular breathing from an individual who was a high emitter was modeled to result in lower room concentrations of up to 1248 copies/m3. Conclusions and Relevance: In this modeling study, breathing and coughing were estimated to release large numbers of viruses, ranging from thousands to millions of virus copies per cubic meter in a room with an individual with COVID-19 with a high viral load, depending on ventilation and microdroplet formation process. The estimated infectious risk posed by a person with typical viral load who breathes normally was low. The results suggest that only few people with very high viral load pose an infection risk in poorly ventilated closed environments. These findings suggest that strict respiratory protection may be needed when there is a chance to be in the same small room with an individual, whether symptomatic or not, especially for a prolonged period.","output":"Estimation of Viral Aerosol Emissions From Simulated Individuals With Asymptomatic to Moderate Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus that has caused a worldwide pandemic. It causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (COVID-19), which is fatal in many cases, and is characterized by a cytokine release syndrome (CRS).

Consequently, possible treatments for cytokine-mediated hyperinflammation, preferably within approved safe therapies, are urgently being researched to reduce rising mortality. One approach to inhibit proinflammatory cytokine release is to activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (7nAchR). Nicotine, an exogenous 7nAchR agonist, is clinically used in ulcerative colitis to counteract inflammation.

When observing racial discrimination in healthcare, self-reported incidences, and perceptions among minority groups in the United States suggest that, the most socioeconomically underrepresented groups will suffer disproportionately in COVID-19 due to synergistic mechanisms. This study reports racially-stratified data regarding the experiences and impacts of different groups availing the healthcare system to identify disparities in outcomes of minority and majority groups in the United States. METHODS: Studies were identified utilizing PubMed, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and PsycINFO search engines without date and language restrictions. The following keywords were used: Healthcare, raci*, ethnic*, discriminant, hosti*, harass*, insur*, education, income, psychiat*, COVID-19, incidence, mortality, mechanical ventilation. Statistical analysis was conducted in Review Manager (RevMan V.5.4). Unadjusted Odds Ratios, P-values, and 95% confidence intervals were presented. RESULTS: Discrimination in the United States is evident among racial groups regarding medical care portraying mental risk behaviors as having serious outcomes in the health of minority groups. The perceived health inequity had a low association to the majority group as compared to the minority group (OR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.78; P = .007), and the association of mental health problems to the Caucasian-American majority group was low (OR = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.58; P < .001). CONCLUSION: As the pandemic continues into its next stage, efforts should be taken to address the gaps in clinical training and education, and medical practice to avoid the recurring patterns of racial health disparities that become especially prominent in community health emergencies. A standardized tool to assess racial discrimination and inequity will potentially improve pandemic healthcare delivery.","output":"Understanding and Promoting Racial Diversity in Healthcare Settings to Address Disparities in Pandemic Crisis Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The conjunctiva is one of the most frequently damaged targets for inflammatory responses induced by allergic immunological hypersensitivity reactions Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) typically manifests as a spectrum of potential severity, ranging from mild symptoms to severe troublesome symptoms that might interfere significantly with daily activities and overall quality of life Aim This study aimed to evaluate impact of the quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life of allergic conjunctivitis patients Methodology This is a cross-sectional study conducted among confirmed patients with allergic conjunctivitis in Saudi Arabia from the period of July 2020 to September 2020 An electronic validated structured-questionnaire explored the participants' demography, symptoms, known allergen and risk factors, and patient psychological and functional domains of life using Eye Allergy Patient Impact Questionnaire (EAPIQ) Data were gathered in MS Excel and all statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 21 Results The most common symptoms of AC was itching (79 9%) and redness of the eye (38 8%), while the most common causes was dust (46 9%) and pollens (46 9%) With regards to the assessment of EAPIQ, the mean score was higher in the impact of eye allergy symptoms domain (mean 12 6 +/- 4 84 SD ), while it was lower in the impact of AC on the psychological and emotional domain (mean 10 7 +/- 5 62 SD ) Statistical analysis revealed that previous history of AC and a visit to healthcare provider were the significant factors associated with the increased risk of eye allergy symptoms, troubled daily activities and bothered psychological and emotional life Conclusion This study demonstrated that a patients' eye allergy symptoms affect many aspects of patients' daily activities In addition to affecting functionality, these symptoms also affect patients' emotional state Although the impact of daily activities and emotions due to eye allergy were minimal, the impact of eye allergy symptoms during quarantine period was still found to be moderate We found the severity of AC & its impact over a patients' quality of life was moderate which suggests there was no major effect found on AC severity during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine period Further studies with detailed analysis of triggering factors might lead to a hewer understanding of the disease and its relation to the patients' activities & lifestyle which can directly affect the AC management & quality of life","output":"Impact of Quarantine During COVID-19 Pandemic on the Quality of Life of Patients with Allergic Conjunctivitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana holds great potential for recombinant protein manufacturing due to its advantages in terms of speed and yield compared to stably transformed plants.

Similar to conventional transvenous pacemakers, satisfying pacing values during implantation are targeted for optimal long-term device function. The objective is to investigate the role of a local injury current (IC) in leadless pacemaker implantations. METHOD: The IC, sensing value, capture threshold and impedance were collected in 30 consecutive patients receiving a leadless pacemaker. RESULTS: 39 EGMs were recorded from 30 patients (including 9 device repositions). An IC was detected in 15 cases (38%). At implantation, the presence of an IC was associated with a significantly lower sensing (7.1a?a?3.7a?mV vs 12.0a?a?4.0a?mV; Pa?=a?0.004) and a higher capture threshold (median threshold 1.13a?V at 0.24a?ms [0.50-2.00] vs 0.50a?V at 0.24a?ms [0.25-0.75]; Pa?=a?0.002) and with a 26 fold higher likelihood of device repositioning compared to the absence of an IC (OR 26.3 [2.79-248], Pa?<a?0.001). Patients with an IC in their final implant position had a lower sensing (9.3a?a?4.4a?mV vs 13.6a?a?4.7a?mV at implantation, Pa?=a?0.04), while the initially similar capture threshold was lower after 24a?h in the IC group. After 2a?weeks, all parameters were similar between the two groups.

In this study, we obtained a blood leukocytes sequencing data set of COVID-19 patients from the GEO database and obtained differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We further analyzed these DEGs by protein-protein interaction analysis and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and identified the DEGs closely related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Then, we constructed a six-gene model (comprising IFIT3, OASL, USP18, XAF1, IFI27, and EPSTI1) by logistic regression analysis and calculated the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The AUC values of the training group, testing group, and entire group were 0.930, 0.914, and 0.921, respectively. The six genes were highly expressed in patients with COVID-19 and positively correlated with the expression of SARS-CoV-2 invasion-related genes (ACE2, TMPRSS2, CTSB, and CTSL). The risk score calculated by this model was also positively correlated with the expression of TMPRSS2, CTSB, and CTSL, indicating that the six genes were closely related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, we comprehensively analyzed the functions of DEGs in the blood leukocytes of patients with COVID-19 and constructed a six-gene model that may contribute to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic ideas for COVID-19.

Covariate data retrieved included age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, Helicobacter pylori status (based on clarithromycin-amoxicillin-proton pump inhibitor issued), cumulative proton pump inhibitor issued within 10 years (quartiles (PPI-Q1-4) of daily drug dose), anti-parietal cell antibodies, body mass index and comorbidity index. RESULTS: Of the 14,147 included patients (median age 63.4 years; women 54.4%; Helicobacter pylori-positive 29.0%), 1244 (8.8%) had gastric intestinal metaplasia. Increasing age, Helicobacter pylori infection, smoking, anti-parietal cell antibodies and proton pump inhibitor use were all associated with the diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia. Upper quartiles of cumulative proton pump inhibitor doses (PPI-Q4 and PPI-Q3 vs. PPI-Q1) were associated with the diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia: adjusted odds ratios 1.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.57) and 1.27 (95% CI 1.07-1.52), respectively, for the whole cohort (Ptotal 0.007, Ptrend 0.013), 1.69 (95% CI 1.23-2.33) and 1.40 (95% CI 1.04-1.89), respectively, for Helicobacter pylori-positive patients (Ptotal 0.004, Ptrend 0.005) and 1.21 (95% CI 0.98-1.49) and 1.20 (95% CI 0.96-1.49), respectively, for Helicobacter pylori-negative patients (Ptotal 0.288, Ptrend 0.018).

Two reviewers completed title, abstract, and full-text screening as well as risk of bias assessment (using the Downs and Black checklist), with a third author available to resolve any disagreements. MAIN RESULTS After removing duplicates, 1911 articles were returned. Fifty-eight articles were included in the review and 20 in the meta-analysis. The overall combined rates of concussion (including game and practice-related concussion) based on the meta-analysis were 0.78 concussions/1000 athlete exposures [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-0.89] for high school football (ages 13-19) and 1.15 concussions/1000 athlete exposures (95% CI 0.89-1.41) for minor football players (ages 5-15). There is evidence that contact training and practice contact restrictions have reduced the rate of head impacts and concussion. Heads Up Football (an intervention focused on coach education and contact training) has been shown to reduce the rate of concussion by 32% and head impacts by 38% amongst high school football players. Limiting contact practices in high schools to 2 days per week reduced practice head impacts per player-season by 42%, and limiting full contact in practice to 75 min per week in the second week of the season and 60 min in week 3 and beyond resulted in a 54% decrease in the practice-related concussion rate (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS This review identified a critical need for interventions to address the high rates of concussion and head impact in youth football. To date, contact training and contact restrictions have the strongest evidence supporting their effectiveness at reducing these rates.

Here, we showed that the FMRFamide neuropeptide FLP-20 modulates a systemic starvation response in Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that mutation of flp-20 rescued the starvation hypersensitivity of the G protein ?-subunit gpb-2 mutants by suppressing excessive autophagy. FLP-20 acted in AIB neurons, where the metabotropic glutamate receptor MGL-2 also functions to modulate a systemic starvation response. Furthermore, FLP-20 modulated starvation-induced fat degradation in a manner dependent on the receptor-type guanylate cyclase GCY-28.

By analyzing 106 SARS-CoV-2 and 39 SARS genome sequences, we provided direct genetic evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has a much lower mutation rate than SARS. Minimum Evolution phylogeny analysis revealed the putative original status of SARS-CoV-2 and the early-stage spread history. The discrepant phylogenies for the spike protein and its receptor binding domain proved a previously reported structural rearrangement prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Despite that we found the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is particularly more conserved, we identified a receptor binding domain mutation that leads to weaker ACE2 binding capability based on in silico simulation, which concerns a SARS-CoV-2 sample collected on 27th January 2020 from India. This represents the first report of a significant SARS-CoV-2 mutant, and requires attention from researchers working on vaccine development around the world. Highlights Based on the currently available genome sequence data, we provided direct genetic evidence that the SARS-COV-2 genome has a much lower mutation rate and genetic diversity than SARS during the 2002-2003 outbreak.

Although radiographic examination is accepted as the gold standard for confirming the position of patients' enteral tubes, it is costly, involves risks of radiation, and is not failsafe. Studies using carbon dioxide sensors to detect inadvertent nasogastric tube placements have been conducted in intensive care settings. However, none involved patients in general wards. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to ascertain the diagnostic measure of colorimeter, with radiographic examination as the reference standard, to confirm the location of nasogastric tubes in patients. DESIGN A prospective observational study of a diagnostic test. SETTING This study was conducted in the general wards of an approximately 1100-bed acute care tertiary hospital of an Academic Medical Center in Singapore. PARTICIPANTS Adult patients with nasogastric tubes admitted to the general wards were recruited into the study. METHODS The colorimeter was attached to the nasogastric tube to detect for the presence of carbon dioxide, suggestive of a tracheobronchial placement. The exact location of the nasogastric tube was subsequently confirmed by a radiographic examination. RESULTS A total of 192 tests were undertaken. The colorimeter detected carbon dioxide in 29 tested nasogastric tubes, of which radiographic examination confirmed that four tubes were located in the tracheobronchial tract. The colorimeter failed to detect carbon dioxide in one nasogastric tube that was located in the tracheobronchial tract, thus, demonstrating a sensitivity of 0.80 [95% CI (0.376, 0.964)]. The colorimeter detected absence of carbon dioxide in 163 tested nasogastric tubes in which radiographic examination confirmed 160 gastrointestinal and one tracheobronchial placements, demonstrating a specificity of 0.865 [95% CI (0.808, 0.907)]. The colorimeter detected one tracheobronchial nasogastric tube placement that the radiographic examination was misinterpreted. CONCLUSION The study found that the use of the colorimeter in the general ward setting was not 100% sensitive or specific in ascertaining the location of a nasogastric tube as previously reported by many studies undertaken in intensive care settings. This is the first study on the use of a colorimeter to confirm the placement of a nasogastric tube in adult patients in the general ward setting.

Forty-eight COVID-19 patients were randomly assigned into nanocurcumin (n = 24) and placebo (n = 24) groups receiving 160 mg/day nanocurcumin or placebo capsules for 6 days. Mean differences of O2 saturation were significantly higher in patients who received nanocurcumin supplements (p = 0.02).

Attitudes of midwives about participation in a vaccine clinical trial have been little explored. Methods: We conducted an anonymous survey from the 11th of September to the 11th of November 2020. Primary endpoint was the willingness to encourage pregnant women to participate in a hypothetical respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine clinical trial. Results: Among 398 midwives who answered the questionnaire, 113 (28.3 %) were likely to encourage pregnant women to participate in the vaccine clinical trial, this proportion ranged from 25 % in senior midwives to 34.5 % among the students. After adjustment on age, parenthood, previous vaccine hesitancy attitudes, and the 5 components of the 5C model, the only predictor of the promotion of the clinical trial was the training score with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.09 (1.01-1.18, p=0.027) for a one-point increase. Vaccine hesitancy and psychological antecedents of vaccinations were not associated with a lower promotion of pregnant women trial participation among midwives. Conclusion: Few respondents were likely to encourage pregnant women to participate in a vaccine clinical trial.

Todays, caregiving to patients with cancer is shifting towards home based care, and home care needs from a caregiver's perspective can help improve the patient care. This qualitative study aimed to examine the home care needs of cancer patients from the perspective of home care nurses. METHODS This is a qualitative descriptive study carried out at home care centers in the northwest of Iran. A total of 15 participants were recruited through purposive sampling and underwent face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Data were analyzed through Conventional content analysis method in MAXQDA software. Measures of trustworthiness were established throughout the study using Lincoln and Guba's (1985) criteria (dependability, credibility, transferability, and confirmability). RESULTS Data analysis resulted in the extraction of four main categories including physical needs (pain relief, gastrointestinal problems including nausea and anorexia and nutritional problems, lethargy, wound care), psychological support (need for hope and emotional support), educational needs (need for information and self-care) and financial support (service insurance coverage, charity support). To promote these patients home care, insurance coverage of nursing home care services was emphasized by the participants.

It particularly focuses on students feedback, detecting advantages, disadvantages, and recommendations when teaching in this manner. The main research objective was to (1) discover how students assess their learning in online distance courses, (2) consider the collected experience and opinions, and (3) reflect them into recommendations for further teacher and learner training in how to exploit online distance instruction efficiently. First, the process of online distance instruction in the Czech Republic was described and requirements were set which should be applied when designing and conducting online distance courses. Then, feedback from 272 respondents, students of upper secondary and higher education institutions, was collected. Students reflected on 64 courses which received positive or negative assessment. Advantages, disadvantages, and recommendations detected in both groups of courses were thought. Respondents experience and opinions were monitored via a questionnaire consisting of eight open-answer items. Finally, the process of online distance learning was considered from the view of the collected data. Results proved that, as expected, even deeper teacher training is required. Main problems were detected in (1) the low level of teacher competency in this field in general, (2) time management, and (3) lack of technical support to learners. However, the fact that the necessity of learners competency in online distance learning must be also developed was mentioned by a few respondents. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Students Reflection on Online Distance Learning: Advantages, Disadvantages, Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: A lapse (any smoking) early in a smoking cessation attempt is strongly associated with reduced success. A substantial proportion of lapses are due to urges to smoke triggered by situational cues. Currently, no available interventions proactively respond to such cues in real time. Quit Sense is a theory-guided just-in-time adaptive intervention smartphone app that uses a learning tool and smartphone sensing to provide in-the-moment tailored support to help smokers manage cue-induced urges to smoke. The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to assess the feasibility of delivering a definitive online efficacy trial of Quit Sense. METHODS AND ANALYSES: A two-arm parallel-group RCT allocating smokers willing to make a quit attempt, recruited via online adverts, to usual care (referral to the NHS SmokeFree website) or usual care plus Quit Sense. Randomisation will be stratified by smoking rate (<16 vs &#8805;16 cigarettes/day) and socioeconomic status (low vs high). Recruitment, enrolment, baseline data collection, allocation and intervention delivery will be automated through the study website. Outcomes will be collected at 6 weeks and 6 months follow-up via the study website or telephone, and during app usage. The study aims to recruit 200 smokers to estimate key feasibility outcomes, the preliminary impact of Quit Sense and potential cost-effectiveness, in addition to gaining insights on user views of the app through qualitative interviews.

By 2020, COPD will be the third leading cause of death and the fifth leading cause of disability. It is C along with chronic congestive heart failure C one of the most common causes of unscheduled hospital readmissions, and as such it represents a significant economic burden for the health-care system. Exacerbations of COPD are important events in the natural history of this prevalent condition. DISCUSSION: This review provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art look at prevention and management of COPD exacerbations. Treatment of these episodes has to be tailored to the severity of the clinical presentation. We now have a wide range of therapeutic available options, based on the results of clinical trials. Management of the acute event should include the necessary measures (mainly the administration of inhaled short-acting bronchodilators, inhaled or oral corticosteroids, and antibiotics), with or without oxygen and ventilator support. CONCLUSIONS: To improve the management of COPD exacerbations, the focus of care must be shifted from the episodic acute complications to their systematic prevention. The management of COPD, which is often associated with multiple co-morbidities, is complex and requires a tailored, multifaceted and multidisciplinary approach. Integrated care for COPD also requires that patients be informed about their condition, that they participate actively in their care, and that they have easy access to the necessary health-care services.","output":"Il percorso diagnostico-assistenziale della broncopneumopatia cronica ostruttiva riacutizzata in Medicina Interna"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study aimed to determine the COVID-19 fear pattern, the common Enneagram pattern in Yemeni society, and the relationship between COVID-19 fear and Enneagram patterns.

Several variants of concern (VOC) have been proffered to be associated with breakthrough infections following immunization. In this study, we investigated 378 breakthrough infections recorded between January and July 2021 and compared the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes identified in 225 fully vaccinated individuals to the frequency of circulating community lineages in the region of South Limburg (The Netherlands) in a week-by-week comparison. Although the proportion of breakthrough infections was relatively low and stable when the Alpha variant was predominant, the rapid emergence of the Delta variant lead to a strong increase in breakthrough infections, with a higher relative proportion of individuals vaccinated with Oxford-AstraZeneca or J&J/Janssen being infected compared to those immunized with mRNA-based vaccines. A significant difference in median age was observed when comparing fully vaccinated individuals with severe symptoms (83 years) to asymptomatic cases (46.5 years) or individuals with mild-to-moderate symptoms (42 years). There was no association between SARS-CoV-2 genotype or vaccine type and disease symptoms. Interestingly, symptomatic individuals harbored significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 loads than asymptomatic vaccinated individuals and breakthrough infections caused by the Delta variant are associated with increased viral loads compared to those caused by the Alpha variant. Altogether, these results indicate that the emergence of the Delta variant might have lowered the efficiency of particular vaccine types to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections and that, although rare, the elderly are particularly at risk of becoming severely infected as the consequence of a breakthrough infection.","output":"Investigating SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections per variant and vaccine type"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect of COVID-19 on biomedical publishing (BP) (i.e. scientific biomedical periodicals continuously published by research communities or commercial publishers) has not been deeply explored.

This has been related to the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) as animal studies indicate that these medications increase levels of ACE2, the cellular entry point for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. This has prompted clinicians to recommend discontinuing ACEIs and ARBs. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of ACEIs or ARBs treatment on serum levels of ACE2 and other key enzymes in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A single center population-based study of 5457 Icelanders from the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility Reykjavik Study (AGES-RS) of the elderly (mean age 756 years) stratified by ACEIs (N = 699) or ARBs (N = 753) treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The AGES-RS study population was stratified by ACEIs and ARBs medication use and compared for age, body mass index (BMI) (kg/m(2)), hypertension and type 2 diabetes (T2D) as well as serum levels of renin, ACE and ACE2. RESULTS: While renin and ACE levels were significantly raised in serum of individuals on ACEIs or ARBs treatments, the ACE2 levels remained unaffected. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Treatment with ACEIs or ARBs does not raise ACE2 levels in serum.

Therapeutic agents are needed to prevent or treat COVID-19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Infection of human cells by SARS-CoV-2 involves binding of the virus spike protein subunit 1 (S1) to the human cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Like antibodies, small molecules have the potential to block the interaction of the viral S1 protein with human ACE2 and prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, a MagMASS assay was developed for the discovery of ligands to the S1 protein. Unlike previous MagMASS approaches, this new assay used robotics for 5-fold enhancement of throughput and sensitivity. The assay was validated using the SBP-1 peptide, which is identical to the ACE2 amino acid sequence recognized by the S1 protein, and then applied to the discovery of natural ligands from botanical extracts. Small molecule ligands to the S1 protein were discovered in extracts of the licorice species, Glycyrrhiza inflata.

As oncology practices adapt to a contracted health care system, expertise gained from partnerships in low-resource settings can be used for guidance. This article provides a primer on priority setting in oncology and ethical guidance based on lessons learned from experience with cancer care priority setting in low-resource settings. Observations Lessons learned from real-world experiences are myriad. First, in the setting of limited resources, a utilitarian approach to maximizing survival benefit should guide decision-making. Second, conflicting principles will often arise among stakeholders and decision makers. Third, fair decision-making procedures should be established to ensure moral legitimacy and accountability. Fourth, proactive safeguards must be implemented to protect vulnerable individuals, or disparities in cancer treatment and outcomes will only widen further. Fifth, communication with patients and families about priority setting decisions should be intentional and standardized. Sixth, moral distress among clinicians must be addressed to avoid burnout during a time when resilience is critical. Conclusions and Relevance Although the need to triage cancer care may be new to those who underwent training and now practice oncology in high-resource settings, it is familiar for those who practice in low- and middle-income countries.

The majority of respondents show low intention for immediate vaccination, and many of them want to delay their vaccination. Further analysis shows that their time preference is shaped more by respondent characteristics than vaccine attributes. In particular, confidence in the vaccine, trust in government, and working in high-risk professions are associated with earlier timing for vaccine uptake.

An optimized ratio of isovanillin, harmine, and curcumin has shown preclinical evidence of in-vitro and in-vivo activity with evidence of super enhancer modulation providing rationale for clinical study. Methods: Phase I, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, safety, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic study of GZ17-6.02 given orally on a daily x 28 day of schedule in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma. The dose escalation followed a standard 3+3 design. Thirty-six patients have accrued to the study, 24 in the dose escalation phase and 12 in the dose expansion phase at the recommended phase two dose (RP2D) of 375mg bid. Results: GZ17-6.02 has demonstrated to be generally well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. Grade 3/4 transaminitis was observed in 6 out of 32 evaluable patients and was the dose limiting toxicity. Transaminitis was readily reversible upon discontinuation, no elevations of bilirubin were observed and 3 of the 6 cases of elevated transaminitis occurred above the RP2D. Grade 3/4 dizziness was observed in one patient. Two patients contracted COVID-19 while on study, though no dose interruptions or modifications were necessary.

A broad variety of commercial and in-house serological assays are available to cater to different laboratory requirements; however direct comparison is necessary to understand utility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigate the performance of six serological methods against SARS-CoV-2 to determine the antibody profile of 250 serum samples, including 234 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, the majority with asymptomatic presentation (87.2%) at 1C51 days post laboratory diagnosis. First, we compare to the performance of two in-house antibody assays: (i) an in-house IgG ELISA, utilizing UV-inactivated virus, and (ii) a live-virus neutralization assay (PRNT) using the same Cambodian isolate as the ELISA. In-house assays are then compared to standardized commercial anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescence immunoassays (Elecsys ECLIAs, Roche Diagnostics; targeting anti-N and anti-S antibodies) along with a flow cytometry based assay (FACS) that measures IgM and IgG against spike (S) protein and a multiplex microsphere-based immunoassay (MIA) determining the antibodies against various spike and nucleoprotein (N) antigens of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, hCoVs 229E, NL63, HKU1). RESULTS: Overall, specificity of assays was 100%, except for the anti-S IgM flow cytometry based assay (96.2%), and the in-house IgG ELISA (94.2%). Sensitivity ranged from 97.3% for the anti-S ECLIA down to 76.3% for the anti-S IgG flow cytometry based assay. PRNT and in-house IgG ELISA performed similarly well when compared to the commercial ECLIA: sensitivity of ELISA and PRNT was 94.7 and 91.1%, respectively, compared to S- and N-targeting ECLIA with 97.3 and 96.8%, respectively.

The COVID-19 pandemic urged us to reorganize many of our daily clinical processes. In this regard, the protection of vulnerable patient populations is of particular importance, since any visit to the outpatient clinic implies the risk of exposure to and infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Nevertheless, patients with a pacemaker, an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) or an implantable cardiac monitor need regular follow-up to assure proper functionality of these devices. Remote monitoring is the ideal solution to meet the requirements of patient protection and device safety during pandemics. Besides, remote monitoring has already proved its value in normal times.

Tranexamic acid, a widely available antifibrinolytic agent with an excellent safety profile, may reduce haematoma growth. METHODS AND DESIGN: Stopping intracerebral haemorrhage with tranexamic acid for hyperacute onset presentation including mobile stroke units (STOP-MSU) is a phase II double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre, international investigator-led clinical trial, conducted within the estimand statistical framework. HYPOTHESIS: In patients with spontaneous ICH, treatment with tranexamic acid within 2 hours of onset will reduce haematoma expansion compared with placebo. SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATES: A sample size of 180 patients (90 in each arm) would be required to detect an absolute difference in the primary outcome of 20% (placebo 39% vs treatment 19%) under a two-tailed significance level of 0.05. An adaptive sample size re-estimation based on the outcomes of 144 patients will allow a possible increase to a prespecified maximum of 326 patients. INTERVENTION: Participants will receive 1 g intravenous tranexamic acid over 10 min, followed by 1 g intravenous tranexamic acid over 8 hours; or matching placebo. PRIMARY EFFICACY MEASURE: The primary efficacy measure is the proportion of patients with haematoma growth by 246 hours, defined as either 33% relative increase or 6 mL absolute increase in haematoma volume between baseline and follow-up CT scan. DISCUSSION: We describe the rationale and protocol of STOP-MSU, a phase II trial of tranexamic acid in patients with ICH within 2 hours from onset, based in participating mobile stroke units and emergency departments.","output":"Tranexamic acid for intracerebral haemorrhage within 2 hours of onset: protocol of a phase II randomised placebo-controlled double-blind multicentre trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes significant economic losses in swine industry. Current studies on TGEV internalization mainly focus on viral receptors, but the internalization mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we used single-virus tracking to obtain the detailed insights into the dynamic events of the TGEV internalization and depict the whole sequential process. We observed that TGEVs could be internalized through clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and the internalization of TGEVs was almost completed within ~2 minutes after TGEVs attached to the cell membrane. Furthermore, the interactions of TGEVs with actin and dynamin 2 in real time during the TGEV internalization were visualized. To our knowledge, this is the first report that single-virus tracking technique is used to visualize the entire dynamic process of the TGEV internalization: before the TGEV internalization, with the assistance of actin, clathrin, and caveolin 1 would gather around the virus to form the vesicle containing the TGEV, and after ~60 seconds, dynamin 2 would be recruited to promote membrane fission.

During the initial few months of the year 2021, Colombia had experienced a surge in positive cases. In this study we aim to evaluate the effect of vaccination on the incidence of new positive cases in HCWs. Design We present a retrospective cohort study of frontline employees at a network of clinics in Colombia prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination from February to March 2021. Results Our findings are consistent with recent reports. During early 2020, in Colombia the number of health care workers positively diagnosed with COVID-19 were higher than the general population. With the start of the national vaccination program, the incidence decreased despite the similar trend in the general population since April 2021. We identified lower infection rates in HCWs during April (odds ratio [OR], 0.72 [95% CI, 0.58-0.90]; P <.01) and May 2021 (odds ratio [OR], 0.25 [95% CI, 0.18-0.36]; P <.01. Conclusions COVID-19 vaccination rollout in Colombia during early 2021 led to a decrease in the incidence of new positive cases among health care workers in contrast to continuous surge in the general population.

The thousands of patients who died showed pneumonia and alveolar damage, but actually, according to several authors in addition to the acute respiratory distress syndrome the virus can give rise to multiorgan failure. In fact, many people died equally despite being intubated and treated for respiratory failure. In this review, we especially wanted to describe the virus effects on the cardiovascular system, probably the leading cause of death of thousands of deceased patients. Therefore, mortality is indirectly induced by the virus through vascular inflammation and cardiovascular damage and patients with severe COVID-19 infection showed significantly increased levels of cardiac troponin I and inflammatory cytokines. The main activation of the signal pathways for the production of inflammatory cytokines are the toll-like receptors that recognize the presence of viral nucleic acids and the ACE-2 receptors, that the virus uses to infect the cells. The binding to ACE-2 also allows to promote high levels of angiotensin II by promoting high levels of blood pressure. High levels of IL-6, IL-1B and IL-8 have been associated with plaque instability and increased thrombotic risk. Furthermore IL-6 is involved in the stimulation of matrix-degrading enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases, and may contribute to the development of acute coronary syndrome. In addition, TNF-&#945;, IL-1 and IL-6 present in patients with severe COVID-19 are associated with coagulation activation and thrombin generation resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation or thrombotic microangiopathy. Considering these pathological effects of the virus, anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant treatments are to be considered to avoid cardiovascular events. In this regard, heparin, in addition to its anticoagulant characteristics, has been shown to have good control over inflammation and to be a good anti-viral drug.","output":"Cardiovascular risk in COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Surgical resection is usually considered as the first-line curative strategy for low-grade (Spetzler-Martin grade I-II) brain arteriovenous malformations because it has a high cure rate and low complications. The role of endovascular treatment remains to be clarified in this indication, especially after A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations. Our objective was to assess the safety and efficacy of first-line endovascular treatment in low-grade brain arteriovenous malformation management at our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with low-grade brain arteriovenous malformations treated primarily with embolization in our department between January 2005 and December 2015 were retrieved from our prospectively collected registry. The primary outcome was the brain arteriovenous malformation obliteration rate, and secondary outcomes were disability or death secondary to brain arteriovenous malformation embolization assessed through modification of the modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS Two hundred twenty-four patients completed endovascular treatment during the study period and represent our study population. Complete exclusion of brain arteriovenous malformations was achieved in 205 patients (92%), including 62.1% of brain arteriovenous malformation exclusions after a single endovascular treatment session. One patient died of a hemorrhagic complication after endovascular treatment, leading to a mortality rate of 0.4%. Twelve patients (5%) kept a permanent neurologic deficit secondary to a complication of the endovascular treatment. An overall good outcome (mRS 0-2) was reported in 179 patients (80%).

However, research on the antecedents, consequences, and buffers of work loneliness is scarce. Integrating research on need for belonging, regulatory loop models of loneliness, and self-compassion, the current study addresses this critical issue by developing and testing a conceptual model that highlights how COVID-related stressors frustrate employees' need for belonging (i.e., telecommuting frequency, job insecurity, and a lack of COVID-related informational justice), negatively impacting worker well-being (i.e., depression) and helping behaviors [i.e., organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)] through work loneliness. Furthermore, we examine the buffering role of self-compassion in this process. Results from a weekly diary study of U.S. employees conducted over 2 months during the initial stage of the pandemic provide support for the mediating role of work loneliness in relations between all three proposed antecedents and both outcomes. In addition, self-compassion mitigated the positive within-person relationship between work loneliness and employee depression, indicating that more self-compassionate employees were better able to cope with their feelings of work loneliness. Although self-compassion also moderated the within-person relationship between work loneliness and OCB, this interaction was different in form from our prediction.

DESIGN: COVID-19 hospital patients were admitted in the Zhejiang province from 17 January 2020 to 8 February 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management and outcome data of patients with GI symptoms were analysed using multivariate analysis for risk of severe/critical type. Bioinformatics were used to analyse features of SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province. RESULTS: Among enrolled 651 patients, 74 (11.4%) presented with at least one GI symptom (nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea), average age of 46.14 years, 4-day incubation period and 10.8% had pre-existing liver disease. Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 17 (22.97%) and 23 (31.08%) had severe/critical types and family clustering, respectively, significantly higher than those without GI symptoms, 47 (8.14%) and 118 (20.45%). Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 29 (39.19%), 23 (31.08%), 8 (10.81%) and 16 (21.62%) had significantly higher rates of fever >38.5C, fatigue, shortness of breath and headache, respectively.

The policy review demonstrates that the Chinese policy framework contains a few redistributive initiatives, for example, cash transfer programs, and free distribution of information and communications technology (ICT). These have the potential to increase the uptake of ICT among persons with disabilities. The Chinese policy framework also includes provisions to ensure consultation with individual persons with disabilities and DPOs in the deliberation and implementation of ICT accessibility policies. While China has initiated awareness-raising campaigns among market actors about the importance of digital inclusion, so far, the Chinese government has adopted little legal regulation of the market to foster accessibility to ICT. The article thus argues that some of the limitations may be due to the way state-market relations have developed since the economy opened up in 1978. Apart from the growing benefits of several cash transfer programs, we have not seen major changes or adjustments to the current policy framework during the efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on digital inclusion.","output":"Digital Inclusion for Persons with Disabilities in China under Covid-19: How Far Has China Come?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nutrients and their potential benefits are a new field of study in modern medicine for their positive impact on health. Curcumin, the yellow polyphenolic compound extracted from Curcuma longa species, is widely used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine to prevent and contrast many diseases, considering its antioxidant, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, cardio-protective, nephron-protective, hepato-protective, anti-neoplastic, and anti-rheumatic proprieties. In recent years, the investigations of curcumin have been focused on its application to aging and age-associated diseases. Aging is a physiological process in which there is a decreasing of cellular function due to internal or external stimuli. Oxidative stress is one of the most important causes of aging and age-related diseases. Moreover, many age-related disorders such as cancer, neuroinflammation, and infections are due to a low-grade chronic systemic inflammation. Curcumin acting on different proteins is able to contrast both oxidative stress than inflammation. In the brain, curcumin is able to modulate inflammation induced by microglia. Finally in brain tumors curcumin is able to reduce tumor growth by inhibition of telomerase activity. This review emphasizes the anti-aging role of curcumin focusing on its mechanism to counteract aging in the brain. Moreover, new formulations to increase the bioavailability of curcumin are discussed.","output":"Curcumin as Prospective Anti-Aging Natural Compound: Focus on Brain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Otolaryngologists are at increased risk for exposure to suspected aerosol-generating procedures during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

We used an optical particle sizer to quantify the number of 1- to 10-m particles observed per 30-second period (PP30). No significant aerosols were observed with ventilation of intubated specimens (10.8  2.4 PP30 vs background 9.5  2.1, P = 1.0000). Simulated coughing through a tracheostomy produced 53.5  25.2 PP30, significantly more than background (P = .0121) and ventilation of an intubated specimen (P = .0401). These data suggest that undisturbed ventilation and thus intubation without stimulation or coughing may be safer than believed. Coughing increases aerosol production, particularly via tracheostomy.

Patients and Methods Patients evaluated at the Mild-to-Moderate COVID-19 Outpatient clinics (MMCOs) of San Raffaele University Hospital and Luigi Sacco University Hospital in Milan, Italy, from 1 October 2020 to 31 October 2021 were included. Patients were referred by general practitioners (GPs), Emergency Department (ED) physicians or hospital specialists (HS) in case of moderate COVID-19. A classification and regression tree (CART) model predicting ED referral by MMCO physicians was developed to aid GPs identify those deserving immediate ED admission. Cost-effectiveness analysis was also performed. Results A total of 660 patients were included. The majority (70%) was referred by GPs, 21% by the ED and 9% by HS. Patients referred by GPs had more severe disease as assessed by peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and interstitial involvement at lung ultrasound. Among them, 18% were addressed to the ED following MMCO assessment. CART analysis identified three independent predictors, namely home-measured SpO2, age and body mass index (BMI), that robustly divide patients into risk groups of COVID-19 severity. Home-measured SpO2 < 95% and BMI  33 Kg/m2 defined the high-risk group. The model yielded an accuracy (95% CI) of 83 (77C88)%.

The data collection protocol consisted on a Google forms questionnaire included two parts: the first with current data (isolation period) and a second with pre-isolation period data. Differences between the pre-isolation and isolation period were calculated using the related paired T-tests. When statistically significant differences were found, the effect size was estimated using the Cohen's d index (d). The reduction in physical activity levels during confinement were related to the increase in total number of minutes of screen consumption from 433.49 min to 623.97 min per day (d = 0.67; 44.01%). The CISS scores were increased by more than 43% during confinement. The increase in convergence insufficiency was 100% after the studied isolation period of 25 days. The 92.19% increase in television use during 25 days of confinement is not responsible for the increase in convergence insufficiency. However, due to the increase in the use of PCs in this period, there is a notable increase in convergence insufficiency.

The global clinical trials in outpatients documented several adverse effects (AE), which mandate caution in Japan where part of patients return home. To investigate post-infusion clinical events and their risk factors, we attempted a retrospective study. MAIN BODY: Subjects were a consecutive series of inpatients with COVID-19 undergoing an infusion of casirivimab-imdevimab in our institute. The criteria for administration were in accordance with previous clinical trials, e.g., exclusion of patients necessitating oxygen supply. In Japan, however, SARS-CoV-2 vaccinees were eligible. Methods were review of background factors of status, imaging, and laboratory findings for the outcome of post-infusion events such as temperature increase (Temp+), pulse oximetry below 94%, and other events. Also, we documented the drug efficacy. Of a total of 96 patients with a median follow-up of 54 days, one (1.0%) died who alone was an exception demanding oxygen supply. Other 95 patients (99.0%) recovered from fever and hypoxia by Day 4 and later had no worsening of COVID-19. Median increase of body temperature was 1.0 degrees Celsius, which was used for computation of Temp+. Multivariate analysis showed that for Temp+ (n = 47), white blood cell counts more than 4.3  10(3)/microliter (Odds Ratio [OR] 2.593, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.060C6.338, P = 0.037) was at risk, whereas 2-time vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 (OR 0.128, 95% CI 0.026C0.636, P = 0.012) was a preventing factor. Likewise for lowered oximetry (n = 21), CT showing bilateral ground glass attenuation (OR 5.544, CI 1.599C19.228, P = 0.007) was a significant risk factor. Two patients (2.1%) showed bradycardia (asymptomatic, intervention not indicated) on Day 3 and recovery on Day 5. Limitations for this study included the difficulty distinguishing AE from worsening of COVID-19, thus we documented as clinical events. CONCLUSIONS: For 24 h after infusion of casirivimab-imdevimab, COVID-19 patients with increased white blood cell counts may be predisposed to temperature elevation more than 1.0 degrees centigrade, as may bilateral ground glass opacity to lowered oximetry. Thus, patients with leukocytosis and bilateral ground glass attenuation may need precaution for transient fever and hypoxia, respectively.","output":"Casirivimab-imdevimab neutralizing SARS-CoV-2: post-infusion clinical events and their risk factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Metabolic reprogramming is a common hallmark of tumor cells and is a crucial mediator of resistance toward anticancer therapies.

METHODS A systematic review of studies published in English in six databases (CINAHL, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, HaPI, and Cochrane) prior to April 2018 was undertaken using the PROSPERO protocol and PRISMA guidelines. Included studies were those reporting the psychometric properties of brief (15 items) tools that measure dietary, activity, or sleep-related behaviours, alone or in combination, in children birth to 4.9 years of age. RESULTS The search identified 11 379 papers, 200 full-text articles were screened for eligibility, and 12 met the inclusion criteria. Three studies measured two behavioural domains, while most assessed a single behaviour (three diet, five physical activity, one sleep, and none sedentary behaviour). Only two (one diet, one sleep) focused on the under 2 age group. Few studies assessed reliability, and validity and findings were mixed.

Western blot and real-time PCR were applied to detect the gene expression of LIMD2 in OC cell lines. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, transwell, wound healing assays, and tumor xenograft experiments were used to evaluate the function of LIMD2 in vitro and vivo. Further, the LIMD2-associated pathways in OC were predicted by RNA-seq analysis, and the involvement of the corresponding cell signaling activities were confirmed by Western blot. We found that LIMD2 was high expressed in OC. Additionally, we found that silencing of LIMD2 inhibited OC cell proliferation in vitro and reduced the growth of its xenograft tumors. Moreover, knockdown of LIMD2 significantly decreased the migration of OC cells. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that pathways regulating extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interactions and focal adhesion signaling, were deregulated by LIMD2.

To address this, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) developed the Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Mitigation (STORM)a provider-facing dashboard that utilizes predictive analytics to stratify patients prescribed opioids based on risk for overdose/suicide. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the case review mandate on serious adverse events (SAEs) and all-cause mortality among high-risk Veterans. DESIGN: A 23-month stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial in all 140 VHA medical centers between 2018 and 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 44,042 patients actively prescribed opioid analgesics with high STORM risk scores (i.e., percentiles 1% to 5%) for an overdose or suicide-related event. INTERVENTION: A mandate requiring providers to perform case reviews on opioid analgesic-prescribed patients at high risk of overdose/suicide. MAIN MEASURES: Nine serious adverse events (SAEs), case review completion, number of risk mitigation strategies, and all-cause mortality. KEY RESULTS: Mandated review inclusion was associated with a significant decrease in all-cause mortality within 4 months of inclusion (OR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.65C0.94). There was no detectable effect on SAEs. Stepped-wedge analyses found that mandated review patients were five times more likely to receive a case review than non-mandated patients with similar risk (OR: 5.1; 95% CI: 3.64C7.23) and received more risk mitigation strategies than non-mandated patients (0.498; CI: 0.39C0.61). CONCLUSIONS: Among VHA patients prescribed opioid analgesics, identifying high risk patients and mandating they receive an interdisciplinary case review was associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality.

While taste perception in the laboratory has been widely studied, it has rarely been taken into account when exploring dietary patterns in a population. The aim of this work is to identify consumers taste perceptions for a list of commonly consumed foods.MethodsThe National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) rolling programme year 9 (2016/17) was used to generate a list of foods consumed by adolescents (10C19 years old). 1748 different foods were grouped by food group, and sugar/salt contents into seven main and 23 subgroups. A pilot test was conducted to identify foods with high taste agreement to further limit the list. The shortened food list was included in an online food-taste classification survey which was distributed to Facebook groups and Twitter. Participants were asked to allocate one main taste of the five basic tastes (sweet, salty, sour, bitter or savoury/umami) to each food. Additionally, neutral and never tried options were provided. To minimize participant burden, the food list was divided into three and participants were asked to complete one part with an option to voluntarily complete the rest. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to allocate foods into taste clusters. Number of clusters was determined based on the elbow method. Cluster linkage method used was based on a dendrogram and cophenetic correlation coefficient (CPCC).ResultsThe pilot questionnaire was completed by 19 participants. 15/19 rated 55 foods as the same taste and these were removed from the final questionnaire. The final food list contained 184 items. The main online questionnaire obtained 209 responses from 162 females, 44 males, (3 not known). The age range was from 18C70+ years with the majority between 40C59 years old. Seven reported having had COVID-19, but only three were tested positive (none experienced a taste loss). Cluster analysis classified foods into 6 taste clusters using the Average weighted linkage (CPCC=71%). Foods were classified as 21% sweet, 9% salty, 9% sour, 13% bitter, 18% savoury, and 29% neutral. These tastes have been applied to all the foods consumed by adolescents reported in the NDNS to generate taste patterns allowing us to explore links with diet and nutritional quality and anthropometry.ConclusionWe have characterised basic tastes for foods reported in the NDNS. This will allow us to create a UK food-taste database to explore dietary-taste patterns in the NDNS.","output":"Taste classification of foods consumed in the national diet and nutrition survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus infection disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been linked to the development of various autoimmune disorders.

To avoid non specific modification of CR2 and the potential for modifying lysine residues critical to the CR2/C3d contact surface, we engineered a new protein, recombinant CR2 (rCR2), to include the C-terminal sequence VFPLECHHHHHH, a hexahistidine tag (for site-specific radiolabeling with [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)(OH(2))(3)](+)). The protein was characterized by N-terminal sequencing, SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. To test the function of the recombinant CR2, binding to C3d was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The function was further confirmed by binding of rCR2 to C3d(+) red blood cells (RBC) which were generated by deposition of human or rat C3d and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The affinity of rCR2 for C3d(+), in presence of 150 mM NaCl, was measured using surface plasma resonance giving rise to a K(D)500 nM. Radiolabeling of rCR2 or an inactive mutant of rCR2 (K41E CR2) or an unrelated protein of a similar size (C2A) with [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)(OH(2))(3)](+) at gave radiochemical yields >95%.

BACKGROUND: The spread of COVID-19 pandemic made it necessary to apply infection prevention and control measures, including interpersonal distancing and the use of personal protective equipment. These measures may impact communication and relationship between nurses, patients and caregivers especially in a complex environment, such as a paediatric setting. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study design was adopted. Reporting followed the COREQ guidelines. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted in two wards of a maternal and child health hospital in north-east Italy. Data were collected between September and November 2020. Transcripts were analysed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: Seventeen caregivers and 17 nurses were recruited using convenience sampling. Three themes were identified, namely: \\"Impact on a trustworthy relationship\\"; \\"Impact on common communication resources\\"; and \\"Strategies to overcome barriers\\". Participants agreed Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures impacted key elements of family-centred and compassionate care. Communication strategies and play were critical to overcoming the barriers encountered. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 containment measures impact communication and family-centred care in paediatric hospital settings. There is a need for stakeholders to consider family needs in interventions aimed at controlling pandemics' impact. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: While COVID-19 pandemic urgency intensified the use of PPE and social distancing, strategies to overcome issues related to family-centred care should be considered in those wards such as oncology or infectious disease paediatric departments where these measures are continuously adopted.

Methods: Eligible individuals were diagnosed between 15-39 years of age, currently age 18, and recruited through the Huntsman-Intermountain Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Care Program. We sent the survey to N=709. Survey questions included demographics, employment, and the 11-item COmprehensive Score for financial Toxicity (COST) which captures financial toxicity in the last four weeks. COST is scored from 0 to 44 with lower scores indicating greater financial toxicity. Scores were dichotomized as high (0-21) or low (22-44). Changes in employment since March 2020 were categorized as no change, increase in hours, and decrease in hours/lost job. We calculated descriptive statistics and fit a multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between employment change and financial toxicity controlling for current age, gender, and treatment status. Results: Of 280 respondents (39.5% participation), 198 (70.7%) were employed prior to the pandemic and were thus included in analyses. Employed individuals were a mean of 29.4 years of age (range 18-58), 64.3% were female, and 50.5% had received cancer treatment since March 2020. Nearly a third (31.3%) had lost their job or reported reduced hours;50.3% reported high financial toxicity. Among those previously employed, participants who lost their job or had their hours reduced had nearly six times the odds of high financial toxicity than those who reported no change in hours (Odds Ratio [OR]=5.8, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 2.6-12.9). In the same model, the odds of reporting high financial toxicity was over twice as high among females than males (OR=2.3, 95% CI: 1.2-4.5). Treatment status and age were not significant. Conclusions: Employment changes during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased financial toxicity among a population already susceptible to high financial hardship. Societal gender inequity appears to be mirrored in participants' financial toxicity during the pandemic. Employment interventions for patients and survivors of AYA cancers who have experienced job loss or reduction in work hours during the pandemic are needed and may particularly benefit females.","output":"Adolescent and young adult cancer patient and survivor employment changes during COVID-19 are associated with financial toxicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The text presented here outlines the scenario of secondary education in Portugal, relating the educational project that has been underway since 2017 with the needs that arose from the COVID-19 pandemic.

We then explored the mechanistic hypothesis that smoking may upregulate ACE2 expression through the upregulation of the androgen pathway. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 upregulation were both correlated to androgen pathway enrichment and the specific upregulation of central pathway regulatory genes.

METHODS: Six pigs (median weight 12 kg, range 9C25 kg) were connected in pairs to a single ventilator using the new device for 6 hours. Both the ventilator and the device were manipulated throughout the experiment according to the needs of each animal. Tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure were individually controlled with the device. Primary and secondary outcome variables were defined to assess ventilation and hemodynamics in all animals throughout the experiment. RESULTS: Median difference in weight between the animals of each pair was 67% (range: 11C108). All animals could be successfully oxygenated and ventilated for 6 hours through manipulation of the ventilator and the DuplicAR? device, despite significant discrepancies in body size and weight. Mean PaCO(2) in arterial blood was 42.1  4.4 mmHg, mean PaO(2) was 162.8  46.8 mmHg, and mean oxygen saturation was 98  1.3%. End-tidal CO(2) values showed no statistically significant difference among subjects of each pair. Mean difference in arterial PaCO(2) measured at the same time in both animals of each pair was 4.8  3 mmHg, reflecting the ability of the device to ventilate each animal according to its particular requirements. Independent management of PEEP was achieved by manipulation of the device controllers. CONCLUSION: It is possible to ventilate two lung-healthy animals with a single ventilator according to each one's needs through manipulation of both the ventilator and the DuplicAR? device. This gives this device the potential to expand local ventilators surge capacity during disasters or pandemics until emergency supplies can be delivered from central stockpiles.","output":"A New Medical Device to Provide Independent Ventilation to Two Subjects Using a Single Ventilator: Evaluation in Lung-Healthy Pigs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increasingly dynamic and volatile market environment has elevated the importance of handling operational risks in supply chain networks. Also, black swan risks are constantly evolving and can strike from almost anywhere, including natural disaster, cyber risk, or viruses. As more companies are outsourcing their logistics to third-party logistics (3PL), at the same time, supply chain risks and uncertainties are also shifted to 3PLs. A 3PL's supply chain network capability to assure continuity can be expressed in terms of resilience, i.e., the ability of sensing and responding to disturbances or threats. Operations research/management science (OR/MS) methods have been widely applied in supply chain management. The objective of this paper is to look into research regarding the development of resilient 3PL supply chain network designs through the utilization of OR/MS methods. After extensive literature review, a so called pro-silience framework is developed aiming at improving resilience from a 3PL perspective maintaining or increasing its competitive advantage during and after major disruptions, yet also maintain competitiveness under normal operating conditions. Additionally, the framework offers insights into topics for future research.","output":"Towards a pro-silience framework: A literature review on quantitative modelling of resilient 3PL supply chain network designs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ethanolic extracts of the dried flower buds of two Caprifoliaceae plants, Lonicera japonica and Abelia  grandiflora, showed considerable inhibitory activities against adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-citrate lyase (ACL), a new promising drug target for the treatment of metabolic disorders. Bioassay-guided purification in conjunction with HPLC-PDA profiling led to the isolation and characterization of thirty-five (1-35) and fourteen (1'-14') structurally diverse compounds from the above two plant extracts, respectively. Compounds 1-9 and 1'-6' are previously undescribed glycosides. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic data, electronic circular dichroism (ECD), and single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. In particular, lonicejaposide A (1) has an unprecedented skeleton generated through the coupling of C-7 in secologanin with C-2'' in phenylacetaldehyde via an aldol condensation. Abeliflorosides A (1') and B (2') are hitherto unknown glycosides of triterpene and bisiridoid conjugates constructed through the formation of a 1,3-dioxane moiety. All the isolates were evaluated for their inhibitory activities against ACL. Compounds 9, 25-28, 31, 1', 2', and 14' displayed significant inhibitory effects, with IC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 14.2 M. The interactions of selected compounds possessing different structure features (e.g., 9, 25, 31, and 2') with ACL were thereafter performed by employing molecular docking studies. In addition, compound 2', the most complex triterpene-bisiridoid conjugate glycoside reported herein, also inhibited acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), with an IC50 value of 7.9 M. The dried material of the flower buds of L. japonica (honeysuckle) is a well-known traditional oriental medicine (i.e., Flos Lonicerae Japonicae, FLJ) and has long been used in large quantities. The above findings not only provide new insights for the development of multipurpose utilization of FLJ in healthcare community, but also provide profitable clues indicating that the flower buds of A.  grandiflora might be a potential alternative to FLJ in the traditional Chinese medicine market.","output":"Structurally diverse glycosides of secoiridoid, bisiridoid, and triterpene-bisiridoid conjugates from the flower buds of two Caprifoliaceae plants and their ATP-citrate lyase inhibitory activities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Follicular helper T (T(FH)) cells provide help to B cells, supporting the formation of germinal centres that allow affinity maturation of antibody responses.

In this Perspective article, I discuss the increase in circulating T(FH) cells seen in autoimmune settings and explore potential explanations for this phenomenon. I consider the multistep regulation of T(FH) cell differentiation by the CTLA4 and IL-2 pathways as well as by regulatory T cells and highlight that these same pathways are crucial for regulating autoimmune diseases. The propensity of infection to serve as a cue for T(FH) cell differentiation and a potential trigger for autoimmune disease development is also discussed.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the course met with the significant challenge of conversion to an online mode of teaching, instead of planned face-to-face instruction. Providing formative feedback was thought to be an important step to help students succeed in their final CAD project of the course. In the process of designing feedback, we found that the concept of feedback is still fragile in an online learning environment because online learning settings provide distinct pedagogical demands as compared to face-to-face settings. The situation is especially delicate in the context of contemporary higher education imparting engineering skills, where students attend large classes, with diminished opportunities to interact with the teaching staff. The challenge we faced was to provide meaningful dialogic feedback in an online environment, especially while teaching engineering graphics design to a large class. Here we addressed this challenge by focusing on the process of structuring meaningful feedback. We designed a project assignment to be submitted as multiple deliverables to be submitted in two-stages. Then, we characterized its feedback with multiple notions, such as dialogic iterative cycles, personalized, goal-directed, immediate, in written format, and having a peer assessment component. The process of providing formative feedback online through the structure mentioned in this paper resulted in students' improved scores on the final project elements. It also helped us identify the common issues students are faltering in a graphics design class, and provide customized guidance, ideal examples of expected work, and more resources to motivate each student group to achieve mastery of course content.

Many retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus, are similarly zoonotic; however, only infectious exogenous gammaretroviruses have recently been identified in bats. Here, viral metagenomic sequencing of samples from bats submitted for rabies virus testing, largely due to human exposure, identified a novel, highly divergent exogenous Deltaretrovirus from a big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) in South Dakota. The virus sequence, corresponding to Eptesicus fuscus deltaretrovirus (EfDRV), comprised a nearly complete coding region comprised of canonical 5'-gag-pro-pol-env-3' genes with 37% to 51% identity to human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), an infectious retrovirus that causes T-cell lymphoma. A putative tax gene with 27% identity to HTLV was located downstream of the pol gene along with a gene harbored in an alternative reading frame which possessed a conserved domain for an Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen involved in gene transactivation, suggesting a regulatory function similar to that of the deltaretrovirus rex gene. A TaqMan reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) targeting the pol gene identified 4/60 (6.7%) bats as positive for EfDRV, which, combined with a search of the E. fuscus genome that failed to identify sequences with homology to EfDRV, suggests that EfDRV is an infectious exogenous virus. As all known members of Deltaretrovirus can cause malignancies and E. fuscus is widely distributed in the Americas, often with a colonial roosting behavior in human dwellings, further studies are needed to investigate potential zoonosis.IMPORTANCE Bats host a large numbers of viruses, many of which are zoonotic. In the United States, the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) is widely distributed and lives in small colonies that roost in cavities, often in human dwellings, leading to frequent human interaction. Viral metagenomic sequencing of samples from an E. fuscus bat submitted for rabies testing identified the first exogenous bat Deltaretrovirus The E. fuscus deltaretrovirus (EfDRV) genome consists of the typical deltaretrovial 5'-gag-pro-pol-env-3' genes along with genes encoding two putative transcriptional transactivator proteins distantly related to the Tax protein of human T-cell lymphotrophic virus and nuclear antigen 3B of Epstein-Barr virus. Searches of the E. fuscus genome sequence failed to identify endogenous EfDRV. RT-PCR targeting the EfDRV pol gene identified 4/60 (6.7%) bats with positive results. Together, these results suggest that EfDRV is exogenous.

While most viral introductions we detected were contained with only minor transmission chains, a striking exception was an outbreak associated with a meatpacking plant in Postville, IA. In this case, a single viral introduction led to unrestrained spread within the facility, affecting many staff and members of their households. Importantly, by surveilling viral sequences from the surrounding counties, we have documented the spread of this SARS-CoV-2 substrain from this epicenter to individuals in 13 cities in 7 counties in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, a region spanning 185 square miles.

Methods: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing analyses on peripheral MAIT cells from 13 patients with COVID-19 and 5 healthy donors. The transcriptional profiles of MAIT cells, together with assembled T-cell receptor sequences, were analyzed. Flow cytometry analysis was also performed to investigate the properties of MAIT cells. Results: We identified that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of MAIT cells were involved in myeloid leukocyte activation and lymphocyte activation in patients with COVID-19. In addition, in MAIT cells from severe cases, more DEGs were enriched in adaptive cellular and humoral immune responses compared with those in moderate cases. Further analysis indicated that the increase of cell cytotoxicity (killing), chemotaxis, and apoptosis levels in MAIT cells were consistent with disease severity and displayed the highest levels in patients with severe disease. Interestingly, flow cytometry analysis showed that the frequencies of pyroptotic MAIT cells, but not the frequencies of apoptotic MAIT cells, were increased significantly in patients with COVID-19, suggesting pyroptosis is one of leading causes of MAIT cell deaths during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, there were more clonal expansions of MAIT cells in severe cases than in moderate cases. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that MAIT cells are likely to be involved in the host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Simultaneously, the transcriptomic data from MAIT cells provides a deeper understanding of the immune pathogenesis of the disease.","output":"Single-Cell Transcriptomic Profiling of MAIT Cells in Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Rectus sheath haematoma (RSH) is an uncommon condition caused by lesion of the superior or inferior epigastric arteries or their branches or by rupture of the rectus muscle. Treatment is usually supportive; however, if haemodynamic compromise develops, intravascular embolisation or surgery may be required. Furthermore, in some cases, bleeding may be so conspicuous that it can determine the patient's death before an adequate treatment is performed. We performed a retrospective study on 78 consecutive patients with the diagnosis of RSH admitted to the General Surgery Unit of our hospital between January 2000 and December 2010 in order to identify possible prognostic risk factors that could affect the operational approach before the onset of haemodynamic instability. METHODS Demographic characteristics, patient history, laboratory and diagnostic imaging examinations were investigated. The variables considered were: gender, age, anti-coagulation or anti-platelet therapy, trauma, international normalised ratio (INR) and bleeding time in the first 72 h of observation and concomitant diseases. The data were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Sixty patients received a conservative treatment, while 18 underwent operative treatment for haemodynamic instability (embolisation in 2 patients and surgery in 16 patients). Three of these 18 patients (17 %) died for consumption coagulopathy after surgery. None of the variables included in the univariate statistical analysis was significant (p = ns). CONCLUSION Ultrasonography or computed tomography are the most common methods used to establish the diagnosis of RSH, so it is no longer a diagnostic dilemma. Most patients can be treated conservatively and an operative treatment is justified only in case of haemodynamic instability. Our retrospective study could not identify any prognostic risk factor of haemodynamic instability in RSH.

The current study aims to investigate and analyze the people top concerns and sentiment dynamics expressed in physician online reviews (PORs). (2) Methods: Text data were collected from four U.S.-based PRWs during the three time periods of 2018, 2019 and 2020. Based on the dynamic topic modeling, hot topics related to different aspects of healthcare were identified. Following the hybrid approach of aspect-based sentiment analysis, the social network of prevailing topics was also analyzed whether people expressed positive, neutral or negative sentiments in PORs. (3) Results: The study identified 30 dominant topics across three different stages which lead toward four key findings. First, topics discussed in Stage III were quite different from the earlier two stages due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Second, based on the keyword co-occurrence analysis, the most prevalent keywords in all three stages were related to the treatment, questions asked by patients, communication problem, patients' feelings toward the hospital environment, disease symptoms, time spend with patients and different issues related to the COVID-19 (i.e., pneumonia, death, spread and cases). Third, topics related to the provider service quality, hospital servicescape and treatment cost were the most dominant topics in Stages I and II, while the quality of online information regarding COVID-19 and government countermeasures were the most dominant topics in Stage III. Fourth, when zooming into the topic-based sentiments analysis, hot topics in Stage I were mostly positive (joy be the dominant emotion), then negative (disgust be the dominant emotion) in Stage II. Furthermore, sentiments in the initial period of Stage III (COVID-19) were negative (anger be the dominant emotion), then transformed into positive (trust be the dominant emotion) later. The findings also revealed that the proposed method outperformed the conventional machine learning models in analyzing topic and sentiment dynamics expressed in PRWs.

However, whether TIGIT has a function in viral persistence or limiting tissue pathology is unclear. Here we report that TIGIT modulation effectively alters the phenotype and cytokine profile of T cells during influenza and chronic LCMV infection, but does not affect virus control in vivo.

Effect of supervisory load, years of Australian registration and departmental flow factors were evaluated. Descriptive statistical methods were used and regression analyses were performed.ResultsA total of 188 shifts were analysed. Productivity was 4.07 patients per 9.5-h shift (95% CI 3.56-4.58) or 0.43 patients per h, representing a 48.5% reduction from previously published data (P<0.0001). Working in a shift outside of the resuscitation area or working a day shift was associated with a reduction in individual patient load. There was a 2.2% (95% CI: 1.1-3.4, P<0.001) decrease in productivity with each year after obtaining Australian medical registration. There was a 10.6% (95% CI: 5.4-15.6, P<0.001) decrease in productivity for each junior physician supervised. Bed access had no statistically significant effect on productivity.ConclusionsEmergency physicians undertake multiple duties. Their ability to manage their own patients varies depending on multiple ED operational factors, particularly their supervisory load. COVID-19 preparations reduced their ability to see their own patients by half.What is known about the topic?An understanding of emergency physician productivity is essential in planning clinical operations. Medical productivity, however, is challenging to define, and is controversial to measure. Although baseline data exist, few studies examine the effect of patient flow and supervision requirements on the emergency physician's ability to perform primary consults. No studies describe these metrics during COVID-19.What does this paper add?This pilot study provides a novel cross-sectional description of the effect of COVID-19 preparations on the ability of emergency physicians to provide direct patient care. It also examines the effect of selected system and process factors in a physician's ability to complete primary consults.What are the implications for practitioners?When managing an emergency medical workforce, the contribution of emergency physicians to the number of patients requiring consults should take into account the high volume of alternative duties required. Increasing alternative duties can decrease primary provider tasks that can be completed. COVID-19 pandemic preparation has significantly reduced the ability of emergency physicians to manage their own patients.","output":"Description of the effect of patient flow, junior doctor supervision and pandemic preparation on the ability of emergency physicians to provide direct patient care."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: Introduction Patients with cancer are at high-risk for mortality from coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19). Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is a common toxicity of thoracic radiotherapy with overlapping clinical and imaging features with COVID-19, however, RP is treated with high-dose corticosteroids, which may exacerbate COVID-19-associated lung injury. We reviewed patients who presented with symptoms of RP during the intensification of a regional COVID-19 epidemic to report on their clinical course and COVID-19 testing results. Methods The clinical course and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging findings of consecutive patients who presented with symptoms of RP in March 2020 were reviewed. The first regional COVID-19 case was diagnosed on 3/1/2020. All patients underwent COVID-19 qualitative RNA testing. Results Four patients with clinical suspicion for RP were assessed. Three out of four patients tested positive for COVID-19. All patients presented with symptoms of cough and dyspnea. Two patients had a fever, of whom only one tested positive for COVID-19. Two patients started on an empiric high-dose corticosteroid taper for presumed RP, but both had clinical deterioration, and ultimately tested positive for COVID-19 and required hospitalization. Chest CT findings in patients suspected of RP, but ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19 showed ground-glass opacities mostly pronounced outside the radiation field. Conclusions As this pandemic continues, patients with symptoms of RP require diagnostic attention. We recommend that patients suspected of RP be tested for COVID-19 before starting empiric corticosteroids and for careful attention be paid to chest CT imaging in order to prevent potential exacerbation of COVID-19 in these high-risk patients.","output":"Need for Caution in the Diagnosis of Radiation Pneumonitis in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type 2 inflammation is found in most forms of asthma, which may co-exist with recurrent viral infections, bacterial colonization, and host cell death.

Here, we show that intranasal CDG induced early airway type 1 interferon (IFN) production and dramatically suppressed CD127+ST2+ ILC2s and type 2 lung inflammation during Alternaria and IL-33 exposure. Further, CD127CST2CThy1.2+ lung ILCs, which showed a transcriptomic signature consistent with ILC1s, were expanded and activated by CDG combined with either Alternaria or IL-33. CDG-mediated suppression of type 2 inflammation occurred independent of IL-18R, IL-12, and STAT6 but required the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and type 1 IFN signaling. Thus, CDG potently suppresses ILC2-driven lung inflammation and promotes ILC1 responses.

Existing analyses of tide gauge records2-10 agree that sea-level rise has been a considerable driver of trends in sea-level extremes since at least 1960. However, the contribution from changes in storminess remains unclear, owing to the difficulty of inferring this contribution from sparse data and the consequent inconclusive results that have accumulated in the literature11,12. Here we analyse tide gauge observations using spatial Bayesian methods13 to show that, contrary to current thought, trends in surge extremes and sea-level rise both made comparable contributions to the overall change in extreme sea levels in Europe since 1960 . We determine that the trend pattern of surge extremes reflects the contributions from a dominant north-south dipole associated with internal climate variability and a single-sign positive pattern related to anthropogenic forcing. Our results demonstrate that both external and internal influences can considerably affect the likelihood of surge extremes over periods as long as 60 years, suggesting that the current coastal planning practice of assuming stationary surge extremes1,14 might be inadequate.","output":"Trends in Europe storm surge extremes match the rate of sea-level rise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread worldwide and infected more that 10 million people, causing more than 500,000 deaths worldwide. The infection has systemic effects on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems; thus, patients can present a variety of symptoms from asymptomatic to rapid deaths. In this paper, we present the first case of post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing in Western part of Romania in a deceased with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and elevated D-dimer levels. METHODS: During the autopsy which took place at the Institute of Forensic Medicine from Timisoara, Romania, blood sample was collected in a vacutainer with EDTA and sent to the Laboratory of Forensic Genetics from Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania. Viral RNA extraction was performed automated on the Maxwell 48 RSC Extraction System (Promega, USA) using the Maxwell RSC Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification kit (Promega, USA). After RNA extraction, the samples were amplified on a 7500 real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems, USA) using the genesig? Real-Time PCR Assay (Primer Design, UK).

Multivariate Cox regression was used to identify risk factors associated with progression, which were then were incorporated into a nomogram to establish a novel prediction scoring model. ROC was used to assess the performance of the model. RESULTS: Overall, 208 patients were divided into a stable group (n = 168, 80.8%) and a progressive group (n = 40,19.2%) based on whether their conditions worsened during hospitalization. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that comorbidity, older age, lower lymphocyte count, and higher lactate dehydrogenase at presentation were independent high-risk factors for COVID-19 progression. Incorporating these 4 factors, the nomogram achieved good concordance indexes of .86 (95% confidence interval [CI], .81-.91) and well-fitted calibration curves. A novel scoring model, named as CALL, was established; its area under the ROC was .91 (95% CI, .86-.94).

An attempt has been made to provide an analysis of the institutional and economic environment and an econometric assessment of the real indicators of the countrys development. Research Design & Methods: To assess the degree of influence of certain indicators on economic growth, a regression analysis was carried out. For this, data were collected from 15 countries for 2000-2018. Since the sample combines temporal and spatial data, a panel data regression model was built to analyze the effect of the considered explanatory variables on GDP. To study a model with these characteristics, two different models can be used: a fixed effects (FE) model and a random effects (RE) model. Findings: Based on the historical and logical analysis of theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of economic development and the constructed regression model of panel data, it is shown that an increase in the level of indicators selected in official statistics has a small effect on economic growth, that is, there is a discrepancy between target indicators government programs and actual results. The institutional features of the Kazakhstani development model, which cause economic lag, are revealed. Implications & Recommendations: The current cyclical transition, complicated by the Covid-19 pandemic, has revealed weak links in the economies of many countries, caused by systemic contradictions accumulated over 30 years. Kazakhstan, as a country that has been building market relations only since the end of the 20th century, found itself in the grip of not only economic and political, but also institutional costs. One of the problems hindering the economic development of the nation is the contradiction between the political ambitions of the authorities and the real results of the implementation of state programs, the loss of public confidence. Contribution & Value Added: The countrys development prospects are primarily predetermined by the states ability to solve accumulated problems. Therefore, it is important to identify them, solve, and then predict the real parameters of the countrys development. The importance of such a methodological approach is noted by scientists from the post-Soviet countries, who study the factors that hinder the development of these countries.","output":"Contradictions of institutional and economic environment: Experience of Kazakhstan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Latinx men are disproportionately impacted by HIV.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to assess the impact of prenatal exposure to serotonergic antidepressants, accounting for maternal mood disturbances, on markers of stress regulation during childhood. METHODS We will follow PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and will search MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ClinicalTrials.gov for full-length studies that assessed physiological (eg, cortisol level, heart rate variability, salivary amylase, pupillary size, C-reactive protein) indices of stress regulation in children of pregnant people who were treated with a serotonergic antidepressant at any point during pregnancy. We will assess the quality of observational studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the quality of experimental studies using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. When possible, we will conduct a random-effects meta-analysis. If meta-analysis is not possible, we will conduct a narrative review.

Methods: The authors sent out an electronic survey to medical students in the Philippines from 11 to 24 May 2020. Using a combination of multiple-choice, Likert scale, and open-ended questions, the following data were obtained: demographics, medical school information, access to technological resources, study habits, living conditions, self-assessment of capacity for and perceived barriers to online learning, and proposed interventions. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Responses were compared between student subgroups using nonparametric tests. Results: Among 3670 medical students, 93% owned a smartphone and 83% had a laptop or desktop computer. To access online resources, 79% had a postpaid internet subscription while 19% used prepaid mobile data. Under prevailing conditions, only 1505 students (41%) considered themselves physically and mentally capable of engaging in online learning. Barriers were classified under five categories: technological, individual, domestic, institutional, and community barriers.

METHODS Eighteen PREG/LACT (age: 31  3 years, pre-pregnancy BMI: 24.26  5.85 kg m-2) collected 24-h urine samples, recorded TFI, and provided a blood sample at 5 time points (15  2, 26  1, 37  1 weeks gestation, 3  1 and 9  1 weeks postpartum during lactation); 18 pair-matched non-pregnant (NP), non-lactating (NL) women (age: 29  4 years, BMI: 24.1  3.7 kg m-2) provided samples at similar time intervals. Twenty-four-hour urine volume (U VOL), osmolality (U OSM), specific gravity (U SG), and color (U COL) were measured. Hematocrit, serum osmolality (S OSM), and serum total protein (S TP) were measured in blood. RESULTS Significant relationships were present between TFI and urinary biomarkers in all women (P < 0.004); these relationships were not different between PREG and NP, and LACT and NL, except U VOL in PREG (P = 0.0017). No significant relationships between TFI and hematological biomarkers existed (P > 0.05).

The particles refract and absorb light, and thereby reduce the UV intensity at various locations within the particle. Previously, we demonstrated shielding in calculations of UV intensities within spherical approximations of SARS-CoV-2 virions within spherical particles approximating dried-to-equilibrium respiratory fluids. The purpose of this paper is to extend that work to survival fractions of virions (i.e., fractions of virions that can infect cells) within spherical particles approximating dried respiratory fluids, and to investigate the implications of these calculations for using UV light for disinfection. The particles may be on a surface or in air. Here, the survival fraction (S) of a set of individual virions illuminated with a UV fluence (F, in J/m2) is assumed described by S(kF) = exp(-kF), where k is the UV inactivation rate constant (m2/J). The average survival fraction (Sp) of the simulated virions in a group of particles is calculated using the energy absorbed by each virion in the particles. The results show that virions within particles of dried respiratory fluids can have larger Sp than do individual virions. For individual virions, and virions within 1-, 5-, and 9-m particles illuminated (normal incidence) on a surface with 260-nm UV light, the Sp = 0.00005, 0.0155, 0.22, and 0.28, respectively, when kF = 10. The Sp decrease to <10-7, <10-7, 0.077, and 0.15, respectively, for kF = 100. Results also show that illuminating particles with UV beams from widely separated directions can strongly reduce the Sp. These results suggest that the size distributions and optical properties of the dried particles of virion-containing respiratory fluids are likely important to effectively designing and using UV germicidal irradiation systems for microbes in particles. The results suggest the use of reflective surfaces to increase the angles of illumination and decrease the Sp.

A systematic drug targeting model (SysDT) was used for compound targets prediction, and then the targets were analyzed for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of HQ-BS targets was constructed, after identifying core networks through Cytoscape plugins. RESULTS We found 47 bioactive compounds of HQ-BS and 107 human-derived targets. A compound target network and a target signal pathway network were constructed and used for topological analysis. Kaempferol, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, wogonin, and oroxylin-a were identified as core compounds and pathways in cancer. The calcium signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, chemical carcinogenesis, estrogen signaling pathway, proteoglycans in cancer, HIF-1 signaling pathway, thyroid hormone signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and T cell receptor signaling pathway were found to be potential signals of HQ-BS in treating cancer. Through PPI network analysis, TNF signaling pathway, tryptophan metabolism, proteoglycans in cancer, cell cycle, and chemical carcinogenesis sub-networks were obtained. CONCLUSIONS HQ-BS contains various bioactive compounds, including flavonoids, phytosterols, and other compounds, and these compounds can inhibit or activate multiple targets and pathways against cancer.","output":"A Network Pharmacology Approach to Explore the Potential Mechanisms of Huangqin-Baishao Herb Pair in Treatment of Cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of 2019 and 2020s, a wave of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) epidemics worldwide has catalyzed a new era of 'communicable infectious diseases'.

Developed over evolutionary time, viral nucleic acid detection is a central pillar in the defensive armamentarium used to combat foreign microbial invasion. To ensure cellular homeostasis, such a strategy necessitates the efficient discrimination of pathogen-derived DNA and RNA from that of the host. In 2011, it was suggested that an upregulation of type I interferon signalling might serve as a defining feature of a novel set of Mendelian inborn errors of immunity, where antiviral sensors are triggered by host nucleic acids due to a failure of self versus non-self discrimination. These rare disorders have played a surprisingly significant role in informing our understanding of innate immunity and the relevance of type I interferon signalling for human health and disease.

We conducted a seroprevalence survey in the Kibera informal settlement, Nairobi, Kenya, to determine the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Members of randomly selected households from an existing population-based infectious disease surveillance (PBIDS) provided blood specimens between 27 (th) November and 5 (th) December 2020. The specimens were tested for antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Seroprevalence estimates were weighted by age and sex distribution of the PBIDS population and accounted for household clustering. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for individual seropositivity. Results: Consent was obtained from 523 individuals in 175 households, yielding 511 serum specimens that were tested. The overall weighted seroprevalence was 43.3% (95% CI, 37.4 C 49.5%) and did not vary by sex. Of the sampled households, 122(69.7%) had at least one seropositive individual. The individual seroprevalence increased by age from 7.6% (95% CI, 2.4 C 21.3%) among children (<5 years), 32.7% (95% CI, 22.9 C 44.4%) among children 5 C 9 years, 41.8% (95% CI, 33.0 C 51.1%) for those 10-19 years, and 54.9%(46.2 C 63.3%) for adults (20 years). Relative to those from medium-sized households (3 and 4 individuals), participants from large (5 persons) households had significantly increased odds of being seropositive, aOR, 1.98(95% CI, 1.17 C 1.58), while those from small-sized households (2 individuals) had increased odds but not statistically significant, aOR, 2.31 (95% CI, 0.93 C 5.74).

Among them, membrane proteins constitute approximately 50% of the major drug targets. In the drug discovery pipeline, rapid methods for producing different classes of proteins in a simple manner with high quality are important for structural and functional analysis. Cell-free systems are emerging as an attractive alternative for the production of proteins due to their flexible nature without any cell membrane constraints. In a bioproduction context, open systems based on cell lysates derived from different sources, and with batch-to-batch consistency, have acted as a catalyst for cell-free synthesis of target proteins. Most importantly, proteins can be processed for downstream applications like purification and functional analysis without the necessity of transfection, selection, and expansion of clones. In the last 5 years, there has been an increased availability of new cell-free lysates derived from multiple organisms, and their use for the synthesis of a diverse range of proteins. Despite this progress, major challenges still exist in terms of scalability, cost effectiveness, protein folding, and functionality. In this review, we present an overview of different cell-free systems derived from diverse sources and their application in the production of a wide spectrum of proteins. Further, this article discusses some recent progress in cell-free systems derived from Chinese hamster ovary and Sf21 lysates containing endogenous translocationally active microsomes for the synthesis of membrane proteins. We particularly highlight the usage of internal ribosomal entry site sequences for more efficient protein production, and also the significance of site-specific incorporation of non-canonical amino acids for labeling applications and creation of antibody drug conjugates using cell-free systems.

This practice could negatively impact sleep by reducing exposure to daylight and physical activity. We examined subjective sleep quality in Baependi, a small rural town in Brazil during the COVID-19 quarantine order. METHODS: This sample is from the Baependi Heart Study, a family-based cohort of adults. Participants (n=800, 71% women, mean age 51.615.6 years) completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) early in the COVID pandemic (April-May, 2020). They were also asked about their compliance to the quarantine order (yes/no). We compared sleep between quarantined (QT) and not-quarantined individuals (NQT). Longitudinal data was obtained from a subsample of 417 individuals who also completed a pre-COVID PSQI between January, 2010 and September, 2014. RESULTS: Individuals compliant with the quarantine had worse sleep quality than non-quarantined individuals [QT PSQI= 6.1 (3.9), NQT PSQI= 5.0 (3.5), p<0.01]. Stratified analysis showed that differences in PSQI scores between QT and NQT was greater for women [QT = 6.4 (4), NQT = 5.2 (3.7), p<0.01] and older people [QT = 6.6 (0.1), NQT = 5.5 (3.3), p=0.02]. Associations were attenuated after adjusting for age and gender. PSQI components demonstrated a higher sleep latency for the QT group in the full sample (p=0.02), women (p<0.01) and young (<50 years, p=0.03). Sleep duration was shorter in the QT young subsample (p=0.03). QT women also reported lower sleep efficiency (p=0.01) and greater use of sleep medication than NQT women (p<0.01). In the longitudinal subsample, PSQI scores were significantly higher during COVID than pre-pandemic [COVID= 5.7 (3.8), pre-COVID= 5 (3.3), p<0.01]. The significant change in PSQI was only observed in the QT participants [COVID= 5.9 (3.7), pre-COVID= 5.2 (3.4), p<0.01] and not NQT [COVID= 5 (3.7), pre-COVID= 4.5 (3), p=0.12.

The safety and efficacy of this treatment modality has not been assessed in a multicenter study.METHODSA retrospective review of prospectively maintained databases at 8 academic institutions was performed for the years 2009 to 2016 to identify patients with posterior circulation aneurysms treated with PED placement.RESULTSA total of 129 consecutive patients underwent 129 procedures to treat 131 aneurysms; 29 dissecting, 53 fusiform, and 49 saccular lesions were included. At a median follow-up of 11 months, complete and near-complete occlusion was recorded in 78.1%. Dissecting aneurysms had the highest occlusion rate and fusiform the lowest. Major complications were most frequent in fusiform aneurysms, whereas minor complications occurred most commonly in saccular aneurysms. In patients with saccular aneurysms, clopidogrel responders had a lower complication rate than did clopidogrel nonresponders. The majority of dissecting aneurysms were treated in the immediate or acute phase following subarachnoid hemorrhage, a circumstance that contributed to the highest mortality rate in those aneurysms.CONCLUSIONSIn the largest series to date, fusiform aneurysms were found to have the lowest occlusion rate and the highest frequency of major complications.

The present study aimed to determine how far airborne bacteria spread during dental treatment, and the level of contamination. Fall out samples were collected on blood agar plates placed in six different sectors, 0.5C2 m from the patient. Restorative dentistry fallout samples (N = 72) were collected from rooms (N = 6) where high-speed rotating instruments were used, and control samples (N = 24) were collected from rooms (N = 4) used for periodontal and orthodontic treatment where rotating and ultrasonic instruments were not used. The collection times were 1.5 and 3 h. In addition, samples were taken from facial masks of personnel and from surfaces in the rooms before and after disinfection. After 48 h of incubation at 37 C, colonies were counted and classified by Gram stain. The results showed significant contamination of the room at all distances sampled when high-speed instruments were used (mean 970 colony-forming units/m(2)/h). The bacterial density was found to be higher in the more remote sampling points. Gram-positive cocci, namely viridans streptococci and staphylococci, were the most common findings. The area that becomes contaminated during dental procedures is far larger than previously thought and practically encompasses the whole room.

The present study is the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the effect of a work schedule without quick returns for 6 months, compared with a work schedule that maintains quick returns during the same time frame. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A parallel-group cluster RCT in a target sample of more than 4000 healthcare workers at Haukeland University Hospital in Norway will be conducted. More than 70 hospital units will be assessed for eligibility and randomised to a work schedule without quick returns for 6 months or continue with a schedule that maintains quick returns. The primary outcome is objective records of sickness absence; secondary outcomes are questionnaire data (n4000 invited) on sleep and functioning, physical and psychological health, work-related accidents and turnover intention. For a subsample, sleep diaries and objective sleep registrations with radar technology (n 50) will be collected.

In October 2019, a wider array of products, including edibles, was legalized, with entry into the legal market beginning in December. DATA AND METHODS: Three quarters (the first quarters of 2018 and 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2020) of the National Cannabis Survey were used to examine changes in cannabis use (overall use and daily or almost daily (DAD) use), consumption methods, products and sources. RESULTS: Cannabis use in the past three months was higher in late 2020 (20.0%) than in 2019 (17.5%) and 2018 (14.0%), and this was particularly the case among: females (for whom rates rose to equal male rates for the first time), adults aged 25 and older, and some provinces. Similarly, DAD use, at 7.9% also increased. Higher percentages of Canadians reported getting at least some of their cannabis from legal sources or growing it, and fewer were relying on friends and family or illegal sources in 2020. DISCUSSION: This study spans three years-from before legalization to about two years after. It provides a more complete picture of the law's impact on cannabis use and related behaviours, given the more established legal cannabis industry better equipped to compete with the black market on price, convenience and selection. Findings demonstrate that change is continuing, and, as before, some cautions and assurances remain. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cannabis use continues to be difficult to measure. Monitoring remains important, given the ever-changing provincial retail landscapes; the introduction of new products; and the pressure by the industry to remove or adjust potency limits, and allow widespread delivery, farm-gate sales and cannabis lounges.","output":"Looking back from 2020, how cannabis use and related behaviours changed in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease outbreak of 2019 has been causing significant loss of life and unprecedented economical loss throughout the world. Social distancing and face masks are widely recommended around the globe in order to protect others and prevent the spread of the virus through breathing, coughing, and sneezing. To expand the scientific underpinnings of such recommendations, we carry out high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations of unprecedented resolution and realism to elucidate the underlying physics of saliva particulate transport during human cough with and without facial masks. Our simulations: (a) are carried out under both a stagnant ambient flow (indoor) and a mild unidirectional breeze (outdoor); (b) incorporate the effect of human anatomy on the flow; (c) account for both medical and non-medical grade masks; and (d) consider a wide spectrum of particulate sizes, ranging from 10 micro m to 300 micro m. We show that during indoor coughing some saliva particulates could travel up to 0.48 m, 0.73 m, and 2.62 m for the cases with medical-grade, non-medical grade, and without facial masks, respectively. Thus, in indoor environments either medical or non-medical grade facial masks can successfully limit the spreading of saliva particulates to others. Under outdoor conditions with a unidirectional mild breeze, however, leakage flow through the mask can cause saliva particulates to be entrained into the energetic shear layers around the body and transported very fast at large distances by the turbulent flow, thus, limiting the effectiveness of facial masks.","output":"Fluid dynamics simulations show that facial masks can suppress the spread of COVID-19 in indoor environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Crowds are a source of transmission in the COVID-19 spread. Contention and mitigation measures have focused on reducing people's mass gathering. Such efforts have led to a drop in the economy. The application of a vaccine at a world level represents a grand challenge for humanity, and it is not likely to accomplish even within months. In the meantime, we still need tools to allow the people integration into their regular routines reducing the risk of infection. In this context, this paper presents a solution for crowd management. The aim is to monitor and manage crowd levels in interior places or point-of-interests (POI), particularly shopping centers or stores. The solution is based on a POI recommendation system that suggests the nearest safe options upon request of a particular POI to visit by the user. In this sense, it recommends places near the user location with the least estimated crowd. The recommendation algorithm uses a top-K approach and behavioral game theory to predict the user's choice and estimate the crowd level for the requested POI. To evaluate the efficiency of this technological intervention in terms of the potential number of contacts of possible COVID-19 infections and the recommendation quality, we have developed an agent-based model (ABM). The adoption level of new technologies can be related to the end-user experience and trust in such technologies. As the end-user follows a recommendation that leads to uncrowded places, both the end-user experience and trust increased. We study and model this process using the OCEAN model of personality. The results from the studied scenarios showed that the proposed solution is widely adopted by the agents, as the trust factor increased from 0.5 (initial set value) to 0.76. In terms of crowd level, these are effectively managed and reduced on average by 40%. The mobility contacts were reduced by 40%, decreasing the risk of COVID-19 infection.

MethodsThree-hundred-sixty persons with COVID-like illness was reported to the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) before February 29, but 37 of these tested negative and 237 were never tested for SARS-COV-2. Records of 86 persons with confirmed COVID-19 and symptom onset prior to February 29, 2020 were reviewed by four physician-epidemiologists. Case-patients were classified as likely early onset COVID-19, or insufficient evidence to determine onset. Clinical and epidemiological factors collected by DOHMH and supplemented with emergency department records were analyzed. ResultsThirty-nine likely early onset COVID-19 cases were identified. The majority had severe disease with 69% presenting to an ED visit within 2 weeks of symptom onset. The first likely COVID-19 case on record had symptom onset on January 28, 2020. Only 7 of the 39 cases (18%) had traveled internationally within 14 days of onset (none to China). ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 was in NYC before being classified as a PHEIC, and eluded surveillance for another month.

This leaves individual clinicians responsible for collating disparate information from patient management systems and care recommendations to manually manage the contradictions that exist in the simultaneous treatment of various conditions. METHODS/DESIGN: We have devised a modelling language based on BPMN that allows us to create computer interpretable representations of single condition guidance and incorporate patient data to detect the points of conflict between multiple conditions based on their transformation to logical constraints. This has been used to develop a prototype clinical decision support tool that we can use to highlight the causes of conflict between them in three main areas: medication, lifestyle and well-being, and appointment bookings. RESULTS: The prototype tool was used to discern contradictions in the care recommendations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and osteoarthritis. These were presented to a panel of clinicians who confirmed that the tool produced clinically relevant alerts that can advise clinicians of the presence of conflicts between guidelines relating to both clashes in medication or lifestyle advice. CONCLUSIONS: The need for supporting general practitioners in their treatment of patients remains and this proof of concept has demonstrated that by converting this guidance into computer-interpretable pathways we can use constraint solvers to readily identify clinically relevant points of conflict between critical elements of the pathway.","output":"Automated conflict resolution for patients with multiple morbidity being treated using more than one set of single condition clinical guidance: A case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early child development has been influenced directly and indirectly by the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, and these effects are exacerbated in contexts of poverty.

COVID-19 infection is commonly associated with symptoms like coughing, fever, and shortness of breath, besides, the reports of muscle pain, anosmia, hyposmia, and loss of taste are becoming evident. Recent reports suggest the pathogenic invasion of the SARS-CoV-2 into the CNS, that could thereby result in devastating long term complications, primarily because some of these complications may go unnoticed for a long time. Evidence suggest that the virus could enter the CNS through angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor, neuronal transport, haematogenous route, and nasal route via olfactory bulb, cribriform plate, and propagates through trans-synaptic signalling, and shows retrograde movement into the CNS along nerve fiber. COVID-19 induces CNS inflammation and neurological degenerative damage through a diverse mechanism which includes ACE-2 receptor damage, cytokine-associated injury or cytokine storm syndrome, secondary hypoxia, demyelination, blood-brain barrier disruption, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation. Viral invasion into the CNS has been reported to show association with complications like Parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disorder, meningitis, encephalopathy, anosmia, hyposmia, anxiety, depression, psychiatric symptoms, seizures, stroke, etc. This review provides a detailed discussion of the CNS pathogenesis of COVID-19. Authors conclude that the COVID-19 cannot just be considered as a disorder of the pulmonary or peripheral system, rather it has a significant CNS involvement.

However, when underlying causes of psychotic symptoms, like inflammation, ischemia, or tumor affecting the neural tissue can be identified, a different classification is used (\\"psychotic disorder with delusions due to known physiological condition\\" (ICD-10: F06.2) or psychosis caused by medical factors (DSM5)). While CSF analysis still is considered optional in current diagnostic guidelines for psychotic disorders, CSF biomarkers could help to identify known physiological conditions. In this retrospective, partly descriptive analysis of 144 patients with psychotic symptoms and available CSF data, we analyzed CSF examinations' significance to differentiate patients with specific etiological factors (F06.2) from patients with schizophrenia, schizotypal, delusional, and other non-mood psychotic disorders (F2). In 40.3% of all patients, at least one CSF parameter was out of the reference range. Abnormal CSF-findings were found significantly more often in patients diagnosed with F06.2 (88.2%) as compared to patients diagnosed with F2 (23.8%, p < 0.00001). A total of 17 cases were identified as probably caused by specific etiological factors (F06.2), of which ten cases fulfilled the criteria for a probable autoimmune psychosis linked to the following autoantibodies: amphiphysin, CASPR2, CV2, LGl1, NMDA, zic4, and titin. Two cases presented with anti-thyroid tissue autoantibodies. In four cases, further probable causal factors were identified: COVID-19, a frontal intracranial tumor, multiple sclerosis (n = 2), and neurosyphilis. Twenty-one cases remained with \\"no reliable diagnostic classification\\". Age at onset of psychotic symptoms differed between patients diagnosed with F2 and F06.2 (p = 0.014), with the latter group being older (median: 44 vs. 28 years).

Standard-of-care (SOC) therapy alone is often not sufficient to heal these wounds, resulting in application of adjuvant wound therapies including biologic skin substitutes. Although a variety of products exist, it has been difficult to formulate conclusions on their clinical efficacy. We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy of healing diabetic foot ulcers with biologic skin substitutes. METHODS A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Four electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE [Ovid], Cochrane CENTRAL [Ovid], and Web of Science) were searched from inception through February 27, 2019. Searches included keywords and subject headings pertaining to 3 main concepts: biologic skin substitutes, wound healing, and diabetic foot ulcers. Cochrane randomized controlled trial filters were used to narrow results. Data were extracted from 54 included articles, and risk-of-bias assessments were conducted by 2 independent reviewers. The primary objective was to calculate a pooled risk ratio for the proportion of wounds completely closed by 12 weeks. Secondary objectives included a pooled risk ratio for the proportion of wounds completely closed by 6 weeks and mean time to healing. RESULTS Twenty-five studies were identified that assessed the proportion of complete wound closure by 12 weeks. We found that wounds treated with biologic dressings were 1.67 times more likely to heal by 12 weeks than those treated with SOC dressings (P < 0.00001). Five studies assessed the proportion of complete wound closure by 6 weeks. Wounds treated with biologic dressings were 2.81 times more likely to heal by 6 weeks than those treated with SOC dressings (P = 0.0001). Descriptively, 29 of 31 studies that assessed time to healing favored biologic dressings over SOC dressings. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review provides supporting evidence that biologic skin substitutes are more effective than SOC dressings at healing diabetic foot ulcers by 12 weeks. Future studies must address the relative benefits of different skin substitutes as well as the long-term implications of these products and their financial considerations.","output":"Evidence for Healing Diabetic Foot Ulcers With Biologic Skin Substitutes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study explores how social networks for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are differentiated by regions.

Here we share the donor presentations evaluated in a lung transplant center during the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures taken at every stage of transplant management, and the outcomes of our transplants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 15 lung donors selected by the national coordination center pre - sented to our lung transplant center as of March 11, 2020, when the first COVID-19 case was reported in Turkey, and data of 5 lung transplant cases in this period were retrospectively analyzed. All donors were examined in detail for COVID-19 disease. Procurement processes for accepted donors, transplant surgeries of recipients, and postoperative follow-up and care processes of recipients were carried out with the least number of personnel, but all with appropriate personal protective equipment. RESULTS: There were 15 donor organs procured by our center during a 9-month period coincident with the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of donor pre - sentations to our center between the same dates in the previous year was 78. Five of the 15 donors were accepted, and of those accepted, 4 were male and 1 was female. There was no statistically significant difference between the accepted and rejected donors in terms of the ratio of Pao2 to fraction of inspired oxygen, age, duration of endotracheal intubation (days), and smoking (pack-years). All SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests performed on bronchoalveolar lavage samples and nasopharyngeal, conjunctival, and rectal samples collected from the recipients during the follow-up period were negative. No pathological finding suggestive of COVID-19 infection was noted in the radiological evaluations.

Rapid detection of foodborne pathogens in the early stages is imperative to prevent the outbreak of foodborne diseases, known as a severe threat to human health. Conventional bacterial culture methods for detecting foodborne pathogens are time-consuming, laborious, and lacking in pathogen diagnosis. To overcome this problem, we have created an embedded paper-based microchip based on isothermal loop amplification (LAMP), which can rapidly and sensitively detect foodborne pathogens. RESULTS: We embed paper impregnated with LAMP reagent and specific primers in multiple reaction chambers of the microchip. The solution containing the target pathogen was injected into the center chamber and uniformly distributed into the reaction chamber by centrifugal force. The purified DNA of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus has been successfully amplified and directly detected on the microchip. The E. coli O157:H7 DNA was identified as low as 0.0134 ng L(? 1). Besides, the potential of this microchip in point-of-care testing was further tested by combining the on-chip sample purification module and using milk spiked with Salmonella spp.. The pyrolyzed milk sample was filtered through a polydopamine-coated paper embedded in the inside of the sample chamber. It was transported to the reaction chamber by centrifugal force for LAMP amplification. Then direct chip detection was performed in the reaction chamber embedded with calcein-soaked paper. The detection limit of Salmonella spp. in the sample measured by the microchip was approximately 12 CFU mL(? 1).

In this Health Policy paper, we look at the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and historical spending in the UK and comparable countries, assess the role of private spending, and review spending projections to estimate future needs. Public spending on health has increased by 37% a year on average since the National Health Service (NHS) was founded in 1948 and, since then, has continued to assume a larger share of both the economy and government expenditure. In the decade before the ongoing pandemic started, the rate of growth of government spending for the health and care sector slowed. We argue that without average growth in public spending on health of at least 4% per year in real terms, there is a real risk of degradation of the NHS, reductions in coverage of benefits, increased inequalities, and increased reliance on private financing. A similar, if not higher, level of growth in public spending on social care is needed to provide high standards of care and decent terms and conditions for social care staff, alongside an immediate uplift in public spending to implement long-overdue reforms recommended by the Dilnot Commission to improve financial protection.

In contrast, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure occur in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19. ARDS is mediated, at least in part, by a dysregulated inflammatory response due to excessive levels of circulating cytokines, a condition known as the \\"cytokine-storm syndrome.\\" Currently, there are FDA-approved therapies that attenuate the dysregulated inflammation that occurs in COVID-19 patients, such as dexamethasone or other corticosteroids and IL-6 inhibitors, including sarilumab, tocilizumab, and siltuximab. However, the efficacy of these treatments have been shown to be inconsistent. Compounds that activate the vagus nerve-mediated cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex, such as the 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, GTS-21, attenuate ARDS/inflammatory lung injury by decreasing the extracellular levels of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) in the airways and the circulation. It is possible that HMGB1 may be an important mediator of the \\"cytokine-storm syndrome.\\" Notably, high plasma levels of HMGB1 have been reported in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19, and there is a significant negative correlation between HMGB1 plasma levels and clinical outcomes. Nicotine can activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex, which attenuates the up-regulation and the excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Therefore, we hypothesize that low molecular weight compounds that activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex, such as nicotine or GTS-21, may represent a potential therapeutic approach to attenuate the dysregulated inflammatory responses in patients with severe COVID-19.","output":"From nicotine to the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex - Can nicotine alleviate the dysregulated inflammation in COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has raised some important interrogations on minimally invasive gynaecological surgery. The International Society of gynaecological Endoscopists (ISGE) has taken upon itself the task of providing guidance and best practice policies for all practicing gynaecological endoscopists. Factors affecting decision making processes in minimal invasive surgery (MIS) vary depending on factors such as the phase of the pandemic, policies on control and prevention, expertise and existing infrastructure. Our responsibility remains ensuring the safety of all health care providers, ancillary staff and patients during this unusual period. We reviewed the current literature related to gynecological and endoscopic surgery during the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) crisis. Regarding elective surgery, universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection should be carried out wherever possible 40 h prior to surgery. In case of confirmed positive case of SARS-CoV-2, surgery should be delayed. Priority should be given to relatively urgent cases such as malignancies. ISGE supports medical optimization and delaying surgery for benign non-life-threatening surgeries. When possible, we recommend to perform cases by laparoscopy and to allow early discharges. Any procedure with risk of bowel involvement should be performed by open surgery as studies have found a high amount of viral RNA (ribonucleic acid) in stool. Regarding urgent surgery, each unit should create a risk assessment flow chart based on capacity. Patients should be screened for symptoms and symptomatic patients must be tested. In the event that a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 is found, every attempt should be made to optimize medical management and defer surgery until the patient has recovered and only emergency or life-threatening surgery should be performed in these cases. We recommend to avoid intubation and ventilation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and if at all possible local or regional anesthesia should be utilized. Patients who screen or test negative may have general anesthesia and laparoscopic surgery while strict protocols of infection control are upheld. Surgery in screen-positive as well as SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that cannot be safely postponed should be undertaken with full PPE with ensuring that only essential personnel are exposed. If available, negative pressure theatres should be used for patients who are positive or screen high risk. During open and vaginal procedures, suction can be used to minimize droplet and bioaerosol spread. In a patient who screens low risk or tests negative, although carrier and false negatives cannot be excluded, laparoscopy should be strongly considered. We recommend, during minimal access surgeries, to use strategies to reduce production of bioaerosols (such as minimal use of energy, experienced surgeon), to reduce leakage of smoke aerosols (for example, minimizing the number of ports used and size of incisions, as well as reducing the operating pressures) and to promote safe elimination of smoke during surgery and during the ports closure (such as using gas filters and smoke evacuation systems). During the post-peak period of pandemic, debriefing and mental health screening for staff is recommended. Psychological support should be provided as needed. In conclusion, based on the existent evidence, ISGE largely supports the current international trends favoring laparoscopy over laparotomy on a case by case risk evaluation basis, recognizing the different levels of skill and access to minimally invasive procedures across various countries.","output":"International society for gynecologic endoscopy (ISGE) guidelines and recommendations on gynecological endoscopy during the evolutionary phases of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human noroviruses are the most common non-bacterial cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks with new variants and genotypes frequently emerging. The origin of these new viruses is unknown; however, animals have been proposed as a potential source as human noroviruses have been detected in animal species. Here we investigated the potential of animals to serve as reservoir of human noroviruses, by testing noroviruses attachment to formalin-fixed intestinal tissues of a range of potential reservoir animals. We set up a novel method to study norovirus binding using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled virus-like particles. In humans, noroviruses interact with histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), carbohydrates that are expressed, among others, on the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract. In animals, this interaction is not well understood. To test if virus binding depends on HBGAs, we characterized the HBGA phenotype in animal tissues by immunohistochemistry. With the exception of the black-headed gull and the straw-coloured fruitbat, we observed attachment of several human norovirus genotypes to the intestinal epithelium of all tested animal species. We did, however, not find an association between the expression of a specific HBGA phenotype and VLP attachment. We show that selected human noroviruses can attach to small intestinal tissues across species, supporting the hypothesis that human noroviruses could reside in an animal reservoir. However, whether this attachment can subsequently lead to infection, needs to be further assessed.IMPORTANCE Noroviruses are a major cause of acute gastroenteritis in humans. New norovirus variants and recombinants (re-)emerge regularly in the human population. From animal experiments and surveillance studies it has become clear that at least seven animal models are susceptible to infection with human strains and that domesticated and wild animals shed human noroviruses in their faeces. As virus attachment is a first important step for infection we used a novel method utilising FITC-labelled VLPs to test for norovirus attachment to intestinal tissues of potential animal hosts. We further characterized these tissues with regards to their HBGA expression, a well-studied norovirus susceptibility factor in humans. We found attachment of several human strains to a variety of animal species independent of their HBGA phenotype. This supports the hypothesis that human strains could reside in an animal reservoir.","output":"Human noroviruses attach to intestinal tissue of a broad range of animal species."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease, leads to a global pandemic with high morbidity and mortality.

Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, is one of the most practical treatment options against the outbreak. In this study, we present a novel strategy for in-silico molecular modeling screening for potential drugs that may interact with multiple main proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Targeting multiple viral proteins is a novel drug discovery concept in that it enables the potential drugs to act on different stages of the virus' life cycle, thereby potentially maximizing the drug potency. We screened 2,631 FDA-approved small molecules against four key proteins of SARS-CoV-2 that are known as attractive targets for anti-viral drug development. In total, we identified 29 drugs that could actively interact with two or more target proteins, with 5 drugs (Avapritinib, Bictegravir, Ziprasidone, Capmatinib and Pexidartinib) being common candidates for all four key host proteins and 3 of them possessing the desirable molecular properties. By overlaying docked positions of drug candidates onto individual host proteins, it has been further confirmed that the binding site conformations are conserved.

As there is no definite antiviral therapy for the treatment of cases with COVID-19 the best option for slowing down the pandemic and reducing mortality rates is protection against the virus of interest. To achieve this goal obtaining information about how first cases infected with COVID-19 is crucial. Hence, this study aims to review the studies published in peer-reviewed journals to report the first confirmed cases with COVID-19.

The results of this review suggested that timely reports of the confirmed cases, notifying World Health Organization and providing information to the general population about the methods of spreading the virus would have decreased the number of infected cases and mortality rates. In addition, the travel history of the first confirmed cases in various countries suggested that prompt actions in restricting travels and closing borders could be an efficient strategy in preventing the transmission of the disease outside of the affected sites.

The Chinese government implemented strong intervention measures in the early stage of the epidemic, including strict travel bans and social distancing policies. Prioritizing the analysis of different contributing factors to outbreak outcomes is important for the precise prevention and control of infectious diseases. We proposed a novel framework for resolving this issue and applied it to data from China. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically identify national-level and city-level contributing factors to the control of COVID-19 in China. METHODS: Daily COVID-19 case data and related multidimensional data, including travel-related, medical, socioeconomic, environmental, and influenza-like illness factors, from 343 cities in China were collected. A correlation analysis and interpretable machine learning algorithm were used to evaluate the quantitative contribution of factors to new cases and COVID-19 growth rates during the epidemic period (ie, January 17 to February 29, 2020). RESULTS: Many factors correlated with the spread of COVID-19 in China. Travel-related population movement was the main contributing factor for new cases and COVID-19 growth rates in China, and its contributions were as high as 77% and 41%, respectively. There was a clear lag effect for travel-related factors (previous vs current week: new cases, 45% vs 32%; COVID-19 growth rates, 21% vs 20%). Travel from non-Wuhan regions was the single factor with the most significant impact on COVID-19 growth rates (contribution: new cases, 12%; COVID-19 growth rate, 26%), and its contribution could not be ignored. City flow, a measure of outbreak control strength, contributed 16% and 7% to new cases and COVID-19 growth rates, respectively. Socioeconomic factors also played important roles in COVID-19 growth rates in China (contribution, 28%). Other factors, including medical, environmental, and influenza-like illness factors, also contributed to new cases and COVID-19 growth rates in China. Based on our analysis of individual cities, compared to Beijing, population flow from Wuhan and internal flow within Wenzhou were driving factors for increasing the number of new cases in Wenzhou. For Chongqing, the main contributing factor for new cases was population flow from Hubei, beyond Wuhan. The high COVID-19 growth rates in Wenzhou were driven by population-related factors. CONCLUSIONS: Many factors contributed to the COVID-19 outbreak outcomes in China. The differential effects of various factors, including specific city-level factors, emphasize the importance of precise, targeted strategies for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak and future infectious disease outbreaks.","output":"Impact of Systematic Factors on the Outbreak Outcomes of the Novel COVID-19 Disease in China: Factor Analysis Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) highlights the shortcomings of the current testing paradigm for viral disease diagnostics. Here, we report a stepwise protocol for an RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test for rapid and naked-eye molecular diagnosis of COVID-19. The test employs a unique dual-prong approach that integrates nucleic acid (NA) amplification and plasmonic sensing for point-of-care detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with a sample-to-assay response time of <1 h. The RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test utilizes plasmonic gold nanoparticles capped with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) as a colorimetric reporter to detect the amplified nucleic acid from the COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. The ASOs are specific for the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene, and binding of the ASOs to their target sequence results in the aggregation of the plasmonic gold nanoparticles. This highly specific agglomeration step leads to a change in the plasmonic response of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, when tested using clinical samples, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the test were found to be >98.4%, >96.6% and 100%, respectively, with a detection limit of 10 copies/L. The test can easily be adapted to diagnose other viral infections with a simple modification of the ASOs and primer sequences. It also provides a low-cost, rapid approach requiring minimal instrumentation that can be used as a screening tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at point-of-care settings in resource-poor situations. The colorimetric readout of the test can even be monitored using a handheld optical reader to obtain a quantitative response.

Going beyond mere epidemiological tallying, the potential for racial-justice interventions, including reparations payments, to ameliorate these disparities has not been adequately explored. METHODS: We compared the COVID-19 time-varying Rt curves of relatively disparate polities in terms of social equity (South Korea vs. Louisiana). Next, we considered a range of reproductive ratios to back-calculate the transmission rates ?ia??j for 4a?cells of the simplified next-generation matrix (from which R0 is calculated for structured models) for the outbreak in Louisiana. Lastly, we considered the potential structural effects monetary payments as reparations for Black American descendants of persons enslaved in the U.S. would have had on pre-intervention ?ia??j and consequently R0. RESULTS: Once their respective epidemics begin to propagate, Louisiana displays Rt values with an absolute difference of 1.3-2.5 compared to South Korea. It also takes Louisiana more than twice as long to bring Rt below 1. Reasoning through the consequences of increased equity via matrix transmission models, we demonstrate how the benefits of a successful reparations program (reflected in the ratio ?ba??b/?wa??w) could reduce R0 by 31-68%. DISCUSSION: While there are compelling moral and historical arguments for racial-injustice interventions such as reparations, our study considers potential health benefits in the form of reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk.

SARS-CoV2 virus-like particles (VLPs) offer a BSL-1, replication-incompetent system that can be used to evaluate virus assembly and virus-cell entry processes in tractable cell culture conditions. Here, we describe a SARS-CoV2 VLP system that utilizes nanoluciferase (Nluc) fragment complementation to track assembly and entry. We utilized the system in two ways. Firstly, we investigated the requirements for VLP assembly. VLPs were produced by concomitant synthesis of three viral membrane proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), and matrix (M), along with the cytoplasmic nucleocapsid (N). We discovered that VLP production and secretion were highly dependent on N proteins. N proteins from related betacoronaviruses variably substituted for the homologous SARS-CoV2 N, and chimeric betacoronavirus N proteins effectively supported VLP production if they contained SARS-CoV2 N carboxy-terminal domains (CTD). This established the CTDs as critical features of virus particle assembly. Secondly, we utilized the system by investigating virus-cell entry. VLPs were produced with Nluc peptide fragments appended to E, M, or N proteins, with each subsequently inoculated into target cells expressing complementary Nluc fragments.

In particular, rapid testing in settings such as the emergency department (ED) could improve time to diagnosis and promote proper infection control measures. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented the Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 method for screening symptomatic ED patients. However, due to concerns of suboptimal sensitivity, samples with a negative result were reflexed to the lab for confirmatory testing by the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo RT-PCR method. This study analyzed 6773 ID NOW results from April 2020 to September 2020 in the ED, of which 10% (n = 673) were positive and reported directly. The rest 90% (n = 6100) were negative and reflexed to RT-PCR. Among them, 3% (n = 175) turned positive on RT-PCR while 97% (n = 5925) of the results were consistently negative. The cycle threshold (Ct) values of the false-negative samples (n = 175) showed 90% (n = 158) of them with relatively low viral loads (Ct  30) with median Ct value at 35, while a number of samples (n = 17) had low Ct values (Ct < 30) and no clear explanation for false-negative results. Our study demonstrates that the Abbott ID NOW, despite it's sensitivity limitations, was capable of providing near real-time results for 10% of symptomatic patients presenting to the ED allowing for improved management and workflow. However, our study findings emphasize the need to reflex negative specimens to a higher sensitivity method when prevalence is high and false-negative results are intolerable.","output":"Application of Abbott ID NOW in the emergency department for SARS-CoV-2 detection: A medical centers perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To understand the impact of digital communication using email and text between young people and their health care team on those in close supporting roles.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional, diagnostic study. Participants with a previous diagnosis of diabetes from three Chinese community healthcare centers were enrolled in the study. Single-field color fundus photography was obtained and analyzed by the AI system and two ophthalmologists. Primary outcome measures included the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the AI system in detecting DR and diabetic macular edema (DME). Results: In this study, 443 subjects (848 eyes) were enrolled, and 283 (63.88%) were men. The mean age was 52.09 (11.51) years (range 18-82 years); 266 eyes were diagnosed with any DR, 233 with more-than-mild diabetic retinopathy (mtmDR), 112 with vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (vtDR), and 57 with DME. The image ability of the AI system was as high as 99.06%, whereas its sensitivity and specificity varied significantly in detecting DR with different severities. The sensitivity/specificity to detect any DR was 75.19% (95%CI 69.47-80.17)/93.99% (95%CI 91.65-95.71), mtmDR 78.97% (95%CI 73.06-83.90)/92.52% (95%CI 90.07-94.41), vtDR 33.93% (95%CI 25.41-43.56)/97.69% (95%CI 96.25-98.61), and DME 47.37% (95%CI 34.18-60.91)/93.99% (95%CI 91.65-95.71).

Existing surveillance provides a proxy of the COVID-19 caseload and mortalities; however, these measures make it difficult to identify the dynamics of the pandemic and places where outbreaks are likely to occur. Moreover, existing surveillance techniques have failed to measure the dynamics of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide additional surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission to track changes in the speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence in the transmission of the pandemic more accurately than existing metrics. METHODS: Through a longitudinal trend analysis, we extracted COVID-19 data over 45 days from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to monitor the daily number of cases in the LAC as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the ArellanoCBond estimator in R. COVID-19 transmission rates were tracked for the LAC between September 30 and October 6, 2020, and between October 7 and 13, 2020. RESULTS: The LAC saw a reduction in the speed, acceleration, and jerk for the week of October 13, 2020, compared to the week of October 6, 2020, accompanied by reductions in new cases and the 7-day moving average. For the week of October 6, 2020, Belize reported the highest acceleration and jerk, at 1.7 and 1.8, respectively, which is particularly concerning, given its high mortality rate. The Bahamas also had a high acceleration at 1.5. In total, 11 countries had a positive acceleration during the week of October 6, 2020, whereas only 6 countries had a positive acceleration for the week of October 13, 2020. The TAC displayed an overall positive trend, with a speed of 10.40, acceleration of 0.27, and jerk of C0.31, all of which decreased in the subsequent week to 9.04, C0.81, and C0.03, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Metrics such as new cases, cumulative cases, deaths, and 7-day moving averages provide a static view of the pandemic but fail to identify where and the speed at which SARS-CoV-2 infects new individuals, the rate of acceleration or deceleration of the pandemic, and weekly comparison of the rate of acceleration of the pandemic indicate impending explosive growth or control of the pandemic.

Significant mitigation efforts have been implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19 but the role of ambient noise and elevated vocal effort on airborne transmission have not been widely reported. Elevated vocal effort has been shown to increase emission of potentially infectious respiratory droplets, which can remain airborne for up to several hours. Multiple confirmed clusters of COVID-19 transmission were associated with settings where elevated vocal effort is generally required for communication, often due to high ambient noise levels, including crowded bars and restaurants, meat packing facilities, and long-stay nursing homes. Clusters of COVID-19 transmission have been frequently reported in each of these settings. Therefore, analysis of COVID-19 transmission clusters in different settings should consider whether higher ambient noise levels, which are associated with increased vocal effort, may be a contributing factor in those settings. Mitigation strategies that include reduction of ambient noise, softer speech practices, and the use of technology such as microphones and speakers to decrease vocal effort will likely reduce the risk of transmitting COVID-19 or other airborne pathogens.","output":"Increased ambient noise and elevated vocal effort contribute to airborne transmission of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Aim To describe Brazilian web survey methods termed DIABETESvid by assessing the diabetic individuals self-care practices and their resilience in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Following a PED outbreak that occurred in China in 2010, the disease was identified for the first time in the United States in April 2013, and was reported in many other countries worldwide from 2013 to 2014. As a novel approach to elucidate the epidemiological relationship between PEDV strains, we explored their genome sequences to identify the motifs that were shared within related strains. Of PED outbreaks reported in many countries during 2013C2014, 119 PEDV strains in Japan, USA, Canada, Mexico, Germany, and Korea were selected and used in this study. We developed a motif mining program, which aimed to identify a specific region of the genome that was exclusively shared by a group of PEDV strains. Eight motifs were identified (M1CM8) and they were observed in 41, 9, 18, 6, 10, 14, 2, and 2 strains, respectively. Motifs M1CM6 were shared by strains from more than two countries, and seemed to originate from one PEDV strain, Indiana12.83/USA/2013, among the 119 strains studied. BLAST search for motifs M1CM6 revealed that M3CM5 were almost identical to the strain ZMDZY identified in 2011 in China, while M1 and M2 were similar to other Chinese strains isolated in 2011C2012. Consequently, the PED outbreaks in these six countries may be closely related, and multiple transmissions of PEDV strains between these countries may have occurred during 2013C2014. Although tools such as phylogenetic tree analysis with whole genome sequences are increasingly applied to reveal the connection between isolates, its interpretation is sometimes inconclusive. Application of motifs as a tool to examine the whole genome sequences of causative agents will be more objective and will be an explicit indicator of their relationship.","output":"Genomic Motifs as a Novel Indicator of the Relationship between Strains Isolated from the Epidemic of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea in 2013-2014"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the health crisis, it is vital to protect not only the critical sectors of the economy, the assets, technology, and infrastructure, but first and foremost, it is fundamental to protect jobs and workers.

The measures aiming to reduce economic activity and social contacts lead to a reduction of labor demand and implicitly to the increase of the unemployment rate. In this context, it becomes even more relevant to be able to monitor the unemployment rate, providing relevant forecasts that include the effects of market shocks. Thus, our paper aims to forecast the unemployment rate for the period 2020C2023 using the Box-Jenkins methodology based on ARIMA models, exploring also the uncertainty based on fan charts. Although the baseline forecast offers valuable information, a good understanding of risks and uncertainties related to this forecast is equally important.

Changes in pulse pressure induced by the passive leg raising test (PLR-PP) as marker of fluid responsiveness, assessed prior to sedation, may predict hemodynamic changes. The present study was to investigate the power of the PLR test in critically ill patients in predicting hypotension induced by the induction of dexmedetomidine sedation. METHODS Fluid responsiveness was estimated by a passive leg raising (PLR) test before dexmedetomidine sedation. Patients were assigned to either the \\"Nonresponders\\" or \\"Responders\\" group according to their hemodynamic responses to the PLR test (\\"Nonresponders\\", PLR-PP < 10.3%; \\"Responders\\", PLR-PP  10.3%). Sedation was performed with a dexmedetomidine infusion (0.5 g/kg over a 10-minute loading period, then 0.2 - 0.7 gkg(-1)h(-1)) and titrated to maintain the target Richmond agitation sedation scale (RASS) score in the range of -2 to -1 and the bispectral index value in the range of 60 to 75. Radial artery pulse pressure, heart rate (HR), and central venous pressure (CVP) were measured at each phase of the study procedure. Hemodynamic fluctuations during the use of dexmedetomidine sedation were recorded and compared between the two groups. RESULTS Fifty patients had a median (25% - 75% interquartile range) of 71 (61 - 78) years old were studied. At baseline, 39 of the 50 patients were \\"Nonresponders\\" and 11 were \\"Responders\\". Following dexmedetomidine sedation, patients classified as \\"Responders\\" had a significantly greater systolic blood pressure decrease during the induction of dexmedetomidine sedation than the \\"Nonresponders\\" ((-26.3  6.8)% vs. -11.8  8.5)%, P < 0.001). In addition, the \\"Responders\\" group required significantly more fluid boluses (8 vs. 3; P < 0.001) and vasopressors (2 vs. 0; P < 0.05) than the \\"Nonresponders\\" group to restore blood pressure. Finally, PLR-PP was positively correlated with changes in systolic blood pressure (PLR-SBP) (r(2) = 0.576; P < 0.001) and significantly correlated with dexmedetomidine infusion-induced changes in SBP (r(2) = 0.202; P < 0.05). AUC for PLR-PP was 0.84 (95%CI 0.71 - 0.93). PLR-PP predicted hypotension with a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 92%. CONCLUSIONS The fluid responsiveness assessment pre-sedation was found to predict blood pressure fluctuation during the induction of dexmedetomidine sedation. The PLR test conducted prior to sedation may be a useful tool to identify patients with a high risk of hemodynamic events and may be used to indicate the need for prophylactic treatment.","output":"Changes in arterial blood pressure induced by passive leg raising predict hypotension during the induction of sedation in critically ill patients without severe cardiac dysfunction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: There have been several reports of the incidental detection of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia on Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) studies, which represent the potential role of molecular imaging in detection and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Searches of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases along with major gastroenterology annual meetings were performed through March 2017. Measured outcomes for comparative effectiveness and safety including improvement in hemoglobin levels, transfusion dependence, number of treatment sessions, complications, follow-up, and author-reported endoscopic success were compared among RFA and APC studies. RESULTS In total, 24 studies (n=508) involving APC and 9 studies (n=104) on RFA were included. Mean age of patients included was comparable in both groups (65.337.80 y for APC vs. 66.966.23 y for RFA; P=0.98). Pooled mean follow-up was significantly longer for APC compared with RFA (19.5213.11 vs. 7.433.72 mo; P<0.001). In total, 47% of RFA patients were refractory to previous treatment with APC. RFA required fewer mean treatment sessions compared with APC (2.10 vs. 3.39, respectively; P<0.001). RFA resulted in fewer and less severe complications as compared with APC (1.92% vs. 5.12%, respectively; P<0.001). Although the reported endoscopic success was better with RFA compared with APC (97% vs. 66%; P<0.001), the posttreatment pooled hemoglobin increase and reduction in transfusion dependence was higher for APC compared with RFA [weighted mean difference 3.10 g/dL (95% confidence interval, 2.92-3.28) vs. 1.95 g/dL (95% confidence interval, 1.62-2.26); P<0.001; and 88% vs. 66%; P<0.001, for APC and RFA, respectively].

Such characteristics and their breath-by-breath variability might be useful indicators of respiratory health. To enable breath-by-breath characterization of respiratory kinematics, we developed a method to detect breaths using motion sensors. In 34 volunteers who underwent maximal exercise testing, we used 8 motion sensors to record upper rib, lower rib and abdominal kinematics at 3 exercise stages (rest, lactate threshold and exhaustion). We recorded volumetric air flow signals using clinical exercise laboratory equipment and synchronized them with kinematic signals. Using instantaneous phase landmarks from the analytic representation of kinematic and flow signals, we identified individual breaths and derived respiratory rate (RR) signals at 1Hz. To evaluate the fidelity of kinematics-derived RR, we calculated bias, limits of agreement, and cross-correlation coefficients (CCC) relative to flow-derived RR. To identify coupling between kinematics and flow, we calculated the Shannon entropy of the relative frequency with which flow landmarks were distributed over the phase of the kinematic cycle. We found good agreement in the kinematics-derived and flow-derived RR signals [bias (95% limit of agreement) = 0.1 ( 7) breaths/minute; CCC median (IQR) = 0.80 (0.48 - 0.91)]. In individual signals, kinematics and flow were well-coupled (entropy 0.9-1.4 across sensors), but the relationship varied within (by exercise stage) and between individuals. The final result was that the flow landmarks did not consistently localize to any particular phase of the kinematic signals (entropy 2.2-3.0 across sensors). The Analysis of Respiratory Kinematics method can yield highly resolved respiratory rate signals by separating individual breaths. This method will facilitate characterization of clinically significant breathing motion patterns on a breath-by-breath basis. The relationship between respiratory kinematics and flow is much more complex than expected, varying between and within individuals.","output":"Analysis of respiratory kinematics: a method to characterize breaths from motion signals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this nationwide study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stroke hospitalization rates, patient characteristics and 30-day case fatality rates. METHODS: All hospitalizations for stroke from January to June of each year from 2017 to 2020 were selected using International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, codes I60 to I64 in the national hospital discharge database. Patient characteristics and management were described according to three time periods: pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown. Weekly incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were computed to compare time trends in the rates of patients hospitalized for stroke as well as in-hospital and 30-day case fatality rates between the years 2017-2019 and 2020. RESULTS: In 2020, between weeks 1 and 24, 55,308 patients were hospitalized for stroke in France.

The remodeling of immune response that is observed among the elderly could explain, at least in part, the age gradient in lethality of COVID-19. In this review, we will discuss the phenomenon of immunosenescence, which entails changes that occur in both innate and adaptive immunity with aging. Furthermore, we will discuss inflamm-aging, a low-grade inflammatory state triggered by continuous antigenic stimulation, which may ultimately increase all-cause mortality. In general, the elderly are less capable of responding to neo-antigens, because of lower na?ve T cell frequency. Furthermore, they have an expansion of memory T cells with a shrinkage of the T cell diversity repertoire. When infected by SARS-CoV-2, young people present with a milder disease as they frequently clear the virus through an efficient adaptive immune response. Indeed, antibody-secreting cells and follicular helper T cells are thought to be effectively activated in young patients that present a favorable prognosis. In contrast, the elderly are more prone to an uncontrolled activation of innate immune response that leads to cytokine release syndrome and tissue damage. The failure to trigger an effective adaptive immune response in combination with a higher pro-inflammatory tonus may explain why the elderly do not appropriately control viral replication and the potential clinical consequences triggered by a cytokine storm, endothelial injury, and disseminated organ injury. Enhancing the efficacy of the adaptive immune response may be an important issue both for infection resolution as well as for the appropriate generation of immunity upon vaccination, while inhibiting inflamm-aging will likely emerge as a potential complementary therapeutic approach in the management of patients with severe COVID-19.","output":"Remodeling of the Immune Response With Aging: Immunosenescence and Its Potential Impact on COVID-19 Immune Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The objective of the study is to investigate diagnostic and clinical processes performed for cardiac contusion in patients with blunt thoracic trauma. METHODS: This study was conducted retrospectively on 65 patients admitted with isolated blunt thoracic trauma to the Emergency Medicine Department. The CT images, the cardiac enzyme levels, the periodic 4-h follow-up electrocardiography (ECGs) in the emer-gency department, and the results of echocardiography, performed at admission and when required according to the clinical status, were investigated. The 1-h and 4-h high-sensitivity troponin I levels were studied, and values above 0.04 ng/ml were considered as positive. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients with isolated thoracic trauma were included in the study, 23 (35.38%) had pulmonary and cardiac contu-sions both. In 23 (35.38%) patients, pulmonary contusion had been present, and cardiac contusion had not been identified at the initial evaluation. However, during clinical follow-up, troponin became positive, dysrhythmia developed, and the trauma affected the heart in four of these patients. In six (9.24%) patients, cardiac contusion was identified without pulmonary contusion. In 13 (20%) patients, no cardiac or pulmonary contusion was identified. troponin elevation was detected in 10 patients without a diagnosis of cardiac contusion who had a pulmonary contusion, hemothorax, and/or pneumothorax at the time of hospital admission and then with normal troponin levels at 4-h control.

Previous studies have shown that allelic variants of the IGHV1-69 gene play a dominant role in protective natural antibody responses to several other viral pathogens, including influenza virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus and, most notably, the SARS-CoV-2-related viruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These allelic variants are commonly known as 51p1-related and differ from the other IGHV1-69 alleles (known as hv1263-related) in the presence of a Phe54 residue in the CDR2 region. Importantly, crystallographic studies have shown that the Phe54 residue is critical for the binding of IGHV1-69 antibodies to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spike proteins. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of 51p1 and hv1263 alleles and the clonality of 51p1- and hv1263-expressing B cells in a large cohort of healthy individuals and COVID-19 patients and correlated the findings with the severity of the disease. aterials and methods: A total of 419 samples were included in the study, of which 78 asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic individuals, 200 hospitalized patients with severe disease, 94 critically ill patients and 47 healthy donors. Peripheral blood was collected 8-20 days after the onset of symptoms and total cellular RNA was extracted from whole blood using an automated procedure. llelle-specific Ig-gene fingerprinting of IgM heavy chain transcripts was used to simultaneously analyse the clonality of the IgM+ B-cell population and the clonality of the 51p1- and hv1263-expressing B cell populations. The significance of the differences in the prevalence of clonal B-cell populations between healthy donors and patients and between patients with different severity of the disease was calculated with the Chi-Square test. Results: Analysis of the clonality of the IgM+ B-cell population showed a polyclonal pattern in most of the investigated healthy individuals (33/47, 70%) but in only 20% of all SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (75/372, p<0.001). A significant difference was also observed between mildly affected and severely/critically ill patients [31/78 (39.7%) vs. 44/294 (15%), respectively) (p<0.001)], but not between severely and critically ill patients [28/200 (14,%) vs. 16/94 (17,1%), (p=n.s.)]. No 51p1 transcripts were detected in 74/372 (19.9%) of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and in 14/47 (29,8%) of the control group (p>0,01), while hv1263 transcripts were not detected in 155/289 (53,6%) and in 27/47 (68,6%) tasted patients and controls, respectively (p>0,05). We did not find a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of 51p1 and hv1263 alleles between patients with different disease severity. However, a significantly higher number of patients displayed clonal expansions of 51p1- or hv1263-expressing B cells (219/372(58.9%) and 118/244 (48,4%), respectively in comparison to healthy donors [5/47(10.6%) and 7/47(14.9%), respectively]. There was no statistically significant difference between mildly affected and severely/critically ill patients in the clonallity status of 51p1- 38/61 (62,3%) and 182/237 (76,7%) respectively or between hv1263- expressing B cells in the same two groups of patients [20/25 (80%) and 98/109 (89,9%), p>0.05]. Conclusions: Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulates clonal expansions of IGHV1-69 -expressing B-cells, but this is independent of the severity of the disease. In addition, no difference in the prevalence of IGHV1-69 alleles was observed between patients at different stages of the disease, indicating that natural neutralizing antibodies encoded by this gene are not an important determinant of COVID-19 severity and progression.

After the outbreak of SARS CoV-2 in Wuhan, China in 2019, the disease turned into a pandemic very rapidly. Mental health is a key issue associated with such outbreaks. To explore the fatigue level among physicians working in designated public and private hospitals in Bangladesh, we conducted a matched case-control study of post-SARS-CoV-2 fatigue. Method: In this study 105 physicians who were diagnosed as COVID-19 infected, got treatment, and declared cured at least 6 weeks before the interview date, were recruited as cases and the same number of age and designation matched healthy physicians as control who are working in the same hospital. Case and control were selected in 1:1 ratio from each of the hospitals. The study population was selected by inclusion and exclusion criteria after taking informed written consent. Data collection was done by a semi-structured questionnaire. Diagnosis of COVID--19 infection was done by detection of SARS CoV-2 antigen by RT-PCR from reference laboratories in Bangladesh or by HRCT Chest. Result: Around two-thirds of the physicians were male (67.6% versus 32.4%). Most of them aged less than forty years (80.5%). The cases had a greater number of comorbid conditions than those who were negative. The FSS score (mean) was much higher for cases (36.7 with standard deviation of 5.3 versus 19.3 standard deviation of 3.8) than the control group with a statistically significant difference with no significant gender differentiation. Similarly, around 67.7% of the previously COVID positive physicians represented in the highest FSS score tertile compared to the respondents in the control group had a mean score of less than 3. The difference was also highly significant. Conclusion: Physicians, who had a previous history of COVID-19 infection had a higher total and mean FSS score, signifying a more severe level of fatigue than the physicians who had never been COVID-19 positive while working in the same hospital irrespective of their age and sex.","output":"Assessment of Post SARS CoV 2 Fatigue among Physicians Working in COVID Designated Hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To report a case of wound neovascularization (Swan syndrome) one year after trabeculectomy favorably treated with two intravitreal ranibizumab injections.

I also retrieved additional results of national studies from preliminary press releases and reports. I assessed the studies for design features and seroprevalence estimates. I estimated the infection fatality rate for each study by dividing the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths by the number of people estimated to be infected in each region. I corrected for the number of immunoglobin (Ig) types tested (IgG, IgM, IgA). FINDINGS: I included 61 studies (74 estimates) and eight preliminary national estimates. Seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.02% to 53.40%. Infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 1.63%, corrected values from 0.00% to 1.54%. Across 51 locations, the median COVID-19 infection fatality rate was 0.27% (corrected 0.23%): the rate was 0.09% in locations with COVID-19 population mortality rates less than the global average (< 118 deaths/million), 0.20% in locations with 118C500 COVID-19 deaths/million people and 0.57% in locations with > 500 COVID-19 deaths/million people.

To achieve this objective, four provincial organizations partnered to establish a single, data\\\\driven system. METHODS: The CEST partnership was driven by COVID\\\\19 questions from Emergency Operational Committee (EOC) of the Saskatchewan Health Authority. CEST included three processes: (a) clarifying the nature and priority of COVID\\\\19 policy and clinical questions; (b) providing Rapid Reviews (RRR) and Evidence Search Reports (ESR); and (c) seeking the requestors' evaluation of the product. A web\\\\based repository, including a dashboard and database, was designed to house ESRs and RRRs and offered a common platform for clinicians, academics, leaders, and policymakers to find COVID\\\\19 evidence. RESULTS: In CEST's first year, 114 clinical and policy questions have been posed resulting in 135 ESRs and 108 RRRs. While most questions (41.3%) originated with the EOC, several other teams were assembled to address a myriad of questions related to areas such as long\\\\term care, public health and prevention, infectious diseases, personal protective equipment, vulnerable populations, and Indigenous health. Initial challenges were mobilization of diverse partners and teams, remote work, lack of public access, and quality of emerging COVID\\\\19 literature.

In this study, we present an integrated computational-experimental approach leading to the discovery of peptide ligands that provide HCP LRVs on par with Protein A. First, the screening of 60,000 peptide variants was performed using a high-throughput search algorithm to identify sequences that ensure IgG affinity binding. Select sequences WQRHGI, MWRGWQ, RHLGWF, and GWLHQR were then negatively screened in silico against a panel of model HCPs to ensure the selection of peptides with high binding selectivity. Candidate ligands WQRHGI and MWRGWQ were conjugated to chromatographic resins and characterized by isothermal binding and breakthrough assays to quantify static and dynamic binding capacity (Qmax and DBC10%), respectively. The resulting Qmax were 52.6 mg of IgG per mL of adsorbent for WQRHGI and 57.48 mg/mL for MWRGWQ, while the DBC10% (2 minutes residence time) were 30.1 mg/mL for WQRHGI and 36.4 mg/mL for MWRGWQ. Evaluation of the peptides by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) confirmed the binding energy predicted in silico, and an amino acid scanning study corroborated the affinity-like binding activity of the peptides.

Instead, endemic transmission may rely on viruses establishing persistent infections within hosts or inducing only short-lived neutralizing immunity. Therefore, studies on insular populations are valuable for developing broader understanding of viral maintenance in bats. The Christmas Island flying-fox (CIFF; Pteropus natalis) is endemic on Christmas Island, a remote Australian territory, and is an ideal model species to understand viral maintenance in small, geographically isolated bat populations. Serum or plasma (n = 190), oral swabs (n = 199), faeces (n = 31), urine (n = 32) and urine swabs (n = 25) were collected from 228 CIFFs. Samples were tested using multiplex serological and molecular assays, and attempts at virus isolation to determine the presence of paramyxoviruses, betacoronaviruses and Australian bat lyssavirus. Analysis of serological data provides evidence that the species is maintaining a pararubulavirus and a betacoronavirus. There was little serological evidence supporting the presence of active circulation of the other viruses assessed in the present study. No viral nucleic acid was detected and no viruses were isolated. Age-seropositivity results support the hypothesis that geographically isolated bat populations can maintain some paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses. Further studies are required to elucidate infection dynamics and characterize viruses in the CIFF. Lastly, apparent absence of some pathogens could have implications for the conservation of the CIFF if a novel disease were introduced into the population through human carriage or an invasive species. Adopting increased biosecurity protocols for ships porting on Christmas Island and for researchers and bat carers working with flying-foxes are recommended to decrease the risk of pathogen introduction and contribute to the health and conservation of the species.","output":"Serological evidence of a pararubulavirus and a betacoronavirus in the geographically isolated Christmas Island flying-fox (Pteropus natalis)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sentinel surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Egypt started in 2000 at 8 sentinel sites geographically distributed all over the country. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 was added to the panel of viral testing by polymerase chain reaction for the first 2 patients with ILI seen at one of the sentinel sites. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A(H1N1) virus co-infection with mild symptoms detected through routine ILI surveillance in Egypt. OBJECTIVE: This report aims to describe how the case was identified and the demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes of the patient. METHODS: The case was identified by Central Public Health Laboratory staff, who contacted the ILI sentinel surveillance officer at the Ministry of Health. The case patient was contacted through a telephone call. Detailed information about the patient's clinical picture, course of disease, and outcome was obtained. The contacts of the patient were investigated for acute respiratory symptoms, disease confirmation, and outcomes. RESULTS: Among 510 specimens collected from patients with ILI symptoms from October 2019 to August 2020, 61 (12.0%) were COVID-19-positive and 29 (5.7%) tested positive for influenza, including 15 (51.7%) A(H1N1), 11 (38.0%) A(H3N2), and 3 (10.3%) influenza B specimens. A 21-year-old woman was confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A(H1N1) virus coinfection. She had a high fever of 40.2 C and mild respiratory symptoms that resolved within 2 days with symptomatic treatment. All five of her family contacts had mild respiratory symptoms 2-3 days after exposure to the confirmed case, and their symptoms resolved without treatment or investigation. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the possible occurrence of SARS-CoV-2/influenza A(H1N1) coinfection in younger and healthy people, who may resolve the infection rapidly. We emphasize the usefulness of the surveillance system for detection of viral causative agents of ILI and recommend broadening of the testing panel, especially if it can guide case management.","output":"Coinfection With SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A(H1N1) in a Patient Seen at an Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Site in Egypt: Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global public health crisis Taiwan experienced two waves of imported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first from China in January to late February, 2020 then from other countries starting in early March As of Dec 14, 2020, 733 cases have been reported in Taiwan, with cases of entire families being infected This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and differentiation of genetic variation among isolates from a cluster of familial COVID-19 infection The parents had pneumonia (Case 14, father, and Case 15, mother), the elder son (Case 17) had mild cough, and the younger son (Case 18) was asymptomatic In this study, four full viral genomes were sequenced by Illumina sequencing directly from specimens Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that these sequences came from Italy, not China, indicating that no major strain has been circulating in Taiwan Several novel mutations were observed in the asymptomatic patient, such as nsp2, nsp12, and nsp14 These mutations may be associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection","output":"Investigation of One Familial Cluster of COVID-19 in Taiwan: Differentiation of Genetic Variation Among Isolates and Implications for Epidemiological Investigation and Surveillance by Genomic Assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: The vaccine supply is likely to be limited in 2021 due to constraints in manufacturing.

Methods: : We analyzed clustering patterns of COVID-19 cases in ArcMap and performed a multiple linear regression model using data of LAN and COVID-19 incidence with adjustment for confounding variables including population density, percent below poverty, and racial factors. Results: : Hotspots of LAN and COVID-19 cases are located in large cities or metro-centers for all 4 states.

In this paper, we develop an inferential method based on ideas from conformal prediction, which can wrap around any survival prediction algorithm to produce calibrated, covariate-dependent lower predictive bounds on survival times. In the Type I right-censoring setting, when the censoring times are completely exogenous, the lower predictive bounds have guaranteed coverage in finite samples without any assumptions other than that of operating on independent and identically distributed data points. Under a more general conditionally independent censoring assumption, the bounds satisfy a doubly robust property which states the following: marginal coverage is approximately guaranteed if either the censoring mechanism or the conditional survival function is estimated well. Further, we demonstrate that the lower predictive bounds remain valid and informative for other types of censoring.

B19 infection is generally self-healing in previously healthy people, but it can cause fatal effects in some high-risk groups and increase its virulence and infectivity. Disseminated B19 infection-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in patients with AH has not been reported yet. Here, we described B19 viremia in an adult patient with AH accompanied by hemolytic anemia (HA), leading to disseminated infection and secondary MODS, as well as self-limiting B19 infections in seven nurses caring for him. Meanwhile, we reviewed the literature on AH and B19 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old male patient with AH accompanied by HA was transferred to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, on March 31, 2021. After supportive treatment, his transaminase and bilirubin levels were reduced, but his anemia worsened. He received a red blood cell (RBC) infusion on April 9 for hemoglobin (Hb) lower than 6 g/dl. On April 13, he suddenly had a high fever. Under empirical anti-infection, his high fever dropped and maintained at a low fever level; however, his anemia worsened. On April 25, he was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute aplastic crisis (AAC), and hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS), which were subsequently confirmed to be related to B19 infection. After methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), empirical anti-infection, and supportive treatment, the lung infection improved, but hematopoietic and liver abnormalities aggravated, and systemic B19 infection occurred. Finally, the patient developed a refractory arrhythmia, heart failure, and shock and was referred to a local hospital by his family on May 8, 2021. Unfortunately, he died the next day. Fourteen days after he was transferred to MICU, seven nurses caring for him in his first two days in the MICU developed self-limiting erythema infectiosum (EI). CONCLUSIONS: B19 infection is self-limiting in healthy people, with low virulence and infectivity; however, in AH patients with HA, it can lead to fatal consequences and high contagion.","output":"Disseminated Human Parvovirus B19 Infection Induced Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome in an Adult Patient With Alcoholic Hepatitis Complicated by Hemolytic Anemia: A Case Report and Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The biology literature presents allometric relations for the specific metabolic rate (SMRk) of an organ k of mass mk within the body of mass mB: SMR_k  mBfk (body mass allometry, BMA).

DISCUSSION: This is the first study to use a multi-modal assessment model to phenotype sarcopenia in these chronic inflammatory diseases. We hope to identify generic as well as disease-specific mechanisms driving sarcopenia. We appreciate that these cohorts do require separate standards of care treatments which limit comparison between groups. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the Health Research Authority - West Midlands Solihull Research Ethics Service Committee Authority (REC reference: 18/WM/0167). Recruitment commenced in January 2019 and will continue until July 2021. The study was halted in March 2020 and again in January 2021 with the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. All data will be stored on a secure server.

However, dysfunctions of this physical barrier are frequently observed in allergic diseases, which are tightly connected with pro- or anti-inflammatory processes. When the epithelial cells are confronted with allergens or pathogens, specific response mechanisms are set in motion, which in homeostasis, lead to the elimination of the invaders and leave permanent traces on the respiratory epithelium. However, allergens can also cause damage in the sensitized organism, which can be ascribed to the excessive immune reactions. The tight interaction of epithelial cells of the upper and lower airways with local and systemic immune cells can leave an imprint that may mirror the pathophysiology. The interaction with effector T cells, along with the macrophages, play an important role in this response, as reflected in the gene expression profiles (transcriptomes) of the epithelial cells, as well as in the secretory pattern (secretomes). Further, the storage of information from past exposures as memories within discrete cell types may allow a tissue to inform and fundamentally alter its future responses.

Accordingly, this makes ACE2 research essential for understanding the zoonotic nature of coronaviruses and identifying novel drugs. Here we present a systematic analysis of the ACE2 conservation and co-evolution protein network across 1,671 eukaryotes, revealing an unexpected conservation pattern in specific metazoans, plants, fungi, and protists. We identified the co-evolved protein network and pinpointed a list of drugs that target this network by using data integration from different sources. Our computational analysis found widely used drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and vasodilators.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infection that has received much attention due to its rapid expansion. Currently, it has been revealed that patients with underlying disease, especially those with kidney disease are more prone to develop complications. Some studies associate kidney transplantation as a risk factor for COVID-19 progression;however, epidemiologic data that demonstrate this are amazingly rare. Methods. we report on six kidney transplant recipients (median age 47 [41-55]) with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19 Results. The most common admission presentations were fever (83.3%), dyspnea, and myalgia. At baseline, immunosuppressive therapy was ceased, prednisolone dose was increased, and all patients received antiviral treatment including hydroxychloroquine and umifenovir. After a median follow-up of 11.5 days from admission, six patients (100%) developed acute kidney injury (AKI), 50% required intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and two patients (33.3%) deceased as a result of deterioration in respiratory status. Conclusion. These findings demonstrate that respiratory involvement may be a risk indicator of in-hospital mortality in kidney recipients with COVID-19. In addition, AKI development in kidney recipients with COVID-19 is of utmost importance given the higher AKI occurrence in these patients compared with others.

One puzzling aspect of COVID-19 is the impressive variation in disease manifestations among infected individuals, from a majority who are asymptomatic or exhibit mild symptoms to a smaller, largely age-dependent fraction who develop life-threatening conditions. Some of these differences are likely the consequence of host genetic factors. Systems genetics using diverse and replicable cohorts of isogenic mice represents a powerful way to dissect those host genetic differences that modulate microbial infections. Here we report that the two founders of the large BXD family of miceC57BL/6J and DBA/2J, differ substantially in their susceptibility to a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV, MA15. Following intranasal viral challenge, DBA/2J develops a more severe disease than C57BL/6J as evidenced by more pronounced and sustained weight loss. Disease was accompanied by high levels of pulmonary viral replication in both strains early after infection but substantially delayed viral clearance in DBA/2J. Our data reveal that the parents of the BXD family are segregated by clear phenotypic differences during MA15 infection and support the feasibility of using this family to systemically dissect the complex virus-host interactions that modulate disease progression and outcome of infection with SARS-CoV, and provisionally also with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Differing susceptibility of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J miceparents of the murine BXD family, to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case series describes morbilliform and other rash presentations among schoolchildren during a March 2014 outbreak of influenza\\\\like illness (ILI) in British Columbia, Canada.

Therefore, there is a need to investigate techniques that might further reduce postoperative pain. This study assessed the safety and efficacy of using a transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS Forty-six patients were analyzed in the trial and were randomized to undergo the TAP block procedure with either bupivacaine (n=24) or saline placebo (Control n=22) injected into the muscle plane. Prefilled syringes were dispensed with the group allocation concealed to maintain blinding. After surgery, the amount of morphine, level of pain, and measures of recovery were recorded. RESULTS The amount of morphine used 6 hr after surgery was significantly lower in patients receiving TAP block with bupivacaine compared with the control (presented as mean [SD], 12.4 [8.4] vs. 21.2 [14.0] mg; P=0.015). However, the total amount of morphine used was similar in both groups 45.6 [31.4] vs. 52.7 [28.8] mg; P=0.771. Patients in the bupivacaine group experienced significantly less pain on postoperative days 1 (score, 19 [15] vs. 37 [20]; P=0.003) and 2 (score, 11 [10] vs. 19 [13]; P=0.031).

In this paper, using an analytical model, we show how the accuracy of a test in detecting the underlying state affects the demand for the information product differentially across heterogeneous agents. Correspondingly, the test accuracy can serve as a rationing device to ensure that the limited supply of information products is appropriately allocated to the heterogeneous agents.

METHODS: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the air and on environmental surfaces around hospitalised patients, with and without respiratory symptoms, was investigated. Environmental sampling was carried out within eight hospitals in England during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Samples were analysed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus isolation assays. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on 30 (8.9%) of 336 environmental surfaces. Ct values ranged from 288 to 391 equating to 22 x 105 to 59 genomic copies/swab. Concomitant bacterial counts were low, suggesting the cleaning performed by nursing and domestic staff across all eight hospitals was effective. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in four of 55 air samples taken <1 m from four different patients. In all cases, the concentration of viral RNA was low and ranged from <10 to 460 genomic copies per m3 of air. Infectious virus was not recovered from any of the PCR positive samples analysed. CONCLUSIONS: Effective cleaning can reduce the risk of fomite (contact) transmission but some surface types may facilitate the survival, persistence and/or dispersal of SARS-CoV-2. The presence of low or undetectable concentrations of viral RNA in the air supports current guidance on the use of specific PPE ensembles for aerosol and non-aerosol generating procedures.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 within the healthcare environment: a multicentre study conducted during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study utilizes the non-linear least squares method to estimate the impact of temperature on COVID-19 cases per million in forty-three countries, divided into three groups as follows: the first group is composed of thirteen countries that announced the first COVID-19 cases in January 2020, while the second and third groups contain thirteen and seventeen countries, respectively, that witnessed the pandemic for the first time in February and March of the same year.

Different from laboratory-controlled expression in the past, images in the wild contain more uncertainties, such as different forms of face information occlusion, ambiguous facial images, noisy labels, and so on. Among them, real-world facial occlusion is the most general and crucial challenge for FER. In addition, because of the COVID-19 disease epidemic, people have to wear masks in public, which brings new challenges to FER tasks. Due to the recent success of the Transformer on numerous computer vision tasks, we propose a Collaborative Attention Transformer (CAT) network that first uses Cross-Shaped Window Transformer as the backbone for the FER task. Meanwhile, two attention modules are collaborated. Channel-Spatial Attention Module is designed to increase the attention of the network to global features. Moreover, Window Attention Gate is used to enhance the ability of the model to focus on local details.

Increasingly, renal ablation is performed via a percutaneous approach. However, most urologists are not formally trained in image-based deployment of ablation needles. To address this need, we created a novel training model to teach urologists to perform precise and accurate percutaneous needle placement. This teaching model was implemented as part of a recent training course on tissue ablation organized by the American Urological Association. METHODS Two fresh frozen human cadavers (Anatomic Gifts Registry, Hanover, Maryland) were used in the model. Plumber's Putty (Oatey, Cleveland, Ohio) and nonpitted olives soaked in Isovue (Bracco Dianostics, Inc, New York, New York) were used to create ablation targets. Course participants underwent a tutorial on the computed tomography (CT)-guided deployment of a 19-gauge Yueh Needle (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana) or Cool-tip radio-frequency ablation (RFA) probe (Covidien, Inc, Boulder, Colorado). After each needle placement, a CT scan was performed to assess successful deployment. Participants were then queried regarding their experience. RESULTS A total of 18 urologists performed needle or radio-frequency ablation probe placement on 2 cadavers. A mean of 3.39 (range 2-5) attempts was required to hit targets. Subjectively, participants noted an increase in confidence performing percutaneous needle deployment. The cadaver laboratory exposed participants to pretreatment planning, tactile feel of needle placement, needle readjustment, and 3-D spatial relationships of a percutaneous approach. CONCLUSIONS The presented cadaveric model is an effective tool for teaching percutaneous needle placement.

The umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV2) is a nonsegmented, positive-sense RNA virus with an unusually long 3 UTR that is susceptible to NMD. To establish a systemic infection, the PEMV2 long-distance movement protein p26 was previously shown to both stabilize viral RNAs and bind them for transport through the plants vascular system. The current study demonstrated that p26 protects both viral and nonviral messenger RNAs from NMD. Although p26 localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleolus, p26 exerts its anti-NMD effects exclusively in the cytoplasm independently of long-distance movement. Using a transcriptome-wide approach in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana, p26 protected a subset of cellular NMD target transcripts, particularly those containing long, structured, GC-rich 3 UTRs. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that the NMD pathway is highly dysfunctional during PEMV2 infection, with 1,820 (48%) of NMD targets increasing in abundance. Widespread changes in the host transcriptome are common during plant RNA virus infections, and these results suggest that, in at least some instances, virus-mediated NMD inhibition may be a major contributing factor.","output":"The Multifunctional Long-Distance Movement Protein of Pea Enation Mosaic Virus 2 Protects Viral and Host Transcripts from Nonsense-Mediated Decay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence regarding skeletal maturation in patients with cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) and to investigate whether the skeletal maturation is delayed in these patients.

The underlying mechanism of trauma-induced or -associated coagulopathy is tissue injury in the presence of shock and acidosis provoking endothelial damage, activation of inflammation, and coagulation disbalancing. Furthermore, the combination of ongoing blood loss and consumption of blood components that are essential for effective coagulation worsens uncontrolled hemorrhage. Additionally, therapeutic actions, such as resuscitation with replacement fluids or allogeneic blood products, can further aggravate coagulopathy. Of the coagulation factors essential to the clotting process, fibrinogen is the first to be consumed to critical levels during acute bleeding and current evidence suggests that normalizing fibrinogen levels in bleeding patients improves clot formation and clot strength, thereby controlling hemorrhage. Three different therapeutic approaches are discussed controversially. Whole blood transfusion is used especially in the military scenario and is also becoming more and more popular in the civilian world, although it is accompanied by a strong lack of evidence and severe safety issues. Transfusion of allogeneic blood concentrates in fixed ratios without any targets has been investigated extensively with disappointing results.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the current awareness and estimations of individual risks for LRRs after completion of primary treatment for breast cancer among health care professionals (HCPs) in the Netherlands, without using any prediction tools. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was performed among 60 HCPs working in breast cancer care in seven Dutch hospitals and 25 general practitioners (GPs). The survey consisted of eleven realistic surgically treated breast cancer cases. HCPs were asked to estimate the 5-year risk for LRRs for each case, which was compared to the estimations by the INFLUENCE-nomogram using one-sample Wilcoxon tests. Differences in estimations between HCPs with different specialities were determined using Kruskal-Wallis tests and Dunn tests. RESULTS HCPs tended to structurally overestimate the 5-year risk for LRR on each case. Average overestimations ranged from 4.8 to 26.1%. Groups of HCPs with varying specialities differed significantly in risk estimations. GPs tended to overestimate the risk for LRRs on average the most (15.0%) and medical oncologists had the lowest average overestimation (2.7%).

Most cases were aged 18-40 years (72.9%, 151/207), male (69.6%, 144/207), and engaged in commercial services (62.3%,129/207). The initial symptoms of most cases were no obvious discomfort (55.6%, 15/27) and cough (37.0%, 10/27). In the epidemic associated with Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, 153 cases were reported, in which women accounted for 58.8% (90/153), most cases were over 41 years old (64.7%,99/153), and retired persons accounted for the highest proportion (32.0%,49/153). The initial symptoms of most cases were cough (32.9%, 48/146) and no obvious discomfort (28.1%, 41/146). The household secondary attack rates of the three local epidemics were 11.2%, 5.7% and 11.5%, respectively. The median (P25, P75) of incubation periods were 6.5 (4.0,10.8) d, 4.0 (2.5, 6.0) d and 4.0 (3.0,5.0) d. The serial intervals median (P25, P75) were 4.0 (3.0, 8.0) d, 4.0 (2.5, 6.0) d and 3.0 (2.0,5.0) d. There were significant differences in gender, age, occupation, initial symptoms, household secondary attack rate and incubation period among the three local COVID-19 epidemics (all P<0.05). In the proportion of the case finding way, passive detection in patient treatment were mainly 44.3%(162/366) in the epidemic associated with the outbreak of COVID-19 in Hubei province,but active community case screening [58.5% (121/207) and 27.5% (24/153)] and close contact management in imported case were mostly [33.3% (69/207) and 67.3% (103/153)] in the epidemic associated with the imported COVID-19 cases from Africa and with Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Conclusions: Due to the different sources of infection, strain types and prevention and control strategies, the epidemiological characteristics of the three local COVID-19 epidemics in Guangzhou differed in demographics, clinical symptoms, transmission routes and case finding, which suggested that it is necessary to improve the key population and common symptom monitoring in the routine prevention and control of COVID-19 to prevent the reemerge of the epidemic.","output":"[Epidemiological characteristics of three local epidemics of COVID-19 in Guangzhou]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Excess mortality has been used to assess the health impact of COVID-19 across countries. Democracies aim to build trust in government and enable checks and balances on decision-making, which may be useful in a pandemic. On the other hand, democratic governments have been criticised as slow to enforce restrictive policies and being overly influenced by public opinion. This study sought to understand whether the strength of democratic governance is associated with the variation in excess mortality observed across countries during the pandemic. Methods Through linking open-access datasets we constructed univariable and multivariable linear regression models investigating the association between country EIU Democracy Index (representing the strength of democratic governance on a scale of 0 to 10) and excess mortality rates, from February 2020 to May 2021. We stratified our analysis into high-income and low and middle-income country groups and adjusted for several important confounders. Results Across 78 countries, the mean EIU democracy index was 6.74 (range 1.94 to 9.81) and the mean excess mortality rate was 128 per 100,000 (range -55 to 503 per 100,000). A one-point increase in EIU Democracy Index was associated with a decrease in excess mortality of 26.3 per 100,000 (p=0.002), after accounting for COVID-19 cases, age 65+, gender, prevalence of cardiovascular disease, universal health coverage and the strength of early government restrictions. This association was particularly strong in high-income countries (b=-47.5, p<0.001) but non-significant in low and middle-income countries (b=-10.8, p=0.40). Conclusions Socio-political factors related to the way societies are governed have played an important role in mitigating the overall health impact of COVID-19. Given the omission of such considerations from outbreak risk assessment tools, and their particular significance in high-income countries rated most highly by such tools, this study strengthens the case to broaden the scope of traditional pandemic risk assessment.","output":"Democratic governance and excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 epidemic has had a substantial impact on Polish legislation since the beginning of 2020 The economic slowdown and the consequent fall in the state budget revenue are among the anticipated effects of the epidemic As a result, provisions introducing lex specialis to the Labour Code and certain employment regulations specifying dissolution of employment relationships in some public administration organisations became part of the COVID-19 Act The new legal construct comes down to extensive facilitation in the process of redundancies for employers dismissing their employees The protective function of labour law provisions insofar as it upholds duration of the employment relationship is consequently restricted Provisions of the COVID-19 Act in this respect are unacceptable Each regulation should arise from objectively identified needs to legally govern social relationships and should not inflate laws or undermine citizens trust in legislation The postulate of this legal direction of determining social relationships is particularly important with regard to relationships of employment, in particular, those founded on appointment in public administration The possibility of identical treatment of employees hired on various legal grounds merely appears to conform with the constitutional protection of equality in law Without detriment to employers right to determine employment levels, the new regulations in connection with the COVID-19 epidemic seem unnecessary, since their objectives can be attained by application of normal remedies provided for by labour law ? 2021, Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Marii Curie-Sklodowskiej w Lublinie All rights reserved","output":"Some aspects of labour laws protective function at the time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regular physical activity during childhood and adolescence is associated with health benefits.

METHODS All patients registered for a primary THR in the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register between July 1, 2005, and December 31, 2008, were selected for the study (45,531 patients with 49,219 THRs) and were matched with the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. All patients with a minimum of 4 weeks of continuous outpatient antibiotic treatment within 2 years after their primary THR (1,989 patients with 2,219 THRs) were selected for a medical records review, and the number of cases with PJI was determined. RESULTS The cumulative incidence of PJI within 2 years after primary THR was 0.9% (95% confidence interval, 0.85-1.02; n = 443), and 405 of these had been reoperated. The incidence rate of PJI for the first 3 months was 5 per 10,000 THR-weeks and, thereafter, 0.3 per 10,000 THR-weeks.

The study aims to identify contributing factors in order to minimise future risk to patients and staff. METHOD: A single-site retrospective cohort study including all T&O patients who underwent surgery with confirmed peri-operative COVID-19 infection. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Exposures investigated included diagnostic timing and theatre designation. RESULTS: 92% of participants were not tested pre-operatively. 75% met the criteria for hospital acquired COVID-19. Only 2 patients were operated on in designated COVID-19 theatres. Two lists accounted for 50% of the T&O COVID-positive patients. Remaining patients on both lists were discharged without further testing. Local 30-day mortality rate (25%) was in line with the findings of the international COVIDSurg Study (23.8%). No further COVID-positive T&O cases identified since the introduction of blanket admission swabbing. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients did not meet criteria for pre-operative testing. Thus, were not operated on in appropriately designated theatres despite unknown COVID status, increasing risk of cross-contamination.

However, it has not been investigated in detail how long different NPIs need to be in place to take effect, or how long they should be in place for their maximum effect to unfold. We used global data and a non-parametric machine learning model to estimate the effects of NPIs in relation to how long they have been in place. Here we show that closure and regulation of schools was the most important NPI, associated with a pronounced effect about 10 days after implementation. Restrictions of mass gatherings and restrictions and regulations of businesses were found to have a more gradual effect, and social distancing was associated with a delayed effect starting about 18 days after implementation. Generally, effects increased until about 40 to 50 days after implementation.

Lectins have potent anti-infectivity properties for several RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2.

Lectins have binding affinity to the glycans of SARS-COV-2 Spike glycoprotein that has N-glycosylation sites. Apart from this, the complement lectin pathway is a first line host defense against the viral infection that is activated by mannose-binding lectins. Mannose-binding lectins deficiency in serum influences innate immunity of the host and facilitates infectious diseases including COVID-19. Our accumulated evidence obtained from scientific databases particularly PubMed and Google Scholar databases indicate that mannose-specific/mannose-binding lectins (MBL) have potent efficacies like anti-infectivity, complement cascade induction, immunoadjuvants, DC-SIGN antagonists, or glycomimetic approach, which can prove useful in the strategy of COVID-19 combat along with the glycobiological aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infections and antiviral immunity.

Years after the epidemic was declared over, stigma toward EVD survivors and others affected by the virus is still a major concern, but little is known about the factors that influence stigma toward survivors. This study examines how key personal and ecological factors predicted EVD-related stigma at the height of the 2014C2015 epidemic in Sierra Leone, and the personal and ecological factors that shaped changes in stigma over time. METHODS: Using three waves of survey data from a representative sample in the Western Urban and Western Rural districts of Sierra Leone, this study examines factors associated with self-reported personal stigma toward Ebola survivors (11 items,  = 0.77) among 1008 adults (74.6% retention rate) from 63 census enumeration areas of the Western Rural and Western Urban districts of Sierra Leone. Participants were randomly sampled at the height of the EVD epidemic and followed up as the epidemic was waning and once the epidemic had been declared over by the WHO. Three-level mixed effects models were fit using Stata 16 SE to examine cross-sectional associations as well as predictors of longitudinal changes in stigma toward EVD survivors. RESULTS: At the height of the EVD epidemic, female sex, household wealth, post-traumatic stress, EVD-related fear and perceived infection risk are a few of the factors which predicted higher levels of stigma toward survivors. On average, stigma toward EVD survivors decreased significantly as the epidemic declined in Sierra Leone, but female sex, EVD fear, and risk perceptions predicted a slower rate of change. CONCLUSION: This study identified key individual and psychosocial characteristics which may predict higher levels of stigma toward infectious disease survivors. Future studies should pursue a better understanding of how personal characteristics and perceptions, including psychosocial distress, fear, and perceived infection risk serve as pathways for stigma in communities affected by infectious disease.

Ten consecutive patients, aged 12 days to 5 years with ARDS and hypoxaemic respiratory failure on conventional ventilation (CV), using a lung protective strategy, were managed with HFOV early in the course of the disease process (median length of CV 4 h). Arterial blood gases, oxygenation index (OI), alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (P(A-a)O(2)) and PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio were prospectively recorded prior to HFOV (0 h) and at predetermined intervals throughout the course of the HFOV protocol.

Launched on September 15, 2018, ELFIN is expected to have a >2.5 year lifetime. Its primary science objective is to resolve the mechanism of storm-time relativistic electron precipitation, for which electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are a prime candidate. From its ionospheric vantage point, ELFIN uses its unique pitch-angle-resolving capability to determine whether measured relativistic electron pitch-angle and energy spectra within the loss cone bear the characteristic signatures of scattering by EMIC waves or whether such scattering may be due to other processes. Pairing identical ELFIN satellites with slowly-variable along-track separation allows disambiguation of spatial and temporal evolution of the precipitation over minutes-to-tens-of-minutes timescales, faster than the orbit period of a single low-altitude satellite (Torbit  90 min). Each satellite carries an energetic particle detector for electrons (EPDE) that measures 50 keV to 5 MeV electrons with  E/E < 40% and a fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) on a 72 cm boom that measures magnetic field waves (e.g., EMIC waves) in the range from DC to 5 Hz Nyquist (nominally) with <0.3 nT/sqrt(Hz) noise at 1 Hz. The spinning satellites (Tspin  3 s) are equipped with magnetorquers (air coils) that permit spin-up or -down and reorientation maneuvers. Using those, the spin axis is placed normal to the orbit plane (nominally), allowing full pitch-angle resolution twice per spin. An energetic particle detector for ions (EPDI) measures 250 keV - 5 MeV ions, addressing secondary science. Funded initially by CalSpace and the University Nanosat Program, ELFIN was selected for flight with joint support from NSF and NASA between 2014 and 2018 and launched by the ELaNa XVIII program on a Delta II rocket (with IceSatII as the primary). Mission operations are currently funded by NASA. Working under experienced UCLA mentors, with advice from The Aerospace Corporation and NASA personnel, more than 250 undergraduates have matured the ELFIN implementation strategy; developed the instruments, satellite, and ground systems and operate the two satellites. ELFIN's already high potential for cutting-edge science return is compounded by concurrent equatorial Heliophysics missions (THEMIS, Arase, Van Allen Probes, MMS) and ground stations. ELFIN's integrated data analysis approach, rapid dissemination strategies via the SPace Environment Data Analysis System (SPEDAS), and data coordination with the Heliophysics/Geospace System Observatory (H/GSO) optimize science yield, enabling the widest community benefits. Several storm-time events have already been captured and are presented herein to demonstrate ELFIN's data analysis methods and potential. These form the basis of on-going studies to resolve the primary mission science objective. Broad energy precipitation events, precipitation bands, and microbursts, clearly seen both at dawn and dusk, extend from tens of keV to >1 MeV. This broad energy range of precipitation indicates that multiple waves are providing scattering concurrently. Many observed events show significant backscattered fluxes, which in the past were hard to resolve by equatorial spacecraft or non-pitch-angle-resolving ionospheric missions. These observations suggest that the ionosphere plays a significant role in modifying magnetospheric electron fluxes and wave-particle interactions. Routine data captures starting in February 2020 and lasting for at least another year, approximately the remainder of the mission lifetime, are expected to provide a very rich dataset to address questions even beyond the primary mission science objective.","output":"The ELFIN Mission."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been crucial in curbing COVID-19 in the United States (US). Consequently, relaxing NPIs through a phased re-opening of the US amid still-high levels of COVID-19 susceptibility could lead to new epidemic waves. This calls for a COVID-19 early warning system. Here we evaluate multiple digital data streams as early warning indicators of increasing or decreasing state-level US COVID-19 activity between January and June 2020. We estimate the timing of sharp changes in each data stream using a simple Bayesian model that calculates in near real-time the probability of exponential growth or decay. Analysis of COVID-19-related activity on social network microblogs, Internet searches, point-of-care medical software, and a metapopulation mechanistic model, as well as fever anomalies captured by smart thermometer networks, shows exponential growth roughly 2-3 weeks prior to comparable growth in confirmed COVID-19 cases and 3-4 weeks prior to comparable growth in COVID-19 deaths across the US over the last 6 months. We further observe exponential decay in confirmed cases and deaths 5-6 weeks after implementation of NPIs, as measured by anonymized and aggregated human mobility data from mobile phones. Finally, we propose a combined indicator for exponential growth in multiple data streams that may aid in developing an early warning system for future COVID-19 outbreaks. These efforts represent an initial exploratory framework, and both continued study of the predictive power of digital indicators as well as further development of the statistical approach are needed.","output":"An Early Warning Approach to Monitor COVID-19 Activity with Multiple Digital Traces in Near Real-Time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a new decade began, COVID-19 quickly gained importance as it became the cause of the current global pandemic Research has been focusing on studying the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and investigates possible pharmaceutical approaches With the number of cases increasing every day, globally, multiple drugs are being researched as possible candidates Although multiple drugs show promise in the treatment of COVID-19 via either inhibiting viral replication or preventing fusion of the virus to the ACE2 receptors, further investigation is still warranted and necessary before the admission of any type of pharmaceutical agent Furthermore, several supplements have also been documented in being utilized as treatment of COVID-19 The exact mechanism and efficacy of current candidate drugs are still being explored through clinical trials Despite the advancements in current research with emerging treatments, social distancing and engaging in preventative measures remains crucial to attempt to prevent the occurrence of more cases and deaths, worldwide This review explores various drugs and their mechanism of action which are either currently being used in clinical trials or may be used in the future for the treatment of COVID-19","output":"Emerging Pharmaceutical Treatments of Novel COVID-19: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Growing evidence associates organ dysfunction(s) with impaired metabolism in sepsis. Recent research has increased our understanding of the role of substrate utilization and mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathophysiology of sepsis-related organ dysfunction. The purpose of this review is to present this evidence as a coherent whole and to highlight future research directions. MAIN TEXT: Sepsis is characterized by systemic and organ-specific changes in metabolism. Alterations of oxygen consumption, increased levels of circulating substrates, impaired glucose and lipid oxidation, and mitochondrial dysfunction are all associated with organ dysfunction and poor outcomes in both animal models and patients. The pathophysiological relevance of bioenergetics and metabolism in the specific examples of sepsis-related immunodeficiency, cerebral dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, acute kidney injury and diaphragmatic failure is also described. CONCLUSIONS: Recent understandings in substrate utilization and mitochondrial dysfunction may pave the way for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. These findings could help physicians to identify distinct subgroups of sepsis and to develop personalized treatment strategies. Implications for their use as bioenergetic targets to identify metabolism- and mitochondria-targeted treatments need to be evaluated in future studies.

This is the first analysis: 1) Discussion about the role of the Hospital Pharmacists during the pandemic, and also the assessment of the impact of covid19 in the lipid control. 2)Descriptive analysis; 3) Effectiveness in LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) reduction of alirocumab and evolocumab; 4) Communicate PCSK9i safety Material and methods: It is a prospective Real-World Evidence analysis of patients that take PCSK9i for the first time in the usual clinical practice, and they are included after the first dispensation in the public pharmacy consultations of 12 Hospitals in Galicia from May 2020 to April 2021. Baseline values of LDL-c are the previous values before taking PCSK9 and the follow-up values are 6 in months time. Results: 89 patients were included. 86.5% with cardiovascular disease and 53.9% with statin intolerances. 78.8% of the patients were treated with high intensity statins. Statins most used were rosuvastatin (34.1%) and atorvastatin (20.5%). Baseline value of LDL-c was 148 mg/dL and the follow-up value was 71 mg/dL. The baseline value of patients treated with alirocumab (N=43) was 144 mg/dL and 73 mg/dL in the follow-up. With evolocumab (N=46) was 151 mg/dL in basaline and 69 mg/dL in follow-up.

In examining these commitments, we elucidated emergent themes and gaps in AMR discourse through a qualitative content analysis of global political resolutions, declarations and statements made by members of the United Nations, the World Health Assembly, Food and Agriculture Organization Conferences, World Organisation for Animal Health General Sessions, and the G7 and G20 summits and ministerial meetings between the years 2015 and 2021. Emergent themes included AMR research, surveillance and stewardship. Across sectors, fewer commitments were made for specific action on AMR in the environment. The themes and types of commitments were found to be consistent across time and fora but did not evolve into more concrete or nuanced pledges to action between 2015 and 2021. GAP objectives relating to infection prevention and efforts to address the root drivers of AMR appeared the least frequently in our analysis, indicating a lack of global commitment to take a proactive prevention-focused approach to AMR.","output":"Taking stock of global commitments on antimicrobial resistance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: A strategy for preventing further spread of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic is to detect infections and isolate infected individuals without the need of extensive bio-specimen testing. Objectives: Here we investigate the prevalence of loss of smell and taste among COVID-19 diagnosed individuals and we identify the combination of symptoms, besides loss of smell and taste, most likely to correspond to a positive COVID-19 diagnosis in non-severe cases. Design: Community survey. Setting and Participants: Subscribers of RADAR COVID-19, an app that was launched for use among the UK general population asking about COVID-19 symptoms. Main Exposure: Loss of smell and taste. Main Outcome Measures: COVID-19. Results: Between 24 and 29 March 2020, 1,573,103 individuals reported their symptoms via the app; 26% reported suffering from one or more symptoms of COVID-19. Of those, n=1702 reported having had a RT-PCR COVID-19 test and gave full report on symptoms including loss of smell and taste; 579 were positive and 1123 negative. In this subset, we find that loss of smell and taste were present in 59% of COVID-19 positive individuals compared to 18% of those negative to the test, yielding an odds ratio (OR) of COVID-19 diagnosis of OR[95%CI]=6.59[5.25; 8.27], P= 1.90x10-59 . We also find that a combination of loss of smell and taste, fever, persistent cough, fatigue, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite is predictive of COVID-19 positive test with sensitivity 0.54[0.44; 0.63], specificity 0.86[0.80; 0.90], ROC-AUC 0.77[0.72; 0.82] in the test set, and cross-validation ROC-AUC 0.75[0.72; 0.77]. When applied to the 410,598 individuals reporting symptoms but not formally tested, our model predicted that 13.06%[12.97%;13.15] of these might have been already infected by the virus. Conclusions and Relevance: Our study suggests that loss of taste and smell is a strong predictor of having been infected by the COVID-19 virus. Also, the combination of symptoms that could be used to identify and isolate individuals includes anosmia, fever, persistent cough, diarrhoea, fatigue, abdominal pain and loss of appetite.

METHODS: Patients with post-operative neuroimaging and follow-up of at least one year were included. In EEG-fMRI responses, we defined as \\"primary\\" the cluster with the highest absolute t-value located in the cortex, and evaluated three levels of confidence for the results. The threshold for low confidence was t &#8805; 3.1 (pa?<a?0.005); the one for medium confidence corresponded to correction for multiple comparisons with a false discovery rate of 0.05; and a result reached high confidence when the primary cluster was much more significant than the next highest cluster. Concordance with the resection was determined by comparison to post-operative neuroimaging. RESULTS: We evaluated 106 epilepsy surgeries in 84 patients. An increasing association between concordance and surgical outcome with higher levels of confidence was demonstrated. If the peak response was not resected, the surgical outcome was likely to be poor: for the high confidence level, no patient had a good outcome; for the medium and low levels, only 18% and 28% had a good outcome. The positive predictive value remained low for all confidence levels, indicating that removing the maximum cluster did not ensure seizure freedom.

Severe respiratory manifestations have been the mainstay of illness in adults, with what seems to be rapid deterioration necessitating mechanical ventilation. Only 5% of those tested and found to have COVID-19 have been younger than 19 years, possibly owing to limited testing, as the symptoms in children are usually mild. Symptoms in children include fever, dry cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and fatigue, and in 10% diarrhea or vomiting. Rarely dyspnea or hypoxemia were also described. Blood tests and imaging have been shown to be of little value in children and should only be ordered for those in whom you would normally order these investigations for viral-like illness. No specific therapy is available and supportive care with rest, fluids, and antipyretics for children is the recommended approach. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen for fever and pain can be given. Antiviral and immunomodulatory treatment is not recommended at this time for otherwise healthy children, and corticosteroids should also not be used.

Based on recent evidence, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) II is known to be the target of the COVID-19 spike protein, which enables the virus to penetrate human cells. ACE II also possesses an anti-inflammatory role in many pathologies such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and other conditions, which are the main risk factors of poor prognosis in COVID-19 infection. Changes in tissue ACE II levels are associated with many diseases and hyperinflammatory states, and it is assumed that elevated levels of ACE II could aggravate the course of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RASis) in COVID-19 patients could be hypothetically considered, though sufficient evidence is not presented by the scientific community. In this work, based on the most recent pieces of evidence, the roles of RAS and RASi in immunologic interactions are addressed. Furthermore, the molecular and immunologic aspects of RASi and their potential significance in COVID-19 are discussed.","output":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme as a new immunologic target for the new SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection that emerged from China in December 2019 and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to the airborne nature of its transmission, COVID-19 has spread to the rest of the world rapidly. Thus, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Most of the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 are also seen in malaria and common colds. Most people have shown poor healthcare-seeking behaviour. For this reason, most people tend to self-medicate using medicines that are known to be effective against malaria, common colds, and COVID-19. Among the commonly used medicines in the practice of self-medication include antibacterials, antimalarials, and antivirals. Some vitamins such as vitamin C boost the immune system enabling it to provide effective defence mechanisms against foreign bodies such as microbes. Vitamin C is obtained from foodstuffs such as oranges, broccoli, cabbage, red pepper, cauliflower, spinach, tomatoes and tomato source, sweet and Irish potatoes. However, self-medication may pose consequences such as the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, hypersensitivity reactions as well as dose-dependent toxicities viz dermatoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and hepatoxicity. Infectious diseases caused by antimicrobial-resistant microbes are difficult and, in some instances, impossible to treat thereby leading to increased morbidity and mortality among infected people. Consequently, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses another global public health problem and requires a multisectoral approach to curb. It is our recommendation that all governments ensure that there are adequate medicines and efficient human resources in healthcare facilities as well as sufficient public awareness to prevent people from seeking self-medication.","output":"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices of Community Pharmacists on Antibiotic Resistance and Antimicrobial Stewardship in Lusaka, Zambia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents five select cases of SMEs from China, India, Bahrain and the US, grouped into three archetypes based on their fundamental nature to highlight the unique challenges presented by COVID-19 as well as the strategies adopted to cope with them The lessons distilled from the cases are used to derive a conceptual framework that would guide SMEs in systematically assessing their preparedness to face a future pandemic Additionally, we present a list of suggested audit questions that would help SMEs to assess the vulnerabilities of the key business components The rationale is that such an audit would enable SMEs to systematically assess their pandemic readiness and equip them to be better prepared for the emerging post-COVID new normal IEEE","output":"Lessons from COVID-19 Towards a Pandemic Readiness Audit Checklist for SMEs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The psychological toll of the COVID-19 pandemic is being felt by people around the world.

Thus, although early re-laparotomy tends to be recommended, we conducted this study to evaluate the feasibility of performing definite laparotomy within  48 h in this clinical population. METHODS: The subjects of this retrospective study were 65 patients (n = 24,  48-h group; n = 41, > 48-h group) who underwent DCS and perihepatic packing. The primary outcome was the rate of repacking for bleeding during re-laparotomy and the secondary outcomes were mortality and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: The  48-h group had a higher rate of angioembolization and transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs), fresh frozen plasma, and platelets, but the rates of repacking and mortality were not significantly different between the groups. However, the incidence of pneumonia and ventilation support requirement were significantly lower in the  48-h group than in the > 48-h group. CONCLUSION: The re-laparotomy performed within  48 h after DCS and perihepatic packing is feasible for patients with high grade liver injury, using angioembolization and aggressive transfusion, as required. Early re-laparotomy reduces the need for prolonged ventilator support and the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia.","output":"Early re-laparotomy for patients with high-grade liver injury after damage-control surgery and perihepatic packing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus family has been infecting the human population for the past two decades, but the ongoing coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 has posed an enigmatic challenge to global public health security. Since last year, the mutagenic quality of this virus is causing changes to its genetic material. To prevent those situations, the FDA approved some emergency vaccines but there is no assurance that these will function properly in the complex human body system. In point of view, a short but efficient effort has made in this study to develop an immune epitope-based therapy for the rapid exploitation of SARS-CoV-2 by applying in silico structural biology and advancing immune information strategies. The antigenic epitopes were screened from the Surface, Membrane, Envelope proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and passed through several immunological filters to determine the best possible one. According to this, 7CD4+, 10CD8+ and 5 B-cell epitopes were found to be prominent, antigenic, immunogenic, and most importantly, highly conserved among 128 Bangladeshi and 110 other infected countries SARS-CoV-2 variants. After that, the selected epitopes and adjuvant were linked to finalize the multi-epitope vaccine by appropriate linkers. The immune simulation disclosed that the engineered vaccine could activate both humoral and innate immune responses. For the prediction of an effective binding, molecular docking was carried out between the vaccine and immunological receptors (TLRs). Strong binding affinity and good docking scores clarified the stringency of the vaccines. Furthermore, MD simulation was performed within the highest binding affinity complex to observe the stability. Codon optimization and other physicochemical properties revealed that the vaccine would be suitable for a higher expression at cloning level. So, monitoring the overall in silico assessment, we anticipated that our engineered vaccine would be a plausible prevention against COVID-19.","output":"Development of an in silico multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-COV-2 by prcised immune-informatics approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES The Sibutramine Cardiovascular OUTcomes (SCOUT) trial showed a significantly increased relative risk of nonfatal cardiovascular events, but not mortality, in overweight and obese subjects receiving long-term sibutramine treatment with diet and exercise. We examined the relationship between early changes (both increases and decreases) in body weight and blood pressure, and the impact of these changes on subsequent cardiovascular outcome events. SUBJECTS/METHODS A total of 9804 male and female subjects, aged 55 years or older, with a body mass index of 27-45 kg m(-2) were included in this current subanalysis of the SCOUT trial. Subjects were required to have a history of cardiovascular disease and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus with at least one cardiovascular risk factor (hypertension, dyslipidemia, current smoking or diabetic nephropathy) to assess cardiovascular outcomes. Post hoc subgroup analyses of weight change (categories) and blood pressure were performed overall and by treatment group (6-week sibutramine followed by randomized placebo or continued sibutramine). The primary outcome event (POE) was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, resuscitated cardiac arrest or cardiovascular death. Time-to-event analyses of the POE were performed using Cox regression models with factors for treatment, subgroups and interactions. RESULTS During the initial 6-week sibutramine treatment period, systolic blood pressure decreased progressively with increasing weight loss in hypertensive subjects (-8.110.5 mm Hg with <5 kg weight loss to -10.811.0 mm Hg with ?5 kg weight loss). The highest POE incidence occurred mainly in groups with increases in both weight and blood pressure. However, with long-term sibutramine treatment, a markedly lower blood pressure tended to increase POEs. CONCLUSION Modest weight loss and modest lower blood pressure each reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events, as expected. However, the combination of early marked weight loss and rapid blood pressure reduction seems to be harmful in this obese elderly cardiovascular diseased population.","output":"Changes in body weight and blood pressure: paradoxical outcome events in overweight and obese subjects with cardiovascular disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late December 2019, a group of patients was observed with pneumonia-like symptoms that were linked with a wet market in Wuhan, China.

It has been observed that SARS-CoV-2 patients show a rather long and asymptomatic incubation time. We characterized the abilities to induce and to response to IFN/IFN1 of two or our clinical isolates, SARS-CoV-2/NTU01/TWN/human/2020 and SARS-CoV-2/NTU02/TWN/human/2020, which exhibit only two amino acid differences over the 30kb viral genome. We found that both isolates may infect Huh7, A549 and Calu-3 cells, yet the RIG-I-like receptor-dependent antiviral signaling was poorly induced in these cells in the early infections. Unexpectedly, we found that the intracellular vRNA levels of these isolates were sustained upon to type I/III IFN treatments, and this phenotype was more pronounced in the Taiwan/NTU01/2020 isolate. The type I/III IFN responses are antiviral but partially proviral in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Poor induction and response to innate immunity may contribute to destitute neutralization index of the antibody produced, and indeed we found that the patient serum could not efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virions. With better understandings of the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the host antiviral innate immunity, our report may provide new insights for the regimen of therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.","output":"Distinct Inductions of and Responses to Type I and Type III Interferons Promote Infections in Two SARS-CoV-2 Isolates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seeking to understand the socio-spatial behaviour of the COVID-19 virus in the most impacted area in Brazil, five spatial regression models were analysed to assess the disease distribution in the affected territory.

Since COVID-19 has consequences on mental health, the present study examined the perceived stress level in school students in distance learning during the COVID-19 period. A cross-sectional study of a sample consisting of 385 school students evaluated the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and their concerns and emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that the mean value of the total PSS scores was 19.50  9.28. About 48.6% of students had moderate stress, 28.8% had low stress, and 22.6% had high stress. Significant associations were found between the level of stress and demographic variables: age, gender, educational level, and place of residence. Female students were significantly higher than the male students in the mean score of perceived stress level (20.14 versus 18.13; p-value = 0.018). Females were more likely (53.4%) to have moderate stress than males (38.2%) (p = 0.019). The students aged 15C18 years were significantly higher than those aged 11C14 years in the mean score of perceived stress level (22.64 versus 17.24, respectively; p-value < 0.001). The students aged 15C18 years were also more likely (n = 536, 96.4%) to had high levels of stress than the younger students (p < 0.001). The results showed that secondary school students were significantly higher than primary school students in the mean score of perceived stress level (23.75 versus 16.76, respectively; p < 0.001). Secondary students were also more likely (43.0%) to have high stress than primary students (9.4%) (p < 0.001).

Investors shall rely on signals emitted by technical indicators for their investment decisions making. The aim of this study is to examine the performance of the MA rules in Malaysian stock market during the different stages of the MCO. The sample used comprised 30 largest market capitalization stocks listed in the stock market. The period of study spanned 2 January 2020 to 30 August 2020. More than 50% of the buy signals emitted by (5,60,0.01) were found linked with positive returns in the next trading day during the MCO and CMCO sub-period respectively. Conversely, 41.28% and 34.78% of the sell signals emitted by (5,50,0.01) during the respective MCO and CMCO sub-period were linked with negative returns. Among all the MA rules, (5,60,0.01) generated the highest average return of 0.88% during the MCO and CMCO sub-period. Importantly, MA rules, (5,60,0.01) also generated positive returns during the out-of-sample period. The findings of this study shall contribute to the existing literature related to technical analysis. Besides that, the findings will benefit investors the most, inducing them to generate returns or avoid losses during the critical COVID-19 pandemic period.

Background In late December 2019 a novel coronavirus was identified in China causing severe respiratory disease. The virus causing the infection has been named - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Symptoms are mainly respiratory, around 40% may manifest with mild neurological symptoms. Methods: Methods: We included 35 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized in Intensive Care Unit, with presentation of severe neurological events. Results: Results: Our hospital (San Jos, Tecnolgico de Monterrey) has treated 2,920 patients infected by COVID19 in 1 year, 351 patients have required intubation, 1.19% have severe neurological manifestations and the reported mortality is 11.4%. This cohort includes 82% males, median age 57.9 (14.96 years), first day of consultation by the neurology service was 22.21 (19.8 days), most frequent neurological presentation was encephalitis in 31.4%. The rest of neurological events were 5.7% myasthenic crisis, 2.9% microangiopathy, 5.7% Guillain Barre syndrome, 11.4 % status epilepticus, 22. 9% STROKE, and around 20% presented Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and Autonomic dysfunction in long COVID. Conclusions: Conclusion: Reports of severe neurological involvement in COVID-19 are increasing, which makes this problem particularly relevant to neurological critical care therapy. The nervous system can be directly or, more frequently, indirectly be involved.

To do so, we conducted a field experiment with messages on mailings and tracked native plant vouchers used. Efficacy messages tended to be more effective than normative messages at increasing residents willingness to reach out to others to encourage conservation action, as indicated by a several percentage point increase in native plant voucher use by residents friends and neighbors. Messages sometimes had different impacts on residents based on past behaviors and perceptions related to native plant gardening. Among these subgroups, efficacy and combined efficacy and norm messages most effectively encouraged individual and collective actions, as indicated by increased voucher usage. Our findings suggest that interventions that build residents efficacy for engaging in a conservation behavior and for reaching out to others may be a promising path forward for outreach.

Angiotensin II (Ang II) is the physiologically active mediator and mediates the main pathophysiological actions in RAS. Ang II exerts the effects by activating its receptors, primarily type 1 (AT1R) and type 2 (AT2R). Most of the known pathophysiological effects of Ang II are mediated by AT1R activation. The precise physiological function of AT2R is still not clear. Generally, AT2R is considered to oppose the effects of AT1R. Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein scavenger receptor-1 (LOX-1) is one of the major receptors responsible for binding, internalizing and degrading ox-LDL. The activation of LOX-1 has been known to be related to many pathophysiological events, including endothelial dysfunction and injury, fibroblast growth, and vascular smooth muscle cell hypertrophy. Many of these alterations are present in atherosclerosis, hypertension, and myocardial ischemia and remodeling. A growing body of evidence suggests the existence of a cross-talk between LOX-1 and Ang II receptors. Their interplays are embodied in the reciprocal regulation of their expression and activity. Their interplays are involved in a series of signals. Recent studies suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are important signals responsible for their cross-talk.

The viral infection expanded internationally and World Health Organization announced a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify and measure the effects of this pandemic on anxiety levels and sleep disturbance and the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) among the HCWs in India. METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional study using piloted structured questionnaires with self-reported responses from 368 volunteer males and females HCWs from India. Study participants were identified through social networking sites: Facebook and WhatsApp. The degree of symptoms of anxiety, sleep quality and the availability of PPE was assessed by the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale, Single Sleep Quality scale and questions on availability of PPE. RESULTS: Majority of the study subjects were in the age group 45-60 years and 52.2% were doctors. Severe anxiety scores (GAD>10) were observed in 7.3%; moderate, mild and minimal anxiety was observed in 12.5%, 29.3% and 50.8% HCWs respectively, and 31.5% had poor to fair sleep scores (<6). Univariate analysis showed female gender and inadequate availability of PPE significantly associated with higher anxiety levels (P= 0.01 and 0.01). Sleep disturbance was significantly associated with age<30 years (P=0.04) and inadequate PPE (P<0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that poorer quality of sleep was associated with higher anxiety levels (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic has potentially caused a significant level of anxiety and sleep disturbance amongst HCWs, associated with female gender, younger age group, and availability of inadequate PPE, which puts HCWs at constant risk of contracting the infection themselves or transmitting it to their families. Early detection of at-risk HCWs and institution of situation-tailored mitigation measures will enable alleviation of the risk of long term, serious psychological sequelae as well as reduce HCWs' current anxiety.","output":"The \\"Wounded Healer\\" - Anxiety and Sleep Disturbance Amongst Healthcare Workers Facing COVID-19 Pandemic in India: A Cross-sectional Online Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Artemisia annua L. has been used for millennia in Southeast Asia to treat \\"fever\\". Many infectious microbial and viral diseases have been shown to respond to A. annua and communities around the world use the plant as a medicinal tea, especially for treating malaria. AIM OF THE STUDY: SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of Covid-19) globally has infected and killed millions of people. Because of the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of artemisinin that includes blockade of SARS-CoV-1, we queried whether A. annua suppressed SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells, we measured anti SARS-CoV-2 activity against fully infectious virus of dried leaf extracts of seven cultivars of A. annua sourced from four continents. IC50s were calculated and defined as the concentrations that inhibited viral replication by 50%; CC50s were also calculated and defined as the concentrations that kill 50% of cells. RESULTS: Hot-water leaf extracts based on artemisinin, total flavonoids, or dry leaf mass showed antiviral activity with IC50 values of 0.1-8.7 M, 0.01-0.14 g, and 23.4-57.4 g, respectively. Antiviral efficacy did not correlate with artemisinin or total flavonoid contents of the extracts. One dried leaf sample was >12 years old, yet its hot-water extract was still found to be active. The UK and South African variants, B1.1.7 and B1.351, were similarly inhibited. While all hot water extracts were effective, concentrations of artemisinin and total flavonoids varied by nearly 100-fold in the extracts. Artemisinin alone showed an estimated IC50 of about 70 M, and the clinically used artemisinin derivatives artesunate, artemether, and dihydroartemisinin were ineffective or cytotoxic at elevated micromolar concentrations. In contrast, the antimalarial drug amodiaquine had an IC50 = 5.8 M. Extracts had minimal effects on infection of Vero E6 or Calu-3 cells by a reporter virus pseudotyped by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. There was no cytotoxicity within an order of magnitude above the antiviral IC90 values. CONCLUSIONS: A. annua extracts inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the active component(s) in the extracts is likely something besides artemisinin or a combination of components that block virus infection at a step downstream of virus entry. Further studies will determine in vivo efficacy to assess whether A. annua might provide a cost-effective therapeutic to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"Artemisia annua L. extracts inhibit the in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2 and two of its variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to the official report, the first case of COVID-19 and the first death in the United States occurred on January 20 and February 29, 2020, respectively.

Nevertheless, HMGXB4 is activated by its own promoter at 4-cell stage, responding to the parental-to-zygotic transition, marks stemness, and maintains its expression during germ cell specification. The HMGXB4 promoter is located at an active chromatin domain boundary. As a vertebrate-specific modulator of SETD1A and NuRF complexes, HMGXB4 links histone H3K4 methyltransferase- and ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelling activities. The expression of HMGXB4 is regulated by the KRAB-ZNF/TRIM28 epigenetic repression machinery. A post-transcriptional modification by SUMOylation diminishes its transcriptional activator function and regulates its nucleolar trafficking. Collectively, HMGXB4 positions SB transposition into an elaborate stem cell-specific transcriptional regulatory mechanism that is active during early embryogenesis and germline development, thereby potentiating heritable transposon insertions in the germline.","output":"HMGXB4 Targets Sleeping Beauty Transposition to Vertebrate Germinal Stem Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatobiliary manifestation of COVID-19 in Sickle Cell Disease: A Case report. Background and aim: SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, and the virus began spreading worldwide in late December 2019. It mainly affects the respiratory system. However, some studies have shown an increasing number of patients reporting gastrointestinal manifestations associated with COVID-19. There is little clinical experience of COVID\\\\19 patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) especially in our country, and most reported cases presented with acute chest syndrome (ACS). Sickle cell hepatopathy is common and ranges from benign hyperbilirubinemia and biliary sludge to overt liver failure, but it is unclear how this is affected by COVID-19. Case presentation: We report a case of a 5-year-old Saudi, non-obese female who was diagnosed as sickle B+ thalassemia (HbS: 71.9%, HbA 1.4%, HbA2: 6 & HbF: 20.7%) and was on hydroxyurea, folic acid, and vitamin D. The child came to our Emergency Department on 28/7/2020 with a one-week history of generalized abdominal pain related to the food ingestion and associated with vomiting and diarrhea. There is a history of jaundice, dark urine, and clay-like stool. There was no documented fever, history of cough, or respiratory distress. There was a history of contact with Covid-19 patient. On clinical examination, the child was vitally stable but jaundiced. She was in pain with tenderness over the right part of the abdomen but no organomegaly; other systematic examinations were normal. Her initial laboratory finding showed elevated liver enzyme (ALT: 148U/L, AST: 89U/L, GGT:150U/L, ALP:149U/L) with direct hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin 4.5mg/dl and direct bilirubin 2.6 mg/dl), high reticulocyte, and stable hemoglobin (10 mg/dl). She had a normal leukocyte count, platelet count, inflammatory markers, and pancreatic enzymes. Her abdominal U/S showed no hepatic focal lesions detected with normal size liver and no evidence of intrahepatic bile duct dilatation. In addition, the common bile duct and the portal vein were not dilated. The gallbladder showed normal wall thickening and was partially filled with sludge without stones (Figure 1). The child was kept on diet restriction and treated with maintenance intravenous fluid (IVF) and paracetamol. Hydroxyurea was stopped. Her gastrointestinal manifestations improved, and the liver enzymes subsided within days (Figure 2). After four days, the child was discharged home. Two days later, she was readmitted with poor oral intake and generalized upper limb pain (vaso-occlusive crisis). There was no clinical finding on examination. Her laboratory finding was acceptable, and she was started on IVF and analgesia. On 8/8/2020, she was discharged in very good clinical condition. Conclusions: It is clear that COVID-19 has significant impact on SCD. Poor oral intake that associated with viral infection can cause biliary sludge and Close follow-up is essential for those patients. Further studies are needed to support this finding.

All extracts irradiated at 5.0 kGy exhibited varying degrees of antibacterial activity against (Gram+ve and GramCve), the GS followed by GL then ML showed strong antibacterial activity with a diameter of inhibition zone of 26.2, 24.5 and 19.7 mm, against L. monocytoganes, respectively and 24.4, 21.4 and 17.2 against S. typhimurium, respectively. This study suggests that -irradiation is an effective technique to enhance the recovery of phenolics and flavonoids from GL, GS and ML. Also in current study, antioxidant, antibacterial and anticancer activity has been suggested to appear a clear positive relationship with the total phenolic material. This study has proved that the Egyptian GL, GS and ML are rich sources of valuable phytochemicals and nutrients that can serve as a potential source of nutraceuticals and multifunctional food additives (antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer). Phenolic compounds recovered from GL, GS and ML may have a potential role in fighting the COVID-19.","output":"Biological activities of Egyptian grape and mulberry by-products and their potential use as natural sources of food additives and nutraceuticals foods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Human CUB and Sushi multiple domains 1 (CSMD1) is a large membrane-bound tumor suppressor in breast cancer. The current study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of CSMD1 in highly invasive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). METHODS We examined the antitumor action of CSMD1 in three TNBC cell lines overexpressing CSMD1, MDA-MB-231, BT-20 and MDA-MB-486, in vitro using scanning electron microscopy, proteome array, qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, proximity ligation assay, ELISA, co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, tumorsphere formation assays and flow cytometric analysis. The mRNA expression pattern and clinical relevance of CSMD1 were evaluated in 3520 breast cancers from a modern population-based cohort. RESULTS CSMD1-expressing cells had distinct morphology, with reduced deposition of extracellular matrix components. We found altered expression of several cancer-related molecules, as well as diminished expression of signaling receptors including Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), in CSMD1-expressing cells compared to control cells. A direct interaction of CSMD1 and EGFR was identified, with the EGF-EGFR induced signaling cascade impeded in the presence of CSMD1. Accordingly, we detected increased ubiquitination levels of EGFR upon activation in CSMD1-expressing cells, as well as increased degradation kinetics and chemosensitivity. Accordingly, CSMD1 expression rendered tumorspheres pretreated with gefitinib more sensitive to chemotherapy. In addition, higher mRNA levels of CSMD1 tend to be associated with better outcome of triple negative breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that CSMD1 cross-talks with the EGFR endosomal trafficking cascade in a way that renders highly invasive breast cancer cells sensitive to chemotherapy. Our study unravels one possible underlying molecular mechanism of CSMD1 tumor suppressor function and may provide novel avenues for design of better treatment.","output":"Complement inhibitor CSMD1 modulates epidermal growth factor receptor oncogenic signaling and sensitizes breast cancer cells to chemotherapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, a new coronavirus, was first observed in Wuhan (China) in November 2019 In a short time, SARS-CoV-2 spread across the world, creating a pandemic There is a need to know the current situation of each country and region and to generate strategies to contain and mitigate the impact on global health and the economy To control COVID-19 in Cartagena and the Department of Bolivar, Colombia, a strategic network involving public health entities and higher education institutions has emerged The network has been in place for six months, and 77,122 subjects have been tested in Cartagena and Bolivar Department, of whom 8,260 (10 71%) tested positive (RT-qPCR) Of those who tested positive, 51 4% were male (p&gt;0 05), and 13 1% were health personnel (9 43% female, p 0 05) The daily case report showed upward and downward fluctuations by the mobility restrictions applied to the population, and from day 120 of the start of the pandemic, the epidemiological curve stabilized, and a logarithmic plateau was reached COVID-19 spread in 39/46 municipalities of Bolivar;however, Bolivar and Cartagena had a low number of cases and deaths compared to other departments and city in Colombia Cartagena and Bolivar have been given an economic opening with restrictions on crowding and mandatory use of a mouth cover until a vaccine is available UNIMOL was the first laboratory in Cartagena, Bolivar and Colombia to receive approval from the National Institute of Health to process COVID-19 samples;thanks to the timely diagnosis of cases by UNIMOL, intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy did not exceed capacity, and population confinement was appropriately initiated","output":"Covid-19 in Cartagena and the Bolivar Department, Colombia.

Early in the pandemic, contact tracing apps generated substantial enthusiasm due to their potential for automating tracing and reducing transmission rates while enabling targeted confinement strategies. However, although surveys demonstrate public interest in using such apps, their actual uptake remains limited. Their social acceptability is challenged by issues around privacy, fairness, and effectiveness, among other concerns. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the extent to which design and implementation considerations for contact tracing apps are detailed in the available literature, focusing on aspects related to participatory and responsible eHealth innovation, and synthesize recommendations that support the development of successful COVID-19 contact tracing apps and related eHealth technologies. METHODS: Searches were performed on five databases, and articles were selected based on eligibility criteria. Papers pertaining to the design, implementation, or acceptability of contact tracing apps were included. Articles published since 2019, written in English or French, and for which the full articles were available were considered eligible for analysis. To assess the scope of the knowledge found in the current literature, we used three complementary frameworks: (1) the Holistic Framework to Improve the Uptake and Impact of eHealth Technologies, (2) the Montreal model, and (3) the Responsible Innovation in Health Assessment Tool. RESULTS: A total of 63 articles qualified for the final analysis. Less than half of the selected articles cited the need for a participatory process (n=25, 40%), which nonetheless was the most frequently referenced item of the Framework to Improve the Uptake and Impact of eHealth Technologies. Regarding the Montreal model, stakeholder consultation was the most frequently described level of engagement in the development of contact tracing apps (n=24, 38%), while collaboration and partnership were cited the least (n=2, 3%). As for the Responsible Innovation in Health framework, all the articles (n=63, 100%) addressed population health, whereas only 2% (n=1) covered environmental considerations. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies lacked fundamental aspects of eHealth development and implementation. Our results demonstrate that stakeholders of COVID-19 contact tracing apps lack important information to be able to critically appraise this eHealth innovation. This may have contributed to the modest uptake of contact tracing apps worldwide. We make evidence-informed recommendations regarding data management, communication, stakeholder engagement, user experience, and implementation strategies for the successful and responsible development of contact tracing apps.","output":"Considerations for the Design and Implementation of COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps: Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The spread of the COVID-19 virus presents an unprecedented event that rapidly introduced widespread life threat, economic destabilization, and social isolation. The human nervous system is tuned to detect safety and danger, integrating body and brain responses via the autonomic nervous system. Shifts in brain-body states toward danger responses can compromise mental health. For those who have experienced prior potentially traumatic events, the autonomic threat response system may be sensitive to new dangers and these threat responses may mediate the association between prior adversity and current mental health. Method: The present study collected survey data from adult U.S. residents (n = 1,666; 68% female; Age M = 46.24, SD = 15.14) recruited through websites, mailing lists, social media, and demographically-targeted sampling collected between March and May 2020. Participants reported on their adversity history, subjective experiences of autonomic reactivity, PTSD and depression symptoms, and intensity of worry related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a combination of standardized questionnaires and questions developed for the study. Formal mediation testing was conducted using path analysis and structural equation modeling. Results: Respondents with prior adversities reported higher levels of destabilized autonomic reactivity, PTSD and depression symptoms, and worry related to COVID-19. Autonomic reactivity mediated the relation between adversity and all mental health variables (standardized indirect effect range for unadjusted models: 0.212C0.340; covariate-adjusted model: 0.183C0.301). Discussion: The data highlight the important role of autonomic regulation as an intervening variable in mediating the impact of adversity on mental health. Because of the important role that autonomic function plays in the expression of mental health vulnerability, brain-body oriented therapies that promote threat response reduction should be investigated as possible therapeutic targets.","output":"Adversity History Predicts Self-Reported Autonomic Reactivity and Mental Health in US Residents During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently at the very beginning of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, many of its trends are difficult to imagine.

The hormone leptin plays a critical role in growth and development. Previous studies reported that postnatal overnutrition increases leptin secretion during the pre-weaning period. However, a direct link between leptin, neonatal overnutrition, and lifelong metabolic regulation has not been investigated. METHODS: We used the small litter mouse model combined with neonatal leptin antagonist injections to examine whether attenuating leptin during early life improves lifelong metabolic regulation in postnatally overnourished mice. RESULTS: Postnatally overnourished mice displayed rapid weight gain during lactation and remained overweight as adults. These mice also showed increased adiposity and perturbations in glucose homeostasis in adulthood. Neonatal administration of a leptin antagonist normalized fat mass and insulin sensitivity in postnatally overnourished mice. These metabolic improvements were associated with enhanced sensitivity of hypothalamic neurons to leptin.

METHODS: This is a single center, retrospective, observational study. All consecutive patients admitted with primary diagnosis of ischemic/ hemorrhagic stroke between March1st -May10th 2020 were included and compared with the same time period in 2019. RESULTS: There was a 41.9% increase in stroke admissions in 2020 (148 vs 210,P = .001). When comparing all ischemic strokes, higher rate of large vessel occlusion (LVO) (18.3% vs 33.8%,P = .008) and significant delay in initiation of mechanical thrombectomy after hospital arrival (67.75 vs 104.30 minutes,P = .001) was observed in 2020. When comparing all hemorrhagic strokes, there were no differences between the two years. Among 591 COVID-19 admissions, 31 (5.24%) patients with stroke including 19 with ischemic (3.21%) and 12 with hemorrhagic stroke (2.03%) were identified. Patients with COVID-19 and ischemic stroke were significantly younger (58.74 vs 48.11 years,P = .002), predominantly male (68.18% vs 94.74%,P = .016), had lesser vascular risk factors, had more severe clinical presentation (NIHSS 7.01 vs 17.05,P < .001), and higher rate of LVO (23.6% vs. 63.1%,P = .006). There was no difference in the rate of endovascular thrombectomy, but time to groin puncture was significantly longer in COVID-19 patients (83.41 vs 129.50 minutes,P = .003). For hemorrhagic stroke, COVID-19 patients did not differ from non-COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke continues to occur during this pandemic and stroke pathways have been affected by the pandemic. Stroke occurs in approximately 5% of patients with COVID-19. COVID-19 associated ischemic stroke occurs in predominantly male patients who are younger, with fewer vascular risk factors, can be more severe, and have higher rates of LVO.

The basic strategy of this special drive involved identifying missed children and vaccinating them in temporary outreach sites for 1 week over consecutive 4-month period starting from October 2017. This study estimated the incremental economic and financial cost of conducting IMI in India from a government provider perspective. Five statesAssam, Bihar, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh were purposefully selected because of high concentration of IMI activities. The stratified random sample of 40 districts, 90 sub-districts and 289 sub-centres were included in this study. Cost data were retrospectively collected at all levels from administrative records, financial records and staff interviews involved in IMI. The weighted incremental economic cost per dose (including vaccine costs) was lowest in Uttar Pradesh (US$3.45) and highest in Maharashtra (U$12.23). Incremental economic cost per IMI dose was found to be higher than a recent routine immunization costing study by Chatterjee and colleagues in 2018, suggesting that it requires additional resources to immunize children through an intensified push in hard-to-reach areas. Incremental financial cost of the IMI programme estimated in this study will be helpful for the government for any future planning of such special initiative. The reasons for variation of unit costs of IMI across the study districts are not known, but lower baseline coverage, high population density, migration, geography and terrain and vaccinating small numbers of children per session could account for the range of findings. Further analysis is required to understand the determinants of cost variations of the IMI programme, which may aid in better planning and more efficient use of resources for future intensified efforts.","output":"The incremental cost of improving immunization coverage in India through the Intensified Mission Indradhanush programme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For over 20 years the Evidence-Based Orthopaedics Working Group (GLOBE) has been promoting evidence-based medicine (EBM) in orthopaedics and traumatology.

Initial reports from the outbreak in Italy, China and the USA have provided anecdotal evidence of improved outcomes with the administration of anti-IL-6 agents, and large-scale trials evaluating these therapies are ongoing. STUDY DESCRIPTION: In this retrospective case series, clinical outcomes and correlates of response to treatment with the IL-6 receptor antagonist sarilumab are described for 15 patients with COVID-19 from a single institution in Southern Italy. Among 10 patients whose symptoms improved after sarilumab treatment, rapid decreases in CRP levels corresponded with clinical improvement. Lower levels of IL-6 at baseline as well as lower neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio as compared with patients whose COVID-19 did not improve with treatment were associated with sarilumab-responsive disease. CONCLUSIONS: This observation may reflect a possible clinical benefit regarding early intervention with IL-6-modulatory therapies for COVID-19 and that CRP could be a potential biomarker of response to treatment.","output":"Outcomes and biomarker analyses among patients with COVID-19 treated with interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist sarilumab at a single institution in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a recently emerged, highly contagious virus and the cause of the current COVID-19 pandemic. It is a zoonotic virus, although its animal origin is not clear yet. Person-to-person transmission occurs by inhalation of infected droplets and aerosols, or by direct contact with contaminated fomites. Arthropods transmit numerous viral, parasitic, and bacterial diseases; however, the potential role of arthropods in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is not fully understood. Thus far, a few studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 replication is not supported in cells from certain insect species nor in certain species of mosquitoes after intrathoracic inoculation. In this study, we expanded the work of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to biting insects after ingesting a SARS-CoV-2-infected bloodmeal. Species tested included Culicoides sonorensis (Wirth & Jones) (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) biting midges, as well as Culex tarsalis (Coquillett) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae), all known biological vectors for numerous RNA viruses. Arthropods were allowed to feed on SARS-CoV-2-spiked blood and at a time point postinfection analyzed for the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus. Additionally, cell lines derived from C. sonorensis (W8a), Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) (Diptera: Culicidae) (C6/36), Cx. quinquefasciatus (HSU), and Cx. tarsalis (CxTrR2) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility.

One of the proposed strategies for mitigating the massive demand for N95 FFRs is their reuse after a process of decontamination that allows the inactivation of any potentially infectious material on their surfaces. This article aims to summarize all of the available evidence on the different decontamination methods that might allow disposable N95 FFRs to be reused, with emphasis on decontamination from SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature in order to identify studies reporting outcomes of at least 1 decontamination method for inactivating or removing any potentially infectious material from the surface of N95 FFRs, specifically addressing issues related to reduction of the microbial threat (including SARS-CoV-2 when available), maintaining the function of N95 FFRs and a lack of residual toxicity. RESULTS: We identified a total of 15 studies reporting on the different decontamination methods that might allow disposable N95 FFRs to be reused, including small-scale energetic methods and disinfecting solutions/spray/wipes. Among these decontamination methods, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation and vaporized hydrogen peroxide seem to be the most promising decontamination methods for N95 FFRs, based on their biocidal efficacy, filtration performance, fitting characteristics, and residual chemical toxicity, as well as other practical aspects such as the equipment required for their implementation and the maximum number of decontamination cycles. CONCLUSIONS: Although all the methods for the decontamination and reuse of N95 FFRs have advantages and disadvantages, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation and vaporized hydrogen peroxide seem to be the most promising methods.","output":"Decontamination and reuse of N95 filtering facemask respirators: A systematic review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Foundry workers face a number of occupational health hazards, which may lead to an increased risk of respiratory disease, cancer, and anxiety level and are associated with endocrine, hematologic, renal, and neurological problems in humans. This study aims to evaluated thyroid functions, glutathione level, and the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 after vaccinated (two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine) foundry workers in Jordan. We examined the efficacy BNT162b2 vaccine by calculating the rate of mortality and the degree of severity from mild to severe respiratory infections in 105 adult males foundry workers occupationally exposed to metals and Pb who had been received two doses, 21 days apart, of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Seventy-five male subjects not exposed to the Pb and who received two shots of the BNT162b2 vaccine (PfizerCBioNTech) served as the control group. In foundry workers who were infected with COVID-19, the mortality rate (0%) was similar as in the control group (0%), and increased transmission of infection with SARS-CoV-2; the non-hospitalized infections increased nearly 3.4-times and hospitalized infections increased 4.29-times among people exposed to lead and metal contamination compared to the healthy persons control group. Also, among the foundry workers, the blood lead, FT3, and FT4 levels were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) and the levels of glutathione and TSH were significantly decreased (p < 0.0001) compared with the control group. In conclusion, long-term exposure to Pb is associated with a risk of infection with COVID-19 despite the 2 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine (PfizerCBioNTech). Also, exposure to Pb is associated with hyperthyroidism and a reduction in glutathione.","output":"How long-term metal and lead exposure among foundry workers affect COVID-19 infection outcomes in Jordan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have constructed a chirped amplitude modulation heterodyne ghost imaging (CAM-HGI) experimental system that demonstrates a robust ability against background light in experiments.

The effects of background light, modulation depth and modulation duration of the signal light source on CAM-HGI are investigated experimentally. The results show that the quality of CAM-HGI can be improved by increasing the modulation depth and the modulation duration of the signal light source, and more importantly, an image with a good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be achieved even when the irradiation SNR is lower than -30 dB.

In pythons, nidovirus (recently reclassified as serpentovirus) infection induces an inflammation of the upper respiratory and alimentary tract which can develop into a severe, often fatal proliferative pneumonia. We observed pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic lesions in organ systems other than the respiratory tract during full post mortem examinations on 30 serpentovirus RT-PCR positive pythons of varying species originating from Switzerland and Spain. The observations prompted us to study whether this not yet reported wider distribution of lesions is associated with previously unknown serpentoviruses or changes in the serpentovirus genome. RT-PCR and inoculation of Morelia viridis cell cultures served to recruit the cases and obtain virus isolates. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining against serpentovirus nucleoprotein demonstrated that the virus not only infects a broad spectrum of epithelia (respiratory and alimentary epithelium, hepatocytes, renal tubules, pancreatic ducts etc.), but also intravascular monocytes, intralesional macrophages and endothelial cells. By next-generation sequencing we obtained full length genome for a novel serpentovirus species circulating in Switzerland. Analysis of viral genomes recovered from pythons showing serpentovirus infection associated respiratory or systemic disease did not reveal sequence association to phenotypes, however, functional studies with different strains are needed to confirm this observation. The results indicate that serpentoviruses have a broad cell and tissue tropism, further suggesting that the course of infection could vary and involve lesions in a broad spectrum of tissues and organ systems as a consequence of monocyte-mediated viral systemic spread.IMPORTANCE During the last years, python nidoviruses (now reclassified as serpentoviruses) have become a primary cause of fatal disease in pythons. Serpentoviruses represent a threat to captive snake collections, as they spread rapidly and can be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our study indicates that, different from previous evidence, the viruses do not only affect the respiratory tract, but can spread in the entire body with blood monocytes, have a broad spectrum of target cells, and can induce a variety of lesions. Nidovirales is an order of animal and human viruses that compromise important zoonotic pathogens such as MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Serpentoviruses belong to the same order as the mentioned human viruses and show similar characteristics (rapid spread, respiratory and gastrointestinal tropism, etc.). The present study confirms the relevance of natural animal diseases to better understand the complexity of viruses of the order nidovirales.","output":"Serpentoviruses, more than respiratory pathogens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), emerged in Wuhan, China, and has spread worldwide, resulting in over 73 million cases and more than 1 600 000 deaths as of December 2020. Although the disease is asymptomatic in most cases, some patients develop life-threatening disease characterised by acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, multisystem organ failure (MSOF), extrapulmonary manifestations, thromboembolic disease and associated cytokine release syndrome. The rationale for applying therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) early in the course of fulminant COVID-19 is the suppression of thromboinflammation and amelioration of microangiopathy, thus preventing the ensuing MSOF. In the course of complicated critical illness due to COVID-19, immune dysregulation may be as important as viral replication itself. Moreover, the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains obscure, as re-infections and/or recurrently positive real-time PCR results have been reported. Although concerns still exist regarding its potential immunosuppressive effects and safety, TPE shows promise in the management of life-threatening COVID-19 as documented by various pilot studies, which remain to be confirmed by future randomised controlled trials.

Furthermore, the results of latent profile analyses yielded four subgroups (i.e., low, moderate, and high levels of all three variables and a varied profile exhibiting very low trust in science, low health literacy, and moderate scientific knowledge).

METHODS AND RESULTS We examined the frequency of use and outcomes of intravascular imaging among 619 CTO percutaneous coronary interventions performed between 2012 and 2015 at 7 US centers. Mean age was 65.410 years and 85% of the patients were men. Intravascular imaging was used in 38%: intravascular ultrasound in 36%, optical coherence tomography in 3%, and both in 1.45%. Intravascular imaging was used for stent sizing (26.3%), stent optimization (38.0%), and CTO crossing (35.7%, antegrade in 27.9%, and retrograde in 7.8%). Intravascular imaging to facilitate crossing was used more frequently in lesions with proximal cap ambiguity (49% versus 26%, P<0.0001) and with retrograde as compared with antegrade-only cases (67% versus 31%, P<0.0001). Despite higher complexity (Japanese CTO score: 2.861.19 versus 2.431.19, P=0.001), cases in which imaging was used for crossing had similar technical and procedural success (92.8% versus 89.6%, P=0.302 and 90.1% versus 88.3%, P=0.588, respectively) and similar incidence of major cardiac adverse events (2.7% versus 3.2%, P=0.772). Use of intravascular imaging was associated with longer procedure (192 minutes [interquartile range 130, 255] versus 131 minutes [90, 192], P<0.0001) and fluoroscopy (71 minutes [44, 93] versus 39 minutes [25, 69], P<0.0001) time. CONCLUSIONS Intravascular imaging is frequently performed during CTO percutaneous coronary intervention both for crossing and for stent selection/optimization.

Our study explores the importance of early identification of the disease, probable etiopathogenesis, clinical and radiological features and a treatment protocol for COVID-19 Associated Fungal Osteomyelitis of Jaws and Sinuses (CAFOJS). A one-year prospective study from June 2020 to May 2021 was conducted among CAFOJS diagnosed patients at a tertiary care center in South India. Demographic details, COVID-19 infection and treatment history, time taken for initiation of symptoms after COVID-19 diagnosis, medical history and clinical features were recorded. All patients were managed with a standard diagnostic and intervention protocol which included pre-operative and post-operative administration of Inj. Amphotericin B 50 mg (liposomal), early aggressive surgical debridement and tab. Posaconazole GR 300 mg OD for 90 days after discharge. Thirty-nine (78%) patients were diagnosed with CAFOJS out of 50 osteomyelitis patients. 35 patients (90%) were diabetic and 21 patients (54%) were known to receive steroids during the COVID-19 treatment. Sole existence of Mucorales spp. was seen in 30 patients (77%), Aspergillus fumigatus in 2 patients (5%), Curvularia spp. in 2 patients (5%). Concomitant existence of Mucorales and Aspergillus fumigatus was reported in two patients (5%) and Candida albicans in three patients (8%). Patients underwent treatment with standard protocol and no recurrence noted. CAFOJS is a clinical entity with aggressive presentation and warrants early diagnosis and treatment. LAY SUMMARY: Invasive fungal infections of head and neck region cause necrosis of bones affected by it, especially maxilla. Early diagnosis and treatment are advocated in such infections due to its aggressive clinical presentation compared to similar infections before COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Covid-19-associated fungal osteomyelitis of jaws and sinuses: An experience-driven management protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, the partitioning clustering of COVID-19 data using c-Means (cM) and Fuzy c-Means (Fc-M) algorithms is carried out. Based on the data available from January 2020 with respect to location, i.e., longitude and latitude of the globe, the confirmed daily cases, recoveries, and deaths are clustered. In the analysis, the maximum cluster size is treated as a variable and is varied from 5 to 50 in both algorithms to find out an optimum number. The performance and validity indices of the clusters formed are analyzed to assess the quality of clusters. The validity indices to understand all the COVID-19 clusters' quality are analysed based on the Zahid SC (Separation Compaction) index, Xie-Beni Index, FukuyamaCSugeno Index, Validity function, PC (performance coefficient), and CE (entropy) indexes. The analysis results pointed out that five clusters were identified as a major centroid where the pandemic looks concentrated. Additionally, the observations revealed that mainly the pandemic is distributed easily at any global location, and there are several centroids of COVID-19, which primarily act as epicentres. However, the three main COVID-19 clusters identified are 1) cases with value <50,000, 2) cases with a value between 0.1 million to 2 million, and 3) cases above 2 million. These centroids are located in the US, Brazil, and India, where the rest of the small clusters of the pandemic look oriented. Furthermore, the Fc-M technique seems to provide a much better cluster than the c-M algorithm.","output":"Clustering of COVID-19 data for knowledge discovery using c-means and fuzzy c-means"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We describe an experience of a large-scale self-initiated recruitment of patients to a self-monitoring initiative for macular pathology over the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: observational study with retrospective analysis. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2272 patients from the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) whose visits were rescheduled over lockdown (13 April to 1 June 2020) were offered participation in a self-monitoring initiative administered by SNEC with the Alleye application as the testing instrument. METHODS: This was an observational study with retrospective analysis. Demographics and characteristics were compared between those that signed up and those that did not. Similar comparisons were made between compliant patients versus those that were not. Outcomes were tracked for 6 months starting from the commencement of lockdown. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participation and compliance rates. Patient characteristics that were more likely to participate and remain compliant. RESULTS: A total 732 (32%) patients participated in this self-monitoring initiative. Those who participated were younger (62 vs. 68 years, p<0001), men, and living with family. Patients not on treatment, and those with poorer vision in their worse-seeing eye were more likely to participate. When grouped according to diagnosis, the proportion who participated was highest for diabetic macular edema (52%), non-neovascular age related macular degeneration (nAMD)(42%), diabetic retinopathy(35%), retinal vein occlusions(18%) , and nAMD(15%) (p<0001). Testing compliance rate was 43% (315/732). Compliant patients were older, on treatment, and had poorer vision in the worse-seeing eye. Trigger events occurred in 33 patients with 5 patients having clinically verified disease progression (16%). CONCLUSION: We provide real-world data on characteristics of patients with stable retinal diseases who were offered and participated in, and were compliant, with a self-monitoring program. The lower participation rate compared to standardized clinical studies reflects the difficulties in implementation for such initiatives in real-world settings. Despite this, self-monitoring continues to show promise in relieving clinic resources, suggesting the feasibility of scaling such programs beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Patterns and Characteristics of a Real-World Implementation of a Self-Monitoring Program for Retina Diseases during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has seen a notable global reduction in influenza cases of both influenza A and B viruses.

Sometimes, but not often, a coronavirus can infect both animals and humans. An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 or SARS-CoV-2 previously known as 2019-nCoV) was identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as it spread throughout China and subsequently across the globe. As of 14th July 2020, a total of 13.1 million confirmed cases globally and 572,426 deaths had been reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the -coronavirus family and shares extensive genomic identity with bat coronavirus suggesting that bats are the natural host. SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as that for SARS-CoV, the coronavirus associated with the SARS outbreak in 2003. It mainly spreads through the respiratory tract with lymphopenia and cytokine storms occuring in the blood of subjects with severe disease. This suggests the existence of immunological dysregulation as an accompanying event during severe illness caused by this virus. The early recognition of this immunological phenotype could assist prompt recognition of patients who will progress to severe disease. Here we review the data of the immune response during COVID-19 infection. The current review summarizes our understanding of how immune dysregulation and altered cytokine networks contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 patients.","output":"The Immune Response and Immunopathology of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The selection and assessment process of appropriate robots became a more complex and complicated task due to various available alternatives and conflicting attributes which must take into consideration. Also, uncertainty which exists usually in the selection process is an unavoidable component that needs to be thoughtfully measured and traditional multi-attribute decision-making approaches failed to deal precisely with it. Since almost all decisions originate from subjective ordinal preferences, handling uncertainty using linguistic variables is also not enough. Thus, the objective of the current study is to present a new extended ordinal priority approach in the neutrosophic environment for the first time to select an appropriate robot. Since neutrosophic is one of the most effective and accommodating tools for handling uncertainty, thus, this method goes to transform linguistic information into triangular neutrosophic numbers using a new presented scale. This scale was used to determine the importance degree of attributes and alternatives regarding experts' opinions. Also, the score function of the triangular neutrosophic number is used for prioritizing attributes and alternatives. The experts in our proposed method have the same degree of importance, since each expert is a person with special skills and knowledge representing mastery of a particular subject. To measure the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach, an experimental case study has been established for the robot selection problem of a new pharmaceutical city in Egypt for the first time. The source of data in this case study is experts, interviews, and questionnaires. Also, sensitivity and comparative analysis are further made for verifying the power of the proposed approach. The outcome of this study shows that the suggested approach for robot selection is quite helpful and has a great performance under uncertainty over classical and fuzzy ordinal priority approaches. Also, the suggested approach is less consumption of time and simpler than the fuzzy ordinal priority approach. Therefore, we recommend firms and governments to apply it for increasing product quality, hence the profitability of manufacturing industries and decrease needless costs.

Modes of consultation have therefore adapted to overcome this barrier;virtual or online consultations have become a popular alternative for people with access to technology. The literature on patient perspectives about this mechanism is still evolving.ObjectivesAim: To explore patient perceptions regarding virtual consultationsMethodsA voluntary online survey instrument using a mix of quantitative and qualitative questions was administered to patients across 3 major cities using a social media platform, WhatsApp. The aim was to explore the characteristics of users, perceived advantages and disadvantages of online consultations and patient satisfaction.ResultsThere were 461 respondents (M 51.4%: F 48.6%) that had consulted doctors online. 91% of them lived in 8 major metro cities. Interestingly, over 80% respondents had never sought online consultation before the COVID-19 pandemic. 52% patients accessed multiple (2C3) consultations in the 10 months since the start of the lock-down in March 2020. While 62% consulted their regular doctor, 19% accepted recommendations from friends and family and 10% used online platforms. 45% of consultations were via videocalls, 28% through WhatsApp and 20% via telephone calls. Prescriptions were provided via WhatsApp in 41% cases, online portals in 32%, email in 13% and a photograph of handwritten prescription in 13% cases. The vast majority (90%) felt that the time provided by the doctor was adequate. 55% of patients paid via G pay while 28% were prepaid through online portals. There were no audio or video connectivity issues in 90% cases. 13% patients had to go for a face-to-face consultation within 7 days of the online consultation as the clinical problem had not been resolved adequately. Patients felt that the main advantages of online consultations included a lower risk of infection (77%), reduced waiting time (57%) and travel time (58%). The main disadvantages cited included a lack of physical examination (73%), a perception that this was not as satisfying as a face-to-face consultation (36%), inability to adequately communicate their problem (24%) and an inability to show past reports (13%). 78% patients rated their online consultations as either a 4/5 or 5/5 satisfaction level. Given the choice after the pandemic, almost two-thirds (64%) felt they would still prefer face-face consultations.ConclusionsFor the vast majority of patients (80%), this pandemic provided the first ever opportunity to choose a virtual platform to seek clinical care. The high level of satisfaction for online consultations suggests that this mechanism of patient-provider clinical service provision might well be an increasingly popular intervention after restrictions are lifted. As digital penetration improves, weaknesses identified in the current system of online consultations (e.g., inability to conduct physical examinations and inadequate communication) could be mitigated through evolving technologies like digital stethoscopes and better communication tools. It brings into focus the need for regulations to keep pace with this rapidly evolving trend to ensure that the virtual patient-provider interaction remains a safe, secure and confidential way to access clinical services.","output":"Patient perspectives regarding online consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The gut microbiota has diverse microbial components, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1238 nurses, assistant nurses, X-ray technicians, managers, lab technicians, midwives and childcare assistants working at night or alternating between days and nights answered the questionnaire. INTERVENTION: Online survey. OUTCOME MEASURES: PAS use prevalence after weighting data for sex, age and profession using calibration on margins, in order to be representative of all AP-HP NSHW. We used the Fagerstr?m scale and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Concise to assess PAS use. RESULTS: The weighted estimated prevalences of daily smoking, alcohol drinking and tranquilliser use in participating NSHW were 21.4, 1.3 and 2.4%, respectively. Twelve per cent (11.7%) of our study sample used opioids. During the first COVID-19 wave, PAS use remained stable except for tobacco use, with 8.6% of participants reporting an increase.

However, there is a shortage of aggregated insights into how wearables have been used in health research. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we aim to broadly overview and categorize the current research conducted with affordable wearable devices for health research. METHODS: We performed a scoping review to understand the use of affordable, consumer-grade wearables for health research from a population health perspective using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) framework. A total of 7499 articles were found in 4 medical databases (PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, and CINAHL). Studies were eligible if they used noninvasive wearables: worn on the wrist, arm, hip, and chest; measured vital signs; and analyzed the collected data quantitatively. We excluded studies that did not use wearables for outcome assessment and prototype studies, devices that cost >500 (US $570), or obtrusive smart clothing. RESULTS: We included 179 studies using 189 wearable devices covering 10,835,733 participants. Most studies were observational (128/179, 71.5%), conducted in 2020 (56/179, 31.3%) and in North America (94/179, 52.5%), and 93% (10,104,217/10,835,733) of the participants were part of global health studies. The most popular wearables were fitness trackers (86/189, 45.5%) and accelerometer wearables, which primarily measure movement (49/189, 25.9%). Typical measurements included steps (95/179, 53.1%), heart rate (HR; 55/179, 30.7%), and sleep duration (51/179, 28.5%). Other devices measured blood pressure (3/179, 1.7%), skin temperature (3/179, 1.7%), oximetry (3/179, 1.7%), or respiratory rate (2/179, 1.1%). The wearables were mostly worn on the wrist (138/189, 73%) and cost <200 (US $228; 120/189, 63.5%). The aims and approaches of all 179 studies revealed six prominent uses for wearables, comprising correlationswearable and other physiological data (40/179, 22.3%), method evaluations (with subgroups; 40/179, 22.3%), population-based research (31/179, 17.3%), experimental outcome assessment (30/179, 16.8%), prognostic forecasting (28/179, 15.6%), and explorative analysis of big data sets (10/179, 5.6%). The most frequent strengths of affordable wearables were validation, accuracy, and clinical certification (104/179, 58.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Wearables showed an increasingly diverse field of application such as COVID-19 prediction, fertility tracking, heat-related illness, drug effects, and psychological interventions; they also included underrepresented populations, such as individuals with rare diseases. There is a lack of research on wearable devices in low-resource contexts. Fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, we see a shift toward more large-sized, web-based studies where wearables increased insights into the developing pandemic, including forecasting models and the effects of the pandemic.

Materials and Methods: Thirty-nine patients with HAE were included in this study. These patients were regularly followed up over phone calls since the first COVID-19 case was seen in our country. Patients were asked to visit the hospital if there was a history of contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient or if the patient developed clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Results: There were 21 (54%) patients with type I HAE, and 18 (46%) with type II HAE. All patients received treatment for angioedema attacks (C1-inhibitor [C1-INH], icatibant), and seven (20%) received long-term prophylaxis (danazol). Treatment for attacks was continued for all patients during the pandemic. Patients taking danazol were switched to long-term prophylaxis using the C1-INH concentrate. Eleven (28%) patients with HAE developed COVID-19 during this study. Only one patient had severe COVID-19. Six patients (54.5%) were diagnosed with type II HAE, and five (45.5%) were diagnosed with type I HAE. The most common COVID-19 symptoms were fever (7/11;64%) and myalgia (6/11;55%). Mild angioedema attacks were experienced by 36% (4/11) of the HAE patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Icatibant was used in all patients. Conclusion: Agents used for HAE block the kallikrein-kinin system and may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19. Considering their beneficial effects on COVID-19, it is recommended that HAE patients should continue the use of agents blocking the kallikrein-kinin system.

The change value was significantly improved in the neurofeedback group (24.90  13.13 vs. 4.11  9.03). Secondary outcomes such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and quality of life were also improved. In an economic analysis using EuroQol-5D, the incremental cost-per-quality-adjusted life-year was approximately $15,600, indicating acceptable cost-utility. There were no adverse events in either group.

The classification and diagnosis of breast cancer and its histopathological images have always been a hot spot of clinical concern. In Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD), traditional classification models mostly use a single network to extract features, which has significant limitations. On the other hand, many networks are trained and optimized on patient-level datasets, ignoring the application of lower-level data labels. Method: This paper proposes a deep ensemble model based on image-level labels for the binary classification of benign and malignant lesions of breast histopathological images. First, the BreaKHis dataset is randomly divided into a training, validation and test set. Then, data augmentation techniques are used to balance the number of benign and malignant samples. Thirdly, considering the performance of transfer learning and the complementarity between each network, VGG16, Xception, ResNet50, DenseNet201 are selected as the base classifiers. Result: In the ensemble network model with accuracy as the weight, the image-level binary classification achieves an accuracy of $98.90\\\\%$. In order to verify the capabilities of our method, the latest Transformer and Multilayer Perception (MLP) models have been experimentally compared on the same dataset. Our model wins with a $5\\\\%-20\\\\%$ advantage, emphasizing the ensemble model's far-reaching significance in classification tasks. Conclusion: This research focuses on improving the model's classification performance with an ensemble algorithm. Transfer learning plays an essential role in small datasets, improving training speed and accuracy.

In a landscape context, contact opportunities within and between populations are changing rapidly as lockdown measures are relaxed and a number of social activities re-activated. Using an individual-based metapopulation model, we explored the efficacy of different control strategies across an urban-rural gradient in Wales, UK. Our model shows that isolation of symptomatic cases, or regional lockdowns in response to local outbreaks, have limited efficacy unless the overall transmission rate is kept persistently low. Additional isolation of non-symptomatic infected individuals, who may be detected by effective test and trace strategies, is pivotal to reduce the overall epidemic size over a wider range of transmission scenarios. We define an urban-rural gradient in epidemic size as a correlation between regional epidemic size and connectivity within the region, with more highly connected urban populations experiencing relatively larger outbreaks. For interventions focused on regional lockdowns, the strength of such gradients in epidemic size increased with higher travel frequencies, indicating a reduced efficacy of the control measure in the urban regions under these conditions. When both non-symptomatic and symptomatic individuals are isolated or regional lockdown strategies are enforced, we further found the strongest urban-rural epidemic gradients at high transmission rates. This effect was reversed for strategies targeted at symptomatics only.

One of the most serious manifestations of PD is gait instability, leading to falls and subsequent complications that can be debilitating, even fatal. Boxing therapy (BT) uses gait and balance exercises to improve ambulation in people with PD, though its efficacy has not yet been fully proven. METHODS: In the current longitudinal observational study, 98 participants with idiopathic PD underwent twice-weekly BT sessions. Primary outcome was self-reported falls per month; secondary outcomes were quantitative and semi-quantitative gait and balance performance evaluations. Statistical methods included segmented generalized estimating equation with an independent correlation structure, binomial distribution, and log link. RESULTS: The average number of self-reported falls per month per participant decreased by 87%, from 0.86  3.58 prior to BT, to 0.11  0.26 during BT. During the lockdown imposed by COVID-19, this increased to 0.26  0.48 falls per month. Females and those > 65 years old reported the greatest increase in falls during the lockdown period. Post-lockdown resumption of BT resulted in another decline in falls, to 0.14  0.33. Quantitative performance metrics, including standing from a seated position and standing on one leg, largely mirrored the pattern of falls pre-and post-lockdown.

Physical touch is a key dimension of social connection that uniquely predicts physical and mental health benefits. However, most studies have been limited by cross-sectional designs, and no prior work has examined the long-term effects of physical touch on loneliness. To investigate the prospective association between physical touch and loneliness among older adults, this study utilized data from 1626 older adults (Mean age = 68, range = 57-85) who participated in Waves 1 and 2 of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP). Participants reported on their loneliness and physical contact with family and friends, as well as with pets, at both waves. Results revealed that more frequent physical contact with family and friends predicted larger decreases in loneliness over the subsequent five years (p<.0001), controlling for age, race, gender, health conditions, marital status, frequency of social interaction, and baseline levels of loneliness. Physical contact with pets had no unique effect (p=.136). To further assess directionality, models tested whether lonelier people experienced decreased touch over time, and the effects were null (p>.250). Taken together, this longitudinal study is the first to identify the unique contribution of human physical touch to prospective changes in loneliness, beyond the well-established effects of covariates, including social interaction frequency. Touch represents a compelling mechanism by which social isolation may lead to loneliness, which in turn raises risks for poor health and premature mortality.","output":"Longitudinal Associations of Physical Touch with Loneliness among Older Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intestinal infections with F4 enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are worldwide an important cause of diarrhea in neonatal and recently weaned pigs. Adherence of F4 ETEC to the small intestine by binding to specific receptors is mediated by F4 fimbriae. Porcine aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) was recently identified as a new F4 receptor. In this study, 7 coding mutations and 1 mutation in the 3 untranslated region (3' UTR)were identified in ANPEP by reverse transcriptase (RTC) PCR and sequencing using 3 F4 receptor-positive (F4R+) and 2 F4 receptor-negative (F4RC) pigs, which were F4 phenotyped based on the MUC4 TaqMan, oral immunization, and the in vitro villous adhesion assay. Three potential differential mutations (g.2615C > T, g.8214A > G, and g.16875C > G) identified by comparative analysis between the 3 F4R+ and 2 F4RC pigs were genotyped in 41 additional F4 phenotyped pigs. However, none of these 3 mutations could be associated with F4 ETEC susceptibility. In addition, the RT-PCR experiments did not reveal any differential expression or alternative splicing in the small intestine of F4R+ and F4RC pigs.

In total, 28 paired clinical specimens of saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 12 patients at various time points after symptom onset. Each specimen was assayed using reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on the BD MAX open system using primers and probes targeting the N-gene.

The qualitative results of each specimen obtained in the period immediately after symptom onset were similar. Three convalescent patients presented saliva-positive results, whereas their nasopharyngeal swabs were negative at four different time points, suggesting that saliva may be superior to nasopharyngeal swabs in terms of obtaining stable assay result of SARS-CoV-2. In conclusion, our results suggest that saliva can potentially serve as an alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs as a specimen for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR.

We discovered that the lung intrinsic clock (and not the central or immune clocks) mediated this dysregulation. Loss of circadian protein, Bmal1, in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells recapitulates the increased mortality, loss of temporal gating, and other key features of hyperoxia-exposed animals.

It has been included in the National Breed List of Livestock and Poultry Genetic Resources. The local communities have a deep understanding of black-boned sheep. The traditional knowledge of black-boned sheep is essential to their conservation and sustainable development. In spite of this, there was no information on traditional knowledge associated with black-boned sheep so far. The aim of this study wasaimed to document traditional knowledge and culture, to elucidate information about forage plants, and to investigate the conservation strategy of black-boned sheep. METHOD: Four field surveys were conducted from July 2019 to May 2021. A total of seven villages and the Pumi Culture Museum in Lanping County are being investigated. A semi-structured interview method was used to interview 67 key informants. During the investigation, we also participated in the grazing activities of black-boned sheep, observed the appearance characteristics and the herd structure of the black-boned sheep, and demonstrated traditional knowledge regarding black-boned sheep, including grazing methods, forage plants, and related customs and habits. RESULTS: We assumed that a majority of people in the current study sites were able to could distinguish black-boned sheep from their relatives by their black bones, blue-green gums, and blue-purple anus. The local people manage their black-boned sheep based on the number of sheep by sex, age, and role in a flock in the different breeding environments. Different grazing strategies have been adopted in different seasons. Through ethnobotanical investigations, 91 species of forage plants in 30 families were identified, including herbaceous, shrubs, lianas, and trees. Among all the plant species consumed by the black-boned sheep, Rosaceae species make up the greatest number, with 16, followed by Asteraceae, with 9, and 8 species of Fabaceae and Poaceae. Considering the abundance of forage plants and the preference for black-boned sheep, Prinsepia utilis and the plants of Rubus, Berberis, and Yushania occupy dominant positions. Plants used for foraging are divided into two categories: wild and cultivated. Due to the lack of forage plants in fall and winter, the local people mainly cultivate crops to feed their black-boned sheep. In addition, the black-boned sheep is an influential cultural species in the local community and plays a prominent role in the cultural identity of the Pumi people. CONCLUSION: Sheep play an essential role in the inheritance of the spiritual culture and material culture of the Pumi ethnic group. The formation of the black-boned sheep is inseparable from the worship of sheep by the Pumi people. With a long-term grazing process, the locals have developed a variety of traditional knowledge related to black-boned sheep. This is the experience that locals have accumulated when managing forests and grasslands. Therefore, both the government and individuals should learn from the local people when it comes to protecting black-boned sheep. No one knows black-boned sheep better than them.

TMPRSS2 gene is expressed in many human tissues and plays a critical role in spreading the infection of the viruses including coronavirus and progression of prostate cancer, and hence could be used as a potential drug target. There are limited reports on occurrence of genetic polymorphism of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in general population, expressions in pathological conditions, and its impact on COVID-19 disease. Hence we comprehended the occurrence of ACE2, TMPRSS2 polymorphism in general population, expression in various diseases and its impact on COVID-19 disease. METHOD: We utilized multiple databases, PubMed (Medline), EMBASE and Google Scholar for literature search. DESCRIPTION: ACE2 polymorphisms have significant linkages with various diseases, including severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Genetic variations of these genes contribute to individual's genetic susceptibility to viral infection and its subsequent clearance.

CONCLUSION: There are diversities in distribution of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 polymorphisms among different populations. Analyzing the genetic variants and expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, in a population may provide the genetic marker for susceptibility or resistance against the coronavirus infection, which might be useful for identifying the susceptible population groups for targeted interventions and for making relevant public health policy decisions.","output":"ACE2 and TMPRSS2 polymorphisms in various diseases with special reference to its impact on COVID-19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic of the novel SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection has affected over 10 million humans around the planet.

Investigations of plant responses to various single abiotic or biotic factors, or combined stresses, have been extensively reported. However, the molecular mechanisms of plants in responses to environmental stresses under natural conditions are not clearly understood. In this study, we carried out a transcriptome analysis using RNA-sequencing to decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms of Onobrychis viciifolia responding and adapting to the extreme natural environment in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). The transcriptome data of plant samples collected from two different altitudes revealed a total of 8212 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 5387 up-regulated and 2825 down-regulated genes. Detailed analysis of the identified DEGs uncovered that up-regulation of genes potentially leading to changes in hormone homeostasis and signaling, particularly abscisic acid-related ones, and enhanced biosynthesis of polyphenols play vital roles in the adaptive processes of O. viciifolia. Interestingly, several DEGs encoding uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases, which putatively regulate phytohormone homeostasis to resist environmental stresses, were also discovered. Furthermore, numerous DEGs encoding transcriptional factors, such as members of the myeloblastosis (MYB), homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP), WRKY, and nam-ataf1,2-cuc2 (NAC) families, might be involved in the adaptive responses of O. viciifolia to the extreme natural environmental conditions. The DEGs identified in this study represent candidate targets for improving environmental stress resistance of O. viciifolia grown in higher altitudes of the QTP, and can provide deep insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the responses of this plant species to the extreme natural environmental conditions of the QTP.","output":"Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Potential Roles of Abscisic Acid and Polyphenols in Adaptation of Onobrychis viciifolia to Extreme Environmental Conditions in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study is to explore risk factors for in-hospital mortality and describe the effectiveness of different treatment strategies of 205 laboratory-confirmed cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the Lombardy outbreak. All patients received the best supportive care and specific interventions that included the main drugs being tested for repurposing to treat COVID-19, such as hydroxychloroquine, anticoagulation and antiviral drugs, steroids, and interleukin-6 pathway inhibitors. Clinical, laboratory, and treatment characteristics were analyzed with univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods to explore their impact on in-hospital mortality. Univariate analyses showed prognostic significance for age greater than 70 years, the presence of two or more relevant comorbidities, a P/F ratio less than 200 at presentation, elevated LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) and CRP (C-reactive protein) values, intermediate- or therapeutic-dose anticoagulation, hydroxychloroquine, early antiviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir, short courses of steroids, and tocilizumab therapy. Multivariable regression confirmed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with age older than 70 years (OR 3.26) and a reduction in mortality for patients treated with anticoagulant (?0.37), antiviral lopinavir/ritonavir (?1.22), or steroid (?0.59) therapy.

We report a structure-driven degradation mechanism for NMC811 (LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2), in which a proportion of the material exhibits a lowered accessible state of charge at the end of charging after repetitive cycling and becomes fatigued. Operando synchrotron long-duration X-ray diffraction enabled by a laser-thinned coin cell shows the emergence and growth in the concentration of this fatigued phase with cycle number. This degradation is structure driven and is not solely due to kinetic limitations or intergranular cracking: no bulk phase transformations, no increase in Li/Ni antisite mixing and no notable changes in the local structure or Li-ion mobility of the bulk are seen in aged NMCs. Instead, we propose that this degradation stems from the high interfacial lattice strain between the reconstructed surface and the bulk layered structure that develops when the latter is at states of charge above a distinct threshold of approximately 75%. This mechanism is expected to be universal in Ni-rich layered cathodes. Our findings provide fundamental insights into strategies to help mitigate this degradation process.","output":"Bulk fatigue induced by surface reconstruction in layered Ni-rich cathodes for Li-ion batteries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The effects of drastic curricular changes necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students education and wellbeing have remained largely unstudied.

Although rare, serious failures occur. Atherosclerosis may contribute to seal failures by altering vascular compressibility and collagen content; however, no data exist. MATERIALS AND METHODS Femoral and iliac arteries of six Yucatan swine with an identified genetic locus predisposing them to atherosclerosis were denuded with a Fogarty catheter. Animals were fed a high-fat diet for 28 wk. A Yorkshire pig was used as a normal control and fed a standard diet. At 28 wk, arteries were measured for their diameters, sealed, and divided in vivo with LigaSure. The sealed artery sections were excised and subjected to burst pressure testing. Half of the seal distal to the aorta was kept intact for histology and collagen and elastin quantification. A multiple linear regression model was used to assess variables contributing to burst pressure. Covariates included were vessel diameter, degree of atherosclerosis, and collagen content. RESULTS Experimental animals were hypercholesterolemic. Atherosclerosis occurred in 90% of seals in induced animals, with severe atherosclerosis in 62% of seals. There was site-selective deposition of atherosclerotic plaques in larger diameter iliac vessels. A model including collagen and size best predicted burst pressure. Every 10-U increase in collagen resulted in 15% increase in burst pressure (95% confidence interval = 0.2%-32%, P = 0.047, R(2) = 0.36). Atherosclerosis was unrelated to burst pressure controlling for collagen and size. CONCLUSIONS Collagen and size provide the best model fit for predicting burst pressure.

Our results suggest that there was virtually no effect of the Covid-19 pandemic growth on fractional changes in market arrivals while the former negatively influences fractional food price changes in the short run. However, once we consider feedback effects in the VAR model based on Impulse Response Functions, the overall elasticity of the fractional change in the market arrival with respect to the Covid-19 pandemic growth turns from weakly positive to zero in a relatively short term. The overall elasticity of the fractional change in the market price with respect to the Covid-19 pandemic growth turns from positive to zero or negative in onion and tomato, and from negative to zero in rice and potato.

We tested reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a method which can produce results in under 30 min, alongside standard methods in a real-life clinical setting. METHODS: This prospective service improvement project piloted an RT-LAMP method on nasal and pharyngeal swabs on 21 residents of a high dependency care home, with two index COVID-19 cases, and compared it to multiplex tandem reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We recorded vital signs of patients to correlate clinical and laboratory information and calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of a single swab using RT-LAMP compared with the current standard, RT-PCR, as per Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) guidelines. RESULTS: The novel method accurately detected 8/10 RT-PCR positive cases and identified a further 3 positive cases. Eight further cases were negative using both methods. Using repeated RT-PCR as a gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of a single novel test were 80 and 73% respectively. PPV was 73% and NPV was 83%.

A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of severe pneumonia and has rapidly spread through many nations, crashing health systems and leading a large number of people to death. In Brazil, the emergence of local epidemics in major metropolitan areas has always been a concern. In a vast and heterogeneous country, with regional disparities and climate diversity, several factors can modulate the dynamics of COVID-19. What should be the scenario for inner Brazil, and what can we do to control infection transmission in each of these locations? Here, a mathematical model is proposed to simulate disease transmission among individuals in several scenarios, differing by abiotic factors, social-economic factors, and effectiveness of mitigation strategies. The disease control relies on keeping all individuals' social distancing and detecting, followed by isolating, infected ones.

We aimed to identify associations between clinical and radiographic features as well as to assess the feasibility of deep learning applied to chest X-rays in the setting of an acute COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A retrospective study of X-rays, clinical, and laboratory data was performed from 48 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients (age 6017 years, 15 women) between February 22 and March 6, 2020 from a tertiary care hospital in Milan, Italy. Sixty-five chest X-rays were reviewed by two radiologists for alveolar and interstitial opacities and classified by severity on a scale from 0 to 3. Clinical factors (age, symptoms, comorbidities) were investigated for association with opacity severity and also with placement of central line or endotracheal tube. Deep learning models were then trained for two tasks: lung segmentation and opacity detection. Imaging characteristics were compared to clinical datapoints using the unpaired student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Cohen's kappa analysis was used to evaluate the concordance of deep learning to conventional radiologist interpretation. RESULTS: Fifty-six percent of patients presented with alveolar opacities, 73% had interstitial opacities, and 23% had normal X-rays. The presence of alveolar or interstitial opacities was statistically correlated with age (P = 0.008) and comorbidities (P = 0.005). The extent of alveolar or interstitial opacities on baseline X-ray was significantly associated with the presence of endotracheal tube (P = 0.0008 and P = 0.049) or central line (P = 0.003 and P = 0.007). In comparison to human interpretation, the deep learning model achieved a kappa concordance of 0.51 for alveolar opacities and 0.71 for interstitial opacities. CONCLUSION: Chest X-ray analysis in an acute COVID-19 outbreak showed that the severity of opacities was associated with advanced age, comorbidities, as well as acuity of care.

METHODS: We designed a triplex RT-qPCR assay based on nCoV19 primers and probes where N1, N2, and RP are labeled with FAM, HEX, and Cy5, respectively, so only a single PCR reaction is required for each sample for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. RESULTS: In total, 172 samples were analyzed in both singleplex and triplex assays, where 86 samples tested SARS-CoV-2 negative with both assays, so the triplex assay specificity was 100%. In addition, 86 samples tested SARS-Co-V 2 positive with the singleplex assay and 84 with the triplex assay, so the sensitivity was 97.7%.

To investigate the cognitive processes underlying health-prevention behavior in the pandemic, we co-opted the dual-process model of thinking to measure participants propensities for automatic and intuitive thinking vs. controlled and reflective thinking. Self-reports of 17 precautionary behaviors, including regular hand washing, social distancing, and wearing a face mask, served as a dependent measure. The results of hierarchical regressions showed that age, risk-taking propensity, and concern about the pandemic predicted adoption of precautionary behavior.

This observation may help design efficient antibody-based COVID-19 therapies and may also explain the increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 of autoimmune patients receiving therapies that impair the production of immunoglobulin M (IgM).","output":"Major role of IgM in the neutralizing activity of convalescent plasma against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus, accountable for the COVID-19 pandemic, is now sweeping the globe.

Computed tomography (CT) findings, such as a spot sign have been shown to be an independent predictor of poor outcome. We have recently encountered a succession of ICH patients who presented with a peculiar imaging finding, which we term the spot on a string sign. This is a rare imaging finding, and interestingly, all these patients presented to our institution over the last few weeks. METHODS: This was a single high-volume center series of patients who presented to our institution between 1 April and 21 May 2020. All patients underwent initial non-contrast CT brain and subsequent CT angiography (CTA). We also present laboratory and clinical data. Our primary measure was the presence of the spot on a string sign on the CTA. We also report the clinical course of these patients. RESULTS: In this study seven large-volume ICH patients with this imaging sign were identified, with a median age of 48 years (range 30-68 years). All had tested negative for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). CONCLUSION: We have described an unusual imaging finding in a cohort of younger patients with large-volume ICH, all of whom presented in a 2-month period to a high-volume neurovascular unit. The cause of these ICH presentations and associated imaging findings are unclear, but we encourage other clinicians to be aware of and vigilant for this rare phenomenon, especially in younger patients with such a bleeding pattern.","output":"Not a String, not a Tangle, not an Aneurysm : Emerging Pattern of Large Parenchymal Bleeding in Younger Patients Associated with Abnormal Vessels on Imaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, HIV clinics had to transform care delivery in order to ensure retention in care (RIC) for people with HIV (PWH). The objective of this quality management project is to maintain high rates of RIC and viral load suppression (VLS) during the pandemic for PWH receiving services at an academic HIV clinic in the Midwest. METHODS: We developed a multifaceted implementation strategy for clinic operation using a combination of telehealth and in-person visits. The strategy included: 1) assess for readiness and identify barriers and facilitators, 2) identify and prepare champions, 3) organize clinician implementation meetings, and 4) staff training. As a result, we developed an implementation blue print with criteria for telehealth vs. office visits, criteria for rescheduling patients, conducted staff training on telehealth and personal protective equipment, and changed the clinic structure to accommodate in-person visits for patients who did not meet telehealth criteria and walk-ins. We monitored VLS (defined as HIV RNA < 200 copies per mL) and RIC as measured by medical visit frequency (MVF, defined as percentage of patients who had one visit in each 6 months of the preceding 24 months with at least 60 days between visits); and gap in care (GiC, defined as no visit in the preceding 6 months). RESULTS: As of June 14, 2020, there were 1140 active PWH receiving care at the clinic. By February 29, 2020 there were 34 patients lost to care as (defined as no visit within the preceding 12 months). Between March 1 and June 14, 2020 we conducted a total 943 visits, out of which 642 (68%) were in person and 301 (32%) were telephone visits. By end of May 2020, there were 47 patients lost to care. MVF decreased to 40% compared to 69% for FY2020, and GiC increased to 25% compared to 14% for FY2020. VLS rate remained unchanged at 91%. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decrease in MVF and an increase in GiC for PWH. However, VLS remained high at 91%. Our implementation strategy facilitated quick adoption of telemedicine, which helped us provide clinical care to a third of PWH during the pandemic. Telemedicine provided a great tool for ensuring patients remain VLS. Evaluation of implementation outcomes including fidelity and reach remains ongoing.

The incidence and prevalence of SARS CoV-2 associated acute renal failure are emerging day by day. While the pathogenesis is not clearly understood, it is considered multifactorial. Initially, the COVID-19-associated renal dysfunction was limited to acute tubular injury. However, over time a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations has been reported. Therefore, prompt investigation and early initiation of supportive treatment can potentially reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with this systemic disease. In this case report, we present a unique presentation of a COVID-19 with acute kidney injury where the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with clinical features of acute renal failure with concomitant diagnosis of COVID-19, unlike other reported cases where patients were admitted to the intensive unit with respiratory distress and subsequently developed renal failure.","output":"A Unique Presentation of Acute Kidney Injury With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: About half of older adults with impaired cognition who are discharged home from the emergency department (ED) return for further care within 30 days. We tested the effect of an adapted Care Transitions Intervention (CTI) at reducing ED revisits in this vulnerable population. METHODS: We conducted a pre\\\\planned subgroup analysis of community\\\\dwelling, cognitively impaired older (age 60 years) participants from a randomized controlled trial testing the effectiveness of the CTI adapted for ED\\\\to\\\\home transitions. The parent study recruited ED patients from three university\\\\affiliated hospitals from 2016 to 2019. Subjects eligible for this sub\\\\analysis had to: (1) have a primary care provider within these health systems; (2) be discharged to a community residence; (3) not receive care management or hospice services; and (4) be cognitively impaired in the ED, as determined by a score >10 on the Blessed Orientation Memory Concentration Test. The primary outcome, ED revisits within 30 days of discharge, was abstracted from medical records and evaluated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of our sub\\\\sample (N = 81, 36 control, 45 treatment), 57% were female and the mean age was 78 years. Multivariate analysis, adjusted for the presence of moderate to severe depression and inadequate health literacy, found that the CTI significantly reduced the odds of a repeat ED visit within 30 days (odds ratio [OR] 0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07 to 0.90) but not 14 days (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.93). Multivariate analysis of outpatient follow\\\\up found no significant effects.

In mammals, mitophagy is mediated by BNIP3L (also known as NIX) that is a dual regulator of mitochondrial turnover and programmed cell death pathways. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with deficiency of BNIP3L are more sensitive to mitochondria-targeting drugs. But small molecular inhibitors for BNIP3L are currently not available. Some immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) have been proved by FDA for hematologic malignancies, however, the underlining molecular mechanisms are still elusive, which hindered the applications of BNIP3L inhibition for AML treatment. In this study we carried out MS-based quantitative proteomics analysis to identify the potential neosubstrates of a novel thalidomide derivative CC-885 in A549 cells. In total, we quantified 5029 proteins with 36 downregulated in CRBN(+/+) cell after CC-885 administration. Bioinformatic analysis showed that macromitophagy pathway was enriched in the negative pathway after CC-885 treatment. We further found that CC-885 caused both dose- and time-dependent degradation of BNIP3L in CRBN(+/+), but not CRBN(?/?) cell. Thus, our data uncover a novel role of CC-885 in the regulation of mitophagy by targeting BNIP3L for CRL4CRBN E3 ligase-dependent ubiquitination and degradation, suggesting that CC-885 could be used as a selective BNIP3L degradator for the further investigation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CC-885 could enhance AML cell sensitivity to the mitochondria-targeting drug rotenone, suggesting that combining CC-885 and mitochondria-targeting drugs may be a therapeutic strategy for AML patients.","output":"The novel cereblon modulator CC-885 inhibits mitophagy via selective degradation of BNIP3L"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: A higher body mass index (BMI) has become acknowledged as one of the important risk factors for developing critical condition in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19).

METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in five databases for studies published until 17(th) November 2020. In the meta\\\\analysis, we calculated pooled mean difference (standardized mean difference; SMD) of visceral fat area (VFA; cm(2)) between patients in intensive care unit (ICU) and general ward, and between patients with and without IMV requirement. RESULTS: Our quantitative synthesis revealed that patients requiring intensive care had higher VFA values (SMD=0.46, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.71, p<0.001) compared to patients on the general ward. Similarly, patients requiring IMV had higher VFA values (SMD=0.38, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.71, p=0.026) compared to patients without IMV requirement.

Fitness, in turn, is often equated with population growth. This leads to an absurd prediction that life evolves to ever-faster growth rates, yet no one seriously claims generally slower population growth rates in the Triassic compared with the present day. I review here, using non-technical language, how fitness can improve yet stay constant (stagnation paradox), and why an unambiguous measure of population fitness does not exist. Subfields use different terminology for aspects of the paradox, referring to stasis, cryptic evolution or the difficulty of choosing an appropriate fitness measure; known resolutions likewise use diverse terms from environmental feedback to density dependence and evolutionary environmental deterioration. The paradox vanishes when these concepts are understood, and adaptation can lead to declining reproductive output of a population when individuals can improve their fitness by exploiting conspecifics. This is particularly readily observable when males participate in a zero-sum game over paternity and population output depends more strongly on female than male fitness. Even so, the jury is still out regarding the effect of sexual conflict on population fitness. Finally, life-history theory and genetic studies of microevolutionary change could pay more attention to each other.","output":"The stagnation paradox: the ever-improving but (more or less) stationary population fitness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To estimate the extent of WhatsApp utilization using text and media messages for inter-physician consultations among ophthalmologists (residents and specialists) at various clinical settings and its perceived benefits for ophthalmologists and their patients. We also aimed to detect obstacles that concern ophthalmologists when using WhatsApp as a consultation platform. METHODS This was a cross-sectional study using a self-administered survey through Google Forms, which was sent to 660 practicing ophthalmologists during April to May 2020. RESULTS One hundred and ninety-two ophthalmologists completed the questionnaire, 151 of which (78.6%) were specialists and 41 (21.4%) were residents. Most ophthalmologists reported using WhatsApp at least once a day for both personal and professional use. Residents reported lower rates of contacting patients using WhatsApp than specialists (1.51  0.98 vs 2.72  1.32, p < 0.001). Respondents reported WhatsApp consultations frequently replaced referrals of patients to other physicians, with a median of once a week. 97.8% of residents and 91.4% of specialists reported the ability to share media is a major advantage of WhatsApp over other medias, followed by rapid responses for consultations. CONCLUSION Many ophthalmologists already use WhatsApp as a tool for professional consultations with other providers, mainly thanks to its simplicity and wide availability. Residents use it more frequently than specialists, and ranked it higher when asked how much WhatsApp has improved the clinical setting.

MATERIAL AND METHODS This research study was conducted using the database of the National Survey of Violence against Women that consisted of the responses of a total of 26 042 female users of health care services provided by the Mexican government health agencies. The Personal Health Scale (ESP per its initials in Spanish) was used to assess emotional distress. To measure violence a 19-item scale which explores different types of violence as well as severity was used. The relationship between emotional distress and gender violence was determined through a binary logistic regression model, as were economic status and demographic variables. RESULTS One of the most important findings of this study is the high prevalence of emotional distress (15.3%) among women seeking health care services from the public sector and the relationship of such emotional distress with the experience of marital physical, psychological, and sexual violence. Factors associated with emotional distress among female users of health care services were age (26 and older); activity (laborer); working hours (71 hours a week or more); alcohol intake (greater intake); abuse during childhood (frequency and types of abuse); severity of marital violence (severe violence); socioeconomic status (very low SES); and type of dwelling (urban). CONCLUSIONS The principal predictor of emotional distress was intimate partner abuse, especially in severe expression. The next predictor was violence in childhood.

This has impeded our ability to accurately track the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the availability of unprecedented numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes on a global scale, evolutionary reconstructions are hindered by the slow accumulation of sequence divergence over its relatively short transmission history. When confronted with these issues, incorporating additional contextual data may critically inform phylodynamic reconstructions. Here, we present a new approach to integrate individual travel history data in Bayesian phylogeographic inference and apply it to the early spread of SARS-CoV-2, while also including global air transportation data. We demonstrate that including travel history data for each SARS-CoV-2 genome yields more realistic reconstructions of virus spread, particularly when travelers from undersampled locations are included to mitigate sampling bias. We further explore methods to ameliorate the impact of sampling bias by augmenting the phylogeographic analysis with lineages from undersampled locations in the analyses. Our reconstructions reinforce specific transmission hypotheses suggested by the inclusion of travel history data, but also suggest alternative routes of virus migration that are plausible within the epidemiological context but are not apparent with current sampling efforts. Although further research is needed to fully examine the performance of our travel-aware phylogeographic analyses with unsampled diversity and to further improve them, they represent multiple new avenues for directly addressing the colossal issue of sample bias in phylogeographic inference.","output":"Accommodating individual travel history, global mobility, and unsampled diversity in phylogeography: a SARS-CoV-2 case study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of research on college food pantry operations, especially in relation to emergency preparedness and disaster relief.

Sociodemographic and clinical features were compared between those seen during the 2020 coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic and previous years, as well as between infants with SARS-CoV-2 infection and infants without SARS-CoV-2 infection (SARS-CoV-2 negative or evaluated during 2018 and 2019). RESULTS: In all, 124 febrile infants <57 days of age were identified; 38 during the 2-month study period in 2018, 33 in 2019, and 53 in 2020. During 2020, fewer febrile infants had a serious bacterial infection or a positive respiratory viral panel than in prior years (6% vs 21% [P = .02]; 15% vs 53% [P < .001], respectively). SARS-CoV-2 was the most frequent pathogen detected in 2020; of 30 infants tested, 20 tested positive. Infants with SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to identify as Hispanic (P = .004), have public insurance or be uninsured (P = .01), exhibited lethargy (P = .02), had feeding difficulties (P = .002), and had lower white blood cell (P = .001), neutrophil (P < .001), and lymphocyte counts (P = .005) than the 81 infants without SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The results showed that the S2 subunit determines the difference in cell tropism of the two strains. After comparing the amino acid sequences of S protein of CK cell-adapted strain YZ120, with its parental strain IBYZ, three amino acid substitutions, A138V, L581F, and V617I, were identified. Using YZ120 as the backbone, one or more of the above-mentioned substitutions were eliminated to verify the correlation between these sites and CK cell tropism. The results showed that the CK cell tropism of the YZ120 strain depends on the V617I substitution, the change of L581F promoted the adaptation in CK cells, and the change at 138 position was not directly related to the CK cell tropism. Further validation experiments also showed that V617I had a decisive role in the adaptation of IBV to CK cells, but other areas of the virus genome also affected the replication efficiency of the virus in CK cells.","output":"The V617I Substitution in Avian Coronavirus IBV Spike Protein Plays a Crucial Role in Adaptation to Primary Chicken Kidney Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Solidarity is a fundamental social value in many European countries, though its precise practical and theoretical meaning is disputed. In a health care context, I agree with European writers who take solidarity normatively to mean roughly equal access to effective health care for all. That is, solidarity includes a sense of justice. Given that, I will argue that precision medicine represents a potential weakening of solidarity, albeit not a unique weakening. Precision medicine includes 150 targeted cancer therapies (mostly for metastatic cancer), all of which are extraordinarily expensive. Our critical question: Must a commitment to solidarity as defined mean that all these targeted cancer therapies should be guaranteed to all within each country in the European Union, no matter the cost, no matter the degree of effectiveness? Such a commitment would imply that cancer was ethically special, rightfully commandeering unlimited resources. That in itself would undermine solidarity. I offer multiple examples of how current and future dissemination of these targeted cancer drugs threaten a commitment to solidarity. An alternative is to fund more cancer prevention efforts. However, that too proves a threat to solidarity. Solidarity, with or without a sense of justice, is too abstract a notion to address these challenges. Further, we need to accept that we can only hope to achieve rough justice and supple solidarity. The precise practical meaning of these notions needs to be worked out through a fair and inclusive process of rational democratic deliberation, which is the real and practical foundation of just solidarity.","output":"Precision medicine and the fragmentation of solidarity (and justice)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Besides group A streptococcus (GAS), microbial causes of pharyngitis in children are not well known. We aimed to document the viral and bacterial aetiology of pharyngitis and to assess the pathogenic role of viruses by determining the myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) in the blood as a marker of interferon response. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, throat swabs and blood samples were collected from children (age 1C16 years) presenting to the emergency department with febrile pharyngitis. Microbial cause was sought by bacterial culture, polymerase chain reaction, and serology. Blood MxA level was determined. RESULTS: A potential pathogen was detected in 88% of 83 patients: GAS alone in 10%, GAS and viruses in 13%, group C or G streptococci alone in 2% and together with viruses in 3%, and viruses alone in 59% of cases. Enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses were the most frequently detected viruses. Blood MxA levels were higher in children with viral (880 [245C1250] g/L; median [IQR]) or concomitant GAS-viral (340 [150C710] g/L) than in those with sole GAS (105 [80C160] g/L) infections.

METHODS: Both the reporting odds ratio (ROR) method and Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) were applied to analyze safety signals of chloroquine based upon the adverse drug events (ADEs) data ranging from 2004 to 2020 as reported in the Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to systematically assesse the safety signals of chloroquine phosphate on various organs systems. RESULTS: Among the 2 063 reports of ADEs studied, 557 reports were considered to be mainly caused by chloroquine. The results demonstrated that the high-risk ADEs signals of chloroquine involved various systems, such as atrioventricular block complete (ROR=2.90, IC-2SD=1.64), ventricular fibrillation (ROR=3.40, IC-2SD=1.27), blindness (ROR=27.51, IC-2SD=0.55), cardiogenic shock (ROR=6.86, IC-2SD=0.54), vomiting (ROR=1.70, IC-2SD=1.83). Moreover, some rare ADEs with high-risk signals showed a correlation with chloroquine, including hypokalaemia (ROR=4.18,IC-2SD=1.51), renal failure acute (ROR=3.08, IC-2SD=0.30), methaemoglobinaemia (ROR=4.37, IC-2SD=0.03), and pyrexia (ROR=1.80, IC-2SD=1.84), which were consistent with literature reports. However, these ADEs were not listed in instruction and worth much attention in clinic. Moreover, basic diseases of patients and drug incompatibility need much attention to prevent the occurrence and exacerbation of chloroquine-related adverse reactions.

Clinical and laboratory information on 98 patients &#8804;21 years of age receiving active anticancer therapy, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR), was collected. RESULTS: Of the 578 pediatric oncology patients tested for COVID-19, 98 were positive, of whom 73 were symptomatic. Most experienced mild disease, 28 required inpatient management, 25 needed oxygen support, and seven required mechanical ventilation. There is a slightly higher risk of severe disease in males and obese patients, though not statistically significant. Persistent lymphopenia was noted in severe cases. Delays in cancer therapy occurred in 67% of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Of four deaths, none were solely attributable to COVID-19.

SUMMARY: In the spring of 2020, New York City quickly became a hotspot for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, putting a strain on local healthcare systems. Antimicrobial stewardship programs faced diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainties as well as healthcare resource challenges. With the lack of effective antivirals, antibiotic use in critically ill patients was difficult to avoid. Uncertainty drove antimicrobial use and thus antimicrobial stewardship principles were paramount. The dramatic influx of patients, drug and equipment shortages, and the need for prescribers to practice in alternative roles only compounded the situation. Establishing enhanced communication, education, and inventory control while leveraging the capabilities of the electronic medical record were some of the tools used to optimize existing resources. CONCLUSION: New York City was a unique and challenging environment during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The structures are in agreement with previous calorimetric and spectroscopic studies. The difference between rotatory phases (plastic crystals) I and II lies in isotropic rotations in the former and anisotropic rotations of the icosahedral clusters in the latter. Phase I is the cubic close packing (ccp) of rotating closo-molecules C(2)B(10)H(12) in the space group Fm3?. Phase II is the ccp of rotating closo-molecules C(2)B(10)H(12) in the cubic space group Pa3?. The preferred rotational axis in II varies with the isomer. The ordered phases III are orthorhombic (meta) or monoclinic (ortho and para) deformations of the cubic unit cell of the disordered phases I and II. The ordering in the phase III of the ortho-isomer carrying the biggest electrical dipole moment creates a twofold superstructure w.r.t. the cubic unit cell. The thermal polymorphism for C(2)B(10)H(12) and related metal salts can be explained by division of the cohesive intercluster interactions into two categories (i) dispersive cohesive interaction with additional Coulombic components in the metal salts and (ii) anisotropic local interaction resulting from nonuniform charge distribution around icosahedral clusters. The local interactions are averaged out by thermally activated cluster dynamics (rotations and rotational jumps) which effectively increase the symmetry of the cluster. The C(2)B(10)H(12) molecules resist at least as well as the CB(11)H(12)(C) anion to the oxidation, and both clusters form easily a mixed compound.

Complete remission (CR), inflammatory parameter changes, GCs tapering and safety were assessed at the 6th, 9th and 12th month. Vascular lesions were evaluated at the 6th and 12th month, and relapse was analysed during 12 months. RESULTS The CR rate was higher in the TOF group than in the MTX group (6 months: 85.19% vs 61.54%, p=0.07; 12 months: 88.46% vs 56.52%, p=0.02). During 12 months' treatment, patients in the TOF group achieved a relatively lower relapse rate (11.54% vs 34.78%, p=0.052) and a longer median relapse-free duration (11.650.98 vs 10.482.31 months, p=0.03). Average GCs dose at the 3rd, 6th and 12th month was lower in the TOF group than that in the MTX group (p<0.05). A difference was not observed in disease improvement or disease progression on imaging between the two groups (p>0.05). Prevalence of side effects was low in both groups (3.70% vs 15.38%, p=0.19). CONCLUSION TOF was superior to MTX for CR induction, a tendency to prevent relapse and tapering of the GCs dose in TAK treatment.

The C-terminal ORF1a protein nsp10 colocalizes with viral replication complexes, but its role in transcription/replication is not well defined. To investigate the role of nsp10 in coronavirus transcription/replication, alanine replacements were engineered into a murine hepatitis virus (MHV) infectious clone in place of conserved residues in predicted functional domains or charged amino acid pairs/triplets, and rescued viruses were analyzed for mutant phenotypes. Of the 16 engineered clones, 5 viable viruses were rescued, 3 mutant viruses generated no cytopathic effect but were competent to synthesize viral subgenomic RNAs, and 8 were not viable. All viable mutants showed reductions in growth kinetics and overall viral RNA synthesis, implicating nsp10 as being a cofactor in positive- or negative-strand synthesis. Viable mutant nsp10-E2 was compromised in its ability to process the nascent polyprotein, as processing intermediates were detected in cells infected with this virus that were not detectable in wild-type infections. Mapping the mutations onto the crystal structure of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus nsp10 identified a central core resistant to mutation. Mutations targeting residues in or near either zinc-binding finger generated nonviable phenotypes, demonstrating that both domains are essential to nsp10 function and MHV replication. All mutations resulting in viable phenotypes mapped to loops outside the central core and were characterized by a global decrease in RNA synthesis.

Prehabilitation seems to attenuate the loss of lean mass in the early postoperative period. However, its long-term role has not been studied. Lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic has forced to carry out the prehabilitation program at home. This study aimed to assess the effect of home prehabilitation on body composition, complications, and hospital stay in patients undergoing oncological colorectal surgery. METHODS: A prospective and randomized clinical study was conducted in 20 patients operated of colorectal cancer during COVID-19 lockdown (13 March to 21 June 2020) in a single university clinical hospital. Patients were randomized into two study groups (10 per group): prehabilitation vs standard care. Changes in lean mass and fat mass at 45 and 90 days after surgery were measured using multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis. RESULTS: Prehabilitation managed to reduce hospital stay (4.8 vs 7.2 days, p = 0.052) and postoperative complications (20% vs 50%, p = 0.16). Forty-five days after surgery, the loss of lean mass decreased (1.7% vs 7.1%, p = 0.17). These differences in lean mass were attenuated at 90 days; however, the standard care group increased considerably their fat mass compared to the prehabilitation group (+ 8.72% vs ? 8.16%).

Asides transportation of oxygen, fish erythrocytes are capable of several immune defence processes. Nucleated fish erythrocytes represent prime candidates for carrying out ETotic responses. ETosis is an evolutionary conserved innate immune defence process found in both vertebrates and invertebrates, which involves the extrusion of DNA studded with antimicrobial proteins into the extracellular space serving to trap and kill microorganisms. In this report, we demonstrate that fish erythrocytes isolated from Danio rerio (zebrafish) produce ETotic-like responses when exposed to chemical and physiological stimuli. Furthermore, we found Salmo salar (Atlantic salmon) erythrocytes produce similar ETotic responses. We have termed these ET-like formations Fish Erythrocyte Extracellular Traps (FEETs). Interestingly, we discovered that mammalian inducers of NETosis, such as the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and the calcium ionophore ionomycin, induced FEETs. Moreover, we found that FEETs are dependent upon activation of PKC and generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Thus, this brief report represents the first demonstration that fish erythrocytes can exhibit ETotic-like responses, unveiling a previously unknown function of nucleated erythrocytes, which sheds new light on the innate immune arsenal of erythrocytes.","output":"Nucleated Fish Erythrocyte Extracellular Traps (FEETs) release is an evolutionary conserved immune defence process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Transurethral catheterization (TUC) is a common hospital procedure. According to the literature, junior doctors contribute to the majority of TUC-related injuries. Our aim is to evaluate the immediate and long-term impact of a short procedure-centric TUC workshop on junior doctor's confidence, procedural knowledge, and ability to identify potential complications of catheterization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intern doctors were invited to attend a one-hour workshop on TUC. A questionnaire was completed before and after the workshop. Three months later, the questionnaire was readministered to assess the workshop's long-term impact. The questionnaire consisted of three domains. A: experience, training, and confidence levels (using 5-point Likert scales), B: procedural knowledge (the highest possible score was 10 points), and C: identification of TUC-related complications (the highest possible score was 3 points). RESULTS: 81 interns participated and reported a confidence level of 3.03  1.05 in performing a straightforward TUC. Preworkshop domain B and domain C were 3.92  1.63 and 1.75  0.69 points, respectively. After the workshop, reported confidence levels improved to 3.71 + 1.02 (p < 0.05). Likewise, the scores in domains B and C increased significantly to 8.85  1.40 (p < 0.005) and 2.65  0.6 (p < 0.005), respectively. Three months later, the same parameters were evaluated, and confidence levels were higher than those of the preworkshop levels at 3.83  0.77 (p < 0.05). The average domain B score was 7.85  1.88 (p < 0.005), and domain C score was 2.69  0.53 (p < 0.005). All scores reported after three months were significantly better than the preworkshop levels (p < 0.005), but there were no statistically significant differences when compared to the immediate postworkshop scores (p > 0.05).

PCR screening is the adopted diagnostic testing method for COVID-19 detection. However, PCR is criticized due its low sensitivity ratios, also, it is time-consuming and manual complicated process. CT imaging proved its ability to detect the disease even for asymptotic patients, which make it a trustworthy alternative for PCR. In addition, the appearance of COVID-19 infections in CT slices, offers high potential to support in disease evolution monitoring using automated infection segmentation methods. However, COVID-19 infection areas include high variations in term of size, shape, contrast and intensity homogeneity, which impose a big challenge on segmentation process. To address these challenges, this paper proposed an automatic deep learning system for COVID-19 infection areas segmentation. The system include different steps to enhance and improve infection areas appearance in the CT slices so they can be learned efficiently using the deep network. The system start prepare the region of interest by segmenting the lung organ, which then undergo edge enhancing diffusion filtering (EED) to improve the infection areas contrast and intensity homogeneity. The proposed FCN is implemented using U-net architecture with modified residual block with concatenation skip connection. The block improves the learning of gradient values by forwarding the infection area features through the network. To demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of the proposed system, it is trained and tested using many 2D CT slices extracted from diverse datasets from different sources. The proposed system is evaluated using different measures and achieved dice overlapping score of 0.961 and 0.780 for lung and infection areas segmentation, respectively.","output":"Automatic Deep Learning System for COVID-19 Infection Quantification in chest CT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of location-based data in clinical settings is often limited to real-time monitoring. In this study, we aim to develop a proximity-based localization system and show how its longitudinal deployment can provide operational insights related to staff and patients' mobility and room occupancy in clinical settings. Such a streamlined data-driven approach can help in increasing the uptime of operating rooms and more broadly provide an improved understanding of facility utilization. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to measure the accuracy of the system and algorithmically calculate measures of mobility and occupancy. METHODS: We developed a Bluetooth low energy, proximity-based localization system and deployed it in a hospital for 30 days. The system recorded the position of 75 people (17 patients and 55 staff) during this period. In addition, we collected ground-truth data and used them to validate system performance and accuracy. A number of analyses were conducted to estimate how people move in the hospital and where they spend their time. RESULTS: Using ground-truth data, we estimated the accuracy of our system to be 96%. Using mobility trace analysis, we generated occupancy rates for different rooms in the hospital occupied by both staff and patients. We were also able to measure how much time, on average, patients spend in different rooms of the hospital. Finally, using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, we showed that the system could differentiate between staff and patients without training.

However, the potential long-term effects of this infection haven't been extensively discussed. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to cause persistent infection in some individuals, and should this be the case, that in a few years we may see a rise in cancer incidence due to carcinogenic effects of this coronavirus. Non-retroviral RNA viruses such as Coronaviridae have been shown to cause persistent infection in hosts. Empirical evidence of viral genomic material shedding weeks after apparent clinical and laboratorial resolution of COVID-19 may be an indirect proof for persistent viral infection. Furthermore, tropism towards certain immune-privileged territories may facilitate immune evasion by this virus. Structural homology with SARS-CoV-1 indicates that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to directly impair pRb and p53, which are key gatekeepers with tumor suppressor functions. Additionally, COVID-19 features preeminent inflammatory response with marked oxidative stress, which acts as both as initiator and promotor of carcinogenesis. Should there be a carcinogenic risk associated with SARS-CoV-2, the implications for public health are plenty, as infected patients should be closely watched during long periods of follow-up.

The sudden clinical deterioration 7C8 days after initial symptom onset suggests that severe respiratory failure (SRF) in COVID-19 is driven by a unique pattern of immune dysfunction. We studied immune responses of 54 COVID-19 patients, 28 of whom had SRF. All patients with SRF displayed either macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or very low human leukocyte antigen D related (HLA-DR) expression accompanied by profound depletion of CD4 lymphocytes, CD19 lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. Tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by circulating monocytes was sustained, a pattern distinct from bacterial sepsis or influenza. SARS-CoV-2 patient plasma inhibited HLA-DR expression, and this was partially restored by the IL-6 blocker Tocilizumab; off-label Tocilizumab treatment of patients was accompanied by increase in circulating lymphocytes. Thus, the unique pattern of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 is characterized by IL-6-mediated low HLA-DR expression and lymphopenia, associated with sustained cytokine production and hyper-inflammation.","output":"Complex Immune Dysregulation in COVID-19 Patients with Severe Respiratory Failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to expand, while the relationship between weather conditions and the spread of the virus remains largely debatable In this paper, we attempt to examine this question by employing a flexible econometric model coupled with fine-scaled hourly temperature variations and a rich set of covariates for 291 cities in the Chinese mainland More importantly, we combine the baseline estimates with climate-change projections from 21 global climate models to understand the pandemic in different scenarios We found a significant negative relationship between temperatures and caseload A one-hour increase in temperatures from 25 C to 28 C tends to reduce daily cases by 15 1%, relative to such an increase from -2 C to 1 C Our results also suggest an inverted U-shaped nonlinear relationship between relative humidity and confirmed cases Despite the negative effects of heat, we found that rising temperatures induced by climate change are unlikely to contain a hypothesized pandemic in the future In contrast, cases would tend to increase by 10 9% from 2040 to 2059 with a representative concentration pathway (RCP) of 4 5 and by 7 5% at an RCP of 8 5, relative to 2020, though reductions of 1 8% and 18 9% were projected for 2080-2099 for the same RCPs, respectively These findings raise concerns that the pandemic could worsen under the climate-change framework ? 2020 The Author(s) Published by IOP Publishing Ltd","output":"How do weather and climate change impact the COVID-19 pandemic?

To address concerns of misuse, the antibiotic stewardship unit (ASU) expanded prospective audit feedback (PAF) to CA ARI patients admitted to ARI wards, with low procalcitonin (PCT). PAF was conducted on day 2-3 of ABx, on weekdays. Doctors received feedback to stop/modify when ABx was deemed inappropriate. Here, we describe the impact of ASUs adaptive approach to curb rising ABx use in patients admitted for ARI during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A Pre- & Post-intervention study was conducted. All patients started on ABx (ceftriaxone/co-amoxiclav/piptazo/carbapenems/levofloxacin) for CA ARI & PCT < 0.5g/L were analysed. Those who died 48h of admission;admitted to intensive care;required ABx escalation;>1 infective sites;complex lung infection were excluded. Primary objective was to compare the proportion of ABx stopped 4 days (time to final infection diagnosis) Pre (22/3-18/4/20) & Post (21/4-13/7/20). Results 184 (Pre) & 528 (Post) ABx courses were analysed. ASU audited 51 (Pre) & 380 (Post) courses with the rest discontinued/discharged before review. Patients were largely similar in both periods;a third had low likelihood of bacterial infection (C reactive protein < 30mg/L). In Post, 73 feedback was given to stop ABx (often because symptoms suggested viral/fluid overload) & 18 to switch to oral ABx. 82 (90%) feedback was accepted. No ABx was restarted 48h or deaths 30 days due to ARI. 1 patient had C. difficile diarrhoea a day after ABx cessation as per ASU feedback. Proportion of all ABx stopped 4 days was higher in Post than Pre [27/184 (15%) vs 152/528 (29%), p< 0.01]. Median duration of therapy of IV ABx was reduced (6.5 vs 3 days, p< 0.01), with corresponding shorter median length of stay (10.5 vs 6 days, p< 0.01). Conclusion PAF directly and indirectly reduced ABx duration in patients treated for CA ARI as prescribers become more conscious about stopping ABx when investigations show low likelihood of bacterial infection.

Using logistic regression, we analyzed the association between anti-Annexin A2 and A5 antibody levels with mortality after adjusting for age, sex, race and key comorbidities. Results: We found higher average levels of anti-Annexin A2 antibodies among hospitalized COVID-19 patients that died when compared with non-critical hospitalized COVID-19 patients (p-value = 0.006) and critically ill COVID-19 patients (p-value = 0.04). No significant differences in anti-Annexin A5 antibody levels were identified. Regression analysis showed that anti-Annexin A2 antibody levels as measured in relative units strongly predicted mortality with an odds ratio of 9.3 (95% CI: 1.9 to 44.6, p=0.005). In contrast, anti-Annexin A5 antibody levels were not associated with higher mortality (95% CI: 0.5 to 15.2, p=0.22). Conclusions: We determined that anti-Annexin A2 antibodies were elevated among hospitalized COVID-19 patients and these levels predicted mortality. It is known that inhibition of Annexin A2 induces systemic thrombosis, cell death, and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Autoimmunity to Annexin A2 is a potential mechanism that may explain the key clinical findings of severe COVID-19.","output":"Autoimmunity to the Lung Protective Phospholipid-Binding Protein Annexin A2 Predicts Mortality Among Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Surgeons are trained as \\"internists that also operate,\\" bringing an important skillset to patient management during the current COVID-19 pandemic. A review was performed to illustrate the response of surgical staff during the pandemic with regard to patient care and residency training. METHODS: The evaluation and assessment of the changes enacted at Stony Brook Medicine's Department of Surgery is illustrated through the unique perspective of surgical residents. No IRB approval or written consent was obtained nor it was necessary for the purposes of this paper. RESULTS: Hospital policy was enacted to hinder transmission of COVID-19 and included limited gatherings of people, restricted travel, quarantined symptomatic staff, and careful surveillance for disease incidence. Surgical residency transformed as residents were diverted from traditional surgical services to staff new COVID-19 ICUs. Education transitioned to an online-based platform for lectures and reviews. New skills sets were acquired such as PICC line placement and complex ventilator management.

Respiratory support was provided by helmet continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or by non-invasive ventilation. One hundred and four patients were enrolled, 84% treated with CPAP and 16% with non-invasive ventilation. Using the HendersonCHasselbalch approach, 40% and 32% of patients presented respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, respectively; 13% did not present acid-base disorders. Using Stewarts approach, 43% and 33% had a respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, respectively; 12% of patients had a mixed disorder characterized by normal pH with a lower SID. The severe hypoxemic and moderate hypoxemic group presented similar frequencies of respiratory and metabolic alkalosis. The most frequent acid-base disorders were respiratory and metabolic alkalosis using both the HendersonCHasselbalch and Stewarts approach.

Fitting mathematical models of infectious disease transmission to the available epidemiological data provides a key statistical tool for understanding the many quantities of interest that are not explicit in the underlying epidemiological data streams. Of these, the basic reproductive ratio, R, has taken on special significance in terms of the general understanding of whether the epidemic is under control (R < 1). Unfortunately, none of the epidemiological data streams are designed for modelling, hence assimilating information from multiple (often changing) sources of data is a major challenge that is particularly stark in novel disease outbreaks. Here, we present in some detail the inference scheme employed for calibrating the Warwick COVID-19 model to the available public health data streams, which span hospitalisations, critical care occupancy, mortality and serological testing. We then perform computational simulations, making use of the acquired parameter posterior distributions, to assess how the accuracy of short-term predictions varied over the timecourse of the outbreak. To conclude, we compare how refinements to data streams and model structure impact estimates of epidemiological measures, including the estimated growth rate and daily incidence.","output":"Fitting to the UK COVID-19 outbreak, short-term forecasts and estimating the reproductive number."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization (WHO) calls for the development of a rapid, biomarker-based, non-sputum test capable of detecting all forms of tuberculosis (TB) at the point-of-care to enable immediate treatment initiation. Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is the only WHO-endorsed TB biomarker that can be detected in urine, an easily collected sample matrix. For obtaining optimal sensitivity, we and others have shown that some form of sample pretreatment is necessary to remove background from patient urine samples. A number of systems are paper-based often destined for resource limited settings. Our current work presents incorporation of one such sample pretreatment, proteinase K (ProK) immobilized on paper (IPK) and test its performance in comparison to standard proteinase K (SPK) treatment that involves addition and deactivation at high temperature prior to performing a capture ELISA. Herein, a simple and economical method was developed for using ProK immobilized strips to pretreat urine samples. Simplification and cost reduction of the proposed pretreatment strip were achieved by using Whatman no.1 paper and by minimizing the concentration of ProK (an expensive but necessary reagent) used to pretreat the clinical samples prior to ELISA. To test the applicability of IPK, capture ELISA was carried out on either LAM-spiked urine or the clinical samples after pretreatment with ProK at 400 g/mL for 30 minutes at room temperature. The optimal conditions and stability of the IPK were tested and validation was performed on a set of 25 previously analyzed archived clinical urine samples with known TB and HIV status. The results of IPK and SPK treated samples were in agreement showing that the urine LAM test currently under development has the potential to reach adult and pediatric patients regardless of HIV status or site of infection, and to facilitate global TB control to improve assay performance and ultimately treatment outcomes.","output":"Immobilization of Proteinase K for urine pretreatment to improve diagnostic accuracy of active tuberculosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The heterogeneity of COVID-19 experience and response for each individual is irrefutable; nevertheless, similarities can be observed between countries with respect to people's psychological responses.

A demographic form and adopted stigma scale were used to collect participants' demographic information and stigmatizing attitudes toward COVID-19 and AIDS. Results: A total of 13,994 questionnaires were included in this study. A high portion of participants tend to avoid contact with individuals affected with COVID-19 (74.3%) or AIDS (59.0%), as well as their family members (70.4% for COVID-19 and 47.9% for AIDS). About half of the participants agreed that affected persons could not only cause problems to their own family but also have adverse effects on others (59.6% and 55.6% for COVID-19, 56.9 and 47.0% for AIDS). The agreements with statements about perceived stigma were similar but slightly higher than those about personal stigma in both COVID-19 and AIDS. Participants' agreements with all statements regarding personal and perceived stigma attitudes between COVID-19 and AIDS were all statistically significant (p < 0.001). Participants obtained COVID-19-related information mainly from social media (91.3%) and newspaper or television (77.1%) during the epidemic, and 61.0% of them thought information from newspapers or television was the most reliable. Conclusion: Several similarities and differences of people's attitude toward COVID-19 and AIDS were found. Avoidance, blame, and secondary discrimination to diagnosed persons and their surrounding persons were the main representations of COVID-19-related stigma.

Upon sucrose gradient centrifugation, the major virus band was found at a density of 1.20 to 1.22 g/cm(3). This high density was observed only when TGEV with a functional sialic acid binding activity was analyzed. Mutants of TGEV that lacked sialic acid binding activity due to a point mutation in the sialic acid binding site of the S protein were mainly recovered at a lower-density position on the sucrose gradient (1.18 to 1.19 g/cm(3)). Neuraminidase treatment of purified virions resulted in a shift of the sedimentation value from the higher to the lower density. These results suggest that binding of sialoglycoproteins to the virion surface is responsible for the sedimentation behavior of TGEV. When purified virions were treated with octylglucoside to solubilize viral glycoproteins, ultracentrifugation resulted in sedimentation of the S protein of TGEV. However, when neuraminidase-treated virions or mutants with a defective sialic acid binding activity were analyzed, the S protein remained in the supernatant rather than in the pellet fraction. These results indicate that the interaction of the surface protein S with sialoglycoconjugates is maintained after solubilization of this viral glycoprotein by detergent treatment.","output":"Sialic acid binding activity of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus affects sedimentation behavior of virions and solubilized glycoproteins."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly spread across the world.

Engaging patients with stimulant use disorder in regular treatment has become even more difficult during this pandemic, which has resulted in many cuts to addiction treatment programs. The most effective treatment options for stimulant use disorder are psychosocial interventions, which rely heavily on in-person interactions, posing an added challenge during physical distancing. In particular, contingency management (CM) is a behavioral therapy that utilizes tangible reinforcements to incentivize targeted behavior changes, and is an effective treatment intervention used for stimulant use disorder.

These therapies represent a valuable new treatment option, yielding impressive complete remission rates and improving survival. The aim of this article is to give an overview of emerging real-world evidence since data from every-day clinical practice are still scarce. We report effectiveness and safety data on 30 patients treated at our Institution. Treatment in this setting with CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapies for relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma showed a manageable safety profile and high objective response rate, confirming the encouraging results of the pivotal clinical trials. ABSTRACT: Large B-cell lymphomas (LBCL) are the most common types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although outcomes have improved thanks to the introduction of rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy, certain LBCL still represents a challenge because of initial resistance to therapy or recurrent relapses. Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) and tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) are second-generation autologous CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies approved for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) LBCL, based on the results of phase II pivotal single-arm trials ZUMA-1 (for axi-cel) and JULIET (for tisa-cel). Here, we report patients outcomes with axi-cel and tisa-cel in the standard of care (SoC) setting for R/R LBCL, treated at our Institution. Data were collected from patients who underwent leukapheresis between August 2019 and February 2021. Toxicities were graded and managed according to the institutions guidelines. Responses were assessed as per Lugano 2014 classification. Of the 30 patients who underwent leukapheresis, 18 (60%) received axi-cel, while 12 (40%) tisa-cel.

Methods: The setting was an EM residency program in the state with the highest per-capita deaths from COVID-19. All EM residents were surveyed eight months into the pandemic using Google Forms. Surveys were anonymous to promote honesty. Residents were asked about to identify the three factors that had the greatest negative impact on their wellness. They were also asked to identify the three features that did most to improve wellness. Demographic information was collected. Results: 23 of 27 residents (85%) completed the survey. 91% (95% CI 80-100) said the negative impact of the pandemic affects them more socially than professionally. The factors identified most commonly contributing negatively to a residents wellness were decreased socialization/isolation (74%) and concerns for family safety (70%). Changing hospital protocols (35%), feeling under-appreciated at work (30%), and public not doing enough to stop the spread (30%) were also identified frequently as having a negative effect. Concerns for my own safety was only identified by 17% of residents as being a top-three issue. The features most commonly identified as helping wellness were ability to socialize in small groups (65%), team mentality (57%) and free food (44%). Conclusion: Overwhelmingly, residents cite the social impact of the pandemic as having a more negative effect on their wellness than work did.

We propose a framework composed by a facial recognition software and a machine learning model trained to detect when to provide guidance according to changes of the user facial expressions. We trained the model by interviewing several analysts during their work and ranked multiple facial features based on their relative importance in determining the need of guidance.

We benchmarked our sequencing and variant-calling methods on known viral genome sequences to establish thresholds for inferring variants in wastewater with confidence. We found that variant frequency estimates in wastewater and clinical samples are correlated over time in each city, with similar dates of first detection. Across all variant lineages, wastewater detection is more concordant with targeted outbreak sequencing than with semi-random clinical swab sampling. Most variants were first observed in clinical and outbreak data due to higher sequencing rate. However, wastewater sequencing is highly efficient, detecting more variants for a given sampling effort.

The Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO) is the largest among several COVID ontologies, and it keeps growing, but it is still a medium sized ontology. Sophisticated CIDO users, who need more than searching for a specific concept, require orientation and comprehension of CIDO. In previous research, we designed a summarization network called partial-area taxonomy to support comprehension of ontologies. The partial-area taxonomy for CIDO is of smaller magnitude than CIDO, but is still too large for comprehension. We present here the weighted aggregate taxonomy of CIDO, designed to provide compact views at various granularities of our partial-area taxonomy (and the CIDO ontology). Such a compact view provides a big picture of the content of an ontology. In previous work, in the visualization patterns used for partial-area taxonomies, the nodes were arranged in levels according to the numbers of relationships of their concepts. Applying this visualization pattern to CIDO's weighted aggregate taxonomy resulted in an overly long and narrow layout that does not support orientation and comprehension since the names of nodes are barely readable. Thus, we introduce in this paper an innovative visualization of the weighted aggregate taxonomy for better orientation and comprehension of CIDO (and other ontologies). A measure for the efficiency of a layout is introduced and is used to demonstrate the advantage of the new layout over the previous one. With this new visualization, the user can see the forest for the trees of the ontology. Benefits of this visualization in highlighting insights into CIDOs content are provided. Generality of the new layout is demonstrated.","output":"Visual Comprehension and Orientation into the COVID-19 CIDO Ontology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate prediction of natural gas consumption (NGC) can offer effective information for energy planning and policy-making.

However, there is little evidence and no official recommendations from any health care organization regarding best wound irrigation practices. This is the first review of wound irrigation that systematically summarizes the literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and distills the evidence into a practical format. In this comprehensive review, the authors outline the irrigation fluids and delivery methods used in the identified studies, analyze reported treatment outcomes, summarize irrigation effectiveness, and propose evidence-based guidelines to improve wound healing outcomes and enhance the consistency of wound irrigation. Thirty-one high-quality studies with a combined total of 61,808 patients were included. Based on the current evidence provided by this review, the authors propose the following guidelines: (1) acute soft-tissue wounds should receive continuous gravity flow irrigation with polyhexanide; (2) complex wounds should receive continuous negative-pressure wound therapy with instillation with polyhexanide; (3) infected wounds should receive continuous negative-pressure wound therapy with instillation with silver nitrate, polyhexanide, acetic acid, or povidone-iodine; (4) breast implant wounds should receive gravity lavage with povidone-iodine or antibiotics; and (5) surgical-site infection rates can be reduced with intraoperative povidone-iodine irrigation.","output":"Evidence-Based Wound Irrigation: Separating Fact from Fiction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the advent of social media, there is a data abundance so that analytics can be reliably designed for ultimately providing valuable information towards a given product or service.

How to cooperate with the government's pandemic-prevention policies and reduce the gap between education and clinical practice represent significant challenges. In this paper, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology (CCUST) is used as an example to show how schools in Taiwan have effectively adapted the fundamentals of nursing practicum programs to the current pandemic using e-learning, group discussions, case analysis, clinical skill practice, and clinical case simulation scenario exercises. The program at CCUST both takes into account the safety of students and has achieved all critical nursing practice goals. After implementation of these adjustments, satisfaction among nursing students with the practicum environment and the clinical instructors was found to be significantly higher for the on-campus clinical practicum than for the off-campus clinical practicum. Furthermore, the results of qualitative data analyses show that nursing students in the on-campus practicum gained significant knowledge and experience and commented positively on their experience. For example, the students indicated that they were satisfied with the simulated clinical environment of the CCC, the teaching strategies and adaptability of the instructor, and the application of virtual reality scenario cases to enhance skill proficiency and learning outcomes.

This reality was especially accentuated in Ecuador where, the shortage of healthcare workers combined with cultural and macroeconomic factors has led Ecuador to face the most aggressive outbreak in Latin America. In this context, the participation of final-year medical students on the front line is indispensable. Appropriate training on COVID-19 is an urgent requirement that universities and health systems must guarantee. We aimed to describe the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Ecuadorian final-year medical students that could potentially guide the design of better medical education curricula regarding COVID-19. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional 33-item online survey conducted between April 6 to April 2020 assessing the knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and prognosis toward COVID-19 in Ecuadorian final-year medical students. It was sent by email, Facebook, and WhatsApp. RESULTS: A total of 309 students responded to the survey. Out of which 88% of students scored high ( 70% correct) for knowledge of the disease. The majority of students were pessimistic about possible government actions, which is reflected in the negative attitude towards the control of COVID-19 and volunteering during the outbreak in Ecuador (77%, and 58% of the students, respectively). Moreover, 91% of students said they did not have adequate protective equipment. The latter finding was significantly associated with negative attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: Although a large number of students displayed negative attitudes, the non-depreciable percentage of students who were willing to volunteer and the coexisting high level of knowledge displayed by students, suggests that Ecuador has a capable upcoming workforce that could benefit from an opportunity to strengthen, improve and advance their training in preparation for COVID-19. Not having personal protective equipment was significantly associated to negative attitudes. Providing the necessary tools and creating a national curriculum may be one of the most effective ways to ensure all students are trained, whilst simultaneously focusing on the students most pressing concerns. With this additional training, negative attitudes will improve and students will be better qualified.

The pandemic led us to revisit one of psychologys most fundamental and most basic questions in a high-stakes context: What determines human behavior? Adopting a Lewinian interactionist lens, we investigate the independent and joint effects of macro-level government policies and micro-level psychological factorsi.e., personalityon whether individuals sheltered-in-place. We analyzed data collected in late March and early April 2020 from 101,005 participants in 55 countries, a time period that coincided with the early and accelerating stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. This time period also contained substantial variation in the stringency of governmental policy towards sheltering-in-place, both between countries and within each country over time. Analyses revealed that personality and the stringency of governmental policies independently predicted sheltering-in-place rates. Policy stringency was positively related to sheltering-in-place. For the personality dimensions, openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism all predicted higher rates of sheltering-in-place, whereas extraversion was negatively related to staying at home. In addition, two personality traitsopenness to experience and neuroticisminteracted with governmental policy to predict whether individuals sheltered-in-place;openness and neuroticism each had weaker effects on sheltering-in-place as governmental policies became stricter. Theoretically, the findings demonstrate that individual differences predict behavior (i.e., sheltering-in-place) even when governments take strong action targeting that behavior. Practically, they suggest that even if governments lift their shelter-in-place restrictions, some individuals will shelter-in-place less than others.","output":"How Personality and Policy Predict Pandemic Behavior: Understanding Sheltering-in-Place in 55 Countries at the Onset of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a non-majors upper-level undergraduate environmental history course focused on the Laurentian Great Lakes, students researched and wrote micro-histories of the Rochester, NY area.

Our study aimed to assess persistent symptoms in COVID-19 patients after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODOLOGY: A multi-center survey was conducted on first wave COVID-19 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, including presenting symptoms and persistent symptoms after viral clearance and possible factors contributing to persistence of such symptoms, were collected using an online multicomponent questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was performed to detect the most persisting symptoms and factors contributing to their persistence. RESULTS: Overall, 538 patients were enrolled. Mean age was 41.17 (SD 14.84), 54.1% were males, and 18.6% were smokers. Hypertension and diabetes were the most reported co-morbidities. Mild symptoms were reported in 61.3% of patients, 51.3% were admitted to hospital and 6.5% were admitted to the intensive care unit. Our study identified 49 types of persisting symptoms. Fatigue (59.1%), sense of fever (46.5%), anorexia (24.3%) and diarrhea (24.3%) were the most commonly reported persisting symptoms followed by loss of taste and smell (22.3%), headache (21.4%), cough (20.8) and dyspnea (21%).

Activation of the renin\\\\angiotensin\\\\aldosterone system (RAAS) contributes to avid sodium retention, cardiac hypertrophy and oedema formation, including lung congestion. While the status of the classic components of RAAS such as renin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II (Ang II) and angiotensin II receptor AT\\\\1 is well studied in CHF, the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme\\\\2 (ACE2), a key enzyme of angiotensin 1\\\\7 (Ang 1\\\\7) generation in the pulmonary, cardiac and renal systems has not been studied thoroughly in this clinical setting. This issue is of a special interest as Ang 1\\\\7 counterbalance the vasoconstrictory, pro\\\\inflammatory and pro\\\\proliferative actions of Ang II. Furthermore, CHF predisposes to COVID\\\\19 disease severity, while ACE2 also serves as the binding domain of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in human host\\\\cells, and acts in concert with furin, an important enzyme in the synthesis of BNP in CHF, in permeating viral functionality along TMPRSST2. ADAM17 governs ACE2 shedding from cell membranes. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the expression of ACE2, furin, TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 in the lung, heart and kidneys of rats with CHF to understand the exaggerated susceptibility of clinical CHF to COVID\\\\19 disease. Heart failure was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats by the creation of a surgical aorto\\\\caval fistula. Sham\\\\operated rats served as controls. One week after surgery, the animals were subdivided into compensated and decompensated CHF according to urinary sodium excretion. Both groups and their controls were sacrificed, and their hearts, lungs and kidneys were harvested for assessment of tissue remodelling and ACE2, furin, TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 immunoreactivity, expression and immunohistochemical staining. ACE2 immunoreactivity and mRNA levels increased in pulmonary, cardiac and renal tissues of compensated, but not in decompensated CHF. Furin immunoreactivity was increased in both compensated and decompensated CHF in the pulmonary, cardiac tissues and renal cortex but not in the medulla. Interestingly, both the expression and abundance of pulmonary, cardiac and renal TMPRSS2 decreased in CHF in correlation with the severity of the disease. Pulmonary, cardiac and renal ADAM17 mRNA levels were also downregulated in decompensated CHF. Circulating furin levels increased in proportion to CHF severity, whereas plasma ACE2 remained unchanged. In summary, ACE2 and furin are overexpressed in the pulmonary, cardiac and renal tissues of compensated and to a lesser extent of decompensated CHF as compared with their sham controls. The increased expression of the ACE2 in heart failure may serve as a compensatory mechanism, counterbalancing the over\\\\activity of the deleterious isoform, ACE. Downregulated ADAM17 might enhance membranal ACE2 in COVID\\\\19 disease, whereas the suppression of TMPRSS2 in CHF argues against its involvement in the exaggerated susceptibility of CHF patients to SARS\\\\CoV2.","output":"Pulmonary, cardiac and renal distribution of ACE2, furin, TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 in rats with heart failure: Potential implication for COVID\\\\19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many US health systems suspended elective surgery at the recommendation of the US Surgeon General.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A 33-item survey was distributed via email to all American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM) 2020 fellow members on April 22, 2020. Frequencies are presented as raw totals and percentages of respondents. The Fisher exact test was used to determine statistical significance between nominal variables, with significance set at P < .05. RESULTS: Of 210 registered fellows, 101 (48.1%) responded. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, the typical case volume per week for most fellows (47.5%) was 11 to 15 cases. From the enactment of COVID-19 mitigation policies to the date of survey completion, 90.1% of fellows had performed fewer than 20 cases. A total of 32 fellows were presented with redeployment options by their fellowship program, with 10 redeployed mandatorily to other hospital departments. Fellows reported that web-based didactics (n = 100) and web-based journal clubs (n = 72) were utilized as alternative supplements in the absence of clinical education. There were 8 respondents who had either their prior contract or job offer rescinded, while 1 had a signed contract voided. As a result, 6 fellows now plan to matriculate into a previously unplanned fellowship. Also, 10 respondents intended practice start date was being delayed by their employer. Respondents whose postfellowship plans were affected were statistically more likely to experience doubts about readiness for practice (58.8% vs 20.3%, respectively; P = .005), anxiety about future career plans (94.4% vs 63.8%, respectively; P = .01), anxiety about their financial situation (86.7% vs 50.8%, respectively; P = .018), stress in personal relationships (58.8% vs 29.9%, respectively; P = .045), and signs or symptoms of depression (41.2% vs 11.1%, respectively; P = .007) compared with those whose plans were not affected.

Moreover, structural studies of these antigens are key to understand the molecular basis for Spike interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor, hopefully enabling the development of COVID-19 therapeutics. Thus, it is urgent that significant amounts of this protein became available at the highest quality.

Using negative and positive sera collected from human donors, we show an excellent performance of the produced antigens, assessed in serologic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests, as denoted by the high specificity and sensitivity of the test. We show robust Spike productions with final yields of approx. 2 mg/L of culture that were maintained independently of the production scale or cell culture strategy.

However, in the absence of signs of infection or at resolution thereof, inappropriately and persistently high PCT may suggest and reveal the presence of other pathologies. We report a patient with acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia in whom persistence of initially elevated PCT during recovery prompted the diagnosis of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Case report: A 43- year-old man presented with a two-day history of fever, sneezing, sore throat and dry cough. Physical exam revealed decreased sounds and coarse crackles in both lung bases at auscultation. Medical history was positive for cognitive impairment since birth, arterial hypertension, systemic lupus erythematosus with nephritis. Initial studies included mild lymphocytopenia 650/l (760 - 5000), D-Dimer 0.73 g/ml (< 0.5), C reactive protein (CRP) of 62 mg/l (< 5) and PCT of 94 ng/ml (0.00 - 0.10). Positivity for SARS-Cov-2 RNA was detected and chest computerized tomography showed bilateral ground-glass opacities in the basilar lung zones and hyperdense and irregular foci in the thoracic vertebral bodies. Empirical antibiotic therapy was started and was maintained for seven days but, despite clinical improvement and the normalization of CRP, serum PCT was persistently high (84 ng/ml). Serum calcitonin (CTN) was 2120 pg/ml (normal up to 12 pg/ml). Neck ultrasound revealed inhomogeneously echogenic lymph nodes with small punctate calcifications and a non-homogeneous thyroid with multiple nodules. Cytological examination by fine needle aspiration and CTN measurement on washing liquid confirmed the suspicion of MTC. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy with bilateral cervical lymph node dissection. Histological analysis confirmed MTC of right thyroid lobe and metastasis at lymph nodes of the central right midneck area. Blood tests performed 48 hours after surgery showed a lowering of CTN (986 pg/mL) and PCT (16 ng/mL). A 6-months follow up showed persistent increased CTN and PCT levels (921 pg/ml and 16 ng/ml, respectively) while a (18)F-fluorodihydro-xyphenylalanine ((18)F-DOPA) PET did not reveal any suspicious fixations at thyroid lodge and cervical lymph node stations while multiple osteoblastic foci in the skeletal area were described. A close follow-up was planned with establishment of the results of RET gene analysis. Discussion: Although CTN is the gold standard biochemical parameter for the diagnosis and follow-up of MTC, PCT can be useful as a biochemical marker of MTC suspicion in patients with inflammatory conditions and persistently elevated PCT even after resolution. In the present CASE, high levels of PCT in a patient with Covid-19 pneumonia without signs of bacterial infection, allowed to diagnose MCT. Conclusion: In the absence of any other signs of infection, a complete clinical assessment, including neck palpation, CTN measurement and thyroid ultrasound should be performed in the presence of persistently elevated PCT.","output":"Persistence of Elevated Procalcitonin in a Patient with Covid-19 Uncovering a Diagnosis of Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The physiologic function of tripartite motif protein 56 (TRIM56), a ubiquitously expressed E3 ligase classified within the large TRIM protein family, remains elusive.

However, to what extent these pathways depend on TRIM56 in human cells is unclear. In addition, it is debatable whether TRIM56 plays a part in controlling the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) resulting from IFN-I based antiviral treatment. In this study, we created HeLa-derived TRIM56 null cell lines by gene editing and used these cell models to comprehensively examine the impact of endogenous TRIM56 on innate antiviral responses. Our results showed that TRIM56 knockout severely undermined the upregulation of ISGs by extracellular dsRNA and that loss of TRIM56 weakened the response to cytosolic dsDNA. ISG induction and ISGylation following IFN- stimulation, however, were not compromised by TRIM56 deletion.

To ground this suggestion and emphasize the complexity and significance of migrant health research, we start by briefly reviewing several migration-related notions including the process of migration and its key facilitators and benefits; existing barriers to the provision of migrant health care; and the intricate links between health systems, health professionals, and migrant health. The three areas of research examined in this article address (i) the specific role of health workers in providing care to migrants and refugees and their capacity to do so, (ii) the health problems experienced by health workers who become migrants or refugees, and (iii) the precarious employment conditions experienced by both migrant and non-migrant health care workers. After summarizing the current available evidence on these topics, we discuss key information gaps and strategies to address them, while also incorporating several relevant COVID-19 pandemic considerations and research implications. Expanding the focus of research studies on migration and health could not only enhance the results of current strategies by supplying additional information to support their implementation but also spearhead the development of new solutions to the migrant health problem.","output":"Health care workers and migrant health: Pre- and post-COVID-19 considerations for reviewing and expanding the research agenda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-2019 emerged from China in late December.

Infection of people with RVFV can occur through mosquito bite or mucosal exposure during butchering or milking of infected livestock. Disease typically presents as a self-limiting fever; however, in rare cases, hepatitis, encephalitis and ocular disease may occur. Recent studies have illuminated the neuropathogenic mechanisms of RVFV in a rat aerosol infection model. Neurological disease in rats is characterized by breakdown of the bloodCbrain barrier late in infection, infiltration of leukocytes to the central nervous system (CNS) and massive viral replication in the brain. However, the route of RVFV entry into the CNS after inhalational exposure remains unknown. Here, we visualized the entire nasal olfactory route from snout to brain after RVFV infection using RNA in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence microscopy. We found widespread RVFV-infected cells within the olfactory epithelium, across the cribriform plate, and in the glomerular region of the olfactory bulb within 2 days of infection. These results indicate that the olfactory tract is a major route of infection of the brain after inhalational exposure. A better understanding of potential neuroinvasion pathways can support the design of more effective therapeutic regiments for the treatment of neurological disease caused by RVFV.","output":"Development of Rift valley fever encephalitis in rats is mediated by early infection of olfactory epithelium and neuroinvasion across the cribriform plate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant impact on the health care system.

The COVID-19 pandemic appears to be further exacerbating health inequities for marginalized populationsyet the experiences of resettled refugee women are not fully known. Aim: To understand Syrian refugee womens experiences accessing postnatal healthcare services and supports during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with eight resettled Syrian refugee women living in Nova Scotia (Canada) who were postnatal between March and August 2020. Data analysis was informed by constructivist grounded theory. Findings: Three themes emerged: the impacts of COVID-19 on postnatal healthcare; loss of informal support; and grief and anxiety. Women experienced difficult healthcare interactions, including socially and physically isolated deliveries, challenges accessing in-person interpreters, and cancelled or unavailable in-home services (e.g., public health nurse and doula visits). Increased childcare responsibilities and limited informal supports due to pandemic restrictions left women feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. Stay-at-home orders resulted in some women reporting feelings of isolation and loss, as they were unable to share in person postnatal moments with friends and family, ultimately impacting their mental wellness. Conclusions: COVID-19 and associated public health restrictions had significant impacts on postnatal Syrian refugee women.

Taking these factors into account, we derive an expression for a critical threshold, which determines the minimal speed a vaccination campaign needs to have in order to be able to keep fatalities from rising. Younger countries with fast vaccination campaigns find it substantially easier to reach this threshold than countries with aged population and slower vaccination. We find that for EU countries it will take some time to reach this threshold, given that the new, now dominant, mutations, have a significantly higher infection rate. The urgency of accelerating vaccination is increased by early evidence that the new strains also have a higher mortality risk.

The chronicity of symptoms coupled with the financial burden of treatment costs, missed days of work/school and interpersonal relationship stress are contributing factors in the diagnosis of depression. The prevalence of depression within the IBD community is 15% and depressive symptoms are noted in 20% of patients. Furthermore, IBD patients with severe uncontrolled disease have higher rates of depression (40.7%) than those in remission (16.5%). The association between IBD and depression is linked to lower quality of life, poor medication compliance, worse disease outcomes, increased hospitalization, and higher suicidal risk. Early diagnosis and treatment of depression in IBD patients is paramount in achieving and maintaining IBD disease remission. While the association between IBD and depression is well-known, identifying depression can be a challenge. Review of recent literature shows that depression is under screened in IBD clinics. We present a prospective quality improvement study at a robust IBD center evaluating the impact of a validated depression screen (PHQ-9) on identifying depression compared to standard of care. METHODS We compared the prevalence of depression in the IBD clinic in the control group using the history and diagnosis of depression and compared it against the intervention group after HQ-9 screening. Control group patient data was collected from June 2020 to July 2020 via virtual and in person visits. Intervention group PHQ-9 data was collected in person visits from January - March 2020 and post-intervention data collection was placed on hold until November 2020 due to the COVID pandemic. One randomly selected patient from each clinic session was asked to participate in the study at the time of visit. The primary end point was to compare the rates of depression and identify any barriers in providing early treatment for depression. The secondary endpoint was to identify high risk patients that are prone to depression. Categorical variables were analyzed by chi square analysis or fischer exact tests. Numerical data were analyzed using T-test. RESULTS A total of 111 patients were screened. 60 patients were randomized to the control group (i.e. EMR based review for depression) and 51 patients were screened via survey during in person clinic visit. The identified depression rate from control vs intervention group is 20% vs. 35% (p = 0.071). Rates of depression were 15% in non-fistulizing Crohn's disease vs. 41.4% in fistulizing Crohn's disease (p = 0.003). Multivariate model for predicting depression noted to be significant for extra-intestinal manifestations OR of 3.06 (1.03, 9.12) p = 0.045 and age OR of 0.97 (0.94, 1.00) p = 0.042. Control vs. intervention identification of depression in patients with extra-intestinal manifestations is notable for OR of 3.31 (1.15, 9.52) p = 0.026 in the univariate model and OR of 3.30 (1.07, 10.16) p = 0.038 in the multivariate model. CONCLUSION Key findings including identification of depression is higher in the intervention group compared to the control group. Though the data is not statistically significant, this is likely secondary to the small sample size in the setting of the pandemic. In addition, univariate analysis revealed a statistically significant finding that the older the age of the patient, the less likely they are to have depression. Our data showed that the mean age of depressed patients was 38.3 compared to nondepressed patients whose mean age is 47.1. Further analysis can help elucidate this finding, for example identifying if older patients are being treated for depression or more likely to seek out therapists compared to younger patients. Univariate analysis also revealed that intestinal Crohn's disease was a risk factor for depression. This is possibly secondary to the severity of disease in these individuals, especially if their IBD is causing an impact on their quality of life. Looking into the number of hospitalizations, days off from work or school, and coexisting medical diagnoses can allow us to further understand if depression stems from their disease. Given preliminary findings, we plan to continue this study for a larger sample size and further determine if there is a significant delay in identifying depression with the current standard of care.","output":"P059 Impact of PHQ-9 Screen on Early Identification of Depression in IBD Clinic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of depression in college students and determine how social support and healthy lifestyle factors are associated with depression in this population.

Few studies investigated the impact of these restrictive measures on individual social proficiency, and specifically the processing of emotional facial information, leading to mixed results. The present research aimed at investigating systematically whether, and to which extent, social isolation influences the processing of facial expressions. To this end, we manipulated the social exclusion experimentally through the well-known Cyberball game (within-subject factor), and we exploited the occurrence of the lockdown for the Swiss COVID-19 first wave by recruiting participants before and after being restricted at home (grouping factor). We then tested whether either form of social segregation influenced the processing of pain, disgust or neutral expressions, across multiple tasks probing access to different components of affective facial responses (state-specific, shared across states). We found that the lockdown (but not game-induced exclusion) affected negatively the processing of pain-specific information, without influencing other components of the affective facial response related to disgust or broad unpleasantness. In addition, participants recruited after the confinement reported lower scores in both empathy questionnaires and affective assessments of Cyberball co-players. These results suggest that social isolation affected negatively individual sensitivity to other peoples affect and, with specific reference to the processing of facial expressions, the processing of pain-diagnostic information.","output":"Far from the eyes, far from the heart.

Treatment recommendations for CNS inflammation associated with rheumatologic conditions, immune-related adverse effects from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and demyelinating disease from tumor necrosis factor- (anti-TNFs) are explored. Additional therapeutic options for inflammation related to postviral syndromes and genetic immunodeficiencies are also discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to treatment of mild, moderate, and severe CNS rheumatologic disease as guided by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), early consideration of rituximab for severe IgG4-related disease and induction with anti-TNF therapy for severe neurosarcoidosis should be considered. Although often not first line, treatment options for CNS inflammatory diseases based on disease mechanism are emerging, including tocilizumab for Behcets disease, natalizumab for ICI associated autoimmune encephalitis, and abatacept for treatment of infiltrative disease secondary to CTLA-4 deficiency. Hematopoietic stem cell treatments represent highly efficacious but risky options for autoimmunity related to genetic immunodeficiency.

However, it is not always easy to implement such systems, and introducing new technologies in the government field requires a complicated, time-consuming process. There is currently an appetite for research extending beyond the typical technology-driven approach to elucidate the government adoption of new technologies and explore its implications.Practical implicationsThe idea behind this system is that by storing and managing personal information on the blockchain and providing mobile apps to customers, users can log in or retrieve previously authenticated personal information without having to go through an authentication process. Since users do not need to go through the verification process every time, it is expected that they will be able to access only the necessary personal information more quickly and conveniently without having to deal with unnecessary details. In addition, the blockchain-based operation of a public service effectively increases the transparency and reliability of that service and reduces the social costs caused by personal information leakage.Originality/valueThis study introduces the design of a blockchain-based identity management system that can be used in public services, specifically in the Korean government sector for the first time.

The cases were revealed to be associated with a different coronavirus type was named SARS-CoV-2 and the disease was identified as Covid-19. It is known that the disease occurs in all age groups. We aimed to evaluate the differences in clinical and laboratory features between adult and pediatric patients. Method: The study is a retrospective cross-sectional study and consists of 206 patients with a definitive diagnosis of Covid-19 confirmed by a positive real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2. They hospitalized in health institutions connected to City Health Administrative of Bolu, Turkey between 11.03.2020 and 19.04.2020. The number of the pediatric patients (0-17 age group) was 106, that of the adult patients (18 and above age group) was 100. Data concerning the patients consisted of age, symptoms, laboratory parameters such as hemogram, biochemistry, coagulation. Results: The mean values of platelet (PLT), platocrit (PCT), percentage of monocytes (MONO %) and MONO in the 0-17 age group were found to be significantly higher than the mean values in the 18 and above age group. The hemoglobin (HGB) mean value of the 0-17 age group was significantly lower than that of the 18 and above age group. The mean C - reactive protein (CRP) value of the 0-17 age group (4.55;min: 1.20 C max: 11.80) was significantly lower than that of the 18 and above age group (5.35;min 1.25- max: 19.77) with no statistically significance.

Individuals might change their intention to adhere to public health prescriptions depending on various personal characteristics, including their own emotional status, which has been recognized to be a crucial psychological factor in orienting peoples adherence to public health recommendation during emergency settings. In particular, it is crucial to support citizens alliance with authorities and feeling of trust: public engagement is a concept that refers to the general involvement of citizens into public affairs which is generally considered an effective approach to enhance citizens understanding of their crucial role in public affairs. However, so far there is no agreement on the metrics and indexes that should be used to measures public engagement during a health crisis. The aim of this paper is to validate a psychometric scale (PHEs-E), which intends to measure the readiness of individuals to adhere to the prescribed behavioral change to contain the emergency. Data were collected throughout the pandemic in Italy: in particular, five independent samples were recruited starting from March 2020 to March 2021. Results showed that the proposed measure has good psychometric characteristics. A general linear model was computed to assess the differences of public engagement across the different data points and among citizens with different sociodemographic characteristics. Correlations with other psychological constructs (i.e. Anxiety, Depression and Self-Efficacy) were also tested, showing that more engaged citizens have a lower level of anxiety and depression, and a higher self-efficacy. This studys findings indicate that individuals characteristics may differentiate citizens motivation to engage in public health behavioral recommendation to prevent the COVID-19 contagion.

Genetic algorithms have provided a potential method for accounting for these interactions, but with limited accessibility. Here, we present CamoEvo, an open-access toolbox for investigating camouflage pattern optimisation by using tailored genetic algorithms, animal and egg maculation theory and artificial predation experiments. This system allows for camouflage evolution within the span of just 10-30 generations (1-2 min per generation), producing patterns that are both significantly harder to detect and that are optimised to their background. CamoEvo was built in ImageJ to allow for integration with an array of existing open access camouflage analysis tools. We provide guides for editing and adjusting the predation experiment and genetic algorithm as well as an example experiment.

METHODS: 163 health care workers (HCW) of the Padua University Hospitals, who underwent a complete vaccination campaign with BNT162b2 vaccine were asked to collect serum samples at 12 (t12) and 28 (t28) days after the first inoculum to allow the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies (Ab) using chemiluminescent assays against the spike (S) protein and the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the virus, respectively. RESULTS: Significant differences were found at t12 for infection-na?ve and subjects with previous-natural infection who present higher values of specific antibodies, while no significant differences have been found between t12 and t28. No statistically significant difference was found between male and female, while lower Ab levels have been observed in subjects older than 60 years at t12 but not at t28.

Among the enzymes that are involved in the ubiquitin (Ub) signaling cascade, tremendous efforts have been focused on elucidating the roles of E3 Ub ligases as they determine the complexity and specificity of ubiquitination. Not surprisingly, the malfunction of E3 ligases is directly implicated in many human diseases, including cancer. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop potent and specific molecules to modulate E3 ligase activity as intracellular probes for target validation and as pharmacological agents in pre-clinical research. Unfortunately, the progress has been hampered by the dynamic regulation mechanisms for different types of E3 ligases. Here, we summarize the progress of using protein engineering to develop Ub variant (UbV) inhibitors for all major families of E3 ligases and UbV activators for HECT E3s and homodimeric RING E3s. We believe that this provides a general strategy and a valuable toolkit for the research community to inhibit or activate E3 ligases and these synthetic molecules have important implications in exploring protein degradation for drug discovery.","output":"Targeted modulation of E3 ligases using engineered ubiquitin variants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many bacterial and archaeal genomes are of a similar size to molecules that have been cloned in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and thus might be clonable as single, circular episomes in this host.

The risk of infection in indoor environments is typically modelled using the Wells-Riley model or a Wells-Riley-like formulation, usually assuming the pathogen dose follows a Poisson distribution (mono-pathogen assumption). Aerosols that hold more than one pathogen copy, i.e. poly-pathogen aerosols, break this assumption even if the aerosol dose itself follows a Poisson distribution. For the largest aerosols where the number of pathogen in each aerosol can sometimes be several hundred or several thousand, the effect is non-negligible, especially in diseases where the risk of infection per pathogen is high. Here we report on a generalization of the Wells-Riley model and dose-response models for poly-pathogen aerosols by separately modeling each number of pathogen copies per aerosol, while the aerosol dose itself follows a Poisson distribution. This results in a model for computational risk assessment suitable for mono-/poly-pathogen aerosols. We show that the mono-pathogen assumption significantly overestimates the risk of infection for high pathogen concentrations in the respiratory tract fluid. The model also includes the aerosol removal due to filtering by the individuals which becomes significant for poorly ventilated environments with a high density of individuals, and systematically includes the effects of facemasks in the infectious aerosol source and sink terms and dose calculations.","output":"Risk assessment for airborne disease transmission bypoly-pathogen aerosols"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a study protocol designed to test the safety and efficacy of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine in patients with major psychotic disease.

Colchicine is an oral anti-inflammatory medication beneficial in gout, pericarditis, and coronary disease. We aimed to investigate the effect of colchicine on the composite of COVID-19-related death or hospital admission. METHODS: The present study is a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, adaptive, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. The study was done in Brazil, Canada, Greece, South Africa, Spain, and the USA, and was led by the Montreal Heart Institute. Patients with COVID-19 diagnosed by PCR testing or clinical criteria who were not being treated in hospital were eligible if they were at least 40 years old and had at least one high-risk characteristic. The randomisation list was computer-generated by an unmasked biostatistician, and masked randomisation was centralised and done electronically through an automated interactive web-response system. The allocation sequence was unstratified and used a 1:1 ratio with a blocking schema and block sizes of six. Patients were randomly assigned to receive orally administered colchicine (05 mg twice per day for 3 days and then once per day for 27 days thereafter) or matching placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of death or hospital admission for COVID-19. Vital status at the end of the study was available for 979% of patients. The analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. The COLCORONA trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04322682) and is now closed to new participants. FINDINGS: Trial enrolment began in March 23, 2020, and was completed in Dec 22, 2020. A total of 4488 patients (539% women; median age 540 years, IQR 470-610) were enrolled and 2235 patients were randomly assigned to colchicine and 2253 to placebo. The primary endpoint occurred in 104 (47%) of 2235 patients in the colchicine group and 131 (58%) of 2253 patients in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR] 079, 951% CI 061-103; p=0081). Among the 4159 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, the primary endpoint occurred in 96 (46%) of 2075 patients in the colchicine group and 126 (60%) of 2084 patients in the placebo group (OR 075, 057-099; p=0042). Serious adverse events were reported in 108 (49%) of 2195 patients in the colchicine group and 139 (63%) of 2217 patients in the placebo group (p=0051); pneumonia occurred in 63 (29%) of 2195 patients in the colchicine group and 92 (41%) of 2217 patients in the placebo group (p=0021). Diarrhoea was reported in 300 (137%) of 2195 patients in the colchicine group and 161 (73%) of 2217 patients in the placebo group (p<00001). INTERPRETATION: In community-treated patients including those without a mandatory diagnostic test, the effect of colchicine on COVID-19-related clinical events was not statistically significant. Among patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, colchicine led to a lower rate of the composite of death or hospital admission than placebo. Given the absence of orally administered therapies to prevent COVID-19 complications in community-treated patients and the benefit of colchicine in patients with PCR-proven COVID-19, this safe and inexpensive anti-inflammatory agent could be considered for use in those at risk of complications. Notwithstanding these considerations, replication in other studies of PCR-positive community-treated patients is recommended.

Inadequate glycemic control is related to high inflammation, hypercoagulability, and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients admitted to hospital for COVID-19 might need modifications to their diabetes therapy. The study was aimed at evaluating the association of clinical presentation and glycemic management in patients with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective study included 60 patients with type 2 DM and COVID-19, distributed into three groups: group 1 oral agents  32 patients, group 2 oral agents and basal insulin  15 patients, group 3 intensive insulin treatment  13 patients. We measured laboratory parameters, evaluated clinical presentation, and followed glycemic treatment during hospitalization. Results: Patients on oral antidiabetic drugs had better glycemic control before hospitalization, shorter duration of DM, and normal weight according to BMI compared with the other two groups. The most common symptoms of COVID -19 were: fever, cough, and fatigue. For better glycemic control we added basal insulin in 15 patients in group 1 (50%) and 9 patients need intensive insulin treatment in group 2 (60%). We discounted metformin in two patients in group 1 and three patients in group 2.

We examined if outdoor mass gatherings in counties with low COVID-19 incidence are also followed by infections. MethodsWe retrospectively examined COVID-19 incidence in 20 counties that held mass gathering rallies (19 outdoor and 1 indoor) in the United States in August-September 2020. They were compared to the rest of the United States counties. We utilized a 7-day moving average and compared the change on the gathering date and 15 days later, based on the 95% confidence interval. For control counties we used the median of the gathering dates. SettingThe United States Population8.4 million in the counties holding mass gatherings, and 324 Million in the rest of the counties in the United States. Main Outcome MeasureChange in COVID-19 incidence rate per 100,000 capita during the two weeks following mass gatherings. ResultsIn the two weeks following the gatherings, the COVID-19 incidence increased significantly in 14 of 20 counties. The county with the highest incidence increase (3.8-fold) had the 2nd lowest incidence before the gathering. The county with the highest decrease (0.4-fold) had the 3rd highest incidence before the gathering. At the gathering date, the average incidence of counties with gatherings was lower than the rest of the United States, and after the gathering, it increased 1.5-fold, while the rest of the United States increased 1.02-fold. ConclusionThese results suggest that even outdoor gatherings in areas with low COVID-19 incidence are followed by increased infections, and that further precautions should be taken at such gatherings. What is already known on the topicMass gatherings have been linked to COVID-19 infections, but it is less clear how much it happens outdoors, and in areas with low incidence. What this study addsCOVID-19 infections increased significantly in 14 of 20 counties that held mass gathering rallies in the United States, 19 of which were outdoors. The county with the highest incidence increase (3.8-fold) was outdoors and had a low incidence before the gathering. The average incidence of all 20 counties with gatherings was lower at the gathering day compared with the rest of the United State, and it increased 1.5-fold following the gatherings.

Setting and Participants: covid-19 positive patients reported in literature and national reports. Measures all-cause mortality by age. Results A total of 611,1583 subjects were analyzed and 141,745 (23.2%) had age 80. The percentage of octogenarians was different in the 5 registries being the lowest in China (3.2%) and the highest and the highest in UK and New York State. The overall mortality rate was 12.10% and it varied widely between countries being the lowest in China (3.1%) and the highest in UK (20.8%) and New York State (20.99%). Mortality was <1.1% in patients with age <50 and it increased exponentially after that age in the 5 national registries. As expected, the highest mortality rate was observed in patients 80 years old. All age groups had significantly higher mortality compared to the inmediatelly younger age group. The largest increase in mortality risk was observed in patients with age 60-69 compared to 50-59 (OR: 3.13 95% CI 2.61-3.76).

This study investigated the potential of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) to improve the intestinal permeation and absorption of low-permeable low-molecular-weight (low-MW) drugs. METHODS The in vitro epithelial permeation of six different drugs (metformin, risedronate, zanamivir, methotrexate [MTX], tacrolimus, and vincristine [VCR]) across Caco-2 cell monolayers was examined in the presence and absence of L- or D-penetratin, and the correlation between permeation enhancement efficiency and the properties of tested drugs was analyzed. In addition, a rat closed ileal loop absorption study was conducted to determine the in vivo effects of penetratin. RESULTS MTX and VCR efficiently permeated Caco-2 monolayers in the presence of L- and D-penetratin, suggesting that CPPs enhanced the epithelial permeation of drugs with relatively high molecular weight and resultant limited intrinsic permeability.

Here, we investigated whether the results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies would be modified in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: : Patients with RA were recruited at Sagamihara National Hospital from July 2014 to October 2015 (n=38, 2014 cohort) and at Tokyo National Hospital from June to October 2020 (n=93, 2020 cohort).

Results: : Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were not detected in all the samples form RA patients in both cohorts by the ECLIA. However, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in the serum samples from three (7.9%) in 2014 cohort by the ICA and fifteen (16.1%) in 2020 cohort.

The element is ubiquitous also in freshwater and nutrients. The average body load of a human individual amounts to 1 mg. The omnipresence of vanadium hampers checks directed towards its essentiality. However, since vanadate can be considered a close blueprint of phosphate with respect to its built-up, vanadate likely takes over a regulatory function in metabolic processes depending on phosphate. At common concentrations, vanadium is non-toxic. The main source for potentially toxic effects caused by vanadium is exposure to high loads of vanadium oxides in the breathing air of vanadium processing industrial enterprises. Vanadium can enter the body via the lungs or, more commonly, the stomach. Most of the dietary vanadium is excreted. The amount of vanadium resorbed in the gastrointestinal tract is a function of its oxidation state (V(V) or V(IV)) and the coordination environment. Vanadium compounds that enter the blood stream are subjected to speciation. The predominant vanadium species in blood are vanadate and vanadyl bound to transferrin. From the blood stream, vanadium becomes distributed to the body tissues and bones. Bones act as storage pool for vanadate. The aqueous chemistry of vanadium(V) at concentration <10 M is dominated by vanadate. At higher concentrations, oligovanadates come in, decavanadate in particular, which is thermodynamically stable in the pH range 2.3C6.3, and can further be stabilized at higher pH by interaction with proteins. The similarity between vanadate and phosphate accounts for the interplay between vanadate and phosphate-dependent enzymes: phosphatases can be inhibited, kinases activated. As far as medicinal applications of vanadium compounds are concerned, vanadiums mode of action appears to be related to the phosphate-vanadate antagonism, to the direct interaction of vanadium compounds or fragments thereof with DNA, and to vanadiums contribution to a balanced tissue level of reactive oxygen species. So far vanadium compounds have not yet found approval for medicinal applications. The antidiabetic (insulin-enhancing) effect, however, of a singular vanadium complex, bis(ethylmaltolato)oxidovanadium(IV) (BEOV), has revealed encouraging results in phase IIa clinical tests. In addition, in vitro studies with cell cultures and parasites, as well as in vivo studies with animals, have revealed a broad potential spectrum for the application of vanadium coordination compounds in the treatment of cardiac and neuronal disorders, malignant tumors, viral and bacterial infections (such as influenza, HIV, and tuberculosis), and tropical diseases caused by parasites, e.g., Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and amoebiasis.","output":"Vanadium.

A mere two-step procedure with user-specified, text-based information and Python codes constructs FAA with nodes which can be combined or divided objectively while maintaining anatomical hierarchy of brain structures. Four FAAs with total node count of 4, 101, 866, and 1381 were demonstrated.

The emergence of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus has been linked to neurological complications, including encephalopathy and encephalitis. METHODS: Case report and literature review. RESULTS: We reviewed case management of a 20-year old Hispanic male who developed febrile upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms followed by a confusional state. He had rapid neurologic decline and his clinical course was complicated by refractory seizures and malignant brain edema. He was managed with oseltamavir and peramavir, corticosteroids, intravenous gamma globulin treatment, anticonvulsants, intracranial pressure management with external ventricular drain placement, hyperosmolar therapy, sedation, and mechanical ventilation. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasal secretions confirmed 2009 H1N1 virus infection; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative for 2009 H1N1 viral RNA. Follow-up imaging demonstrated improvement in brain edema but restricted diffusion in the basal ganglia. We provide a review of the clinical spectrum of neurologic complications of seasonal influenza and 2009 H1N1, and current approaches towards managing these complications. CONCLUSIONS: 2009 H1N1-associated acute encephalitis and encephalopathy appear to be variable in severity, including a subset of patients with a malignant clinical course complicated by high morbidity and mortality. Since the H1N1 influenza virus has not been detected in the CSF or brain tissue in patients with this diagnosis, the emerging view is that the host immune response plays a key role in pathogenesis.","output":"H1N1 Encephalitis with Malignant Edema and Review of Neurologic Complications from Influenza"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Growing clinical evidence has implicated complement as a pivotal driver of COVID-19 immunopathology. Deregulated complement activation may fuel cytokine-driven hyper-inflammation, thrombotic microangiopathy and NET-driven immunothrombosis, thereby leading to multi-organ failure. Complement therapeutics have gained traction as candidate drugs for countering the detrimental consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether blockade of terminal complement effectors (C5, C5a, or C5aR1) may elicit similar outcomes to upstream intervention at the level of C3 remains debated. Here we compare the efficacy of the C5-targeting monoclonal antibody eculizumab with that of the compstatin-based C3-targeted drug candidate AMY-101 in small independent cohorts of severe COVID-19 patients. Our exploratory study indicates that therapeutic complement inhibition abrogates COVID-19 hyper-inflammation. Both C3 and C5 inhibitors elicit a robust anti-inflammatory response, reflected by a steep decline in C-reactive protein and IL-6 levels, marked lung function improvement, and resolution of SARS-CoV-2-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). C3 inhibition afforded broader therapeutic control in COVID-19 patients by attenuating both C3a and sC5b-9 generation and preventing FB consumption. This broader inhibitory profile was associated with a more robust decline of neutrophil counts, attenuated neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release, faster serum LDH decline, and more prominent lymphocyte recovery. These early clinical results offer important insights into the differential mechanistic basis and underlying biology of C3 and C5 inhibition in COVID-19 and point to a broader pathogenic involvement of C3-mediated pathways in thromboinflammation. They also support the evaluation of these complement-targeting agents as COVID-19 therapeutics in large prospective trials.","output":"Complement C3 vs C5 inhibition in severe COVID-19: Early clinical findings reveal differential biological efficacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An evolutionary game model is developed to study the interplay between consumers and producers when trade takes place on an e-commerce marketplace.

While most primary physicians' offices were closed, hospitals prepared for a pandemic surge and emergency departments (EDs) stayed open to provide care for urgent needs. We sought to determine whether ED paediatric presentations prior and during the COVID-19 pandemic changed and review acuity compared with seasonal adjusted prior year. METHODS: We analysed records from 18 EDs in British Columbia, Canada, serving 60% of the population. We included children 0-16 years old and excluded those with no recorded acuity or discharge disposition and those left without being seen by a physician. We compared prepandemic (before the first COVID-19 case), early pandemic (after first COVID-19 case) and peak pandemic (during public health emergency) periods as well as a similar time from the previous year. RESULTS: A reduction of 57% and 70% in overall visits was recorded in the children's hospital ED and the general hospitals EDs, respectively. Average daily visits declined significantly during the peak-pandemic period (167.4440.72) compared with prepandemic period (543.5358.8). Admission rates increased mainly due to the decrease in the rate of visits with lower acuity. Children with complaints of 'fever' and 'gastrointestinal' symptoms had both the largest overall volume and per cent reduction in visits between peak-pandemic and prior year (79% and 74%, respectively).

OBJECTIVE: In this contribution, characteristics and progressions of infected cases among healthcare workers at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic will be presented. METHODS: Between 1 July and 28 July 2020, 67 healthcare workers, who previously tested positive for SARS-CoV?2 via PCR, were invited via E?mail to participate in an anonymous online questionnaire; 39 persons participated. RESULTS: Participants (58%) were mostly  39 years old (64%) and female (70%). Most healthcare workers were involved in direct patient management (85%), including contact with SARS-CoV?2 positive patients (62%). All participants reported acute symptoms with a median duration of 19 days. The most frequent symptoms were fatigue (85%), anosmia (67%), cough (64%), headache (62%), and shortness of breath (51%). The disease course was mostly mild with low admission rates (5%). Ongoing symptoms lasting more than four weeks post-symptom-onset, particularly anosmia, fatigue, and shortness of breath, were reported by 38%.

METHODS: Before and during the COVID-19 crisis, 2,344 young Swiss men completed questionnaires covering SU (i.e. alcohol, cigarettes, illegal cannabis), ORB (i.e. gaming, watching TV series, internet pornography) and sociodemographic and work-related characteristics (i.e. deterioration in the work situation, change in working hours, change in working hours from home, healthcare workers and other professionals contacts with potentially infected people, linguistic region, call up to military or civil protection unit, living situation, age). RESULTS: Latent-change score models showed significant decreases of 17% for drinking volume and frequency of heavy episodic drinking, and a significant increase of 75% for time spent gaming and watching TV series. Subgroups showed greater relative increases. French-speaking participants, those who experienced a deterioration in their work situation and healthcare workers in contact with potentially infected people reported increased cigarette use. Those without children increased gaming, whereas those who worked fewer hours, experienced a deterioration in their work situation or were French-speaking did more gaming and watched more TV series. Those who lived alone or were German-speaking watched more internet pornography.

This has been especially true in the field of virology, where the discovery of a contagium vivum fluidum, or infectious fluid remaining after excluding bacteria by filtration, was initially ignored because it did not coincide with the established view of microorganisms. Subsequent studies on such infectious agents, eventually termed viruses, were met with skepticism. However, after an abundance of proof accumulated, viruses were eventually acknowledged as defined microbiological entities. Next, the proposed role of viruses in oncogenesis in animals was disputed, as was the unique mechanism of genome replication by reverse transcription of RNA by the retroviruses. This same pattern of skepticism holds true for the prediction of the existence of retroviral antisense transcripts and genes. From the time of their discovery, it was thought that retroviruses encoded proteins on only one strand of proviral DNA. However, in 1988, it was predicted that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and other retroviruses, express an antisense protein encoded on the DNA strand opposite that encoding the known viral proteins. Confirmation came quickly with the characterization of the antisense protein, HBZ, of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), and the finding that both the protein and its antisense mRNA transcript play key roles in viral replication and pathogenesis. However, acceptance of the existence, and potential importance, of a corresponding antisense transcript and protein (ASP) in HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis has lagged, despite gradually accumulating theoretical and experimental evidence. The most striking theoretical evidence is the finding that asp is highly conserved in group M viruses and correlates exclusively with subtypes, or clades, responsible for the AIDS pandemic. This review outlines the history of the major shifts in thought pertaining to the nature and characteristics of viruses, and in particular retroviruses, and details the development of the hypothesis that retroviral antisense transcripts and genes exist. We conclude that there is a need to accelerate studies on ASP, and its transcript(s), with the view that both may be important, and overlooked, targets in anti-HIV therapeutic and vaccine strategies.","output":"Retroviral Antisense Transcripts and Genes: 33 Years after First Predicted, a Silent Retroviral Revolution?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The variation of and the interrelation between different energy markets significantly affect the competitiveness of various energy technologies, therefore complicate the decision-making problem for a complex energy system consisting of multiple competing technologies, especially in a long-term time frame. The interrelations between these markets have not been accounted for in the existing energy system modelling efforts, leading to a distortion of understanding of the market impact on the technological choices and operations in the real world. This study investigates the strategic and operational decision-making problem for such an energy system characterized by three competing technologies from crude oil, natural gas, and coal. A stochastic programming model is constructed by incorporating multiple volatile energy prices interrelated with each other. Oil price is modelled by the mean-reverting OrnsteinCUhlenbeck process and serves as the exogenous variable in the ARIMAX models for natural gas and downstream plastic prices. The K-means clustering method is employed to extract a handful of distinctive patterns from a large number of simulated price projections to enhance the computing efficiency without losing retaining critical information and insights from the price co-movement. The model results suggest that the high volatility of the energy market weakens the possibility of selecting the corresponding technology. The oil-based route, for example, gradually loses its market share to the coal approach, attributed to a higher volatile oil market. The proposed method is applicable to other problems of the same kind with high-dimensional stochastic variables.

We conducted a retrospective, 2-year, observational, single-centre study to evaluate clinical outcome and risk factors for E-BSI mortality in internal medicine wards. 201patients with E-BSI were included in the analysis. Infection rate was 2.4/1000 days of hospital admission. Most E-BSI were hospital acquired (78.1%). The median age was 68 years. Charlson Comorbidity Index, adjusted for age, was 5 (range 4C6). Patients with E-BSI frequently had at least one invasive device, predominantly a central venous (73%) or a bladder catheter (61.7%). Enterococcus faecium accounted for 47.94% of E-BSI (resistance rate to ampicillin or vancomycin was 22.2 and 23.3%, respectively) and Enterococcus faecalis for 52.08% (resistance rate to ampicillin or vancomycin was 3.1 and 2.2%, respectively).

We have recently shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein promotes an inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6)/IL-6R-induced trans signaling response and alarmin secretion. Virus-infected or spike-transfected human epithelial cells exhibited an increase in senescence, with a release of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)-related inflammatory molecules. Introduction of the bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor AZD5153 to senescent epithelial cells reversed this effect and reduced SASP-related inflammatory molecule release in TMNK-1 or EA(hy926) (representative human endothelial cell lines), when cells were exposed to cell culture medium (CM) derived from A549 cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Cells also exhibited a senescence phenotype with enhanced p16, p21, and senescence-associated -galactosidase (SA--Gal) expression and triggered SASP pathways. Inhibition of IL-6 trans signaling by tocilizumab and inhibition of inflammatory receptor signaling by the Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor zanubrutinib, prior to exposure of CM to endothelial cells, inhibited p21 and p16 induction. We also observed an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in A549 spike-transfected and endothelial cells exposed to spike-transfected CM. ROS generation in endothelial cell lines was reduced after treatment with tocilizumab and zanubrutinib. Cellular senescence was associated with an increased level of the endothelial adhesion molecules vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), which have in vitro leukocyte attachment potential. Inhibition of senescence or SASP function prevented VCAM-1/ICAM-1 expression and leukocyte attachment. Taken together, we identified that human endothelial cells exposed to cell culture supernatant derived from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expression displayed cellular senescence markers, leading to enhanced leukocyte adhesion. IMPORTANCE The present study was aimed at examining the underlying mechanism of extrapulmonary manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-associated pathogenesis, with the notion that infection of the pulmonary epithelium can lead to mediators that drive endothelial dysfunction. We utilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expression in cultured human hepatocytes (Huh7.5) and pneumocytes (A549) to generate conditioned culture medium (CM). Endothelial cell lines (TMNK-1 or EA(hy926)) treated with CM exhibited an increase in cellular senescence markers by a paracrine mode and led to leukocyte adhesion. Overall, the link between these responses in endothelial cell senescence and a potential contribution to microvascular complication in productively SARS-CoV-2-infected humans is implicated. Furthermore, the use of inhibitors (BTK, IL-6, and BRD4) showed a reverse effect in the senescent cells. These results may support the selection of potential adjunct therapeutic modalities to impede SARS-CoV-2-associated pathogenesis.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Induces Paracrine Senescence and Leukocyte Adhesion in Endothelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the degradation of methylene blue (MeB), methyl orange (MeO), and rhodamin B (RhB) by the UV/Persulfate (UV/PS) process.

The second-order rate constant of the dyes with ?OH, SO4?-, and CO3?- were calculated and found to be: k?OH,MeB = 5.6  109 M-1 s-1, [Formula: see text] = 3.3  109 M-1 s-1, [Formula: see text] = 6.9  107 M-1 s-1; k?OH,MeO = 3.2  109 M-1 s-1, [Formula: see text] = 13  109 M-1 s-1, [Formula: see text] = 4.4  106 M-1 s-1; k?OH,RhB = 14.8  109 M-1 s-1, [Formula: see text] = 5  109 M-1 s-1, [Formula: see text] = 1  107 M-1 s-1. The steady-state concentrations of ?OH and SO4?- (including other reactive species) were determined using both chemical probes and modeling methods (Kintecus? V6.8). In the UV/PS, the dye degradation depends on the pH of the solution with the order: kdye (at pH of 7) > kdye (in acidic conditions) > kdye (in alkaline conditions). The presence of water matrices had different impacts on dye degradation: 1) The HCO3- and Cl- promoted the degradation efficiency of one dye, but also inhibited the degradation of other dyes; 2) Humic acid (HA) inhibited dye degradation as it scavenged both ?OH and SO4?-. The degradation of the dyes by UV/PS was also compared with the UV/Chlorine (UV/HOCl) and UV/H2O2 and it was established that: 1) In UV/PS and UV/HOCl, SO4?- and RCS contributed to dye degradation more than ?OH, while ?OH played a major role in dye degradation by UV/H2O2; 2) The calculated toxicity in UV/PS was the lowest probably due to the low toxicity of by-products; 3) For MeO and RhB, the UV/PS process is more beneficial for the total organic carbon (TOC) removal compared to that of the UV/HOCl and UV/H2O2 processes; 4) The UV/PS showed lower cost than the UV/HOCl and UV/H2O2 systems for MeO, and RhB degradation but higher cost for MeB removal.","output":"Degradation of dyes by UV/Persulfate and comparison with other UV-based advanced oxidation processes: Kinetics and role of radicals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outbreaks of respiratory disease constitute a major health problem in herds of finishing pigs and their aetiology often remains unclear.

Since the development of new drugs is an extremely long, complex and expensive process, researchers and clinicians are increasingly considering drug repositioning/repurposing as a valid alternative to the standard research process. Drug repurposing is also under active investigation in GBM therapy, since a wide range of noncancer and cancer therapeutics have been proposed or investigated in clinical trials. Among these, a remarkable role is played by the antipsychotic drugs, thanks to some still partially unexplored, interesting features of these agents. Indeed, antipsychotic drugs have been described to interfere at variable incisiveness with most hallmarks of cancer. In this review, we analyze the effects of antipsychotics in oncology and how these drugs can interfere with the hallmarks of cancer in GBM. Overall, according to available evidence, mostly at the preclinical level, it is possible to speculate that repurposing of antipsychotics in GBM therapy might contribute to providing potentially effective and inexpensive therapies for patients with this disease.","output":"Tackling the Behavior of Cancer Cells: Molecular Bases for Repurposing Antipsychotic Drugs in the Treatment of Glioblastoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic of global concern has killed about three million humans and affected around 151 million people worldwide, as of April 30, 2021. Although recently approved vaccines for COVID-19 are engendering hope, finding new ways to cure the viral pandemic is still a quest for researchers worldwide. Major pandemics in history have been of viral origin, such as SARS, MERS, H1NI, Spanish flu, and so on. A larger emphasis has been on discovering potential vaccines, novel antiviral drugs, and agents that can mitigate the viral infection symptoms; however, a relatively new area, RNA interference (RNAi), has proven effective as an antiviral agent. The RNAi phenomenon has been largely exploited to cure cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and some rare diseases. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recently approved three siRNA products for human use that garner significant hope in siRNA therapeutics for coronaviruses. There have been some commentaries and communications addressing this area. We have summarized and illustrated the significance and the potential of the siRNA therapeutics available as of April 30, 2021 to combat the ongoing viral pandemic and the emerging new variants such as B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Numerous successful in vitro studies and several investigations to address the clinical application of siRNA therapeutics provide great hope in this field. This seminal Review describes the significance of siRNA-based therapy to treat diverse viral infections in addition to the current coronavirus challenge. In addition, we have thoroughly reviewed the patents approved for coronaviruses, the major challenges in siRNA therapy, and the potential approaches to address them, followed by innovation and prospects.","output":"siRNA Therapeutics for the Therapy of COVID-19 and Other Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic continues infecting people causing deaths globally.

This study aimed to test the effects of the biomolecule oleuropein, whey collected from industrial waste and soaproot extracts obtained from Gypsophila arrostii Guss. var. nebulosa Boiss. & Heldr. and Saponaria officinalis L. on the expression of the human ACE2 gene as SARS-CoV-2 receptor on the A549 adenocarcinoma cell-line by Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). According to the cytotoxicity tests, G. arrostii var. nebulosa and S. officinalis extract treatments showed a dose dependent cytotoxic effect on the cells. The EC50 values of G. arrostii var. nebulosa and S. officinalis were found to be 54.3 mu g/ml and 17.3 mu g/ml, respectively. Oleuropein showed moderate cytotoxic effects with the EC50 value over 250 mu g/ml. Whey (fermented and non-fermented) did not show any cytotoxic effect at the applied doses. The qPCR results showed that the ACE2 mRNA level decreased by 89.8% and 35.2% due to the fermented and non-fermented whey extracts, respectively. Similarly, G. arrostii var. nebulosa and S. officinalis downregulated ACE2 by 79.8% and 90.1%, respectively. In contrast, oleropein upregulated ACE2 (102.8%).

We consider whether National Early Warning Scores (NEWS/NEWS2) could contribute to COVID-19 surveillance in care homes. We analysed NEWS measurements from care homes in England (December 2019 to May 2020). We estimated pre-COVID (baseline) levels for NEWS and NEWS components using 80th and 20th centile scores for measurements before March 2020. We used time-series to compare the proportion of above-baseline NEWS to area-matched reports of registered deaths in care home residents from the Office for National Statistics We analysed 29,656 anonymised NEWS from 6,464 people in 480 care home units across 46 local authority areas. From March 23rd to May 20th, there were 5,753 deaths (1,532 involving COVID-19, 4,221 other causes) in corresponding geographical areas. A rise in the proportion of above-baseline NEWS was observed from March 16th 2020. The proportion of above-baseline oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and temperature measurements also increased approximately two weeks before peaks in deaths. We conclude that NEWS could contribute to disease surveillance in care homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and temperature could be prioritised as they appear to signal rise in mortality almost as well as total NEWS. This study reinforces the need to collate data from care homes, to monitor and protect residents health. Further work using individual level outcome data is needed to evaluate the role of NEWS in the early detection of resident illness.","output":"National Early Warning Scores And COVID-19 Deaths In Care Homes: An Ecological Time Series Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Supporters of the antivaccination movement can easily spread information that is not scientifically proven on social media. Therefore, learning more about their posts and activities is instrumental in effectively reacting and responding to the false information they publish, which is aimed at discouraging people from taking vaccines. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to gather, assess, and synthesize evidence related to the current state of knowledge about antivaccine social media users web-based activities. METHODS: We systematically reviewed English-language papers from 3 databases (Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed). A data extraction form was established, which included authors, year of publication, specific objectives, study design, comparison, and outcomes of significance. We performed an aggregative narrative synthesis of the included studies. RESULTS: The search strategy retrieved 731 records in total. After screening for duplicates and eligibility, 18 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis. Although most of the authors analyzed text messages, some of them studied images or videos. In addition, although most of the studies examined vaccines in general, 5 focused specifically on human papillomavirus vaccines, 2 on measles vaccines, and 1 on influenza vaccines. The synthesized studies dealt with the popularity of provaccination and antivaccination content, the style and manner in which messages about vaccines were formulated for the users, a range of topics concerning vaccines (harmful action, limited freedom of choice, and conspiracy theories), and the role and activity of bots in the dissemination of these messages in social media. CONCLUSIONS: Proponents of the antivaccine movement use a limited number of arguments in their messages; therefore, it is possible to prepare publications clarifying doubts and debunking the most common lies.

The Czech Society of Gastroenterology (CSG) developed statements and guidelines aimed at solving specific practical problems in this situation. On April 20, 2020, internet based survey was published (under the heading of the Czech Gastroenterology Study Group): Endoscopy in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Aim and methods: Aim of the survey was to obtain basic information on the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the field of digestive endoscopy in the Czech Republic, on the feasibility of measures recommended by the CSG and on problematic areas during the first phase of the pandemic. A set of 23 questions was created, covering the period between 1.3. and 20.4.2020. The links to the survey were sent to all CSG members (875 original e-mail addresses). Results: Ninety questionnaires were evaluated. The survey involved 62 men (69%) and 28 women (31%) of whom 92% were certified gastroenterologists, 52% hospital staff and 48% physicians in private endoscopy practice. A total of 72 responses were obtained from endoscopy unit leaders. Eight respondents (9%) were in contact with an infected patient and only one endoscopist (1%) became ill during the monitored period. There were seven patients only who underwent acute endoscopy with a diagnosis of COVID-19. The endoscopic care plan for patients with COVID-19 was developed in 53% of all respondents and in 88% of units dedicated to endoscopy of at-risk patients. The CSG statements were a source of information and recommendations for a total of 63% of respondents (68% of COVID-19 dedicated endoscopy units). The majority of endoscopy units significantly reduced endoscopy activities during the monitored period (86%), mainly to acute and selected elective procedures. Complete discontinuation of practice was reported by 7% only. A significant problem was the lack of personal protective equipment (83% of units dedicated to endoscopy in COVID-19 positive patients) during the first phase of pandemic. The collection of epidemiological data (91%) and stratification of patients (77%) were generally the most frequently used measures, followed by the choice of personal protective equipment according to the degree of the risk. The possibilities of testing before digestive endoscopy (polymerase chain reaction of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swab) were significantly limited (not available for 57% of respondents). Conclusion: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents a new experience in the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy with the need to introduce a number of epidemiological and hygienic regulations. The statements of the Czech Society of Gastroenterology represented an important source of information and recommendations in this context. The data obtained from the survey enabled a critical evaluation of the pandemic impact in the Czech Republic and thus future creation of revised and realistic measures in digestive endoscopy too.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on endoscopy practice in the Czech Republic - Survey research/ Vliv pandemie COVID-19 na endoskopickou praxi v ?esk republice - Dotaznkov studie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Exhaled breath analysis by electronic nose (eNose) has shown to be a potential predictive biomarker before start of anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). We hypothesized that the eNose could also be used as an early monitoring tool to identify responders more accurately at early stage of treatment when compared to baseline. In this proof-of-concept study we aimed to definitely discriminate responders from non-responders after six weeks of treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective observational study in patients with advanced NSCLC eligible for anti-PD-1 treatment. The efficacy of treatment was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 at 3-month follow-up. We analyzed SpiroNose exhaled breath data of 94 patients (training cohort n = 62, validation cohort n = 32). Data analysis involved signal processing and statistics based on Independent Samples T-tests and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) followed by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS In the training cohort, a specificity of 73% was obtained at a 100% sensitivity level to identify objective responders. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 0.95 (CI: 0.89-1.00). In the validation cohort, these results were confirmed with an AUC of 0.97 (CI: 0.91-1.00).

AIM To evaluate effectiveness, safety and use of tofacitinib in daily practice. METHODS UC patients initiating tofacitinib were prospectively enrolled in 15 hospitals in the Netherlands. Corticosteroid-free clinical remission (short clinical colitis activity index [SCCAI] 2), biochemical remission (faecal calprotectin level 250 g/g), combined corticosteroid-free clinical and biochemical remission, predictors of remission, safety outcomes, treatment dose and effect on lipids were determined at weeks 12 and 24. Endoscopic outcomes were evaluated in centres with routine endoscopic evaluation. RESULTS In total, 123 UC patients (95% anti-TNF, 62% vedolizumab and 3% ustekinumab experienced) were followed for a median duration of 24 weeks (interquartile range 12-26). The proportion of patients in corticosteroid-free clinical, biochemical, and combined corticosteroid-free clinical and biochemical remission rate at week 24 was 29% (n: 22/77), 25% (n: 14/57), and 19% (n: 11/57) respectively. Endoscopic remission (Mayo = 0) was achieved in 21% of patients at week 12 (n: 7/33). Prior vedolizumab exposure was associated with reduced clinical remission (odds ratio 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.11-0.94). At week 24, 33% (n: 14/42) of patients still on tofacitinib treatment used 10 mg twice daily.

Methods: This was a single-center, observational study with 142 patients who were admitted with COVID-19 during three months. Seven patients were excluded due to the presence of chronic liver disease. Results: A total of 135 patients were included in the study aged between 18 and 95 years (mean 57.7  15.6); among them, 93 were males (68.9%). Hypertension was present in 74 patients (54.8%), and diabetes was present in 48 patients (35.6%). Fever was the chief complaint in 112 patients (83%), followed by dyspnea in 93 patients (68.9%) and cough in 79 patients (58.5%).

This study aimed to describe the clinical symptoms and risk factors of COVID-19 in cancer patients. Method: In a prospective cross-sectional study, during a year, all cancer patients who underwent chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy in our clinic (Kermanshah, Iran) were followed up in terms of getting COVID-19. We analyzed the effect of tumor features and demographic information on clinical manifestations, survival status, therapeutic outcomes, and severity of the disease COVID-19 in 2 categories of cancer (hematologic and solid cancers). Results: Most of the patients (68%) were in the solid tumor category, including breast cancer (24.4%), colon cancer (22%), and gastric cancer (9.8%). There was a statistically significant difference between 2 categories of cancer in the clinical manifestations: the stage of cancer and survival status (P < .05). Logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of death in cancer patients with COVID-19 along with symptoms of diarrhea (odds ratio [OR] = 12.8, P = .004), the difficulty of breath (OR = 10.73, P = .034), drop of SO2 (OR = 1.334, P = .003), thrombocytopenia (OR = 1.022, P = .02), anemia (OR = 2.72, P = .011), requiring mechanical ventilation (OR = 9.24, P = .004), pleural infusion (OR = 10.28, P = .02), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR = 7.389, P = .009) increases independent of other variables.

We consider a co-evolutionary dynamical network where node-states change through the epidemics and network topology changes through creation and deletion of edges. For a simple threshold base application of lockdown measures we observe large regions in parameter space with oscillatory behavior. For the SIS epidemic model, we derive analytic expressions for the oscillation period from a pairwise closed model.

Fleet activity per gear type was inferred from monthly Automatic Identification System data. Pattern recognition techniques were applied to study the fishing effort trends and barycentres by gear. The beneficial effects of the lockdowns on Adriatic endangered, threatened and protected (ETP) species were also estimated. Finally, fleet effort series were examined through a stock assessment model to demonstrate that every Adriatic fishing fleet generally behaves like a stock subject to significant stress, which was particularly highlighted by the pandemic.

Multivariate Risk Estimate Odds Ratio for ICU in patients with Calcifediol treatment vs Without Calcifediol treatment ICU (adjusting by Hypertension and T2DM): 0.03 (95 %CI: 0.003-0.25). Of the patients treated with calcifediol, none died, and all were discharged, without complications. The 13 patients not treated with calcifediol, who were not admitted to the ICU, were discharged. Of the 13 patients admitted to the ICU, two died and the remaining 11 were discharged. CONCLUSION: Our pilot study demonstrated that administration of a high dose of Calcifediol or 25-hydroxyvitamin D, a main metabolite of vitamin D endocrine system, significantly reduced the need for ICU treatment of patients requiring hospitalization due to proven COVID-19. Calcifediol seems to be able to reduce severity of the disease, but larger trials with groups properly matched will be required to show a definitive answer.","output":"\\"Effect of calcifediol treatment and best available therapy versus best available therapy on intensive care unit admission and mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19: A pilot randomized clinical study\\""},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic has imposed a complete shut-down of face-to-face teaching to universities and schools, forcing a crash course for online learning plans and technology for students and faculty.

However, hydrochar contains greater amounts of labile fractions than traditional biochar and may exacerbate the short-term greenhouse effect. To lower the risk of greenhouse gas release due to labile fractions, optimize parameters must be determined to produce hydrochar without carbohydrate carbon. In addition, the effects of varying feedstocks and process conditions on hydrochar structure as well as its dissolved organic matter (DOM) must be investigated. Spartina alterniflora and pig manure were used to produce two hydrochars (HSAs and HPMs) and their corresponding DOM samples (DSAs and DPMs) at various production temperatures (Tp) and reaction times (tr). The carbohydrate vanishing points (CVPs) were 265 C-1 h, 250 C-2 h, and 245 C-4 h for the HSAs and 260 C-1 h, 250 C-2 h, and 250 C-4 h for the HPMs. With the isolation of DOM, 1.09-4.33% organic carbon of the hydrochar was released. The aromaticity of DSAs decreased with increasing Tp and tr. The molecular weights of the DSAs and DPMs decreased with increasing Tp and tr. This study uncovered hydrochar's molecular structure as well as the content and properties of its labile fractions. Results can be used to help design specific hydrochars for potential applications, based on the trend of the molecular change under the condition of the studied parameters optimization to produce hydrochar in this study.","output":"Investigation on parameters optimization to produce hydrochar without carbohydrate carbon."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sneezes play a key role in transferring respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 between infectious and susceptible individuals where the timely monitoring and alerting for sneezes can be important in preventing the spread of such diseases.

Changes in expression of G3BPs are correlated to several cancers including thyroid, colon, pancreatic and breast cancer. G3BPs are important regulators of stress granule (SG) formation and function. SG are ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles that respond to cellular stresses to triage mRNA resulting in transcripts being selectively degraded, stored or translated resulting in a change of gene expression which confers a survival response to the cell. These changes in gene expression contribute to the development of drug resistance. Many RNA viruses, including Chikungunya (and potentially Coronavirus), dismantle SG so that the cell cannot respond to the viral infection. Non-structural protein 3 (nsP3), from the Chikungunya virus, has been shown to translocate G3BP away from SG. Interestingly in cancer cells, the formation of SG is correlated to drug-resistance and blocking SG formation has been shown to reestablish the efficacy of the anticancer drug bortezomib. METHODS Chikungunya nsP3 was transfected into breast cancer cell lines T47D and MCF7 to disrupt SG formation. Changes in the cytotoxicity of bortezomib were measured. RESULTS Bortezomib cytotoxicity in breast cancer cell lines changed with a 22 fold decrease in its IC50 for T47D and a 7 fold decrease for MCF7 cells. CONCLUSIONS Chikungunya nsP3 disrupts SG formation. As a result, it increases the cytotoxicity of the FDA approved drug, bortezomib.

Yet, no study has investigated what aspects of the pandemic are of particular concern for this population and ways in which strategies to coping with pandemic stressors may exacerbate their clinical symptomatology. Objective This study explores what pandemic stressors and coping strategies are associated with ACEs, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19 pandemic, before investigating whether the identified chief stressors and coping styles mediate the effects of ACEs on depression and PTSD. Participants and setting 1107 Greek adults were sampled from the general population. Methods Participants completed the Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire, Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5, Pandemic Stressor Scale, and Brief Cope Scale. Results ACEs and depression were both predominantly associated with difficult housing conditions as a stressor (b = 0.079, p < .001 and b = 0.046, p < .001, respectively), whereas PTSD was mainly related to fear of contracting the COVID-19 virus (b = 0.065, p < .001). Self-blame was the main coping strategy associated with both ACEs (b = 0.046, p = .010), depression (b = 0.071, p < .0005), and PTSD (b = 0.088, p < .0005). Difficult housing conditions and self-blame further demonstrated a significant serial mediation effect in the relationship between ACEs with both depression (b = 0.105, 95% CI [0.0607, 0.158]) and PTSD (b = 0.019, 95% CI [0.011, 0.031]).

On admission (Day 2), she presented with left ophthalmalgia and headache without any other neurological deficits including the movement of eyeballs, visual field, visual acuity, or nystagmus. MRI on Day 2 suggested slight left optic neural swelling; Gadolinium-enhanced MRI on Day 4 revealed left optic perineuritis. Test for serum anti-aquaporin 4 antibody was negative, whereas anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody was positive. She was diagnosed with left optic perineuritis after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. Her visual disturbance never recurred and her ophthalmalgia and headache subsided only with anti-inflammatory agents.

Here, we use a sero-survey to estimate the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the St. Louis, MO, metropolitan area in a symptom-independent manner. Five hundred three adult and 555 pediatric serum/plasma samples were collected from patients presenting to Barnes-Jewish Hospital or St. Louis Children's Hospital between 14 April 2020 and 12 May 2020. We developed protocols for in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using spike and nucleoprotein and used the assays to estimate a seroprevalence rate based on our samples. Overall IgG seropositivity was estimated to be 1.71% (95% credible interval [CI], 0.04% to 3.38%) in pediatric samples and 3.11% (95% CI, 0.92% to 5.32%) in adult samples.

The primary outcome was 90-day mortality, and the secondary outcomes were the length of hospital stay, a requirement for mechanical ventilation or renal replacement therapy, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of 1,718 patients with septic shock, 1,012 (58.9%) patients were culture-positive (blood 803, urine 302, sputum 102, others 204) and the median pathogen detection time was 9.5 h (aerobic 10.2 h and anaerobic 9.0 h). The most common site of culture-positive infection was the hepatobiliary tract (39.5%), while for the culture-negative it was the lower respiratory tract (38.2%). The culture-negative group had a lower mean body temperature (37.3 vs 37.7 ), lactate (2.5 vs. 3.2 mmol/L), C-reactive protein (11.1 vs 11.9 mg/dL), and sequential organ failure assessment score (7.0 vs. 8.0) than that of the culture-positive group.

Healthcare workers (HCW) in radiology departments are exposed to a high infection risk similar to HCWs in the ICU or dedicated COVID wards. The goal of our paper is to evaluate the prevalence of IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 among radiology HCWs in two different hospitals and regions in Germany with a low and high COVID-19 prevalence and to compare it to the prevalence in other clinical personnel. Additionally, we assessed the number of radiological procedures performed in patients with a positive PCR test (C+) followed by a short review of the risk for nosocomial infections of radiology HCWs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the first COVID-19 wave between March and July 2020, we evaluated a region with one of the highest COVID-19 rates (776-1570/100a??000) in Germany (Hospital A). Additionally, we assessed Hospital B in a region with a low prevalence (65/100a??000). We tested the serum prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among the whole staff with a subgroup analysis for radiology in both hospitals. We calculated the total number of different radiological procedures performed in C+ patients. RESULTS: In Hospital A 594 PCR-proven C+ patients were treated resulting in 2723 radiological procedures. 24a??% (na??=a??6) of the radiology technicians and 13.35 (na??=a??2) of radiologists had a positive IgG test. The rates were similar to positive rates in HCWs in COVID-19 wards and ICUs within the hospital. The most frequently performed procedures in C+ patients were chest X-rays (3.17/patient) and CT examinations (1.15/patient). In Hospital B 50 C+ patients were treated, resulting in 64 radiological procedures. None of the HCWs tested IgG positive. The most frequently performed examinations were also chest X-rays (1.04/patient) and CT (0.2/patient). CONCLUSION: HCWs in radiology have a high occupational infection risk similar to that of HCWs in ICUs and dedicated COVID wards.

Currently, it is not only a problem for a pulmonologist since it could cause complications to many other organs, including the cardiovascular system. Recent acute COVID-19 infection state has been associated with hypercoagulation and causing microthrombi called immunothrombus. Acute limb ischemia is one of the rare complications but organ-threatening. Unfortunately, unlike coronary artery disease, there is no recent guideline for cardiologists to diagnose and manage acute limb ischemia in pandemic situations CASE PRESENTATION: This case series presented two patients with acute limb injury (ALI)-complicating COVID-19, with chief complaints of pain at their lower extremity. The first patient was an 80-year-old woman who was just dismissed from the hospital due to COVID-19. The distal part of her toe was cyanosed, and her motoric and sensory functions were partially reduced. She was treated with oral drug therapy due to unwillingness to be hospitalized. Interestingly, she had recovered by using oral drug therapy. The second case was a 54-years-old female with several comorbidities such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She had cyanosed foot and weak arterial pulsation. Unfortunately, she passed away due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSION: Several internal and external factors cause ALI treatment to be more challenging in the pandemic COVID-19 situation. The diagnosis and management of ALI in COVID-19 patients may not fully comply with the current guideline and are likely to be affected by local hospital regulations.

METHODS: Patients who had been tested with the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 were identified, and according to the RT-PCR test results, patients were separated into Positive and Negative Groups. A telephone-based assessment was applied to both groups using the American Academy of OtolaryngologyCHead and Neck Surgery Anosmia Reporting Tool. Patients in Positive Group were also asked to rate STD, nasal breathing, and anxiety in three different time periods (pre-/during-/post-COVID) using the visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS: A total of 53 COVID-19 positive and 51 negative patients completed the surveys. STD was eightfold more frequent (OR 8.19; CI 95% 3.22C20.84) in the Positive Group. Of the 53 COVID-19 positive patients, 32 reported STD and 21 did not. Ground-glass appearance on chest-computed tomography was more frequent and median lymphocyte count was significantly lower in COVID-19 positive patients with STD. During-COVID STD and nasal breathing VAS scores were significantly lower than the pre- and post-COVID scores. During-COVID STD scores were significantly correlated with anxiety scores (Spearmans rho-0.404, p = 0.022) but not correlated with nasal breathing scores.

Underlying risk in all these patients is an increase in bodyweight or obesity. The adverse health effects of obesity and how these factors enhance the risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients is still unexplored. OBJECTIVE: The enhanced fat deposition might be a risk factor for increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHOD: We have reviewed and collected the information from online databases: Pubmed, Google scholar, Researchgate, to highlight the systematic link between obesity with associated risks in COVID-19. RESULT: We have reported the first study during the pandemic from France and New York, to a currently reported study in Mexico and found individuals with BMI 35 kg/m2 or >40 kg/m2 have greater risk of developing critical illness due to COVID-19, thereby increasing mortality. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests obesity in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood can be considered a profound risk factor for greater susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 and is associated with nutritional, lifestyle, cardiac, respiratory, renal, and immunological alterations, which may potentiate the complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Functional impairment of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is associated with inflammatory retinal diseases. Enhancing the protective axis namely ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas by activation of ACE2 presents anti-inflammatory properties. We investigated whether diminazene aceturate (DIZE), an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activator, prevented lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response by activating the protective axis and whether the effect was mediated by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the nuclear factor-B (NF-B) pathways. METHODS: Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and real-time PCR were used to determine the optimum concentration and incubation time of DIZE. ARPE-19 cells and primary cultured human retinal pigment epithelia (hRPE) were incubated with or without 10 g/mL DIZE for 6 h before stimulated with 5 g/mL LPS for 24 h. The mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines, AT1R, and AT2R was analyzed. The protein level of inflammatory cytokines, Ang II, and Ang-(1-7) was detected. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and phosphorylated transcription inhibition factor-B- (p-IB-) were measured. Inhibitors of MAPKs and NF-B were added to verify the involvement of these pathways. A small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to ACE2 and a selective Ang-(1-7) antagonist A779 was used to confirm the role of ACE2 and the involvement of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis. RESULTS: DIZE remarkably increased the expression of ACE2 and inhibited the expression of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 at both mRNA and protein levels in both RPE cell lines stimulated with LPS. Inhibitors of p38, ERK1/2, JNK, and NF-B significantly decreased LPS-induced overproduction of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1. DIZE reduced the expression of Ang II and AT1R, whereas increased Ang-(1-7). Furthermore, DIZE downregulated the phosphorylation of p38MAPK, ERK1/2, JNK, and the activation of NF-B upon stimulation with LPS. Downregulating ACE2 and pre-treatment with A779 abrogated the effects of DIZE on production of cytokines, the expression of Ang II, Ang-(1-7), AT1R, phosphorylation of MAPKs and activation of NF-B. CONCLUSIONS: DIZE inhibits LPS-induced inflammatory response by activating ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis in human RPE cells. The protective effect is mediated by inhibiting the p38MAPK, ERK1/2, JNK, and NF-B pathways.","output":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activator diminazene aceturate prevents lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation by inhibiting MAPK and NF-B pathways in human retinal pigment epithelium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The United Nations through universal health coverage, including sexual and reproductive health (SRH), pledges to include all people, leaving no one behind. However, people with disabilities continue to experience multiple barriers in accessing SRH services. Studies analysing the impacts of disability in conjunction with other social identities and health determinants reveal a complex pattern in SRH service use. Framed within a larger mixed methods study conducted in Uganda, we examined how disability, among other key social determinants of health (SDH), was associated with the use of SRH services. METHODS: We analysed data from repeated cross-sectional national surveys, the Uganda Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of 2006, 2011, and 2016. The three outcomes of interest were antenatal care visits, HIV testing, and modern contraception use. Our main exposure of interest was the type of disability, classified according to six functional dimensions: seeing, hearing, walking/climbing steps, remembering/concentrating, communicating, and self-care. We performed descriptive and multivariable logistic regression analyses, which controlled for covariates such as survey year, sex, age, place of residence, education, and wealth index. Interaction terms between disability and other factors such as sex, education, and wealth index were explored. Regression analyses were informed by an intersectionality framework to highlight social and health disparities within groups. RESULTS: From 2006 to 2016, 15.5-18.5% of study participants lived with some form of disability. Over the same period, the overall prevalence of at least four antenatal care visits increased from 48.3 to 61.0%, while overall HIV testing prevalence rose from 30.8 to 92.4% and the overall prevalence of modern contraception use increased from 18.6 to 34.2%. The DHS year, highest education level attained, and wealth index were the most consistent determinants of SRH service utilisation. People with different types of disabilities did not have the same SRH use patterns. Interactions between disability type and wealth index were associated with neither HIV testing nor the use of modern contraception. Women who were wealthy with hearing difficulty (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.15, 95%CI 0.03 - 0.87) or with communication difficulty (OR = 0.17, 95%CI 0.03 - 0.82) had lower odds of having had optimal antenatal care visits compared to women without disabilities who were poorer. CONCLUSION: This study provided evidence that SRH service use prevalence increased over time in Uganda and highlights the importance of studying SRH and the different disability types when examining SDH. The SDH are pivotal to the attainment of universal health coverage, including SRH services, for all people irrespective of their social identities.","output":"Disability and sexual and reproductive health service utilisation in Uganda: an intersectional analysis of demographic and health surveys between 2006 and 2016"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The history of human development has proven that medical and healthcare applications for humanity always are the main driving force behind the development of science and technology. The advent of Cloud technology for the first time allows providing systems infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and software as a service. Cloud technology has dominated healthcare information systems for decades now. However, one limitation of cloud-based applications is the high service response time. In some emergency scenarios, the control and monitoring of patient status, decision-making with related resources are limited such as hospital, ambulance, doctor, medical conditions in seconds and has a direct impact on the life of patients. To solve these challenges, optimal computing technologies have been proposed such as cloud computing, edge computing, and fog computing technologies. In this article, we make a comparison between computing technologies. Then, we present a common architectural framework based on fog computing for Internet of Health Things (Fog-IoHT) applications. Besides, we also indicate possible applications and challenges in integrating fog computing into IoT Healthcare applications. The analysis results indicated that there is huge potential for IoHT applications based on fog computing. We hope, this study will be an important guide for the future development of fog-based Healthcare IoT applications.","output":"Smart healthcare IoT applications based on fog computing: architecture, applications and challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has posed unprecedented challenges to tourism due to the global nature of its pandemic effect.

To effectively address these barriers and increase the scalability of psychotherapy among perinatal women, we suggest four pragmatic questions to be answered from a patient-centered lens; namely, who, what, how, and when. Promising avenues include task-sharing among mental health non-specialists, an emphasis on culturally sensitive care, web-based delivery of psychotherapy with some caveats, and a lifespan approach to perinatal mental health.

The pandemic has caused severe economic and social devastation, and due to the lack of experience, many countries have a huge burden to protect their people from the coronavirus. This virus spreads from person to person so easily via the droplets. Hence, it is hard to identify the virus if they do not show the symptoms;thus, the asymptomatic person can become a super spreader and spread the virus faster than a symptomatic person. It is essential to seek a technological-based application that can be globally used. Therefore, this paper proposes a machine learning-based speech signal processing application to identify the asymptomatic and mild symptomatic COVID-19 virus-infected individuals. The proposed method uses gammatone cepstral features along with eight machine learning methods for the classification task. Finally, the best-trained machine learning model will apply in a real-time-based speech signal processing application. The final results show that the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Ensemble Bagged Tree (EBT) can provide better classification results than the other machine learning models.","output":"Speech signal analysis of COVID-19 patients via machine learning approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Delivering the recommended care is an important quality measure that has been insufficiently studied in urology. Obstructive pyelonephritis is a suitable case study for this focus because many patients do not receive such care, although guidelines advocate decompression. We determined the influence of hospital factors, particularly familiarity with urolithiasis, on the likelihood of decompression in such patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS We used the NIS from 2002 to 2011 to retrospectively identify patients admitted to community hospitals with severe infection and ureteral calculi. Hospital familiarity with nephrolithiasis was estimated by calculating hospital stone volume (divided into quartiles) and hospital treatment intensity (the decompression rate in patients with ureteral calculi and no infection). After calculating national estimates we performed logistic regression to determine the association between the receipt of decompression and hospital stone volume, controlling for treatment intensity and other covariates thought to be associated with receiving recommended care. RESULTS Of an estimated 107,848 patients with obstructive pyelonephritis 27.4% failed to undergo decompression. Discrepancies were greatest between hospitals with the highest and lowest stone volumes (76% vs 25%, OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.94-3.96, p <0.01) as well as high and low treatment intensity (78% vs 37%, p <0.01). CONCLUSIONS High hospital stone volume and treatment intensity were associated with an increased likelihood of receiving decompression.

Previous literature suggests that these increases in social disconnection can have profound effects on both physical and mental health, perhaps especially in the case of fear disorders. The combination of feeling disconnected from others and the high level of daily threat experienced due to COVID-19 created conditions under which dysfunctional and persistent fears were especially likely to develop. Building on current understanding of the harmful effects of social disconnection on well-being in general as well as specific implications for fear, here we present findings from three preliminary investigations that are the first to directly examine the effects of loneliness on how fears are learned and maintained.

A first step in estimating the impact of these changes is to characterize the patients, visits, and diagnoses for whom care is being delayed or deferred. METHODS: We conducted an observational study, examining demographics, visit characteristics, and diagnoses for all ED patient visits to an urban level 1 trauma center before and after a state emergency declaration and comparing them with a similar period in 2019. We estimated percent change on the basis of the ratios of before and after periods with respect to 2019 and the decline per week using Poisson regression. Finally, we evaluated whether each factor modified the change in overall ED visits. RESULTS: After the state declaration, there was a 49.3% decline in ED visits overall, 35.2% (95% confidence interval -38.4 to -31.9) as compared with 2019. Disproportionate declines were seen in visits by pediatric and older patients, women, and Medicare recipients, as well as for presentations of syncope, cerebrovascular accidents, urolithiasis, and abdominal and back pain. Significant proportional increases were seen in ED visits for upper respiratory infections, shortness of breath, and chest pain. CONCLUSION: There have been significant changes in patterns of care seeking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Declines in ED visits, especially for certain demographic groups and disease processes, should prompt efforts to understand these phenomena, encourage appropriate care seeking, and monitor for the morbidity and mortality that may result from delayed or deferred care.","output":"An Analysis of Changes in Emergency Department Visits After a State Declaration During the Time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Access to global information through the Internet has become an essential ingredient to successful practice in travel medicine.

The overall uncertainty in the organization of the social life and the enforced and, at times, very contentious steps taken at various levels of management have caused polarization of opinions as to the functioning of all social institutions.

We present three studies that support our hypotheses: the more ambivalent people are about the recommendations, the less they follow them. We also examined the effect of the mixed emotions of hope and worry on adherence and find that it positively relates to adherence. Our findings replicated both in a U.S. sample as well as a representative German sample. Our work is the first to investigate the role of ambivalence in large-scale behavior change and highlight the importance of understanding the conflict that comes with changing behavior. We discuss implications for policy and communication.","output":"Ambivalence and Adherence to Measures to Reduce the Spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo A obesidade e seus determinantes s?o foco de amplas pesquisas, dentre tais determinantes, encontra-se o apetite emocional, definido como a tendncia a comer em excesso em reposta s emo??es negativas.

However, characterisation of the individual patients fibrinolytic capacity remains a challenge due to a lack of global fibrinolysis biomarkers. We aimed to assess fibrinolysis in septic shock patients using a plasma-based fibrin clot formation and lysis (clotClysis) assay and investigate the association between clotClysis parameters and other haemostatic markers, organ dysfunction and mortality. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study including adult septic shock patients (n = 34). ClotClysis was assessed using our plasma-based in-house assay. Platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), international normalised ratio (INR), fibrinogen, fibrin D-dimer, antithrombin, thrombin generation, circulating fibrinolysis markers and organ dysfunction markers were analysed. Disseminated intravascular coagulation score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and 30-day mortality were registered. Results: Three distinct clotClysis profiles emerged in the patients: (1) severely decreased fibrin formation (flat clotClysis curve), (2) normal fibrin formation and lysis and (3) pronounced lysis resistance. Patients with abnormal curves had lower platelet counts (p = 0.05), more prolonged aPTT (p = 0.04), higher lactate (p < 0.01) and a tendency towards higher SOFA scores (p = 0.09) than patients with normal clotClysis curves. Fibrinogen and fibrin D-dimer were not associated with clotClysis profile (p  0.37). Conclusion: Septic shock patients showed distinct and abnormal clotClysis profiles that were associated with markers of coagulation and organ dysfunction. Our results provide important new insights into sepsis-related fibrinolysis disturbances and support the importance of assessing fibrinolytic capacity in septic shock.","output":"Fibrin Network Formation and Lysis in Septic Shock Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Medical education in this era has been disturbed by coronavirus disease. Our faculty has quickly adapted the curricula to online formats. The online format seems to be more advantageous in terms of content material and virtual activities, but the results of these adjustments will require subsequent evaluation. The aim of this study was to evaluate medical student expectations of online orthopedics learning that was created based on social constructivism theory. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out to assess the fifth-year medical student expectations of our newly developed online orthopedics course during the outbreak. Constructivist Online Learning Environment Survey (COLLES) was applied for evaluating the expectations during orthopedic rotation. The survey contains six aspects based on social constructivist principles: relevance, reflection, interactivity, tutor support, peer support, and interpretation. All students responded to the preferred COLLES before starting the online course, and the actual COLLES was filled out when the online course was completed. Before and after attending the online course, the scores were compared and interpreted to assess student expectations. Results: A total of 126 fifth-year medical students studied the online orthopedic course. The preferred COLLES were completed by 125 students, while 120 students replied to the actual COLLES. The overall scores from the post-course survey in all aspects were significantly higher than scores from the pre-course with P-value &lt; 0.01. The comparison between the preferred and actual scores showed this online course fulfilled student expectations. Conclusion: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 19 has disrupted medical student education. The online orthopedic learning course in our department has been developed to deal with the current situation.

This scheme became operational in 2012, exactly 5 years after disaster management legislation was passed in 2007. This DRV strategy is a component of the central governments decentralisation of disaster management to local governments. Using a method of doctrinal legal review, this study argues that the DRV approach to disaster preparedness at the village level is inefficient. That is because the village apparatus is the central player in this DRV, but residents of disaster-prone areas are regarded as an afterthought when it comes to disaster management. Consequently, efforts to strengthen emergency preparedness for residents in disaster-prone areas will be harmed. As a result, it is unsurprising that whenever a disaster occurs in Indonesia, the death toll and damage to property remain high. This is because people who live in disaster-prone areas lack a framework for transforming knowledge and scientific experience with disasters. In addition, this DRV strategy opposes previous disaster experts community-based and transformative approaches. However, direct field research on communities living in disaster-prone areas is needed to obtain empirical evidence of the DRV approachs shortcomings.","output":"Disaster resilient village-based approach to disaster risk reduction policy in Indonesia: A regulatory analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a new generative model for topic segmentation based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

Most of the existing models either fuse topic segments by keywords or focus on modeling word co-occurrence patterns without merging. They can hardly achieve both coherency and saliency since many words have high uncertainties in topic assignments due to their polysemous nature. To solve this problem, we introduce topic-specific co-occurrence of word pairs within contexts in modeling, to generate more coherent segments and alleviate the influence of irrelevant words on topic assignment. We also design an optimization algorithm to eliminate redundant items in the generated topic segments. Experimental results show that our proposal produces significant improvements in both topic coherence and topic segmentation.","output":"Context-Aware Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Topic Segmentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To investigate the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT), macular RNFLT, ganglion cell layer (GCL), and inner plexiform layer (IPL) thickness in recovered COVID-19 patients compared to controls. METHODS: Patients previously diagnosed with COVID-19 were included, while healthy patients formed the historic control group. All patients underwent an ophthalmological examination, including macular and optic nerve optical coherence tomography. In the case group, socio-demographic data, medical history, and neurological symptoms were collected. RESULTS: One hundred sixty patients were included; 90 recovered COVID-19 patients and 70 controls. COVID-19 patients presented increases in global RNFLT (mean difference 4.3; CI95% 0.8 to 7.7), nasal superior (mean difference 6.9; CI95% 0.4 to 13.4), and nasal inferior (mean difference 10.2; CI95% 2.4 to 18.1) sectors of peripapillary RNFLT. Macular RNFL showed decreases in COVID-19 patients in volume (mean difference -0.05; CI95% -0.08 to -0.02), superior inner (mean difference -1.4; CI95% -2.5 to -0.4), nasal inner (mean difference -1.1; CI95% -1.8 to -0.3), and nasal outer (mean difference -4.7; CI95% -7.0 to -2.4) quadrants. COVID-19 patients presented increased GCL thickness in volume (mean difference 0.04; CI95% 0.01 to 0.07), superior outer (mean difference 2.1; CI95% 0.8 to 3.3), nasal outer (mean difference 2.5; CI95% 1.1 to 4.0), and inferior outer (mean difference1.2; CI95% 0.1 to 2.4) quadrants.

METHODS: We used a two-fold search strategy to identify messages, utilizing the existing content database from Vaping Prevention Resource (vapingprevention.org) and supplementing those messages with web searches. Potential messages were included if they were vaping prevention-oriented, appropriate or relevant for youth, and in a static web or print format. RESULTS: A total of 220 messages met criteria. Messages were coded on the presence or absence of 37 objective features within five categories: message themes, imagery, text features, message perspective, and other (e.g., source). The most common themes were nicotine addiction (32%), chemicals (30%), health effects (24%), and industry targeting (19%). Eighty-five percent of messages included imagery, with 27% showing a vaping device, 22% showing smoke or vapor, and 21% showing a persons face. Just over half (56%) included a message source. CONCLUSIONS: Vaping prevention messages for youth have commonly focused on addiction and health risks of vaping, and they vary on a series of text and image features.

Previous reports have demonstrated that epicardial fat plays key roles in coronary artery disease, but the non-coding RNA and transcriptomic alterations of epicardial fat in coronary artery disease have not been investigated thoroughly. Micro- and lncRNA microarrays followed by GO-KEGG functional enrichment analysis demonstrated sex-dependent unique mi/lncRNAs altered in human epicardial fat in comparison to subcutaneous fat in both patients with and without coronary artery disease (IRB approved). Among the 14 differentially expressed microRNAs in epicardial fat between patients with and without coronary artery disease, the hsa-miR-320 family was the most highly represented. IPW lncRNA interacted with three of these differentially expressed miRNAs. Next-generation sequencing and pathway enrichment analysis identified six unique mRNAsCmiRNA pairs. Pathway enrichment identified inflammation, adipogenesis, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis as the most represented functions altered by the mi/lncRNAs and atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction among the highest cardiovascular pathologies associated with them. Overall, the epicardial fat in patients with coronary artery disease has a unique mi/lncRNA profile which is sex-dependent and has potential implications for regulating cardiac function.","output":"Profiling of Non-Coding Regulators and Their Targets in Epicardial Fat from Patients with Coronary Artery Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For a searchable version of these abstracts, please visit www.acrabstracts.org.","output":"ACR Convergence 2020 Abstract Supplement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2, a betacoronavirus structurally similar to SARS-CoV.

We estimate that aggregate spending dropped by around 25 percent in Sweden and, as a result of the shutdown, by 4 additional percentage points in Denmark. This implies that most of the economic contraction is caused by the virus itself and occurs regardless of social distancing laws.

Its design and questionnaire were informed by three community gatherings organized by Refugee Council USA in the fall and winter of 2019, extensive input from an expert advisory group, and a literature review.This study finds that USRAP serves important purposes, enjoys extensive community support, and offers a variety of effective services. Overall, the survey finds a high degree of consensus on the US resettlement programs strengths and objectives, and close alignment between its services and the needs of refugees at different stages of their settlement and integration. Because its infrastructure and community-based resettlement networks have been decimated in recent years, the main challenges of subsequent administrations, Congresses, and USRAP stakeholders will be to rebuild, revitalize, and regain broad and bipartisan support for the program. This article also recommends specific ways that USRAPs programs and services can be strengthened. Among the studys findings: 3 Most refugee respondents identified USRAPs main purpose(s) as giving refugees new opportunities, helping them to integrate, offering hope to refugees living in difficult circumstances abroad, and saving lives. High percentages of refugees reported that the program allowed them to support themselves soon after arrival (92 percent), helped them to integrate (77 percent), and has a positive economic impact on local communities (71 percent). Refugee respondents also reported that the program encourages them to work in jobs that do not match their skills and credentials (56 percent), does not provide enough integration support after three months (54 percent), does not offer sufficient financial help during their first three months (49 percent), and reunites families too slowly (47 percent). Respondents identified the following main false ideas about the program: refugees pose a security risk (84 percent), use too many benefits and drain public finances (83 percent), and take the jobs of the native-born (74 percent). Refugee respondents reported using public benefits to meet basic needs, such as medical care, food, and housing. Non-refugee survey respondents believed at high rates that former refugees (69 percent) and refugee community advocate groups (64 percent) should be afforded a voice in the resettlement process. Non-refugee respondents indicated at high rates that the programs employment requirements limit the time needed for refugees to learn English (65 percent) and limit their ability to pursue higher education (59 percent). Eighty-six percent of non-refugee respondents indicated that the Reception and Placement program is much too short (56 percent) or a little too short (30 percent). Respondents identified a wide range of persons and institutions as being very helpful to refugees in settling into their new communities: these included resettlement staff, friends, and acquaintances from refugees country of origin, members of places of worship, community organizations led by refugees or former refugees, and family members. Refugee respondents identified finding medical care (61 percent), housing (52 percent), and a job (49 percent) as the most helpful services in their first three months in the country. Refugees reported that the biggest challenge in their first year was to find employment that matched their educational or skill levels or backgrounds. The needs of refugees and the main obstacles to their successful integration differ by gender, reflecting at least in part the greater childcare responsibilities borne by refugee women. Refugee men reported needing assistance during their first three mo ths in finding employment (68 percent), English Language Learning (ELL) courses (59 percent), and orientation services (56 percent), while refugee women reported needing orientation services (81 percent) and assistance in securing childcare (64 percent), finding ELL courses (53 percent), and enrolling children in school (49 percent). To open-response questions, non-refugee respondents identified as obstacles to the integration of men: digital literacy, (lack of) antiCdomestic violence training, the need for more training to improve their jobs, the new public benefit rule, transportation to work, low wages, the need for more mental health services, cultural role adjustment, and lack of motivation. Non-refugee respondents identified as obstacles to the integration of women: lack of childcare and affordable housing, the different cultural roles of women in the United States, lack of affordable drivers education classes, a shortage of ELL classes for those with low literacy or the illiterate, digital literacy challenges, difficulty navigating their childrens education and school systems, transportation problems, poorly paying jobs, and lack of friendships with US residents. Non-refugee respondents report that refugee children also face unique obstacles to integration, including limited funding or capacity to engage refugee parents in their childrens education, difficulties communicating with refugee families, and the unfamiliarity of teachers and school staff with the cultures and backgrounds of refugee children and families. LGBTQ refugees have many of the same basic needs as other refugees  education, housing, employment, transportation, psychosocial, and others  but face unique challenges in meeting these needs due to possible rejection by refugees and immigrants from their own countries and by other residents of their new communities. Since 2017, the number of resettlement agencies has fallen sharply, and large numbers of staff at the remaining agencies have been laid off. As a result, the program has suffered a loss in expertise, institutional knowledge, language diversity, and resettlement capacity.

Unfortunately, its promising use as an anticancer agent was biased by its toxicity, which was clear soon from the first clinical trials with TNF in cancer. Almost at the same time TNF was being developed as an anticancer drug, it became clear that TNF was identical to a mediator responsible for cachexia associated with sepsis, which was termed cachectin. This research led to the finding that TNF is, in fact, the main lethal mediator of sepsis and to the publication of a huge number of articles showing that TNF inhibits the toxic effects of bacterial endotoxins, which are now described as systemic inflammatory response. Although the clinical trials with anti-TNF in sepsis have not been successful thus far, undoubtedly as a result of the complexity of this clinical setting, these studies ultimately led to the identification of TNF as a key inflammatory mediator and to the development of anti-TNF molecules (soluble receptors and antibodies) for important diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohns disease. On the other side, the mechanisms by which TNF and related molecules induce cell death have been studied in depth, and their knowledge might, in the future, suggest means of improve the therapeutic index of TNF in cancer.","output":"Tumor necrosis factor as a pharmacological target"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of healthcare workers (HCWs) infected with COVID\\\\19 and to examine their sources of exposure. METHODS: A descriptive cross\\\\sectional study using data extracted from the centralized disease notification system comprising individuals confirmed with COVID\\\\19 in Singapore between 23 January and 17 April 2020. Occupation of HCWs was categorized into six categories. Their job nature was classified into frontline or back\\\\end based on the frequency of direct patient contact, and source of exposure was classified as family/household, social interaction or workplace. Chi\\\\square and median tests were used to identify differences between categorical groups and sample medians, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 88 (1.7%) HCWs were identified from 5,050 cases. Their median age was 35 years. Chinese and Indians constituted 42.0% and 31.8%, respectively, and 43.2% were foreigners. The majority (63.6%) was serving at frontlines handling patient\\\\facing duties, 15.9% were doctors, 11.4% were nurses and 44.3% were ancillary staff. About 81.8% acquired the infection locally, of which 40.3% did not have a clearly identifiable source of exposure. Exposure from the family/household was most common (27.8%), followed by workplace (16.7%) and social interaction (15.3%). All HCWs were discharged well with no mortality; three (3.4%) were ever admitted to intensive care unit and required increased care.

We investigated potential predictors of in-hospital mortality, a composite outcome of in-hospital mortality, pericardiocentesis-related complications, and the need for emergency cardiac surgery and all-cause mortality in patients undergoing percutaneous pericardiocentesis. This is an observational, retrospective, single-center study on patients undergoing percutaneous pericardiocentesis (2010C2019). We enrolled 81 consecutive patients. Median age was 71.4 years (interquartile range [IQR] 58.1C78.1 years) and 51 (63%) were male. Most of the pericardiocentesis were performed in an urgency setting (76.5%) for cardiac tamponade (77.8%). The most common etiology was idiopathic (33.3%) followed by neoplastic (22.2%). In-hospital mortality was 14.8% while mortality during follow-up (mean 17.1 months) was 44.4%. Only hemodynamic instability (i.e., cardiogenic shock, hypotension refractory to fluid challenge therapy and inotropes) was associated with in-hospital mortality at the univariate analysis (odds ratio [OR] 7.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.76C29.4).

In this work, a competitive biopanning strategy of a phage display antibody library was applied to screen blocking antibodies against RBD. High-affinity antibodies were enriched after the first round using a standard panning process in which RBD-His was immobilized as a bait. At the next two rounds, immobilized ACE2-Fc and free RBD-His were mixed with the enriched phage antibodies. Antibodies binding to RBD at epitopes different from ACE2-binding site were captured by the immobilized ACE2-Fc, forming a sandwich complex. Only antibodies competed with ACE2 can bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by the Ni-NTA magnetic beads.

There remains a need for standardized, evidence-based, continuously updated guidelines for perioperative care in these patients. METHODS: A multidisciplinary expert group, the Perioperative Anesthesia in Thoracic Surgery (PACTS) group, was established to develop recommendations for anesthesia practice in patients undergoing elective lung resection for lung cancer. The project addressed three key areas: preoperative patient assessment and preparation, intraoperative management (surgical and anesthesiologic care), and postoperative care and discharge. A series of clinical questions was developed, and literature searches were performed to inform discussions around these areas, leading to the development of 69 recommendations. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were graded using the United States Preventive Services Task Force criteria. RESULTS: Recommendations for intraoperative care focus on airway management, and monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamics, blood gases, neuromuscular blockade, and depth of anesthesia. Recommendations for postoperative care focus on the provision of multimodal analgesia, intensive care unit (ICU) care, and specific measures such as chest drainage, mobilization, noninvasive ventilation, and atrial fibrillation prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations should help clinicians to improve intraoperative and postoperative management, and thereby achieve better postoperative outcomes in thoracic surgery patients.

Whether intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) improves functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients with CMBs is unknown. We aimed to estimate the treatment effect of IVT in patients with acute ischemic stroke and a high burden (>10) of CMBs. Methods- We devised a multistep algorithm to model 90-day modified Rankin Scale scores in patients with 10 versus >10 CMBs who do or do not receive IVT. Parameters were extracted from recently published meta-analyses and included pairwise relationships between CMBs, IVT, 3-month functional outcome, and intracranial hemorrhage. Uncertainty was quantified in probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results- In patients with >10 CMBs as compared with 10 CMBs, point estimates of the odds ratios for favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale 2) associated with IVT were 7% to 10% lower but still >1 (range, 1.03-1.51). On the other hand, IVT in patients with >10 CMBs significantly increased the odds of mortality. The point estimates for the net treatment effect of IVT (change in the utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale score) in patients with >10 CMBs were in favor of withholding IVT in older patients with more severe strokes and longer treatment delays. However, because the general pretest probability of >10 CMBs is low (0.6%-2.7%), pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging to quantify CMB burden would be justified only if it delayed IVT by <10 minutes. Conclusions- High CMB burden modifies the treatment effect of IVT. In patients with >10 CMBs, IVT is associated with higher mortality and, in older patients with severe strokes and longer treatment delays, a net utility loss. Patients with higher-than-average pretest probability of >10 CMB might profit from magnetic resonance imaging screening if it does not increase the treatment time.","output":"Benefit of Intravenous Thrombolysis in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients With High Cerebral Microbleed Burden."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in what has been described as a cytokine storm or cytokine release syndrome (CRS), may be the key factor in the pathology of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is also a crucial cause of death from COVID-19.With the purpose of finding effective and low-toxicity drugs to mitigate CRS, IL-1 blockade agents, which are one of the safest ways to stop this overwhelming innate immune response, are already available in several preliminary reports or are under observational trials and may offer an important treatment option in hyperinflammatory COVID-19.In this review, we described the key information in both case reports and clinical studies on the potential beneficial features of IL-1 inhibitors in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Perspectives on anti-IL-1 inhibitors as potential therapeutic interventions for severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has left scientists and clinicians no choice but a race to find solutions to save lives while controlling the rapid spreading.

Chronic smoke exposure triggers the expansion of this cell population and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking decreases the abundance of these secretory cells and reduces ACE2 levels. Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 expression is responsive to inflammatory signaling and can be upregulated by viral infections or interferon treatment. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Patients in group A underwent TACE with subsequent percutaneous thermal ablation, while patients in group B who were unsuitable for ablation received TACE monotherapy. Characteristics and survival data of the two groups were analyzed and compared. Relevant factors for overall survival (OS) of group A were explored by univariate analysis. RESULTS Twenty-six patients were included and analyzed. The median OS for group A (n = 13) was 18 months, while the 1-, 2- and 3-year survival rates were 58.6%, 46.9% and 46.9%, respectively. The median OS for group B (n = 13) was 6.5 months and the 1-year survival rate was 10.9%. The survival of group A was significantly better than group B (P = 0.02).

To identify the putative roles of these miRs in zoonosis, we assessed their conservation, compared with humans, in some key wild and domestic animal carriers of zoonotic viruses, including bat, pangolin, pig, cow, rat, and chicken. Out of the seven miRs under study, miR-3611 was the most strongly conserved across all species; miR-5197 was the most conserved in pangolin, pig, cow, bat, and rat; miR-1307 was most strongly conserved in pangolin, pig, cow, bat, and human; miR-3691-3p in pangolin, cow, and human; miR-3934-3p in pig and cow, followed by pangolin and bat; miR-1468 was most conserved in pangolin, pig, and bat; while miR-8066 was most conserved in pangolin and pig. In humans, miR-3611 and miR-1307 were most conserved, while miR-8066, miR-5197, miR-3334-3p and miR-1468 were least conserved, compared with pangolin, pig, cow, and bat. Furthermore, we identified that changes in the miR-5197 nucleotides between pangolin and human can generate three new miRs, with differing tissue distribution in the brain, lung, intestines, lymph nodes, and muscle, and with different downstream regulatory effects on KEGG pathways. This may be of considerable importance as miR-5197 is localized in the spike protein transcript area of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our findings may indicate roles for these miRs in viral-host co-evolution in zoonotic hosts, particularly highlighting pangolin, bat, cow, and pig as putative zoonotic carriers, while highlighting the miRs' roles in KEGG pathways linked to viral pathogenicity and host responses in humans. This in silico study paves the way for investigations into the roles of miRs in zoonotic disease.","output":"MicroRNAs for Virus Pathogenicity and Host Responses, Identified in SARS-CoV-2 Genomes, May Play Roles in Viral-Host Co-Evolution in Putative Zoonotic Host Species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China was first reported to the World Health Organization on 31 December 2019, after the first cases were officially identified around 8 December 2019.

Here, we perform single-cell deep-immune profiling of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from 5 patients with mild and 26 with critical COVID-19 in comparison to BALs from non-COVID-19 pneumonia and normal lung. We use pseudotime inference to build T-cell and monocyte-to-macrophage trajectories and model gene expression changes along them. In mild COVID-19, CD8+ resident-memory (TRM) and CD4+ T-helper-17 (TH17) cells undergo active (presumably antigen-driven) expansion towards the end of the trajectory, and are characterized by good effector functions, while in critical COVID-19 they remain more na?ve. Vice versa, CD4+ T-cells with T-helper-1 characteristics (TH1-like) and CD8+ T-cells expressing exhaustion markers (TEX-like) are enriched halfway their trajectories in mild COVID-19, where they also exhibit good effector functions, while in critical COVID-19 they show evidence of inflammation-associated stress at the end of their trajectories. Monocyte-to-macrophage trajectories show that chronic hyperinflammatory monocytes are enriched in critical COVID-19, while alveolar macrophages, otherwise characterized by anti-inflammatory and antigen-presenting characteristics, are depleted. In critical COVID-19, monocytes contribute to an ATP-purinergic signaling-inflammasome footprint that could enable COVID-19 associated fibrosis and worsen disease-severity.

Anti-spike antibodies were tested at 1 and 3C4 months after vaccination. Of 259 kidney transplant recipients tested at a median time of 110 days from second vaccine dose, 99 (38%) were seropositive, compared with 83% (101/122) of control patients. Younger age, better renal function and lower immunosuppression levels were associated with seropositivity. A total of 14% (13/94) of participants seropositive at 1 month became seronegative at follow-up and 11% (18/165) became seropositive. The latter were mainly individuals with higher antibody levels at 1 month. Antibody levels at 3C4 months were significantly reduced in both study groups, although the decline was more pronounced in the control group. Kidney transplant recipients present poor antibody response to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, with only 38% seropositive at 3C4 months.

METHODS: An active surveillance population-based study that combined minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) and verbal autopsies (VA) among children under 5 was conducted in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from September 2018 to December 2020 to define the burden of all causes of community deaths. RESULTS: Among 90 cases enrolled (86% of parental acceptance), 81 had complete MITS, 15.6% were neonates, 65.6% were post-neonatal infants, and 18.9% were children aged 1C5 years. Lung infections were the most common cause of death (CoD) in all age groups (57.8%). Among all cases of lung infections, acute bronchiolitis was the most common CoD in infants aged <12 months (23 of 36, 63.9%), and bacterial pneumonia was the most common cause in children aged >12 months (8 of 11, 72.7%). The most common comorbid condition in all age groups was undernutrition in 18 of 90 (20%). It was possible to find an immediate CoD in 78 of 81 subjects where MITS could be done.

During September 2020, 233 healthcare workers responded to an online survey to test the impact of demographic variables, COVID-19 exposure, and psychological resources in determining stress and burnout during the COVID-19 emergency. Frontline workers reported higher scores for stress, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization (p < 0.001) as compared to colleagues working in units not directly serving patients with COVID-19. Mature defensive functioning was associated with resilience and personal accomplishment (r = 0.320; p < 0.001), while neurotic and immature defenses were related to perceived stress and burnout. Stress and burnout were predicted by lower age, female gender, greater exposure to COVID-19, lower resilience, and immature defensive functioning among healthcare professionals (R2 = 463; p < 0.001).

One of the most popular and complex deep learning in finance topics is future stock prediction. The difficulty that causes the future stock forecast is that there are too many different factors that affect the amplitude and frequency of the rise and fall of stocks at the same time. Some of the company-specific factors that can affect the share price like news releases on earnings and profits, future estimated earnings, the announcement of dividends, introduction of a new product or a product recall, secure a new large contract, employee layoffs, a major change of management, anticipated takeover or merger, and accounting errors or scandals. Furthermore, these factors are only company factors, and other factors affect the future trend of stocks, such as industry performance, investor sentiment, and economic factors.

Methods: a prospective double-blind study was carried out in patients with BMS and randomized to three groups: melatonin (1 mg once a day), clonazepam (0.5 mg/twice a day), or a placebo once a day, for 8 weeks. The clinical changes were evaluated, including xerostomia, the Oral Health Impact Profile 14 (OHIP-14) score, Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Oxygen saturation and heart rate were recorded, with an analysis of salivary biomarkers in the forms of oxytocin, ferritin, adenosine deaminase (ADA), total proteins, and alpha-amylase. Results: a total of 64 patients were analyzed. A significant decrease in burning sensation was recorded with melatonin (7.8  1.54 pre-treatment, 5.78  2.54 post-treatment; p < 0.001) and clonazepam (8.75  1.2 pre-treatment, 5.5  3.6 post-treatment (p < 0.01).

METHODS: This exploratory, prospective, observational cohort study included consecutive adult patients hospitalized in two Swiss tertiary-care hospitals between March and June 2020 for confirmed COVID-19 and their relatives. The primary outcome was psychological distress defined as clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety and/or depression measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 90 days after discharge. RESULTS: Clinically relevant psychological distress 90 days after hospital discharge was present in 23/108 patients (21.3%) and 22/120 relatives (18.3%). For patients, risk and protective factors associated with clinically relevant psychological distress included sociodemographic, illness-related, psychosocial, and hospital-related factors. A model including these factors showed good discrimination, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84. For relatives, relevant risk factors were illness-related, psychosocial, and hospital-related factors. Resilience was negatively associated with anxiety and depression in both patients and relatives and regarding PTSD in relatives only.

The symptoms vary from person to person and many are \\"hidden carriers.\\" Few people experience immediate reaction and even death within 48 h of infection. However, many show mild to chronic symptoms and recover. Nevertheless, the death rate due to COVID-19 transmission is high especially among patients with non-communicable diseases. The purpose of this review is to provide evidence to consider vitamins as epigenetic modifiers to enhance immunity and reduce inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients with non-communicable diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical evidence has suggested the risk of getting infected is high among individuals with non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, cancer, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and renal disease, as well as the elderly with high mortality rate among the cohort. The impact is due to an already compromised immune system of patients. Every patient has a different response to COVID-19, which shows that the ability to combat the deadly virus varies individually. Thus, treatment can be personalized and adjusted to help protect and combat COVID-19 infections, especially in individuals with non-communicable diseases. Based on current published scientific and medical evidence, the suggestions made in this article for combination of vitamin therapy as epigenetic modifiers to control the unregulated inflammatory and cytokine marker expressions, further needs to be clinically proven. Future research and clinical trials can apply the suggestions given in this article to support metabolic activities in patients and enhance the immune response.","output":"Can Vitamins, as Epigenetic Modifiers, Enhance Immunity in COVID-19 Patients with Non-communicable Disease?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented expansion of telemedicine services worldwide. This study aimed to explore the practice of telemedicine in Pediatric Surgery in Germany, the impact of the pandemic on its development and parents' and surgeons' experiences with telemedicine. METHODS: The study is a cross-sectional analysis using three surveys between 6/2020 and 10/2020: (1) all Pediatric Surgery departments of Germany reported whether they provide telemedicine services. (2) Members of the German Society of Pediatric Surgery and (3) families who participated in an outpatient visit by telephone or video with the Department of Pediatric Surgery and Pediatric Urology of the University Hospital Frankfurt completed an anonymous survey on their experience with telemedicine. RESULTS: 21% of the Pediatric Surgery departments in Germany provided telemedicine, of which 57% started due to the pandemic. The lack of physical examination and face-to-face contact seem to be the major limitations to surgeons and parents. 48% of the parents answered that telemedicine is equal to or better than traditional appointments, while 33% thought that telemedicine is worse.

OBJECTIVES To (i) assess whether increased perilesional perfusion and perfusion inhomogeneity are predictors for expansion of psoriasis lesions and (ii) assess feasibility of the HAPI system in a mounted modality. METHODS In this interventional pilot study in adults with unstable plaque psoriasis, HAPI measurements and color photographs were performed for lesions present on one body region at week 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8. The presence of increased perilesional perfusion and perfusion inhomogeneity was determined. Clinical outcome was categorized as increased, stable or decreased lesion surface between visits. Patient feedback was collected on a 10-point scale. RESULTS In total, 110 lesions with a median follow-up of 6 (IQR 6.0) weeks were assessed in 6 patients with unstable plaque psoriasis. Perfusion data was matched to 281 clinical outcomes after two weeks. A mixed multinomial logistic regression model revealed a predictive value of perilesional increased perfusion (OR 9.90; p < 0.001) and perfusion inhomogeneity (OR 2.39; p = 0.027) on lesion expansion after two weeks compared to lesion stability. HAPI measurements were considered fast, patient-friendly and important by patients. CONCLUSION Visualization of increased perilesional perfusion and perfusion inhomogeneity by noninvasive whole field LSCI holds potential for prediction of psoriatic lesion expansion.

However, these machines cannot precisely simulate a live pitcher's pitching motion. To understand if a batter's movement strategy would be altered due to disparate visual information provided by a pitching machine as opposed to a live pitcher, the present study aimed to compare differences in baseball batting movement patterns under the two delivery conditions. Methods: To examine movement variations and different strategies of each high-level athlete rather than obtaining averaged group performance, single-subject analysis was adopted. Four professional baseball players were recruited to bat around 50 pitches under each delivery condition. Vertical ground reaction forces of the participants' batting movements were recorded. Relative timings of key events and values of several kinetic parameters during batting were examined. Results: When batting against the pitching machine, batters initiated forward stepping earlier (relative to ball release), had smaller loading rate at landing the step, and altered the duration from forward bat swing to ball impact. These results might be attributed to lacking visual cues of a live pitcher's whole body kinematics prior to ball release. Without sufficient visual information, greater uncertainty and incomplete weight transfer affected the batter's decision making and movement execution. Conclusion: The batters in this study did adjust their movement strategy in batting against a pitching machine. With dissimilar batting movement patterns under the two delivery conditions, extensive reliance on training with pitching machines is not recommended.","output":"Differences in Baseball Batting Movement Patterns Between Facing a Pitcher and a Pitching Machine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent pandemic of COVID\\\\19 revealed that a highly transmissible virus threatens all humanity because extensive mobility, migration, and millions of passengers who travel worldwide shape our globalized environment and make containment of a virus more difficult In a war between humans and viruses, we should have the necessary weapons, such as masks, gloves, ventilators, and so forth However, during the COVID\\\\19 outbreak, there was a shortage of this basic medical and personal protective equipment (MAPPE), even for the health workers This note focuses on this issue and suggests that a global organization, which stores and renews basic MAPPE would be beneficial in the fight against the next pandemic and that such an organization can be established without significantly increasing the public expenses of the countries [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of World Medical & Health Policy is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Fighting a war without weapons?

METHODS: The data of all patients who were admitted to outpatient clinics at Hisar Intercontinental Hospital or the hospital's online patient portal system between March 11th and May 30th, 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Of all patients, 545 in outpatient clinics and 25 in online portal system, (17%) were hospitalized for medical treatment, and 53 underwent surgery. There were 1032 patients admitted to Urology Clinics and 104 patients who underwent surgery in the same period of 2019. The pre-operative assessment of patients who were candidates of urological surgery included certain criteria for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of patients included in this study, the median age was 41 years (18-90). The mean hospital stay was 1 day (1-12), and the mean duration of operation was 25 min (3-250). Thirty-seven patients (69.8%) underwent general anesthesia, while only 11(20.8%) underwent combined spinal epidural anesthesia.

Therefore, considering the exigency of the situation, we focused on identifying the available approved drugs as potential inhibitor against the promising Coronavirus drug target, the Main Protease, using computer-aided methods. We created a library of U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved anti-microbial drugs and virtually screened it against the available crystal structures of Main Protease of the virus. The study revealed that Viomycin showed the highest -CDocker energy after docking at the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease. It is noteworthy that Viomycin showed higher -CDocker energy as compared to the drugs currently under clinical trial for SARS-CoV-2 treatment viz. Ritonavir and Lopinavir. Additionally, Viomycin formed higher number of H-bonds with SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease than its co-crystallised inhibitor compound N3. Molecular dynamics simulation further showed that Viomycin embedded deeply inside the binding pocket and formed robust binding with SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease. Therefore, we propose that Viomycin may act as a potential inhibitor of the Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2.

Since its discovery in 1982, the roles of Wnt signaling have been established in various key regulatory systems in biology. Wnt signals exert pleiotropic effects, including mitogenic stimulation, cell fate specification, and differentiation. The Wnt signaling pathway in humans has been shown to be involved in a wide variety of disorders including colon cancer, sarcoma, coronary artery disease, tetra-amelia, Mullerian duct regression, eye vascular defects, and abnormal bone mass. The canonical Wnt pathway functions by regulating the function of the transcriptional coactivator ?-catenin, whereas noncanonical pathways function independent of ?-catenin. Although the role of Wnt signaling is well established in epithelial malignancies, its role in mesenchymal tumors is more controversial. Some studies have suggested that Wnt signaling plays a pro-oncogenic role in various sarcomas by driving cell proliferation and motility; however, others have reported that Wnt signaling acts as a tumor suppressor by committing tumor cells to differentiate into a mature lineage. Wnt signaling pathway also plays an important role in regulating cancer stem cell function.

In this study, we found that M protein of several other RNA viruses, including VSV, SeV and HIV, interacted with SLD5. Furthermore, VSV/SeV infection and M protein of VSV/SeV/HIV induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. Importantly, overexpression of SLD5 partially rescued the cell cycle arrest by VSV/SeV infection and VSV M protein. In addition, SLD5 suppressed VSV replication in vitro and in vivo, and enhanced type  interferon signalling.

However, the negative impact of such disruptions on people with substance use disorders (SUD) seeking treatment remains unclear. We aim to explore the behaviors adopted by these individuals to overcome the service disruptions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We explored the changes related to substance use behavior (quit attempts, withdrawal experienced, treatment-seeking, and risky behaviors), and behavioral changes in response to COVID-19 lockdown. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 404 people with SUD seeking treatment from seven centers across India. They were assessed by a specially designed structured questionnaire during the first wave (JuneCSeptember) of the pandemic. RESULTS: An overwhelming majority experienced withdrawal symptoms, with close to half making quit attempts and seeking treatment during the lockdown. Three-fourth of the sample reported difficulty in accessing treatment services and medications. Patients with opioid use were significantly more likely to think about quitting ((2) = 20.408, P = 0.000), make attempts ((2) = 12.436, P = 0.000), seek treatment ((2) = 7.536, P = 0.006), and self-medicate for withdrawal symptoms ((2) = 5.885, P = 0.015).

Recent efforts, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), show promise in performing a new kind of inference to leverage these models. While the scope of applicability of these inference algorithms is limited by the capabilities of contemporary computational hardware, they show potential of being greatly parallelized.

Therefore, this study explored the changing patterns of adversity relating to the COVID-19 pandemic by socioeconomic position (SEP) during the early weeks of lockdown in the UK. METHODS: Data were from 12 527 UK adults in the University College London COVID-19 Social Study (a panel study that involves online weekly data collection from participants during the COVID-19 pandemic). We analysed data collected from 25 March to 14 April 2020. The sample was well-stratified and weighted to population proportions of gender, age, ethnicity, education and country of living. We used Poisson and logit models to assess 10 different types of adverse experiences depending on an index of SEP over time. RESULTS: There was a clear gradient across the number of adverse events experienced each week by SEP. This was most clearly seen for adversities relating to finances (including loss of employment and cut in income) and basic needs (including access to food and medications) but less for experiences directly relating to the virus. Inequalities were maintained with no reductions in discrepancies between socioeconomic groups over time.

Modern system of medicine, do not have any defini-tive management. Now, we need to think about other systems of medicine to break this chain. So in Ayurvedic perspective, the COVID-19 can be con-sidered as Aupasargika/ AgantujaVyadhi (Infectious disease). Present study aims to understand the principles of Ayurveda, in view of concept, epidemiol-ogy, etiopathology, prognosis, prevention and management of infectious dis-eases. It comprises of probable approaches of infectious diseases through Ayurveda. References established on data pertaining to available in Ayurveda classics, modern texts, peer review journals regarding the same. The speedily spread of COVID-19 is due to indulgence in the etiological factors, by people of this era. The onset period of this pandemic was VasantaRutu(spring), hence KaphaPrakopa(vitiation of Kapha) is there. And the further pathogenesis is like ShwasanakaSannipatikaJwara(fever due to vitiation of all humors). So, Panchakarma (Internal purification), Rasayana Chikitsa (Rejuvenating treat-ment) and Sadvritta (Good regime) can be included in the management of such diseases. From this study it can be concluded that disease is produced due to an imbalance between physical and mental elements, as it reduces resis-tance of body against disease. If we cure or prevent this imbalance and the strengthen hosts defense system by Ayurvedic drugs, lifestyle modifications, and diet modifications, the body will be immune to diseases.","output":"Concept of infectious diseases in Ayurveda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the relationship between the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in postpartum depressive symptoms (PDS) in individuals in the United States. Further analyses explored how these changes related to state-level measures of pandemic severity, economic hardship, and social isolation. METHODS: Data were collected from users of the Flo mobile health application who completed a survey about their mood within 90 days of giving birth. Analyses assessed changes in national and state-level self-reported PDS from a pre-pandemic period (N = 159,478) to a pandemic period (N = 118,622). Linear regression determined which state-level pandemic severity or economic factors were associated with changes in PDS. RESULTS: National rates of PDS increased from 6.5% (pre-pandemic) to 6.9% (pandemic). There was a significant increase in PDS over the course of the pandemic timeframe. Linear regressions revealed a negative association between percent change in PDS across states and COVID-19 deaths per 100 K residents as well as 2020 women's unemployment rate. There was no association between change in PDS and COVID-19 cases per 100 K residents, percent job loss, percent change in women's unemployment rate, or percentage of population staying at home. CONCLUSIONS: There was a national increase in PDS that worsened over the course of a year following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. States with a greater increase in PDS tended to show overall fewer deaths from COVID-19 and lower women's unemployment rates. Further work is needed to identify what individual-level factors may be driving these differences.","output":"Rates of self-reported postpartum depressive symptoms in the United States before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article we discuss an experience developed with high school students during Covid-forced distance learning.

The management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has primarily impacted emergency departments, medical teams, and intensive care units. However, the impact on health systems as a whole, including surgical specialties, has been wide ranging. We aimed to establish the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown on the number and characteristics of general surgical patients reviewed and/or admitted by the surgical team within a district general hospital. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of patients admitted in the 2-week period from start of the lockdown (Monday 23rd March 2020 to 5th April 2020), and the same period 1 year earlier (Monday 25th March 2019 to 7th April 2019). Number of patients reviewed and admitted were compared between the two cohorts. Data including diagnosis, operation/procedural interventions, and length of stay were analysed. The overall number of patients reviewed and admitted by the surgical team was substantially lower during the period of lockdown (61 vs 126). Of the patients seen during lockdown, a smaller proportion were admitted to hospital after initial surgical review (59% vs 77%, p < 0.05). Interventional/operative procedures were performed in a similar proportion of patients in both cohorts (31%). Our data show that there has been a substantial reduction in the number of patients being referred to and admitted by the general surgical team at our centre during the COVID-19 pandemic. Explanations for this include reduced attendance due to risk perception of the patients, the impact of lockdown messages and advice regarding self-isolation, as well as an increased threshold for patient admission during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the clinical characteristics, and potential causes of this phenomenon still cannot be identified.Methods: Patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and first admitted to Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Hubei Province, China and then discharged from January17 to March 30, 2020 were under follow-up. Patients with hospital stay30 days were assigned to long-course group (LC group). Once the follow-up SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test became re-positive before April 27, 2020, the patients were involved in re-positive group (RP group). Meanwhile, we matched another group of patients (Matched group) to the RP group at 1:1, according to the admission time (three days before or after). Baseline features, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, Computed Tomography (CT) manifestations, comorbidities, and outcomes in the three groups were collected, summarized and analyzed.Findings: A total of 365 confirmed COVID-19 patients discharged from January17 to March 30, 2020, among which 31 patients presented re-positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. The mean age of the RP group was 56351441(24-85) years, with 14(4516%) patients older than 60 years. There was no obvious difference of age between RP group and LC group.

Right now, one of the main questions about COVID-19 in Italy is whether the second wave will be less severe than the first. Currently, the answer to this question remains open. According to the Italian Ministry of Health website (COVID-19 C Situation in Italy), it would appear that in Italy the COVID-19 second wave is less severe and deadly than the first one was. However, this difference could be affected by several factors, including the different number of swabs performed in the two waves, as it is approximately seven to eight times higher in the second wave. Therefore, it is not yet clear whether the COVID-19 second wave in Italy, specifically in Lombardy, is less severe and deadly than the first wave.In order to answer this challenging question, we decided to quantify the radiographic severity of COVID-19 pneumonia during the second wave and compare it with that of the first wave.

The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of 30-day all-cause mortality, vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and severe influenza complication (myocarditis and encephalitis). Secondary outcomes encompassed all the components of the primary outcome, 90-day all-cause mortality, occurrence of pneumonia, length of hospital stay, and 90-day readmission rates. The study comprised 512 hospitalized adults diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed influenza A (195/512) and B (317/512).

We rarely encounter lung cancer in a patient with a tracheal bronchus; however, it is essential to know the distinctive perioperative management strategy for patients with a tracheal bronchus. CASE PRESENTATION We report a 72-year-old man with lung cancer located in the right apical segment supplied by a tracheal bronchus. Annual chest computed tomography performed as follow-up after colon cancer resection showed an enlarging pulmonary nodule with pure ground-glass opacity, which was suspected to be lung adenocarcinoma. The nodule was located in the right apical segment. The apical segment was independently supplied by a single pulmonary artery superior trunk and a tracheal bronchus that branched directly from the trachea at 1.2 cm above the carina. The pulmonary vein branching pattern was uncommon in that the central vein that usually runs through B2 (posterior bronchus) and B3 (anterior bronchus) was missing. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic apical segmentectomy under one-lung ventilation using a left-sided double-lumen tube. DISCUSSION Anomalous venous return accompanied with tracheal bronchus has been described in some reports. Since pulmonary vein is important during segmentectomy, the surgeon should pay particular attention to the venous return. CONCLUSION Preoperative three-dimensional graphic imagery helped us accurately identify the anatomical anomaly to enable the successful segmentectomy in a patient with a tracheal bronchus. We review the relevant literature regarding the perioperative management of patients with a tracheal bronchus.","output":"VATS right apical segmentectomy for lung cancer in a patient with tracheal bronchus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: It is important to quantify the true burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in different countries, to enable informed decisions about imposing and relaxing control measures. COVID-19 surveillance data fails in this respect, as it is influenced by different definitions, control policies and capacities. This article aims to quantify excess mortality and estimate the distribution between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 causes of death. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study and mathematical modelling. METHODS: Publicly available data from multiple institutional sources were used and an in-depth analysis was carried out of deaths from all causes between 2015 and 2020 in Italy at the national, regional and local level. Excess mortality over time and space was first explored, followed by an assessment of how this related to COVID-19 surveillance and, ultimately, assuming a fixed male:female ratio, a model was developed and applied to estimate the proportions of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 excess mortality in 2020. RESULTS: In Italy, the mortality rate doubled in March and April 2020 compared with data from 2015 to 2019 (+109%, when considering municipalites with >10.000 inhabitants), with excess mortality reaching >600% in large municipalities in northern areas. Notified COVID-19 deaths accounted for only 43.5% (regional range: 43-62%) of excess mortality. It is estimated that more than two-thirds of excess deaths that were not captured by surveillance are non-COVID-19 deaths, which could be a result of the excess burden on the health systems, in addition to reduced demand and supply of other non-COVID healthcare services. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID-19 during the early stages of the pandemic is much larger than official figures have reported. Monitoring excess mortality helps to capture the full effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which differs between regions in Italy and which might have resulted in significant indirect effects on the well-being of the population. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in significant indirect effects on the well-being of the population.","output":"Doubled mortality rate during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy: quantifying what is not captured by surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently emerged novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) led to urgent search for methods to prevent and treat COVID-19.

Study 3 (N = 3444; 1587 males; M(age) = 55.34) examined bidirectional relationships between an index of emotional ambivalence and psychological well-being about ten years later, controlling for baselines. Demographic covariates, positive emotions, and negative emotions were controlled for in all studies. Analyses were performed using latent variable structural equation modelling. After adjusting for all covariates, the direct measures of mixed emotions predicted poorer psychological well-being (Study 1) and greater burnout (Study 2).

In Study 3, emotional ambivalence predicted poorer long-term psychological well-being, while psychological well-being also predicted lower emotional ambivalence, supporting bidrectionality. The findings provide preliminary evidence that naturalistically experienced mixed emotions may be conflicting and unpleasant, with potentially negative implications for psychological well-being over and above positive and negative emotions.

In general, a combination of cost state variables and control effort have been applied as cost indices. Many important results have been reported. Nevertheless, it seems that the interpretation of the optimal control law for an epidemic system has received less attention. In this paper, we have applied Pontryagins maximum principle to develop an optimal control law to minimize the number of infected individuals and the vaccination rate. We have adopted the compartmental model SIR to test our technique. We have shown that the proposed control law can give some insights to develop a control strategy in a model-free scenario. Numerical examples show a reduction of 50% in the number of infected individuals when compared with constant vaccination. There is not always a prior knowledge of the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals required to formulate and solve the optimal control problem. In a model-free scenario, a strategy based on the analytic function is proposed, where prior knowledge of the scenario is not necessary. This insight can also be useful after the development of a vaccine to COVID-19, since it shows that a fast and general cover of vaccine worldwide can minimize the number of infected, and consequently the number of deaths.

With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in medical sciences as low-cost and safer diagnostic methods, researchers have turned their attention to the use of imaging tools with AI that have fewer complications for patients and reduce the consumption of healthcare resources. Despite its limitations, X-ray is suggested as the first-line diagnostic modality for detecting and screening COVID-19 cases. METHOD: This systematic review assessed the current state of AI applications and the performance of algorithms in X-ray image analysis. The search strategy yielded 322 results from four databases and google scholar, 60 of which met the inclusion criteria. The performance statistics included the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC) curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. RESULT: The average sensitivity and specificity of CXR equipped with AI algorithms for COVID-19 diagnosis were >96% (83%-100%) and 92% (80%-100%), respectively. For common X-ray methods in COVID-19 detection, these values were 0.56 (95% CI 0.51-0.60) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.54-0.65), respectively. AI has substantially improved the diagnostic performance of X-rays in COVID-19. CONCLUSION: X-rays equipped with AI can serve as a tool to screen the cases requiring CT scans. The use of this tool does not waste time or impose extra costs, has minimal complications, and can thus decrease or remove unnecessary CT slices and other healthcare resources.","output":"X-Ray Equipped with Artificial Intelligence: Changing the COVID-19 Diagnostic Paradigm during the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools worldwide are using tele-education for class delivery. However, this causes a problem related to students' active class participation. We propose to address the problem with a system that recognizes student's actions and informs the teacher accordingly, while preserving the privacy of students. In the proposed action recognition system, seven typical actions performed by students attending online courses, are recognized using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. The actions considered were defined by considering the relevant literature and educator's views, and ensure that they provide information about the physical presence, active participation, and distraction of students, that constitute important pedagogical aspects of class delivery. The action recognition process is performed locally on the device of each student, thus it is imperative to use classification methods that require minimal computational load and memory requirements. Initial experimental results indicate that the proposed action recognition system provides promising classification results, when dealing with new instances of previously enrolled students or when dealing with previously unseen students.","output":"Using Student Action Recognition to Enhance the Efficiency of Tele-education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The project was conducted to learn how the services of the digital media commons (DMC) impact and support student success. Data were collected to learn how faculty perceive the instructional support program, how patrons perceive the quality of the services and how students use the services, technology and the space that the DMC occupies. The results will be used to improve services and instruction and to inform the future direction of our instruction support service post-COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach The project included three phases. First, a survey was sent to faculty who had brought their class for an instruction session to gain input on how they perceived the impact of the instruction and follow-up services on the quality of media projects. The second phase was a customer service survey implemented in the area to learn how patrons used the spaces and technology, what types of projects they completed in the DMC and their satisfaction with the assistance they received. The third phase employed student focus groups that followed up on the information from the survey to pinpoint how students perceive that the DMC impacts their academic success. Findings The data gained from the research indicated that (1) the teaching program provides important instruction for media projects, (2) the DMC provides important services and technology that contribute to student success and (3) The DMC space is an important destination for students as a learning space. Research limitations/implications The scope of this case study is limited by the size of sample groups surveyed and the presumed veracity of their responses. The implications of our results do, however, align with reported trends experienced by peer institutions. Practical implications This case study can be used by colleagues from other university's and learning environments to improve their space and instructional support offerings. Social implications Digital learning and work environments are increasing across the country due to society's demand for multimedia literacy instruction and technical support. This research will serve as a reference point for institutions starting and/or assessing the direct impact of digital spaces on student success and learning outcomes. Originality/value Although there are many studies on the impact of academic libraries' services, space and resources on student success, few specifically address the contributions of academic library digital media services on student achievement.

To strengthen this efforts, a consortium of researchers initiated in March 2020 the COVID Moonshot project that has been accepting public suggestions for computationally triaged, synthesized, and tested molecules, with experimental data made publicly available. The main goal of the project was to identify through Fragment Based Drug Design (FBDD) small molecules with activity against the virus, for oral treatment. Since orally administered drugs are introduced to the bloodstream through absorption via the small intestine pathway, the ability of a drug to readily cross the intestinal cell membranes and enter circulation is decisively influencing its bioavailability. This explains the need to evaluate and optimize a drugs membrane permeability in the early stages of drug discovery to avoid failures in late-stage drug development owing to incomplete absorption and poor bioavailability. In our present work, as a contribution to the ongoing scientific efforts, we have employed advanced Machine Learning techniques, including stacked model ensembles, to develop QSAR tools for modelling the PAMPA Effective Permeability (passive diffusion) of orally administered drugs. By applying feature elimination methods, we identified a set of 61 features (descriptors) most relevant in explaining drug cell permeability and used these features to develop the models. The QSAR models were subsequently used to predict the PAMPA Effective Permeability of molecules included in datasets made available through the COVID Moonshot project. Our models were shown to be robust and may provide a promising framework for predicting the potential permeability of molecules not yet synthesized, thus guiding the process of drug design.","output":"Development of QSAR ensemble models for predicting the PAMPA Effective Permeability of new, non-peptidic leads with potential antiviral activity against the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Invasive aspergillosis of the lungs and the central nervous system and Legionella pneumophilia serotype 1 infection of the lungs were diagnosed in a 22-month old child during inpatient induction treatment for T-lymphoblastic leukemia.

Methods: Seven data bases were searched. Research criteria included cohort and case-control studies, carried out worldwide and published before September 9, 2020, that compared the serum antibody levels of hospitalized COVID-19 cases that RP after discharge to those that did NRP. Results: There is some evidence that immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody levels in RP cases were lower compared with NRP cases. The hypothesis of incomplete clearance aligns with these findings. The possibility of false negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR test results during viral clearance is also plausible, as concentration of the viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) in nasopharyngeal and fecal swabs fluctuate below the limits of RT-PCR detection during virus clearance. The probability of reinfection was less likely to be the cause of retesting positive because of the low risk of exposure where cases observed a 14 day-quarantine after discharge.

The study comprised serum samples from the SPF-herd over a 10-year period (n=109) and a close monitoring of animals in the herd during the period after the EE outbreak. Serum samples from conventional boars at the AI-station servicing the herd were also included (n=9). All serum samples were tested for antibodies to porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2). In addition, 3-week-old piglets from three litters (n=24) farrowed close after the initial EE outbreak were closely monitored for clinical signs of skin disease, sampled for Staphylococcus hyicus, tested for antibodies to porcine parvovirus and in sequentially collected serum samples tested for interferon- (IFN-) and interleukin-6. The PVC-2 serology showed that animals in the herd were sero-negative at least until 2 months prior to the EE outbreak. During the period close after the EE outbreak the animals showed varying levels of antibodies to PCV-2 but all the tested animals had sero-converted 4 months later. The AI boars were also sero-positive to PCV-2 at the time of the EE outbreak. Animals in the SPF-herd remained sero-positive to PCV-2 during the following 7 years. In the monitored litters, one piglet had clinical EE and 15 piglets displayed defined erythemas on the abdomen.

This can cause structural changes that result in downstream functional effects, for example, in integrin activation. Recent studies have shown that a wide range of membrane proteins have labile disulfide bonds including CD132, the common gamma chain of the receptors for several cytokines including interleukin-2 and interleukin-4 (IL-2 and IL-4). The Cys(183)CCys(232) disulfide bond in mouse CD132 is susceptible to reduction by enzymes such as thioredoxin (TRX), gamma interferon-inducible lysosomal thiolreductase and protein disulfide isomerase, which are commonly secreted during immune activation. The Cys(183)CCys(232) disulfide bond is also reduced in an in vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute model of inflammation. Conditions that lead to the reduction of the Cys(183)CCys(232) disulfide bond in CD132 inhibit proliferation of an IL-2-dependent T cell clone and concomitant inhibition of the STAT-5 signalling pathway. The same reducing conditions had no effect on the proliferation of an IL-2-independent T cell clone, nor did they reduce disulfide bonds in IL-2 itself. We postulate that reduction of the Cys(183)CCys(232) disulfide in CD132 inhibits IL-2 binding to the receptor complex. Published data show that the Cys(183)CCys(232) disulfide bond is exposed at the surface of CD132 and in close contact with IL-2 and IL-4 in their respective receptor complexes. In addition, mutants in these Cys residues in human CD132 lead to immunodeficiency and loss of IL-2 binding. These results have wider implications for the regulation of cytokine receptors in general, as their activity can be modulated by a redox regulator mechanism caused by the changes in the redox environment that occur during inflammation and activation of the immune system.","output":"Interleukin-2 signalling is modulated by a labile disulfide bond in the CD132 chain of its receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nowadays, the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its complications are one of the main concerns of the world.

We aimed to assess whether timapiprant attenuated or prevented asthma exacerbations induced by experimental rhinovirus (RV) infection. We furthermore hypothesised that timapiprant would dampen RV-induced type 2 inflammation and consequently improve antiviral immune responses. METHODS: Atopic patients with partially controlled asthma on maintenance inhaled corticosteroids were randomised to timapiprant (n=22) or placebo (n=22) and challenged with RV-A16 3 weeks later. The primary endpoint was the cumulative lower respiratory symptom score over the 14 days post infection. Upper respiratory symptoms, spirometry, airway hyperresponsiveness, exhaled nitric oxide, RV-A16 virus load and soluble mediators in upper and lower airways samples, and CRTH2 staining in bronchial biopsies were additionally assessed before and during RV-A16 infection. RESULTS: Six subjects discontinued the study and eight were not infected; outcomes were assessed in 16 timapiprant-treated and 14 placebo-treated, successfully infected subjects.

Two divergent hypotheses have been proposed: hyperinflammatory cytokine storm; and failure of host protective immunity that results in unrestrained viral dissemination and organ injury. A key explanation for the inability to address this controversy has been the lack of diagnostic tools to evaluate immune function in COVID-19 infections. ELISpot, a highly sensitive, functional immunoassay, was employed in 27 patients with COVID-19, 51 patients with sepsis, 18 critically ill nonseptic (CINS) patients, and 27 healthy control volunteers to evaluate adaptive and innate immune status by quantitating T cell IFN- and monocyte TFN-&#945; production. Circulating T cell subsets were profoundly reduced in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, stimulated blood mononuclear cells produced less than 40%-50% of the IFN- and TNF-&#945; observed in septic and CINS patients, consistent with markedly impaired immune effector cell function. Approximately 25% of COVID-19 patients had increased IL-6 levels that were not associated with elevations in other canonical proinflammatory cytokines. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that COVID-19 suppresses host functional adaptive and innate immunity. Importantly, IL-7 administered ex vivo restored T cell IFN- production in COVID-19 patients. Thus, ELISpot may functionally characterize host immunity in COVID-19 and inform prospective therapies.","output":"Severe immunosuppression and not a cytokine storm characterizes COVID-19 infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In this study, we assessed the prevalence of positive rapid detection test (RDT) among healthcare workers (HCWs) and evaluated the role of personal protective equipment (PPE) and knowledge of the pandemic. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study conducted between August 2020 and October 2020 in a tertiary referral center (Tehran, Iran), we enrolled 117 physicians, nurses, and other HCWs (OHCWs)-aides, helpers, and medical waste handlers-regularly working in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) wards. The RDT kit was utilized to reveal recent infection; data on demographics, PPE use and availability, and knowledge of the pandemic was collected through pre-defined questionnaires. RESULTS: Overall, 24.8% (95% CI: 16.8-32.7%) of HCWs had positive RDTs. The more PPE was available and used, the less the chance of positive RDT was (OR: 0.63 [0.44-0.91], P = 0.014 and 0.63 [0.41-0.96], P = 0.030). The same was true for the knowledge of prevention and adhering to preventive rules (OR: 0.44 [0.24-0.81], P = 0.008 and 0.47 [0.25-0.89], P = 0.020). OHCWs had the highest prevalence of positive RDT, while they had more shifts per month, less accessibility to PPE, and less knowledge of the pandemic than physicians. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that HCWs should have a thorough knowledge of the pandemic along with using PPE properly and rationally. Furthermore, adhering to preventive regulations plays a crucial role in HCWs' safety. It is also noteworthy that shifts should be arranged logically to manage exposures, with a special attention being paid to OHCWs.","output":"Rapid Detection Test for COVID-19 among Healthcare Workers and the Role of Personal Protective Equipment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous manifestations have been included in COVID-19 patients' clinical spectrum.

Methods: Data came from 32,194 respondents to The Global Drug Survey (GDS) 2015, an annual, cross-sectional, online survey. Respondents selected their usual drinking location (home alone: home with partner/family: house parties: pubs/bars or clubs) and usual drink (wine; beer/cider/lager; spirits or alcopops/coolers). They indicated how many drinks they required to reach three stages of intoxication (feeling the effects; an ideal stage of intoxication; and the tipping point) and how frequently they reached each stage. Results: Drink type affected grams of alcohol reported to reach the tipping point: 109 gm wine, 127 gm alcopops, 133 gm of beer, and 134 gm of spirts. Respondents who drank at home alone, or in clubs reached their tipping point more frequently compared to other locations. Conclusions: Where people drink, and the type of alcohol they drink, affected the amount of alcohol reported to reach different stages of intoxication. Understanding why different drinking locations, and drink types lead to a need for greater consumption to reach an ideal state of drunkenness, such as social cues from other people who drink, may enable people to reduce their drinking.","output":"Where and What You Drink Is Linked to How Much You Drink: An Exploratory Survey of Alcohol Use in 17 Countries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have optimised a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from extracted RNA for clinical application.

Endothelial VWF is stored in cell-specific secretory granules, Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs), organelles generated in a wide range of lengths (0.5-5.0 m). WPB size responds to physiological cues and pharmacological treatment, and VWF secretion from shortened WPBs dramatically reduces platelet and plasma VWF adhesion to an endothelial surface. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that WPB-shortening represented a novel target for antithrombotic therapy. Our objective was to determine whether compounds exhibiting this activity do exist. METHODS: Using a microscopy approach coupled to automated image analysis, we measured the size of WPB bodies in primary human endothelial cells treated with licensed compounds for 24 hours. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A novel approach to identification of antithrombotic compounds generated a significant number of candidates with the ability to shorten WPBs. In vitro assays of two selected compounds confirm that they inhibit the pro-hemostatic activity of secreted VWF. This set of compounds acting at a very early stage of the hemostatic process could well prove to be a useful adjunct to current antithrombotic therapeutics. Further, in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with a considerable fraction of critically ill COVID-19 patients affected by hypercoagulability, these WPB size-reducing drugs might also provide welcome therapeutic leads for frontline clinicians and researchers.","output":"Modulation of endothelial organelle size as an antithrombotic strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 spread quickly in Jordan in the past few months.

Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to detect the possible association between lung computed tomography (CT) findings in COVID-19 and patients' age, body weight, vital sings, and medical regimen. The present cross-sectional study enrolled 230 COVID-19 patients in Prince Hamza Hospital in Jordan. Demographic data as well as major lung CT scan changes were obtained from the hospital records of the COVID-19 patients. The main observed major lung changes among the enrolled COVID-19 patients included ground glass opacification in 47(15.2%) patients and consolidation in 22(7.1%) patients. The higher percentage of patients with major lung changes (24%) was observed among patients above 60 years old, while (50%) of patients with no changes in their lungs findings in the age group of 18-29 years old. Results obtained from the present study showed that only patients with major CT lung changes (9.7%) were prescribed more than three antibiotics.

Medical, ethical, moral and social dynamics continue to remain individualized and highly debated but more evolved with advancement in medicine for patients needing cardiac re-transplantation. We describe a case of a successful outcome in a patient requiring her third orthotopic heart transplant. Case A 26 year old female with history of orthotopic heart transplant at age 11 for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and subsequent re-transplantation for cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) ten years later presented to our emergency room with cardiac arrest. Prior to the index hospitalization, the patient had an echocardiogram with a mildly reduced ejection fraction and an angiogram with chronic total occlusions of the right coronary artery and left circumflex artery with excellent collaterals and preserved cardiac output. Nuclear stress test showed no evidence of ischemia. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy prophylaxis with aspirin and pravastatin in addition to a triple regimen of immunosuppression of tacrolimus, sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were verified. The hospitalization was complicated by rapidly deteriorating biventricular function and three more episodes of cardiac arrest ultimately requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Fortunately, the patient had negative HLAs with 0% CPRA and preserved end organ function. The selection committee thoughtfully considered her history of intermittent social marijuana use, active COVID 19 precautions in the hospital and a third sternotomy at such a young age, with likely need of possible 4th heart transplant in the future, but ultimately approved the patient for listing. Despite being Status 1, the patient had near daily loss of pulsatility for greater than 10-15 minutes which made us consider the possibility of total artificial heart. Fortunately, the patient received a local heart due to the COVID travel restrictions with total ischemic time of 98 minutes. She was induced with basiliximab and had negative retrospective and prospective crossmatches. There were no intra-op complications and post-op the patient had mild RV dysfunction requiring 4 days of inotropes. Patient was successfully discharged 9 days following her third OHT. Conclusion Patients undergoing re-transplantation have overall poorer outcomes than those undergoing primary transplantation. Several factors influence these outcomes including timing from prior transplant, previous sternotomy, sensitization status, and renal dysfunction.

To address hesitancy, we must focus our attention on building vaccine confidence, trust in the vaccine itself, in providers who administer vaccines, and in the process that leads to vaccine licensure and the recommended vaccination schedule. Building vaccine confidence, particularly in communities who have higher levels of distrust of vaccines and low vaccination coverage rates is a critical public health priority, particularly in the current climate as the United States and the global public health community grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic. In this commentary, we focus on the central role pharmacists play in promoting the health and wellness of the local communities they are embedded in, how they are one of the most trusted sources for their communities when it comes to health information and care, and their unique position in making a significant contribution to building vaccine confidence. We propose to arm all health care professionals with a tool, the ASPIRE framework, which serves as a series of actionable steps to facilitate conversations with communities. This framework is intended to assist pharmacists in communicating with community members who may have concerns about vaccines by sharing trustworthy health information about vaccines to increase vaccine adoption. We conclude that it is insufficient to merely relay accurate health information about vaccines to the public and expect dramatic increases to vaccination rates. Accurate health information needs to be conveyed by trusted sources. Open engagement and dialogue layered on top of fundamental facts and messages are central to building confidence. Pharmacists and other providers can use tools, such as ASPIRE, to guide their conversations with community members to increase vaccine adoption.","output":"Trust, Influence and Community: Why pharmacists and pharmacies are central for addressing vaccine hesitancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by the SARS-COV-2 or COVID-19 virus has been a global challenge given its high rate of transmission and lack of effective therapy or vaccine.

A message containing a link to the actual questionnaire was sent to their phones simultaneously. The medical records of the patients were reviewed for gathering information about demographic data, clinical follow-up, and treatments. Patients who were followed-up under immunosuppressive treatment (n = 439) were attempted to be contacted. The diagnostic distribution of patients (n = 414) eligible for the study was as follows: juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (n = 243, 58.7%), autoinflammatory diseases (n = 109, 26.3%), connective tissue diseases (n = 51, 12.3%), and vasculitis (n = 11, 2.7%).

BACKGROUND Crowding in emergency departments (EDs) is a widely reported problem leading to increased service times and patients leaving without being seen. METHODS Using ED historical data and expert estimates, we created a discrete-event simulation model. We analyzed the likely impact of initiating care and boarding patients in the hallway (hallway care) instead of the exam rooms and adding a dedicated triage space for patients who arrive by emergency medical services (EMS triage) to decrease hallway congestion. The scenarios were compared in terms of LOS, time spent in exam rooms and hallway spaces, service time, blocked time, and utilization rate. RESULTS The hallway care scenario resulted in significantly lower LOS and exam room time only for EMS patients but when implemented along with the EMS triage scenario, a significantly lower LOS and exam room time was observed for all patients (EMS and walk-in). The combination of two simulated scenarios resulted in significant improvements in other flow metrics as well. CONCLUSIONS Our findings discourage boarding of admitted patients in ED exam rooms. If space limitations require that admitted patients be placed in ED hallways, designers and planners should consider enabling hallway spaces with features recommended in this article. Alternative locations for boarding should be prioritized in or out of the ED. Our findings also encourage establishing a triage area dedicated to EMS patients in the ED.","output":"Data-Driven Design Strategies to Address Crowding and Boarding in an Emergency Department: A Discrete-Event Simulation Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypereosinophilic syndromes (HESs) are a group of disorders characterized by pathological proliferation of eosinophils.

METHODS: Between March-May 2020, 2060 patients underwent thoracic imaging and SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Imaging was independently double- or triple-reported (if discordance) by blinded radiologists according to radiological criteria for COVID-19.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study of patients with VCFs aged 65 years was conducted using a nationwide database in Japan. We examined the relationships between frailty risk, classified using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), in-hospital mortality, and complications such as pressure ulcers and pneumonia. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between the HFRS and the outcomes of patients with VCFs. RESULTS: In this study, the data of 30 980 in-patients with VCFs were analyzed. Of these patients, 76.8%, 21.3%, and 1.9% had low, intermediate, and high risks of frailty, respectively. The higher the risk of frailty, the higher the rate of in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of all complications (P < 0.001 for trend). An intermediate risk of frailty was independently associated with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.421; P < 0.001), whereas a high risk of frailty did not show statistical significance (OR, 1.385; P = 0.150). Each frailty risk was independently associated with the occurrence of all complications during hospitalization.

Under the working capital channel, cash credit constraints force entrepreneurs to forgo investment opportunities in order to finance their working capital needs. Building on survey data, I find that short-term credit constraints are as important as long-term ones in SMEs investment decisions. Besides, the detrimental effect of cash credit constraints on corporate investment is stronger for SMEs with higher increase in working capital needs but lower for liquid ones that are able to adjust their accounts receivable and inventories. My results suggest that short-term finance is a major issue for SMEs. Plain English Summary Short-term credit constraints turn out to be as important as long-term ones in SMEs investment decisions. Building on survey data, this paper investigates the real effects of short-term financial constraints on small businesses through an under-explored transmission mechanism. While the bulk of research on the effects of financial constraints focuses on long-term liabilities, I stress the importance of short-term finance. Owing to the competition between working and fixed capital in cash-flow uses, cash credit constraints force entrepreneurs to allocate additional cash-flow to finance the increase in their working capital needs to the detriment of long-term assets.The main implication of this work is that supports for short-term financing would provide a significant boost to long-term investment and economic growth.","output":"Short-term financial constraints and SMEs investment decision: evidence from the working capital channel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the physiological impact of high CPAP (9 cmH(2)O) vs. NIPPV at equivalent mean airway pressures.

The objective of this study was to estimate the median amount of money ED personnel would be willing to pay for preventing nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: A contingent valuation approach with close-ended format was used. During the study period from June 15, 2003 through June 30, 2003, a convenience sample of all medical personnel working in the ED of National Taiwan University Hospital was carried out. Participants were interviewed by a standard questionnaire and were asked to choose whether or not they would pay at a specified price to purchase a hypothetical SARS vaccine. A logistic regression model was created to evaluate the relationship between willingness-to-pay and the log of the price offered in the bid questions. The median and mean amounts of willingness-to-pay were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 115 subjects were interviewed and most were nurses (68.7%). The median and mean amount subjects reported being willing to pay for a SARS vaccine was US $1762 and US $720, respectively. Subject responses were significantly related to the price of vaccination and their type of job.

Simultaneously, the significant part of plastic waste is still disposed improperly and pollutes the environment making a threat to all living organisms. In this work three plastic materials, two bio-based biodegradable: polylactide (PLA) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), and one petroleum-derived non-biodegradable polypropylene (PP) were studied towards their effects on seed germination and early growth of higher plants. The following plants were used as bioindicators: monocotyledonous plant - Sorghum saccharatum and two dicotyledonous plants: Sinapsis alba and Lepidium sativum. Plastics did not affect seed germination of higher plants even at the highest concentration tested (11.9% w/w) but their presence in soil acted in various ways on growth of the plants. Either no or inhibitive or stimulation effects on growth of roots or stems were noticed. It depended on the concentration and chemical composition of the plastic tested, and plant species. PHB and PLA more often caused to the inhibition of root growth than PP did. This phenomenon was observed in particular with regard to the dicotyledonous plants. Moreover, in the tests with the dicotyledonous plants (S. alba and L. sativum) the dose-response relations were usually determined as statistically relevant. Among these plants cress (L. sativum) occurred to be more sensitive and allowed for obtaining the dose-response dependence for both root and stem length, and, what is important, it took place in the case of each of materials tested. Therefore, cress is recommended to be used as a bioindicator in the assessment of the effect of plastics (petroleum-derived and bio-based plastics) on the early stages of growth of higher plants.","output":"Phytotoxicity assessment of biodegradable and non-biodegradable plastics using seed germination and early growth tests."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common neurological disorders and can be highly disabling. In recent years, studies on the clinical perspectives and pathophysiology have advanced our understanding of ET. Specifically, clinical heterogeneity of ET, with co-existence of tremor and other neurological features such as dystonia, ataxia, and cognitive dysfunction, has been identified. The cerebellum has been found to be the key brain region for tremor generation, and structural alterations of the cerebellum have been extensively studied in ET. Finally, four main ET pathophysiologies have been proposed: 1) environmental exposures to ?-carboline alkaloids and the consequent olivocerebellar hyper-excitation, 2) cerebellar GABA deficiency, 3) climbing fiber synaptic pathology with related cerebellar oscillatory activity, 4) extra-cerebellar oscillatory activity. While these four theories are not mutually exclusive, they can represent distinctive ET subtypes, indicating multiple types of abnormal brain circuitry can lead to action tremor.

In vitro activation of macrophages (M) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) delayed MHV3 replication only in cells that originated from A/J mice, although cell populations from both A/J, and BALB/c mice were able to synthesize comparable amounts of IFN-/.

The prognostic ability of abnormal BCR range was assessed using a Logistic regression. Development a nomogram for predicting in-hospital mortality incorporated age, sex and BCR. The model discrimination was assessed using the calibration curves and concordance index in training and validation cohort. The predictive accuracy and clinical values of the nomogram was measured by decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve analysis (CICA). Results: : Among 337 COVID-19 patients, 13.4% and 11.3% were classified into higher and lower than normal range group, respectively. The BCR was identified as an independent risks factor for death in COVID-19 patients (P<0.0001), with area under the curve (AUC) 0.768;95%CI: 0.717-0.819). Kaplan-Meier curves for all-cause mortality outcomes showed that patients with above normal range of BCR had worse prognosis (p<0.0001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that BCR above the normal range was independently associated with death in COVID-19 patients (Odds ratio 7.54;95%CI: 1.55-36.66;P=0.012).

It was discovered 21 years ago more than 40 years after the discovery of ACE itself. Its primary physiological activity is believed to be in the conversion of angiotensin II to the vasodilatory angiotensin-(1-7) acting through the Mas receptor. As such it has been implicated in numerous pathological conditions, largely in a protective mode which has led to the search for ACE2 activatory mechanisms. ACE2 has a diverse substrate specificity allowing its participation in multiple peptide pathways. It also regulates aspects of amino acid transport through its homology with a membrane protein, collectrin. It also serves as a viral receptor for the SARS virus, and subsequently SARS-CoV2, driving the current COVID-19 pandemic. ACE2 therefore provides a therapeutic target for the treatment of COVID and understanding the biological events following viral binding can provide insight into the multiple pathologies caused by the virus, particularly inflammatory and vascular. In part this may relate to the ability of ACE2, like ACE, to be shed from the cell membrane. The shed form of ACE2 (sACE2) may be a factor in determining susceptibility to certain COVID pathologies.

Cemented fixation has excellent long-term results and is the gold standard. However, longevity in the younger, heavier, and more active population is suboptimal. Cementless TKA offers the opportunity to gain biological fixation and overcome these shortcomings. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of all consecutive cementless TKA procedures performed at a single academic institution from 2016 until 2020. Demographics, aseptic revisions, and septic revisions were pulled from the electronic medical record. The number of yearly implanted cementless TKA prosthesis was determined to analyze utilization trends. RESULTS: Eight-hundred and two patients were identified with a mean age of 61.57  7.78 years, and a mean of BMI 32.12  5.98 kg/m(2). The mean time to revision was 12.31  13.91 months. There were four septic failures and nine aseptic failures during the study period. Of these nine aseptic failures only five were due to mechanical loosening. There was a yearly linear increase in the use of cementless fixation. CONCLUSION: Cementless fixation is here to stay, and its use will continue to increase. Early and mid-term outcomes have been excellent thus far. Changing clinical practice takes time but we have already seen this transition take place in total hip arthroplasty. As technology and design continue to evolve, we believe it is a possibility.","output":"The Future is Non-cemented Total Knee Arthroplasty: Volume Trends at the Hospital for Special Surgery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: One of the main barriers to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is the fear of developing hypersensitivity reactions to any of its components. Although these reactions are very rare, it is necessary to establish an effective protocol to detect patients at risk of developing them. The aim of this study was to evaluate hypersensitivity reactions in vaccinated patients in order to allow or not to complete the vaccination protocol. METHODS: Descriptive and cross-sectional study in which patients with suspected hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were evaluated. All patients underwent skin prick test (SPT) and/or intradermal test (IDT) with the vaccines and their excipients. In patients with positive IDT with the vaccine, a histopathological and immunohistochemical study was performed by skin biopsy. A basophil activation test (BAT) and a lymphoblastic transformation test (LTT) were also performed. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with suspected hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (12 received Comirnaty(?), 3 received Vaxzevria(?), and 1 received Spikevax(?)) were evaluated. Half had immediate hypersensitivity reactions and half had delayed reactions. All SPTs to excipients and vaccines were negative. IDTs with all excipients were negative. IDTs with vaccines were positive in 11 patients and negative in 5. The histological and immunohistochemical study of the two selected patients with positive IDT with vaccine showed T-lymphocyte involvement. BAT and LTT were negative in both cases. The vaccination protocol could be completed in 7 of 16 patients (44%) studied. The remaining 9 patients did not receive the second dose: 5 because vaccination was not required and 4 because they refused to be vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: Thanks to the allergological and immunohistochemical study, the vaccination protocol could be completed in about half of the patients who presented suspected hypersensitivity reactions to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. IDTs with vaccines could be a valuable method for assessing the immunogenicity of the vaccines.","output":"Allergological study in patients vaccinated against COVID-19 with suspected allergic reactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has claimed millions of lives and devastated economies worldwide.

This seemingly mandates a deeper understanding of the disease pathogenesis. This necessitates a plausible extrapolation of cell-based therapy to COVID-19 and is regarded equivalently significant. Recently, correlative pieces of clinical evidence reported a robust decline in lymphocyte count in severe COVID-19 patients that suggest dysregulated immune responses as a key element contributing to the pathophysiological alterations. The large granular lymphocytes also known as natural killer (NK) cells play a heterogeneous role in biological functioning wherein their frontline action defends the body against a wide array of infections and tumors. They prominently play a critical role in viral clearance and executing immuno-modulatory activities. Accumulated clinical evidence demonstrate a decrease in the number of NK cells in circulation with or without phenotypical exhaustion. These plausibly contribute to the progression of pulmonary inflammation in COVID-19 pneumonia and result in acute lung injury. In this review, we have outlined the present understanding of the immunological response of NK cells in COVID-19 infection.

This allows to compare two radically different scenarios, one with no travel restrictions and another in which mobility is reduced by a travel ban. Our findings indicate that i) travel restrictions might be an effective measure in the short term, however, ii) they are ineffective when it comes to completely eliminate the disease. The latter is due to the impossibility of removing the risk of seeding the disease to other regions.

These fears are quite diverse and may manifest periictally or interictally, be part of the seizure's semiology, or an expression of reactive psychological distress from seizures themselves. Our review addresses the question of what screening tools are used in clinical care and epileptological research to capture the complexity of epilepsy-specific anxieties. METHOD: On 2021/11/11, we entered a search string in PubMed that covered our research interest as completely as possible. We also screened the bibliographies of our findings and followed PubMed's recommendations. From the assessments we found in the included studies, we extracted domains that represent the range of manifestations of anxiety, in order to compare the tools and to discuss to what extent they are suitable for assessing epilepsy-specific anxieties. RESULTS: We screened 1,621 abstracts. In total, we identified 24 different anxiety assessments. In addition to the psychiatric assessments in use, we found 7 tools that were designed to assess epilepsy-specific anxieties. The latter focus on different aspects of epilepsy-specific anxieties. In some cases, the conceptual frameworks are not sufficiently transparent or divergent. CONCLUSION: Because a diagnosis of epilepsy can result in, or seizures may appear as, anxiety, it is important to better understand this psychological burden and address it therapeutically, if necessary. There is a need for screening tools that integrate specific points of a variety of assessments, so as to cover the broad range of epilepsy-specific fears. None of the assessments we found meets this integrative perspective. At the same time, the appropriate design of such a required tool presupposes a conceptual framework of what should be considered as epilepsy-specific anxiety.","output":"Assessment of Anxiety in Patients With Epilepsy: A Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses are non-living organisms that annually cause many problems for human societies The spread of some of the most dangerous viruses causing acute pneumonia, including novel Corona virus has led to the largest death toll in the world With a long incubation period, Corona virus causes many problems for the immune system Studies have shown that antioxidant enzymes play an important role in reducing infection and boosting the immune system The immune system of people with chronic infections is often weak Specific immunity is one of the most important responses to the virus The present study therefore investigates association of Coronavirus pathogenicity with the level of antioxidants and immune system","output":"Association of coronavirus pathogencity with the level of antioxidants and immune system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many infection control measures have been implemented to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during COVID-19 pandemic.

However, there are no effective preventive measures and the efficacy of hip-preserving surgery is unsatisfactory due to the unclear mechanism of collapse. This study aimed to identify and validate miRNAs differentially expressed in collapse and non-collapse areas of the osteonecrotic femoral head, and to predict the target genes and pathways of these miRNAs. RESULTS: Nine samples passed the quality control test. A total of 2085 differentially expressed miRNAs were detected, among which 433 miRNAs showed differential expression in the T1 group compared to the W1 group; 344 miRNAs showed differential expression in the T2 group compared to the W2 group; 107 miRNAs showed differential expression in the T3 group compared to the W3 group. After combining data from all three patients, 10 miRNAs showed differential expression in the collapse area (T1+T2+T3) compared to the non-collapse area (W1+W2+W3). Compared to the normal area, has-miR-195-5p showed the most significant downregulation. Expression results from RT-PCR revealed that the expression of hsa-miR-195-5p in the collapse area (T1+T2+T3) was significantly lower than that in the non-collapse area (W1+W2+W3) and normal area (Z1+Z2+Z3). 157 genes were perdicted as the target gene of hsa-miR-195-5p. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Femoral heads of three patients (2 males and 1 female) treated by total hip arthroplasty surgery for steroid-induced femoral head osteonecrosis were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Bone tissue samples were obtained from the collapse area (T), non-collapse area (W), and normal area (Z) according to the anatomical structure of osteonecrotic femoral heads. Total RNA was extracted from the samples and the microarray chip was scanned. miRNAs showing differential expressions of more than 1.5-fold were selected and was validated by RT-PCR. TargetScan, mirBase and miRanda bioinformatics software was used to predict target genes and identify possible pathways involving these genes.

Prevention of viral propagation is of primordial importance in shelters and catteries, where cats from different backgrounds have narrow contacts.

The aim of this study was to test their ability to modulate innate immune responses and prevent viral replication as stand-alone agents in the domestic cat. CpG-A stimulation of feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) enhanced their proliferation, increased the presence of co-stimulatory molecules on their surface and influenced their gene expression profiles in an antiviral orientation. Incubation of the supernatants of CpG-A stimulated PBMCs with feline cell lines of epithelial and fibroblastic origin induced expression of the antiviral myxovirus resistance (Mx) gene in these target cells, which also showed enhanced resistance to feline viruses from five distinct families, namely Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, Caliciviridae, Parvoviridae, and Retroviridae. Most importantly, subcutaneous administration of CpG-A in domestic cats systemically increased the expression of Mx, reaching maximal levels within 24 h.

The nonlinear (NARDL) model results show that positive EPU shocks have a negative impact on short-run economic growth, and the magnitude of positive shocks is greater than the magnitude of negative shocks. The reason is that Pakistan is facing issues like nondiversified sectors, price spikes, political uncertainty, and a weak economic and financial structure. Due to these factors, any adjustment in economic policies creates an unpredictable environment in the country. When uncertainty decreases, economic activity may rebound, but it does not happen instantly. On the basis of the findings of the study, we recommend that there should be political stability in the country and coordination between macroeconomic policies to achieve long-term goals.

MATERIALS: 2,883 well-preserved skeletal elements and 9 relatively complete skulls representing an MNI of 32 non-adults (<18 years old). METHODS: All skeletal elements were observed macroscopically and pathophysiological processes underlying any lesions or other anomalies were assessed, followed by a comparative approach to rule out potential diagnoses. RESULTS: The skeletal lesions observed were caused by inflammation due to chronic hemorrhaging, marrow hyperplasia due to an increase in hemopoiesis, rapid bone growth, and the impact of biomechanical strain on poorly mineralized elements. Rickets, scurvy, and acquired anemias best fit this pattern of lesions, although inflammation from other sources such as trauma or infection could not be definitively ruled out.

Moreover, few studies evaluate how antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are maintained over time. We assessed serological response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus among our university students and staff. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, seroprevalence was determined in 705 randomly selected volunteers, members of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of the University of Alcal, using a chemiluminescent Siemens SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay for total antibodies. Positive samples were tested for IgG and IgM/IgA using VIRCLIA(?) MONOTEST (Vircell). A first analysis took place during June 2020, and in those testing positive, a determination of secondary outcomes was performed in November 2020. RESULTS: A total of 130 subjects showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (18.5%, 95% CI, 15.8C21.5%). Of these, IgM/IgA was positive in 27 and indeterminate in 19; IgG was positive in 118, indeterminate in 1. After 23 weeks, among 102 volunteers remeasured, IgG became undetectable in 6. Presence of antibodies was associated, in multivariable logistic regression, with exposure to infected patients (31.3%) [OR 1.84, 95% CI, 1.14C2.96; P = 0.012], presence of COVID-19 symptoms (52.4%) [OR 6.88, 95% CI, 4.28C11.06; P < 0.001], and confirmed earlier infection (82.9%) [OR 11.87, 95% CI, 4.26C33.07; P < 0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: The faculty of medicine and health sciences personnel and students of our university showed a high infection rate for SARS-CoV-2 during 2020 associated with providing clinical care to infected patients. This emphasizes the importance of the performance of continuous surveillance methods of the most exposed health personnel, including health science students.","output":"High Seroprevalence Against SARS-CoV-2 Among Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences Personnel and Students of the University of Alcal, Spain: Contributing Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hand washing enhanced by the Covid-19 has caused more surfactants to flow into wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which might affect both wastewater treatment and sludge disposal. Surfactants in municipal wastewater are usually at 5~20 mgL?1, but it could climb to 10~30 mgL?1 during the pandemic. Only about 1% of the influent surfactants generally remains in the effluent, and approximately 10%~20% is adsorbed into excess sludge. Although the content of surfactants in wastewater is not so high, their special amphiphilic molecular structures could reduce oxygen transfer efficiency, destroy sludge flocs, and affect the activity and abundance of microorganisms associated with nitrogen and phosphorus removal. As for sludge treatment, however, surfactants seem positive on dehydration, cell disintegration, solubilizing sludge flocs, and even anaerobic digestion like hydrolysis and acidification. Thus, it is a high priority to address the source, structure and migration &amp;transformation of surfactants first, then to elucidate their influences and associated countermeasures on wastewater treatment, and finally to demonstrate their positive impacts on sludge treatment/disposal. The review is proposed to pay attention to the long-term effect of surfactants at a high content due to the pandemic, so as to study future operational measures that could alleviate the negative effects on wastewater treatment and simultaneously utilizes the positive effects on sludge treatment. ? 2021, Science Press.

METHODS Between 2002 and 2011, a total of 398 metastases were ablated in 122 patients (87 male, median age 68 years, range 29-90 years) at 256 procedures. Percutaneous CT-guided cool-tip radiofrequency ablation was performed under sedation/general anesthesia. Maximum tumor size, number of tumors ablated, number of procedures, concurrent/prior liver ablation, previous liver or lung resection, systemic chemotherapy, disease-free interval from primary resection to lung metastasis, and survival from first ablation were recorded prospectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed, and factors were compared by log rank test. RESULTS The initial number of metastases ablated was 2.3 (range 1-8); the total number was 3.3 (range 1-15). The maximum tumor diameter was 1.7 (range 0.5-4) cm, and the number of procedures was 2 (range 1-10). The major complication rate was 3.9 %. Overall median and 3-year survival rate were 41 months and 57 %. Survival was better in patients with smaller tumors-a median of 51 months, with 3-year survival of 64 % for tumors 2 cm or smaller versus 31 months and 44 % for tumors 2.1-4 cm (p = 0.08). The number of metastases ablated and whether the tumors were unilateral or bilateral did not affect survival. The presence of treated liver metastases, systemic chemotherapy, or prior lung resection did not affect survival. CONCLUSION Three-year survival of 57 % in patients with inoperable colorectal lung metastases is better than would be expected with chemotherapy alone. Patients with inoperable but small-volume colorectal lung metastases should be referred for ablation.","output":"Survival after radiofrequency ablation in 122 patients with inoperable colorectal lung metastases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination among medical students worldwide.

OBJECTIVE: To identify factors more likely to lead to vaccine-associated work disruption, employee absenteeism, and future vaccine reluctance among healthcare workers (HCWs). Hypothesis: Side effects related to COVID vaccination: 1- frequently disrupt HCW duties, 2- result in a significant proportion of HCW absenteeism, 3- contribute to uncertainty about future booster vaccination, 4- vary based on certain demographic, socioeconomic, occupational, and vaccine-related factors. METHODS: Using an anonymous, voluntary electronic survey, we obtained responses from a large, heterogeneous sample of COVID-19-vaccinated HCWs in two healthcare systems in Southern California. Descriptive statistics and regression models were utilized to evaluate the research questions. RESULTS: Among 2,103 vaccinated HCWs, 579 (27.5%) reported that vaccine-related symptoms disrupted their professional responsibilities, and 380 (18.1%) missed work as a result. Independent predictors for absenteeism included experiencing generalized and work-disruptive symptoms, and receiving the Moderna vaccine [OR = 1.77 (95% CI = 1.33 C 2.36), p<0.001]. Physicians were less likely to miss work due to side effects (6.7% vs 21.2% for all other HCWs, p<0.001). Independent predictors of reluctance toward future booster vaccination included lower education level, younger age, having received the Moderna vaccine, and missing work due to vaccine-related symptoms. CONCLUSION: Symptoms related to mRNA vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 may frequently disrupt work duties, lead to absenteeism, and impact future vaccine decision-making. This may be more common in Moderna recipients and less likely among physicians. Accordingly, health employers should schedule future booster vaccination cycles to minimize loss of work productivity.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Vaccine-Associated Side Effects on Health Care Worker Absenteeism and Future Booster Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019, Wuhan in Hubal province of China suffered an outbreak in the form of acute respiratory disease-causing severe mortality due to the novel corona virus which was later declared and identified as COVID-19 by World Health Organisation (WHO) in January 2020 By the end of March 2020 more than 160 countries and regions around the world were affected The causative agent of COVID-19, is closely related to SARS-CoVClike bat Corona viruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC2 The whole genome sequencing and systematic analysis showed that this novel Corona virus is a distinct clad from -Corona virus associated with human Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which was officially named SARS-CoV-2 by WHO In January the transmission of the virus breached international borders and first case outside China was seen in Philipines and Thailand and then in USA After that WHO declared it a global public-health emergency in January 30, 2020 and later declared it a pandemic in March 2020 All nations then adopted stringent measures to contain the spread of the disease In India the first cases of COVID 19 positive were reported in the state of Kerala in January 2020 amongst Indiansstudying in China with a history of travel from China The number of cases then increased and as on April 11, 2020 there were 6761 positive COVID-19 cases The major concern to both human and animal health is viral infection of the respiratory tract whichis the most commonly occurring health problem and is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality Commonly seen in children, elderly and immunocompromised patients It is now importantand mandatory to take the stringent preventive and precautionary measure which is the need of the hour like strictly following social distancing, screening of disease, using the protective masks at the public places, Regular hand wash, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by the practitioners, paramedics, health care workers, sanitary people etc to prevent the spread of this dangerous Novel viral infectious disease COVID-19 To curb the disease, following altered social norms along with good sanitization and opting for active treatment using chloroquine or other drugs and prophylaxis using Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) Though its use is yet to provide satisfactory results and to continue on research with the help of researchers to develop vaccines to restrain and combat the dread disease ? 2020","output":"COVID C19: The Novel Corona Virus infectious disease that halted the world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Hypertension is a rather common comorbidity among critically ill patients and hospital mortality might be higher among critically ill patients with hypertension (SBP  140 mmHg and/or DBP  90 mmHg). This study aimed to explore the association between ACEI/ARB medication during ICU stay and all-cause in-hospital mortality in these patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted based on data from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database, which consisted of more than 40,000 patients in ICU between 2008 and 2019 at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Adults diagnosed with hypertension on admission and those had high blood pressure (SBP  140 mmHg and/or DBP  90 mmHg) during ICU stay were included. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Patients were divided into ACEI/ARB treated and non-treated group during ICU stay. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust potential confounders. Nine machine learning models were developed and validated based on 37 clinical and laboratory features of all patients. The model with the best performance was selected based on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) followed by 5-fold cross-validation. After hyperparameter optimization using Grid and random hyperparameter search, a final LightGBM model was developed, and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were calculated to evaluate feature importance of each feature. The features closely associated with hospital mortality were presented as significant features. Results: A total of 15,352 patients were enrolled in this study, among whom 5,193 (33.8%) patients were treated with ACEI/ARB. A significantly lower all-cause in-hospital mortality was observed among patients treated with ACEI/ARB (3.9 vs. 12.7%) as well as a lower 28-day mortality (3.6 vs. 12.2%). The outcome remained consistent after propensity score matching. Among nine machine learning models, the LightGBM model had the highest AUC = 0.9935. The SHAP plot was employed to make the model interpretable based on LightGBM model after hyperparameter optimization, showing that ACEI/ARB use was among the top five significant features, which were associated with hospital mortality. Conclusions: The use of ACEI/ARB in critically ill patients with hypertension during ICU stay is related to lower all-cause in-hospital mortality, which was independently associated with increased survival in a large and heterogeneous cohort of critically ill hypertensive patients with or without kidney dysfunction.","output":"ACEI/ARB Medication During ICU Stay Decrease All-Cause In-hospital Mortality in Critically Ill Patients With Hypertension: A Retrospective Cohort Study Based on Machine Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the reality of 2021's Covid-19 pandemic there are a lot of government's restrictions made to reduce the virus spread speed in the society.

Positive wastewater samples triggered clinical testing of almost all residents within that dorm; thus, SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals were identified regardless of symptom expression. This current study examined clinical testing data to determine the abundance of asymptomatic versus symptomatic cases in these defined communities. Nasal and nasopharyngeal swab samples processed via antigen and PCR tests indicated that 79.2% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were asymptomatic, and only 20.8% of positive cases reported COVID-19 symptoms at the time of testing. Clinical data was paired with corresponding wastewater virus concentrations, which enabled calculation of viral shedding rates in feces per infected person(s).

Little is known about NKT cells which represent a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. METHODS: We characterized peripheral blood T, NK and NKT cells in 45 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (COVID-19 subjects) and 19 healthy donors (HDs). According to the severity of the disease, we stratified COVID-19 subjects into severe and non-severe groups. RESULTS: Compared to HDs, COVID-19 subjects showed higher percentages of NK CD57+ and CD56dim NK cells and lower percentages of NKT and CD56bright cells. In the severe group we found a significantly lower percentage of NKT cells. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, NKT cell was independently associated with the severity of the disease.

Legionella pneumophila (Lp) is the species most frequently responsible for a severe pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease. Lp consists of 15 serogroups (Sgs), usually identified by monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. With regard to Lp serogrouping, it is well known that phenotyping methods do not have a sufficiently high discriminating power, while genotypic methods although very effective, are expensive and laborious. Recently, mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy have proved to be rapid and successful approaches for the microbial identification and typing. Different biomolecules (e.g., lipopolysaccharides) adsorb infrared radiation originating from a specific microbial fingerprint. The development of a classification system based on the intra-species identification features allows a rapid and reliable typing of strains for diagnostic and epidemiological purposes. The aim of the study was the evaluation of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy using the IR Biotyper? system (Bruker Daltonik, Germany) for the identification of Lp at the serogroup (Sg) level for diagnostic purposes as well as in outbreak events. A large dataset of Lp isolates (n = 133) and ATCC reference strains representing the 15 Lp serogroups were included. The discriminatory power of the instrument's classifier, was tested by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). All isolates were classified as follows: 12/133 (9.0%) as Lp Sg1 and 115/133 (86.5%) as Lp Sg 2C15 (including both ATCC and environmental Lp serogroup). Moreover, a mis-classification for 2/133 (1.5%) isolates of Lp Sg 2C15 that returned as Lp Sg1 was observed, and 4/133 (3.0%) isolates were not classified. An accuracy of 95.49% and an error rate of 4.51% were calculated. IR Biotyper? is able provide a quick and cost-effective reliable Lp classification with advantages compared with agglutination tests that show ambiguous and unspecific results. Further studies including a larger number of isolates could be useful to implement the classifier obtaining a robust and reliable tool for the routine Lp serogrouping. IR Biotyper? could be a powerful and easy-to-use tool to identify Lp Sgs, especially during cluster/outbreak investigations, to trace the source of the infection and promptly adopt preventive and control strategies.","output":"Use of Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy With IR Biotyper?

During the evolving coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, given the concerns related to IMT and the increased risk of infections, an urgent need for guidance on the management of IMT in patients with uveitis has emerged. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of international uveitis experts was conducted. An expert steering committee identified clinical questions on the use of IMT in patients with NIU during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using an interactive online questionnaire, guided by background experience and knowledge, 139 global uveitis experts generated consensus statements for IMT. In total, 216 statements were developed around when to initiate, continue, decrease and stop systemic and local corticosteroids, conventional immunosuppressive agents and biologics in patients with NIU. Thirty-one additional questions were added, related to general recommendations, including the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and hydroxychloroquine. RESULTS: Highest consensus was achieved for not initiating IMT in patients who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and for using local over systemic corticosteroid therapy in patients who are at high-risk and very high-risk for severe or fatal COVID-19. While there was a consensus in starting or initiating NSAIDs for the treatment of scleritis in healthy patients, there was no consensus in starting hydroxychloroquine in any risk groups. CONCLUSION: Consensus guidelines were proposed based on global expert opinion and practical experience to bridge the gap between clinical needs and the absence of medical evidence, to guide the treatment of patients with NIU during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Evolving consensus for immunomodulatory therapy in non-infectious uveitis during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An elective procedure is one that is chosen (elected) by the patient or physician that is advantageous to the patient but is not urgent Elective surgery is decided by the patient or their doctor The procedure is seen as beneficial but not absolutely essential at that time Removal of a malignancy, for example, is usually scheduled as semi-elective surgery, to be performed within a set number of days or weeks Urgent surgery is typically performed within 48 hours of diagnosis Emergency surgery is performed as soon as a surgeon is available Many surgeries can be performed as either elective or emergency surgeries, depending on the patient's needs The aim of the study was to assess the awareness of the effects of pandemic outbreak on elective treatment among general population Semi-elective procedures are typically scheduled within a time frame deemed appropriate for the patient's condition and disease Materials and methods: A self structured questionnaire is administered to the participants to know the awareness on the effect of pandemic treatment outbreak on elective treatment Data was collected and statistically analysed using SPSS Based on the assessment we conclude that there is a moderate awareness among people regarding the elective treatment in pandemic outbreak Medical professionals are available to provide treatment for the people who are undergoing elective treatment","output":"Awareness on effects of pandemic outbreak on elective treatment among general population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Passive immunization by oral administration of specific antibodies has been an attractive approach against gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens in both humans and animals. Recently, laying chickens have attracted considerable attention as an alternative source of antibodies for the prevention and treatment of infectious GI diseases. After immunization, the specific antibodies (called IgY) are transported to the egg yolk, from which the IgY then can be separated without sacrificing chickens. A chicken usually lays about 280 eggs in a year, and egg yolk contains 100-150 mg of IgY per yolk, suggesting that more than 40 g of IgY per year can be obtained from each chicken through eggs. IgY is also an alternative to antibiotics for treatment of enteric antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Oral administration of IgY has proved successful for treatment of a variety of GI infections, such as bovine and human rotaviruses, bovine coronavirus, Yersinia ruckeri, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Edwardsiella tarda, Staphylococcus, and Pseudomonas. The IgY technology offers great future opportunities for designing prophylactic strategies against infectious GI diseases in humans and animals. However, there is still controversy regarding the stability of IgY through the GI tract.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional prospective study was conducted in tertiary hospitals in the Uusimaa region, Finland, with 1072 volunteers being enrolled in the study from among the HCWs at the Helsinki University Hospital. Overall, 866 (80.8%) HCWs (including 588 nurses, 170 doctors, and 108 laboratory and medical imaging nurses) completed the questionnaire by July 15, 2020, with 52% of the participants taking care of COVID-19 patients. The participants answered a structured questionnaire regarding their use of PPE, the ability to follow safety guidelines, exposure to COVID-19, and the source of potential COVID-19 infections. The participants with COVID-19 symptoms were tested with the SARS-CoV-2 realtime polymerase chain reaction method. All infected participants were contacted, and their answers were confirmed regarding COVID-19 exposure. RESULTS: In total, 41 (4.7%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with 22 (53.6%) of infections being confirmed or likely occupational, and 12 (29.3%) originating from colleagues. In 14 cases (63.6%), occupational infections occurred while using a surgical mask, and all infections originating from patients occurred while using a surgical mask or no mask at all.

Chronic diseases are one of the most serious health challenges in developing and developed countries. According to WHO, this accounts for 73% of all deaths and 60% of the global burden of diseases. Chronic disease classification models are now harnessing the potential of lifelog data to explore better healthcare practices. This paper is to construct an optimal feature selection-based unsupervised logistic regression model (OFS-ULR) to classify chronic diseases. Since lifelog data analysis is crucial due to its sensitive nature; thus the conventional classification models show limited performance. Therefore, designing new classifiers for the classification of chronic diseases using lifelog data is the need of the age. The vital part of building a good model depends on pre-processing of the dataset, identifying important features, and then training a learning algorithm with suitable hyper parameters for better performance. The proposed approach improves the performance of existing methods using a series of steps such as (i) removing redundant or invalid instances, (ii) making the data labelled using clustering and partitioning the data into classes, (iii) identifying the suitable subset of features by applying either some domain knowledge or selection algorithm, (iv) hyper parameter tuning for models to get best results, and (v) performance evaluation using Spark streaming environment. For this purpose, two-time series datasets are used in the experiment to compute the accuracy, recall, precision, and f1-score. The experimental analysis proves the suitability of the proposed approach as compared to the conventional classifiers and our newly constructed model achieved highest accuracy and reduced training complexity among all among all.","output":"Empirical Analysis of Lifelog Data using Optimal Feature Selection based Unsupervised Logistic Regression (OFS-ULR) Model with Spark Streaming"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cell lines are the mainstay in understanding the biology of COVID-19 infection but do not recapitulate many of the complexities of human infection.

We hypothesized that a cryopreserved bank of human lung tissue would allow for the ex vivo study of the interindividual heterogeneity of host response to SARS-CoV-2, thus providing a bridge between studies with cell lines and studies in animal models. We generated a cryobank of tissues from 21 donors, many of whom had clinical risk factors for severe COVID-19. Cryopreserved tissues preserved 90% cell viability and contained heterogenous populations of metabolically active epithelial, endothelial, and immune cell subsets of the human lung. Samples were readily infected with HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrated comparable susceptibility to infection. In contrast, we observed a marked donor-dependent heterogeneity in the expression of IL6, CXCL8, and IFNB1 in response to SARS-CoV-2. Treatment of tissues with dexamethasone and the experimental drug N-hydroxycytidine suppressed viral growth in all samples, whereas chloroquine and remdesivir had no detectable effect. Metformin and sirolimus, molecules with predicted but unproven antiviral activity, each suppressed viral replication in tissues from a subset of donors.

As patients are usually observed from hospital admission to discharge and drug initiation starts during hospitalization, advanced statistical methods are needed to account for time-dependent drug exposure, confounding and competing events. Our objective is to evaluate the observational studies on the three common methodological pitfalls in time-to-event analyses: immortal time bias, confounding bias and competing risk bias. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search on 23 October 2020, in the PubMed database to identify observational cohort studies that evaluated drug effectiveness in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We included articles published in four journals: British Medical Journal, New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association and The Lancet as well as their sub-journals. RESULTS: Overall, out of 255 articles screened, 11 observational cohort studies on treatment effectiveness with drug exposure-outcome associations were evaluated. All studies were susceptible to one or more types of bias in the primary study analysis. Eight studies had a time-dependent treatment. However, the hazard ratios were not adjusted for immortal time in the primary analysis. Even though confounders presented at baseline have been addressed in nine studies, time-varying confounding caused by time-varying treatment exposure and clinical variables was less recognized. Only one out of 11 studies addressed competing event bias by extending follow-up beyond patient discharge. CONCLUSIONS: In the observational cohort studies on drug effectiveness for treatment of COVID-19 published in four high-impact journals, the methodological biases were concerningly common.

In this prolonged pandemic, nurses and midwives working at the frontline face multiple ethical problems, including their obligation to care for their patients and the risk for infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Despite the frequency of emergencies in Africa, there is a paucity of literature on ethical issues during epidemics. Furthermore, nursing regulatory bodies in African countries such as Kenya have primarily adopted a Western code of ethics that may not reflect the realities of the healthcare systems and cultural context in which nurses and midwives care for patients. In this article, we discuss the tension between nurses' and midwives' duty of care and resource allocation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to clarify nurses' and midwives' rights and responsibilities, especially in the current political setting, limited resources, and ambiguous professional codes of ethics that guide their practice.","output":"Duty versus distributive justice during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: How chronic diseases and lifestyle affect suicidal ideation in the sub-Saharan region remains unclear. We investigated the association of chronic diseases and lifestyle with suicidal ideation in the past year and the potential modifying role of sociodemographic status on this association. The findings can guide suicide prevention interventions. METHODS: We analyzed 3026 respondents from the World Health Organization STEPwise approach to noncommunicable disease risk factor surveillance conducted in Eswatini in 2014. The outcome was past-year suicidal ideation, and the main predictors were chronic diseases and lifestyle. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate predictors, and subgroup analysis was performed to assess effect modification. RESULTS: The prevalence of past-year suicidal ideation was 9.9%. After adjustment for covariates, including sex, marital status, employment status, and education level, individuals aged 18C30 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22C4.22) were more likely to have had past-year suicidal ideation than those aged 45C69 years. After adjustment for covariates among employed individuals, having high blood pressure (aOR: 3.38, 95% CI: 1.54C7.40), not exercising (aOR: 2.65, 95% CI: 1.09C6.39), drinking alcohol (aOR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.14C5.05), being aged 18C30 years (aOR: 3.50, 95% CI: 1.01C12.1), and being exposed to threats (aOR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.01C5.53) were significantly associated with past-year suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS: Among currently employed individuals, having high blood pressure, not exercising, and drinking alcohol were associated with past-year suicidal ideation. The findings highlight the importance of developing and strengthening systems for early identification of suicidal ideation risk.","output":"Association of chronic diseases and lifestyle factors with suicidal ideation among adults aged 18C69 years in Eswatini: evidence from a population-based survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Individuals with obesity are at higher risk of experiencing complications during their pregnancy and may also experience infertility, requiring assisted reproductive technologies (ART) to conceive. The current body of literature demonstrates that bariatric surgery decreases an individual's risk of developing a variety of obesity-related obstetrical conditions during and after pregnancy. However, the effects of bariatric surgery on ART outcomes are not well understood. Therefore, the paucity in the literature warrants a need to determine these effects. METHODS We will search electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), as well as the gray literature and the reference lists of included articles. We will screen all studies published between January 1978 and the present day that explore the impact of bariatric surgery on ART outcomes for women and men. We will include observational studies. Two independent reviewers will assess the studies for inclusion and extract data for each article. The main outcome that will be analyzed is live birth rate. Secondary outcomes such as time to conception, number of rounds of ART, type of bariatric surgery, and length of time between bariatric surgery and initiation of ART will also be recorded. Risk of bias will be conducted using the National Institutes of Health Study Quality Assessment Tools. A random effects model will be used to account for statistical analysis and results will be pooled with forest plots. In the event of statistical and reporting heterogeneity, we will provide a qualitative synthesis and narrative review of the results. DISCUSSION This review will provide information on the outcomes of ART following bariatric surgery and may help healthcare professionals make informed decisions about the length of time between bariatric surgery and initiation of ART. The study findings may be of interest to various stakeholders including patients, bariatric surgeons, obstetricians, and gynecologists, and those who specialize in obesity medicine and reproductive endocrinology and infertility. We plan to disseminate our findings through presentations, publications, and social media releases to individuals who are navigating infertility and are interested in undergoing or have undergone bariatric surgery, healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers.

However, the existing models independently process the 3D lesion segmentation and disease classification, ignoring the inherent correlation between these two tasks. In this paper, we propose a joint deep learning model of 3D lesion segmentation and classification for diagnosing COVID-19, called DeepSC-COVID, as the first attempt in this direction. Specifically, we establish a large-scale CT database containing 1,805 3D CT scans with fine-grained lesion annotations, and reveal 4 findings about lesion difference between COVID-19 and community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Inspired by our findings, DeepSC-COVID is designed with 3 subnets: a cross-task feature subnet for feature extraction, a 3D lesion subnet for lesion segmentation, and a classification subnet for disease diagnosis. Besides, the task-aware loss is proposed for learning the task interaction across the 3D lesion and classification subnets. Different from all existing models for COVID-19 diagnosis, our model is interpretable with fine-grained 3D lesion distribution. Finally, extensive experimental results show that the joint learning framework in our model significantly improves the performance of 3D lesion segmentation and disease classification in both efficiency and efficacy.","output":"Joint learning of 3D lesion segmentation and classification for explainable COVID-19 diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The suspension imposed on Universities due to COVID-19 pandemic impeded students educational opportunities. Alternative teaching modalities have been used. Substitution of dissection courses on cadavers was a great challenge. Present study investigates students view on the efficacy of the online pre-recorded dissection educational videos (DEVs) in assisting anatomy teaching, aiming to modernize the lectures and reinforce comprehension. METHODS: The adequacy of the online anatomy courses and a possible new teaching modality were evaluated by the 2nd year pre-graduate students, employing an online questionnaire. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-six volunteer students participated. Before the pandemic, 78.1% of the students constantly attended the auditorium-based lectures and 73% used self-teaching tools (STTs) for a better understanding of anatomy. During pandemic, a slight lower frequency (76%) attended the online lectures and a higher frequency (84.2%) used at least one STT. Up to 59.2% of the students disagreed with the permanent replacement of the auditorium-based by the online lectures, while 62.8% supported the idea of parallel conduction of the lectures. Combined teaching tools were the most preferred resources. 83.2% of the students stated that the dissection labs cancellation negatively affected their education, and 75.5% supported the permanent addition of the pre-recorded DEV series in the lectures.

The way capital organises production and reproduction combines with structures of oppression, generating vulnerability among the racialised and gendered populations worst impacted by Covid-19. Using global data, this commentary shows that during the pandemic, women experienced relatively greater employment losses, were more likely to work in essential jobs, and experienced a greater reduction in income. Women were also doing more reproductive labour than men and were more likely to drop out of the labour force because of it. Analyses of capitalism in feminist political economy illustrate how capital accumulation depends on women's oppression in multiple, fundamental ways having to do with their paid and unpaid work. Women's work, and by extension their health, is the foundation upon which both production and social reproduction rely.

Neutrophils target invading pathogens through both intracellular and extracellular mechanisms. One of their primary antimicrobial mechanisms is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within phagolysosomes during oxidative burst. ROS production is a marker of the inflammatory/activity state of neutrophils. Although neutrophils are crucial in the defense against microorganisms, recruitment and hyperactivation of neutrophils can also cause collateral damage to the host. Recent studies have shown that neutrophils may be playing a role in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19. We hypothesized that ROS production would be increased secondary to elevated activation of circulating neutrophils in COVID-19 patients and may be playing a role in immunopathology.Methods: Circulating neutrophils were isolated from the blood of 20 human subjects with COVID-19 and 12 healthy controls. Neutrophils at 2x106 cells/ml were incubated with 10M 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) for 20min at 37C. Neutrophils were centrifuged at 500g, resuspended in HBSS-/-, plated at 2x105 in 96-well plates and exposed to 0, 2.5, 25 and 250nM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA;in triplicate). Fluorescence was measured (Infinite M200, TECAN) at 495nm:520nm every 15min for 2hr. ROS production was analyzed using mixed-effects models with Geisser- Greenhouse correction and Sidak's multiple comparisons test.Results: ROS production was increased in neutrophils isolated from the circulation of critically ill COVID-19 patients as compared to healthy controls (2581nm versus 3790nm, respectively, at 120min, p&lt;0.05). Upon stimulation with PMA, ROS production was also increased in COVID-19 patients relative to controls (2.5 PMA: 16597 versus 10549, respectively, &lt;0.001;25 PMA: 20633 versus 11312, respectively, p&lt;0.0001). At the final timepoint, 1.57, 1.82 and 1.85-fold difference in ROS production was noted at 2.5, 25 and 250nM respectively between patient populations. Conclusion: Increased ROS production at baseline and upon stimulation demonstrates that neutrophils in the circulation of critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS have an elevated activation state. These patients are known to have recruitment of neutrophils to the lung parenchyma, where the production and release of ROS may cause collateral damage. Further, neutrophils have been implicated in the vascular and systemic immunopathology of COVID-19, which may be driven by release of these damaging and toxic molecules. Neutrophil-associated pathways may serve as therapeutic targets and quantitative markers of disease in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Neutrophils from the circulation of critically ill COVID-19 patients may promote inflammation via increased production of reactive oxygen species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In early 2020, the world faced a rapid, life-changing, public health crisis in the form of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

To accomplish this, the current study draws from publicly available data using series of analytical techniques to account for underlying trends, seasonality, and temperature while also estimating borough-specific effects. Results indicate that the prevalence of COVID-19 cases, associated social-distancing mandates, and the period of social unrest following Floyd's murder were associated with violence in NYC.

OBJECTIVE: The overall aim of this study is to develop an interactive computer play for children with upper motor neuron lesions to train selective voluntary motor control and give particular attention to motivation and feedback. We also aim to determine features that make games engaging, investigate which sensory feedback modality is noticed the fastest during play, develop an interactive game, and evaluate its feasibility. METHODS: We identified engaging game features by interviewing 19 children and adolescents undergoing rehabilitation. By using a test version of the game, we determined the response times of 10 patients who had to react to visual, auditory, or combined feedback signals. On the basis of the results of these two subprojects, we developed and designed a game environment. Feasibility was studied in terms of the practicability and acceptability of the intervention among 5 children with upper motor neuron lesions. RESULTS: The game features deemed the most important by pediatric patients were strategic gameplay (13/29, 45% of answers) and choice (6/29, 21%). While playing the game, an acoustic alarm signal (reaction time: median 2.8 seconds) was detected significantly faster (P=.01) than conditions with other feedback modalities (avatar velocity reduction: median 7.8 seconds; color desaturation: median 5.7 seconds).

Nevertheless, the use of molecular diagnosis of EV should be investigated in respiratory tract infections (RTI). OBJECTIVES: To perform enterovirus molecular diagnostic tools, PCR and genotyping, in nasal samples for diagnostic and epidemiologic purposes. METHODS: During 2008, 3612 nasal specimen (NS) were studied by IFD and MRC5 culture. Next, we realised successively viral isolation on HuH7 culture (for NS negative by IFD assay) and a duplex PCR enterovirus-rhinovirus for the 816 HuH7 positive supernatants. Furthermore, 327 NS collected from neonates were systematically tested by a real-time RT-PCR. This assay was used in routine for EV diagnosis setting in cerebrospinal fluid. Enterovirus genotyping was then performed for the 68 positive supernatants. RESULTS: Thirty-five NS (0.97%) were positive for EV by culture (MRC5). A combination of both PCR assays, PEVRV and PEV, allowed an additional identification of 41 EV, eight EV-RV and 12 RV, increasing the number of positive to 96 NS (2.6%). Among the neonates, 32 NS (11.3%) were positive for EV by PEV. Of the 98 NS tested by the two PCR assays (PEV and PEVRV), 27 were positive and we detected 10 EV, five EV-RV and 12 RV. From January to December 2008, the circulation of EV showed the usual peak in JuneCJuly when a small outbreak of aseptic meningitis occurred and an additional autumnal peak corresponding to respiratory tract infections. Five main serotypes were isolated: 19 EV68 (29.7%), 12 CB3 (18.7%), nine E3 (14,1%), six CA9 (9.4%) and six CB1 (9.4%); the 19 EV68 were isolated in OctoberCNovember and 17/19 (89.5%) of positive patients were hospitalised for severe respiratory diseases.

OBJECTIVES The objective of this review was to examine recruitment manoeuvres compared to standard care as therapy for adults with acute lung injury in order to quantify the effects on patient outcomes (mortality, length of ventilation, and other relevant outcomes). SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 2); MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2008); EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2008); LILACS (1982 to May 2008); CINAHL (1982 to May 2008); and Current Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com). SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials of adults who were mechanically ventilated comparing recruitment manoeuvres to standard care for those patients diagnosed with ALI or ARDS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. MAIN RESULTS Seven trials met the inclusion criteria for this review (the total number of included participants was 1170). All trials included a recruitment manoeuvre as part of the treatment strategy for patients on mechanical ventilation for ARDS or ALI. However, two of the trials included a package of ventilation that was different from the control ventilation in aspects other than the recruitment manoeuvre. The intervention group showed no significant difference on 28-day mortality (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.17, P = 0.2). Similarly there was no statistical difference for risk of barotrauma (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.07 to 3.52, P = 0.5) or blood pressure (MD 0.9 mm Hg, 95% CI -4.28 to 6.08, P = 0.73).

OBJECTIVE: We determined the association between peripheral immune cell numbers, C-reactive protein (CRP), and prevalent as well as incident PD. METHODS: This study was embedded in the population-based setting of the Rotterdam Study. We repeatedly measured peripheral immune cell numbers (differential leukocyte count and platelet count, granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio [GLR], platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio [PLR], and adapted systemic immune-inflammation index [adapted SII]) and CRP between 1990 and 2016. Participants were continuously followed-up for PD until 2018. We estimated the association of the markers with prevalent and incident PD using logistic regression models and joint models, respectively. Models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, body mass index, and medication use. Odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) are shown per doubling of the marker. RESULTS: A total of 12,642 participants were included in this study. The mean age (standard deviation) was 65.1 (9.8) years and 57.5%were women. Participants with a higher lymphocyte count were less likely to have prevalent PD (adjusted OR: 0.34, 95%CI 0.17C0.68). Participants with a higher GLR, PLR, and adapted SII were more likely to have prevalent PD, but these effects were explained by the lymphocyte count. The peripheral immune cell numbers and CRP were not significantly associated with the risk of incident PD. CONCLUSION: We found participants with a higher lymphocyte count to be less likely to have prevalent PD, but we did not find an association between peripheral immune cell numbers nor CRP and the risk of incident PD.","output":"Peripheral Immune Cell Numbers and C-Reactive Protein in Parkinsons Disease: Results from a Population-Based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For the past century, health care measurement and delivery have been centered in hospitals and clinics.

However, the impact of a decrease in face-to-face contacts on non-physical social contacts of older people remains unclear. In particular, we focus on intergenerational contacts that are especially relevant for older people's mental health. Our analyses rely on an online quota sampling survey conducted in France, Italy and Spain during April 14-24, 2020. We considered the subsample of individuals aged 50 + (N = 4207). We calculated post-stratification weights based on official statistics and used logistic regressions to analyze how changes in intergenerational contacts differed by socioeconomic factors and to what extent non-physical contacts (via phone, social media, etc.) have compensated the reduction in face-to-face contacts. Finally, the change in digital devices' use has been explored as a consequence of both decreased physical intergenerational contacts (PIC) and increased non-physical intergenerational contacts (NPIC). We found that about 50% of older people have increased their NPIC during the first lockdown. Younger individuals, those with medium level of education, and those economically better off displayed higher probabilities of increased NPIC as compared to their counterparts. NPIC increased especially for individuals whose face-to-face contacts decreased, particularly so if this happened with respect to contacts with children. A large share of older people has increased their use of video calls and instant messages, while only some increased the use of social media. These findings are relevant to understand how intergenerational contacts changed during the pandemic and may be central to better plan future outbreak responses.

The subjects were randomly divided in groups of direct relining and indirect relining of the inferior denture ( n = 10). Both groups received the same silicone-based relining. The clinical tests verified the quality of life (Oral Health Impact Profile in edentulous individuals), the satisfaction with the relining, the occlusal force, and halitosis. The tests (halitosis and occlusal force) were performed initially (before the relining), immediately after the relining, and 30, 60, 90, and 180 days after the relining. The questionnaires (quality of life and satisfaction with the relining) were performed initially (before the relining), and 30, 60, 90, and 180 days after the relining. Statistical Analysis Analysis of variance and the Tukey test were used ( p < 0.05). Results There was no statistical difference comparing the two techniques in all the evaluations ( p < 0.05). There was a significant statistical difference for the factor of time in all clinical tests for each relining technique ( p < 0.05). The quality of life and satisfaction with the relining increased significantly 30 days after the relining when compared with the initial time point, for both techniques ( p < 0.05). The occlusal force increased significantly after 90 and 180 days when compared with the initial time point, for both techniques ( p < 0.05). Halitosis decreased significantly immediately after the relining when compared with the initial time point, for both techniques ( p < 0.05).

A series of methods (e.g., RNA\\\\seq, metabolomics, and genetic manipulation) were conducted to reveal the mechanism whereby melatonergic signalling reduces macrophage inflammation.

The effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines on viral replication in both upper and lower airways is important to evaluate in nonhuman primates. METHODS: Nonhuman primates received 10 or 100 g of mRNA-1273, a vaccine encoding the prefusion-stabilized spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, or no vaccine. Antibody and T-cell responses were assessed before upper- and lower-airway challenge with SARS-CoV-2. Active viral replication and viral genomes in bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid and nasal swab specimens were assessed by polymerase chain reaction, and histopathological analysis and viral quantification were performed on lung-tissue specimens. RESULTS: The mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate induced antibody levels exceeding those in human convalescent-phase serum, with live-virus reciprocal 50% inhibitory dilution (ID50) geometric mean titers of 501 in the 10-g dose group and 3481 in the 100-g dose group. Vaccination induced type 1 helper T-cell (Th1)-biased CD4 T-cell responses and low or undetectable Th2 or CD8 T-cell responses. Viral replication was not detectable in BAL fluid by day 2 after challenge in seven of eight animals in both vaccinated groups. No viral replication was detectable in the nose of any of the eight animals in the 100-g dose group by day 2 after challenge, and limited inflammation or detectable viral genome or antigen was noted in lungs of animals in either vaccine group.

Reports of clinical outcomes, cost, and resource utilization differ among inpatient team structures. OBJECTIVE Directly compare outcomes among resident, APC, and solo hospitalist inpatient general medicine teams. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study using multivariable analysis adjusted for time of admission, interhospital transfer, and comorbidities that compares clinical outcomes, cost, and resource utilization. SUBJECTS Patients 18 years or older discharged from an inpatient medicine service between July 2015 and July 2018 (N = 12,716). MAIN MEASURES Length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission, inpatient mortality, normalized total direct cost, discharge time, and consultation utilization. KEY RESULTS Resident teams admitted fewer patients at night (32.0%; P < .001) than did APC (49.5%) and hospitalist (48.6%) teams. APCs received nearly 4% more outside transfer patients (P = .015). Hospitalists discharged patients 26 minutes earlier than did residents (mean hours after midnight [95% CI], 14.58 [14.44-14.72] vs 15.02 [14.97-15.08]). Adjusted consult utilization was 15% higher for APCs (adjusted mean consults per admission [95% CI], 1.00 [0.96-1.03]) and 8% higher for residents (0.93 [0.90-0.95]) than it was for hospitalists (0.85 [0.80-0.90]). No differences in LOS, readmission, mortality, or cost were observed between the teams. CONCLUSION We observed similar costs, LOS, 30-day readmission, and mortality among hospitalist, APC, and resident teams. Our results suggest clinical outcomes are not significantly affected by team structure. The addition of APC or hospitalist teams represent safe and effective alternatives to traditional inpatient resident teams.","output":"Comparison of Resident, Advanced Practice Clinician, and Hospitalist Teams in an Academic Medical Center: Association with Clinical Outcomes and Resource Utilization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: North American communities are severely impacted by the overdose crisis, particularly in British Columbia (BC), which has the highest toxic drug overdose death rate in Canada. Most fatal overdoses in BC occurred among individuals using alone and in private residences. This study aimed to assess prevalence and reasons for using drugs alone among people accessing harm reduction services in BC. METHODS: We recruited harm reduction supply distribution site clients from 22 communities across BC. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression were used to describe factors associated with using alone. Thematic analysis of free-text responses providing reasons for using alone were grouped with survey data and additional themes identified. RESULTS: Overall, 75.8% (n = 314) of the study sample (N = 414) reported using drugs alone within the last week. Those that reported using alone did not differ from those that did not by gender, age, urbanicity, or preferred drug use method. Among those that used alone, 73.2% (n = 230) used opioids, 76.8% (n = 241) used crystal meth, 41.4% (n = 130) used crack/cocaine, and 44.6% (n = 140) used alcohol in the past week. Polysubstance use involving stimulants, opioids, and/or benzodiazepines was reported by 68.5% (n = 215) of those that used alone. Additionally, 22.9% (n = 72) of those that used alone had experienced an opioid and/or stimulant overdose in the past 6 months. In a multivariable logistic regression model, having no regular housing and past week crack/cocaine use were associated with using alone (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.27; 95% CI 1.20C4.27 and AOR: 2.10; 95% CI 1.15C3.82, respectively). The most common reason reported for using alone was convenience and comfort of using alone (44.3%). Additional reasons included: stigma/hiding drug use (14.0%); having no one around (11.7%); safety (9.6%); and not wanting to share drugs with others (8.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Using drugs alone, particularly for convenience and comfort, is ubiquitous among people accessing harm reduction services. Overdose prevention measures that go beyond individual behaviour changes, including providing a safer supply of drugs and eliminating stigma, are paramount to mitigate harms.

It is classified into the well-differentiated, myxoid, round cell, pleomorphic and dedifferentiated types and the commonest is the pleomorphic type. Dedifferentiated liposarcomas are defined by the presence of sharply demarcated regions of non-lipogenic sarcomatous tissue within a well-differentiated tumor.

However, if the information is too complex to interpret and it fails to lead to disambiguation, this can contribute to feelings of panic.","output":"Public Health Communication in Time of Crisis: Readability of On-Line COVID-19 Information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Eventhough the development of vaccine against COVID-19 pandemic is progressing in different part of the world a well-defined treatment plan is not yet developed. Therefore, we investigate the inhibitory activity of a group of dietary bioactive flavonoids against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), which are identified as one of the potential targets in the drug discovery process of COVID-19. After the initial virtual screening of a number of bioactive flavonoids, the binding affinity of three compounds - Naringin, Naringenin and Amentoflavone - at the active site of Mpro was investigated through MD Simulations, MM-PBSA and DFT Binding Energy calculations. From the MD trajectory analysis, Amentoflavone and Naringin showed consistent protein-ligand interactions with the aminoacid residues of the active site domains of Mpro. The excellent inhibitory activity of Amentoflavone and Naringin was established from its MM-PBSA binding energy values of -190.50 and -129.87 kJ/mol respectively. The MET165 residue of Mpro is identified as one of the key residue which contributed significantly to MM-PBSA binding energy through hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, the DFT binding energy values of Amentoflavone (-182.92 kJ/mol) and Naringin (-160.67 kJ/mol) in active site molecular clusters with hydrogen bonds confirmed their potential inhibitory activity. These compounds are of high interest because of their wide availability, low cost, no side effects, and long history of use. We can prevent the severity of this disease for home care patients using these effective dietary supplements.

BACKGROUND Hospital-acquired infection is the commonest complication affecting hospitalised patients. Even though research evidence suggests that hand hygiene and proper glove use are the most important ways to prevent the spread of disease and infection, compliance with both are reported to be unacceptably low. DESIGN An observational study of hospital workers in one acute and two convalescence and rehabilitation hospitals in Hong Kong was conducted. The participating clinical areas included the medical and surgical wards, accident and emergency department and intensive care unit. METHODS Hand hygiene practice and glove use amongst 206 hospital health and support workers, stratified according to years of working experience, were observed. RESULTS The number of observed episodes for hand hygiene was 1037 and for glove use 304. Compliance with hand hygiene was 74.7% and with glove use 72.4%. In approximately two-third of episodes, participants washed their hands after each patient contact; though, 78.5% failed to rub their hands together vigorously for at least 15 seconds. The major break in compliance with glove use was failure to change gloves between procedures on the same patient. In 28.6% of observed glove use episodes, participants did not wear gloves during procedures that exposed them to blood, body fluids, excretion, non-intact skin or mucous membranes. Significant differences in performance scores on antiseptic hand rub were found between the two types of hospital and on glove use between the three groups of work experience:  5, 6-10, >10 years.

It had spread worldwide and was declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic by March 2020. Patients presented with a wide range of symptoms affecting multiple organ systems predominantly the lungs. Severe cases required intensive care unit (ICU) admissions while there were asymptomatic cases as well. Although early detection of the COVID-19 virus by Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is effective, it is not efficient;as there can be false negatives, it is time consuming and expensive. To increase the accuracy of in-vivo detection, radiological image-based methods like a simple chest X-ray (CXR) can be utilized. This reduces the false negatives as compared to solely using the RT-PCR technique. This paper employs various image processing techniques besides extracted texture features from the radiological images and feeds them to different artificial intelligence (AI) scenarios to distinguish between normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases. The best scenario is then adopted to build an automated system that can segment the chest region from the acquired image, enhance the segmented region then extract the texture features, and finally, classify it into one of the three classes. The best overall accuracy achieved is 93.1% by exploiting Ensemble classifier.

The management of overinflation of the endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff at altitude is critical to prevent mucosal injury. METHODS We continuously measured ETT cuff pressures during a Critical Care Air Transport Team training flight to 8,000-ft cabin pressure using four methods of cuff pressure management. ETTs were placed in a tracheal model, and mechanical ventilation was performed. In the control ETT, the cuff was inflated to 20 mm Hg to 22 mm Hg and not manipulated. The manual method used a pressure manometer to adjust pressure at cruising altitude and after landing. A PressureEasy device was connected to the pilot balloon of the third tube and set to a pressure of 20 mm Hg to 22 mm Hg. The final method filled the balloon with 10 mL of saline. Both size 8.0-mm and 7.5-mm ETT were studied during three flights. RESULTS In the control tube, pressure exceeded 70 mm Hg at cruising altitude. Manual management corrected for pressure at altitude but resulted in low cuff pressures upon landing (<10 mm Hg). The PressureEasy reduced the pressure change to a maximum of 36 mm Hg, but on landing, cuff pressures were less than 15 mm Hg. Saline inflation ameliorated cuff pressure changes at altitude, but initial pressures were 40 mm Hg. CONCLUSION None of the three methods using air inflation managed to maintain cuff pressures below those associated with tracheal damage at altitude or above pressures associated with secretion aspiration during descent. Saline inflation minimizes altitude-related alteration in cuff pressure but creates excessive pressures at sea level.

Thus, it is critical to develop and evaluate antiviral compounds that either directly target CoV functions or modulate host functions involved in viral replication. Here, we demonstrate that low-micromolar concentrations of 6,6-difluoro-aristeromycin (DFA), an adenosine nucleoside analogue, strongly inhibit the replication of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in a cell-based infection assay. DFA was designed to target S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase and, consequently, may affect intracellular levels of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine, which is used by two CoV methyltransferases involved in the capping of the 5 end of the viral mRNAs. Passaging of wild-type MERS-CoV in the presence of DFA selected a virus population with a 100-fold decreased DFA sensitivity, which carried various amino acid substitutions in viral nonstructural proteins (nsps). Specifically, mutations were present in the RNA polymerase subunit (nsp12) and in nsp13, the helicase subunit containing a nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase activity that has been implicated in CoV capping. We hypothesize that DFA directly or indirectly affects viral cap methylation, either by inhibiting the viral enzymes involved or by binding to SAH hydrolase. We also evaluated the antiviral activity of DFA against other betacoronaviruses, but found it to have limited impact on their replication, while being quite cytotoxic to the Calu-3 cells used for this comparison. Nevertheless, our results justify the further characterization of DFA derivatives as an inhibitor of MERS-CoV replication. Importance Currently, there is a lack of antiviral drugs with proven efficacy against human CoV infections including the MERS-CoV that is endemic in the Middle East, the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 and potential future zoonotic CoV. This highlights the importance to investigate new drug targets and identify compounds that can be used to inhibit CoV replication. In this study, we characterize the inhibitory effect of DFA on MERS-CoV replication by phenotypic studies, time-of-addition studies, and the generation and genotyping of a DFA-resistant virus population. Our results revealed that DFA needs further improvement to reduce its cytotoxic side-effects and potentially enhance its broad-spectrum activity. Despite this observation, we think that DFA can be used to understand the function and metabolic interactions of the CoV RNA-synthesizing machinery, or as a starting point for the design of new compounds of the same class.","output":"6,6-Difluoro-aristeromycin is a potent inhibitor of MERS-coronavirus replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the absence of a correlate(s) of protection against human tuberculosis and a validated animal model of the disease, tools to facilitate vaccine development must be identified.

However, experimental methods to find protein interactions are inadequate: large scale experiments are noisy, and small scale experiments are slow and expensive. Inspired by the recent successes of deep neural networks, we hypothesize that deep learning methods are well-positioned to aid and augment biological experiments, hoping to help identify more accurate virus-host protein interaction maps. Moreover, computational methods can quickly adapt to predict how virus mutations change protein interactions with the host proteins. We propose DeepVHPPI, a novel deep learning framework combining a self-attention-based transformer architecture and a transfer learning training strategy to predict interactions between human proteins and virus proteins that have novel sequence patterns. We show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly in predicting VirusCHuman protein interactions for SARS-CoV-2, H1N1, and Ebola. In addition, we demonstrate how our framework can be used to predict and interpret the interactions of mutated SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequences.

Clinically useful biomarkers are measurable, improve diagnostic or prognostic performance, and ultimately aid clinicians in determining the initiation, duration, or magnitude of therapy. Areas Covered The purpose of this review is to explore the roles of various blood biomarkers of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and how their use may improve the precision with which clinicians can identify, treat, and ultimately prevent ASCVD. Our review will include lipid biomarkers, markers of cardiac injury and wall stress, markers of inflammation, and a few others. Expert Opinion Several biomarkers have recently been highlighted as \\"risk-enhancing factors\\" in the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline for the Primary Prevention of ASCVD, which can help guide shared decision-making. These included elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein B, or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. However, some other biomarkers mentioned in this review are not commonly used despite showing initial promise as prognostic of ASCVD risk, as it is not clear how treatment decisions should be changed after their measurement among asymptomatic individuals. Future studies should focus on whether biomarker-directed management strategies can improve clinical outcomes.","output":"The Use of Blood Biomarkers in Precision Medicine for the Primary Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease: a Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What tips the SARS/COVID-19 balance into severe pneumonia, rather than recovery?

We used linear mixed-effects regression to examine changes in health climate, safety climate, and worker well-being, prior to the pandemic and at two timepoints during it. We also examined whether employees at organizations that had received a TWH leadership development intervention prior to COVID-19 would better maintain pre-pandemic perceptions of climates and well-being. The final study cohort consisted of 261 employees from 31 organizations. No differences were observed in mean outcome scores between the leadership intervention groups at any of the survey timepoints. We combined intervention groups to examine the difference across timepoints. Perceptions of health and safety climates remained stable across all timepoints. However, employee well-being scores declined between the pre-pandemic period and subsequent COVID-19 timepoints. These findings suggest that while small organizations continued to be viewed as supporting employees health and safety over the course of the pandemic, well-being scores declined, indicating that other factors contributed to decreased well-being.

The wide variance of state laws related to advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) acted as a barrier to mobility during this time. The Consensus Model for APRN Regulation, Licensure, Accreditation, Certification, and Education (Consensus Model) was developed in 2008 to provide a uniform model for APRN regulation. If adopted, the Consensus Model would align state laws related to APRNs and would clear the way for an APRN Compact, which would allow APRNs to practice across state borders. Although some states have completely adopted the Consensus Model's elements in the 13 years since its publication, many have not. Without regulatory uniformity, APRNs cannot efficiently provide care where needed throughout the country or practice to the full extent of their education, leaving some without access to quality care.

The signaling process initiates with the detection of endogenous and/or external danger signals by specific sensors, followed by the nucleation and polymerization from sensor to downstream adaptor and then to the effector, caspase-1. Aberrant activation of inflammasomes promotes autoinflammatory diseases, cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiometabolic disorders. Therefore, an equitable level of regulation is required to maintain the equilibrium between inflammasome activation and inhibition. Recent advancement in the structural and mechanistic understanding of inflammasome assembly potentiates the emergence of novel therapeutics against inflammasome-regulated diseases.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many states relaxed the 1-month dispensing limit restriction in order to align with social distancing recommendations. Yet, some states have not relaxed this limit and have differed substantially regarding the policies that have been implemented. Among states that relaxed the 1-month supply limit, determining which chronic disease drugs qualified for this extension can be challenging for patients and clinicians. As more commercial and Medicare insurance beneficiaries are offered 90-day drug supplies, the 30-day drug supply limit with Medicaid has become a health equity issue, since many individuals insured by Medicaid have already experienced a disproportionate impact from and remain at high risk for severe COVID-19 disease. Thus, we propose policy solutions to ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries have safe and uninterrupted access to chronic disease medications during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: This was an IRB-approved retrospective multicentric study including patients with suspected PE from September to December 2019 (i.e., during a preliminary evaluation period of an approved AI algorithm). CTPA quality and conclusions by emergency radiologists were retrieved from radiological reports. The gold standard was a retrospective review of CTPA, radiological and clinical reports, AI outputs, and patient outcomes. Diagnostic performance metrics for AI and radiologists were assessed in the entire cohort and depending on CTPA quality. RESULTS: Overall, 1202 patients were included (median age: 66.2 years). PE prevalence was 15.8% (190/1202). The AI algorithm detected 219 suspicious PEs, of which 176 were true PEs, including 19 true PEs missed by radiologists. In the cohort, the highest sensitivity and negative predictive values (NPVs) were obtained with AI (92.6% versus 90% and 98.6% versus 98.1%, respectively), while the highest specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) were found with radiologists (99.1% versus 95.8% and 95% versus 80.4%, respectively). Accuracy, specificity, and PPV were significantly higher for radiologists except in subcohorts with poor-to-average injection quality. Radiologists positively evaluated the AI algorithm to improve their diagnostic comfort (55/79 [69.6%]). CONCLUSION: Instead of replacing radiologists, AI for PE detection appears to be a safety net in emergency radiology practice due to high sensitivity and NPV, thereby increasing the self-confidence of radiologists. KEY POINTS: ? Both the AI algorithm and emergency radiologists showed excellent performance in diagnosing PE on CTPA (sensitivity and specificity  90%; accuracy  95%). ? The AI algorithm for PE detection can help increase the sensitivity and NPV of emergency radiologists in clinical practice, especially in cases of poor-to-moderate injection quality. ? Emergency radiologists recommended the use of AI for PE detection in satisfaction surveys to increase their confidence and comfort in their final diagnosis.

Protein GP5 and M have been considered very important to arouse the humoral and cellular immune responses against PRRSV infection and proposed to be the excellent candidate proteins in the design of PRRS bioengineering vaccine. There were some attempts on expressing GP5 or M in DNA vaccine and adenovirus to arouse humoral and cellular immune responses, but few papers have been reported on that the immune response can be difference because of the expression patterns of GP5 and M proteins in the recombinant virus. In this article, four recombinant viruses that expressed GP5 and M proteins of PRRSV in the modified vaccinia virus ankara (MVA) with different expression patterns were made. In these recombinant virus (rMVAs), GP5 and M proteins were expressed in MVA in the same virus but under the control of two promoters (rMVA-GP5/M), or as a fusion protein under one promoter (rMVA-GP5-M), or separately (rMVA-GP5 and rMVA-M). The humoral and cellular immune responses for the four recombinant viruses were evaluated with mouse model. Every mouse was inoculated with 5  10(5) TCID(50) of the different rMVAs and boosted 3 weeks later. Neutralizing antibody titers for each group were detected with virus neutralization test assay weekly after the primary inoculation for 13 weeks to evaluate the humoral immune response. The production of gamma interferon (IFN-), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and interleukin-4 (IL-4) was detected in splenocytes of rMVA-inoculated mice at 30, 60, and 90 days post inoculation to evaluate the cellular immune response. Results showed that rMVA-GP5 and rMVA-M cannot induce obvious humoral and cellular immune responses; rMVA-GP5-M inoculated group developed better immune responses than rMVA-GP5 and rMVA-M inoculated groups; however, mice inoculated with rMVA-GP5/M maintained the strongest cellular response against PRRS and consistently enhanced the anti-PRRSV humoral responses. The strategy of co-expressing PRRSV GP5 and M protein in MVA under the control of different promoters might be an attractive method for future PRRSV vaccine design.","output":"Co-expressing GP5 and M proteins under different promoters in recombinant modified vaccinia virus ankara (rMVA)-based vaccine vector enhanced the humoral and cellular immune responses of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study compares the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and Systemizing Quotient (SQ) scores of elementary school children with and without ADHD.

Therefore, understanding patient experiences and perceptions of healthcare interactions is paramount to quality improvement. This integrative review aimed to explore how patients with chronic conditions experience Interprofessional Collaborative Practice in primary care. METHODS An integrative review was conducted to comprehensively synthesize primary studies that used qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods. Databases searched were Medline, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science on June 1st, 2021. Eligible studies were empirical full-text studies in primary care that reported experiences or perceptions of Interprofessional Collaborative Practice by adult patients with a chronic condition, in any language published in any year. Quality appraisal was conducted on included studies using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool. Data on patients' experiences and perceptions of Interprofessional Collaborative Practice in primary care were extracted, and findings were thematically analyzed through a meta-synthesis. RESULTS Forty-eight (n = 48) studies met the inclusion criteria with a total of n = 3803 participants. Study quality of individual studies was limited by study design, incomplete reporting, and the potential for positive publication bias. Three themes and their sub-themes were developed inductively: (1) Interacting with Healthcare Teams, subthemes: widening the network, connecting with professionals, looking beyond the condition, and overcoming chronic condition collectively; (2) Valuing Convenient Healthcare, subthemes: sharing space and time, care planning creates structure, coordinating care, valuing the general practitioner role, and affording healthcare; (3) Engaging Self-care, subthemes: engaging passively is circumstantial, and, engaging actively and leading care. CONCLUSIONS Patients overwhelmingly had positive experiences of Interprofessional Collaborative Practice, signaling it is appropriate for chronic condition management in primary care.

We reviewed 11 cases in 11 patients of extramedullary mass-forming malignant tumours composed of immature non-lymphoid haematopoietic cells expressing CD41 with or without concurrent bone marrow lesions. The patients consisted of seven men and four women (1.75:1 male-to-female ratio). The mean and median ages at diagnosis were 50 and 62 years, respectively, ranging from 2 to 78 years. Extramedullary mass lesions were solitary in three cases (27%) and multiple in eight cases (73%). Tumour locations were lymph nodes (6 cases), subcutaneous tissue (3 cases), intramuscular (1 case), and bone (1 case). Seven of the 11 patients (64%) had a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Three patients (27%) developed MS during remissions of acute myelogenous leukaemia, and one patient had a recurrence of MS at other sites. Follow-up data were available for four cases.

METHODS PERN has grown from five to eight member networks over the past decade. With an executive committee comprising representatives from all member networks, PERN plays a supportive and collaborative rather than governing role. The full impact of PERN's facilitation of international collaborative research, although somewhat difficult to quantify empirically, can be measured indirectly by the observed growth of the field, the nature of the increasingly challenging research questions now being addressed and the collective capacity to generate and implement new knowledge in treating acutely ill and injured children. RESULTS Beginning as a pandemic response studying H1N1 influenza risk factors in children, PERN research has progressed to multiple observational studies and ongoing global randomised controlled trials (RCTs). As a recent example, PERN has developed sufficient network infrastructure to enable the rapid initiation of a prospective observational study in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Following its success with developing global research, the PERN goal now is to promote the implementation of scientific advances into everyday clinical practice by: (i) expanding the capacity for global RCTs; (ii) deepening the focus on implementation science; (iii) increasing attention to healthcare disparities; and (iv) expanding PERN's reach into resource-restricted regions.

RESULTS: A total of 341,499 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified on the research network: 930 (0.27%) with CD and 340,569 (99.73%) without CD. In the 30- and 60-day periods post SARS-CoV-2 infection, 12 (1.29%) and 13 (1.40%) deaths, respectively, were reported in the CD group. Fewer patients in the CD group reached the composite outcome of either mechanical ventilation or mortality at 60 days (risk ratio 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.36-0.95). After propensity matching, no difference in clinical outcomes was observed. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that patients with CD are not at increased risk of COVID-19-related morbidity or mortality.","output":"Outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with celiac disease: a multicenter research network study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Concern over Ebola becoming endemic in West Africa has appeared in the medical and lay media.

Our goal was to assess mental health symptoms and social risks during COVID-19, compared to before the pandemic, for urban, racial and ethnic minority school-age children, and investigate the relationship between mental health and social risks. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study from September 2019 until January 2021 of children age 5C11 years old recruited from an urban safety net hospital-based pediatric primary care practice. We measured emotional and behavioral symptoms (including attention, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms) before and during the pandemic with the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-17). We measured social risks (including food and housing insecurity) before and during the pandemic with the THRIVE screener. We measured additional mid-pandemic COVID-related stressors with items on school participation, screens/media use, illness exposure, and caregiver mental health. We compared pre- and mid-pandemic PSC-17 symptom scores across 4 domains (total, attention, internalizing, and externalizing) and used path analysis to examine the relationship between mental health and social risks pre- and mid-pandemic. RESULTS: Caregivers of 168 children (54% non-Hispanic Black, 29% Hispanic, and 22% non-English speaking) completed the study. Children had significantly higher levels of emotional and behavioral symptoms midpandemic- vs. pre-pandemic in all domains. Significantly more children had a positive PSC-17 total score (18% vs. 8%, p < 0.01) and internalizing (depression and anxiety) score (18% vs. 5%, p < 0.001) during the pandemic vs. before, indicating clinical concerns in these areas. Caregivers reported significantly more social risks during vs. before the pandemic (p < 0.001). Mental health symptoms significantly correlated with number of social risks before the pandemic, but not during the pandemic. Less school assignment completion, increased screen time, and caregiver depression were all significantly associated with worse mid-pandemic mental health in children. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic increase in depression/anxiety problems and social risks among urban, racial and ethnic minority school-age children compared to before the pandemic. More research is needed to understand if these changes will persist.

The main outcomes were the comparisons of the severe infection rates and fatality rates in COVID-19 patients with and without AKI and the estimation of the odds ratio (OR) and its 95 % confidence interval (CI) for severe infection and mortality. Statistical analyses were performed with R statistical software. A total of 40 studies involving 24,527 patients with COVID-19 were included in our meta-analysis. The incidence of AKI was 10 % (95 % CI 8%-13 %) in COVID-19 patients. The patients had higher severe infection and fatality rates (55.6 % vs. 17.7 % and 63.1 % vs. 12.9 %, respectively, all P < 0.01) with COVID-19.

In ophthalmology, AI has delivered robust results in the screening and detection of diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and retinopathy of prematurity. Cataract management is another field that can benefit from greater AI application. Cataract is the leading cause of reversible visual impairment with a rising global clinical burden. Improved diagnosis, monitoring, and surgical management are necessary to address this challenge. In addition, patients in large developing countries often suffer from limited access to tertiary care, a problem further exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. AI on the other hand, can help transform cataract management by improving automation, efficacy and overcoming geographical barriers. First, AI can be applied as a telediagnostic platform to screen and diagnose patients with cataract using slit-lamp and fundus photographs. This utilizes a deep-learning, convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect and classify referable cataracts appropriately. Second, some of the latest intraocular lens formulas have used AI to enhance prediction accuracy, achieving superior postoperative refractive results compared to traditional formulas. Third, AI can be used to augment cataract surgical skill training by identifying different phases of cataract surgery on video and to optimize operating theater workflows by accurately predicting the duration of surgical procedures. Fourth, some AI CNN models are able to effectively predict the progression of posterior capsule opacification and eventual need for YAG laser capsulotomy. These advances in AI could transform cataract management and enable delivery of efficient ophthalmic services.

EmbR-PknH pair controls embC/A/B operon, which encodes EmbC/A/B genes, and EMB interacts with EmbA/B proteins. However, the EmbR binding site on PknH was unknown. We conducted molecular simulation on the EmbRC peptides binding structures and discovered phosphorylated PknH 273C280 (N-HEALS(P)DPD-C) makes  strand with the EmbR FHA domain, as -MoRF (MoRF; molecular recognition feature) does at its binding site. Hydrogen bond number analysis also supported the peptides' -MoRF forming activity at the EmbR FHA domain. Also, we discovered that previously known phosphorylation residues might have their chronological order according to the phosphorylation status. The discovery validated that Mtb PknH 273C280 (N-HEALSDPD-C) has reliable EmbR binding affinity. This approach is revolutionary in the computer-aided drug discovery field, because it is the first trial to discover the protein-protein interaction site, and find binding partner in nature from this site.","output":"Computational prediction and validation of specific EmbR binding site on PknH"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nutritional status is associated with lung function and plays a critical role in the management of the pediatric patient with COVID-19 who depends on ventilatory support An inadequate nutritional status, such as;malnutrition, can severely impairs lung function, so providing an adequate nutritional support;enteral or parenteral, is of utmost importance to improve prognosis and lung function in pediatric patients Nutritional support aims to complete the nutrients requirement and to modulate the pulmonary inflammatory response also must take into account the points of;detecting nurturing and monitoring in order to carry out the nutritional care process The objective of this work is to describe guidelines of the nutritional management in pediatric patients with COVID-19","output":"Nutrition therapy in children with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Libertarian ideas of self\\\\ownership and the priority of bodily autonomy have featured prominently in the political debate over vaccination programmes and the justifiability or otherwise of restricting the liberty of the unvaccinated.

Hospitals as health service facilities continuously strive to provide optimal service to patients with the confirmed COVID-19 infection. Resident doctors usually handle COVID-19 patients at the Zainoel Abidin Hospital (ZAH). As the front liner in handling the COVID-19 pandemic, these resident doctors must have adequate knowledge and good attitudes in dealing with COVID-19 patients, especially regarding ethical and medicolegal. Aim: This study aims at finding out the level of knowledge and attitudes of resident doctors in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic at the ZAH, Aceh. Methods: This was a cross sectional study conducted among resident doctors (n=80) in the ZAH during November-December 2020 with a self-administered online questionnaire. It had been tested for validity by experts with a Content Validity Ratio / CVR of 0.738 and reliability of 0.732. The data were analyzed using the frequency distribution test (univariate) and the Chi square correlation test (bivariate). Results and Discussion: The results show that the majority of respondents had inadequate knowledge of ethical and medicolegal issues in handling the COVID-19 pandemic (70.0%);however, they had a positive attitude in overcoming ethical and medicolegal issues, i.e.77.5%. The chi square statistical test result shows no correlation between knowledge and attitude with a p-value of 0.077 (p-value >0.05). Conclusions: Therefore, it can be concluded that the theoretical knowledge of doctors was not sufficient to identify ethical and medicolegal issues, but the attitude in dealing with ethical and medicolegal issues was satisfactory. This result offers a new opportunity and challenge to increase the awareness of doctors in applying their knowledge and attitudes towards handling the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Knowledge and Attitudes regarding Ethical and Medicolegal Issues in Handling the Covid-19 Pandemic among Resident Doctors at Zainoel Abidin Hospital, Aceh, Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The need to prepare veterinarians to serve as part of the disaster medical response for mass casualty incidents has been recognized since at least the 1960's. The potential value of incorporating veterinarians for mass casualty disaster response has been noted by organizations throughout the world. Clinical veterinarians are highly trained medical professionals with access to equipment, medications, and treatment capabilities that can be leveraged in times of crisis. The ongoing threat of disasters with the current widespread healthcare access barriers requires the disaster management community to address the ethical constraints, training deficiencies and legal limitations for veterinary medical response to mass casualty disasters. An ethical imperative exists for veterinarians with translatable clinical skills to provide care to humans in the event of a mass casualty disaster with insufficient alternative traditional medical resources. Though this imperative exists, there is no established training mechanism to prepare veterinarians for the provision of emergency medical care to humans. In addition, the lack of clear guidance regarding what legal protections exist for voluntary responders persists as a barrier to rapid and effective response of veterinarians to mass casualty disasters. Measures need to be undertaken at all levels of government to address and remove the barriers. Failure to do so reduces potentially available medical resources available to an already strained medical system during mass casualty events.","output":"The Role of Veterinarians in Mass Casualty Disasters: A Continuing Need for Integration to Disaster Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to review 4 weeks of universal novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) screening among delivery hospitalizations, at two hospitals in March and April 2020 in New York City, to compare outcomes between patients based on COVID-19 status and to determine whether demographic risk factors and symptoms predicted screening positive for COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study evaluated all patients admitted for delivery from March 22 to April 18, 2020, at two New York City hospitals. Obstetrical and neonatal outcomes were collected. The relationship between COVID-19 and demographic, clinical, and maternal and neonatal outcome data was evaluated. Demographic data included the number of COVID-19 cases ascertained by ZIP code of residence. Adjusted logistic regression models were performed to determine predictability of demographic risk factors for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 454 women delivered, 79 (17%) had COVID-19. Of those, 27.9% (n = 22) had symptoms such as cough (13.9%), fever (10.1%), chest pain (5.1%), and myalgia (5.1%). While women with COVID-19 were more likely to live in the ZIP codes quartile with the most cases (47 vs. 41%) and less likely to live in the ZIP code quartile with the fewest cases (6 vs. 14%), these comparisons were not statistically significant (p = 0.18). Women with COVID-19 were less likely to have a vaginal delivery (55.2 vs. 51.9%, p = 0.04) and had a significantly longer postpartum length of stay with cesarean (2.00 vs. 2.67days, p < 0.01). COVID-19 was associated with higher risk for diagnoses of chorioamnionitis and pneumonia and fevers without a focal diagnosis. In adjusted analyses, including demographic factors, logistic regression demonstrated a c-statistic of 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69, 0.80). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 symptoms were present in a minority of COVID-19-positive women admitted for delivery. Significant differences in obstetrical outcomes were found. While demographic risk factors demonstrated acceptable discrimination, risk prediction does not capture a significant portion of COVID-19-positive patients. KEY POINTS:  COVID-19 symptoms were present in a minority of COVID-19-positive women admitted..  COVID-19 symptomatology did not appear to differ before or after the apex of infection in New York..

Our objective was to test the performance of such MRI-derived collateral flow indices for prediction of recanalization after endovascular thrombectomy. METHODS Fifty-seven patients with MCA-M1 occlusion evaluated with multimodal MRI prior to thrombectomy were included. Bayesian processing allowed quantification of collateral perfusion indices like the volume of tissue with severely prolonged arterial-tissue delay (>6 s) (VolATD6). Baseline DWI lesion volume was also measured. Correlations with angiographic collateral flow grading and post-thrombectomy recanalization were assessed. RESULTS VolATD6 < 27 ml or DWI lesion volume <15 ml provide the most accurate diagnosis of excellent collateral supply (p < 0.0001). The combination of VolATD6 > 27 ml and DWI lesion volume >15 ml significantly discriminates recanalizers versus nonrecanalizers (whole cohort, p = 0.032; MERCI cohort (n = 50), p = 0.024). When both criteria are positive, 76.2 % of the patients treated with the MERCI retriever do not fully recanalize (p = 0.024). In multivariate analysis, the aforementioned combined criterion and the angiographic collateral grade are the only independent predictors of recanalization with the MERCI retriever (p = 0.015 and 0.029, respectively). CONCLUSION Bayesian arterial-tissue delay maps and DWI maps provide a non-invasive assessment of the degree of collateral flow and a combined index that is predictive of MCA-M1 recanalization after endovascular thrombectomy.

Methods A retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the TriNetX Research Network database was performed. Patients undergoing CABG between January 20, 2019, and September 15, 2019, contributed to the 2019 cohort, and those undergoing CABG between January 20, 2020, and September 15, 2020, contributed to the 2020 cohort. Propensity-score matching was performed, and the odds of mortality, acute kidney injury (AKI), stroke, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and mechanical ventilation occurring by 30-days were evaluated. Results The number of patients undergoing CABG in 2020 declined by 35.5% from 5,534 patients in 2019 to 3,569 patients in 2020. After propensity-score matching, 3,569 patient pairs were identified in the 2019 and the 2020 cohorts. Compared with those undergoing CABG in 2019, the odds of mortality by 30-days were 0.96 (95%CI:0.69-1.33;p=0.80) in those undergoing CABG in 2020. The odds for stroke (OR:1.21 [95%CI:0.96-1.39]), AKI (OR: 0.76 [95%CI:0.59-1.08]), ARDS (OR:1.01 [95%CI:0.60-2.42]) and mechanical ventilation (OR: 1.11 [95% CI: 0.94-1.30]) were similar between the two cohorts.

Knowing how physician-educators find their way among different communities of practice (i.e., their landscape of practice) has implications for professional development but limited description in the literature. In this longitudinal qualitative research, we explored how physicians who pursue graduate degrees in medical education navigate their landscape of practice. METHODS 11/29 physicians in one cohort of a masters in medical education program were interviewed annually from 2016 (program start) to 2020 (2 years post-graduation). We iteratively collected and analyzed data, creating inductive codes and categorizing coded data by mode of identification (engagement, imagination, alignment) and time. We organized narratives into time-ordered data matrices so that final analysis wove together mode, time, and participant. RESULTS All participants consistently spoke of navigating their landscape of practice, which included the community created in the graduate program; but that single community \\"doesn't define the journey itself.\\" They shifted engagement from teaching individual learners to translating what they learned in the graduate program to develop educational projects and produce scholarship.

We discovered that up-regulated and down-regulated proteins were organized into two predominant subnetworks that exhibited distinct biological processes. The down-regulated network modules are involved in typical mitochondrial functions, while up-regulated proteins are responsible for mtDNA repair and regulation of mt protein expression and transport. Furthermore, comparisons of proteome and transcriptome data revealed that (0) cells attempted to compensate for mtDNA depletion by modulating the coordinated expression/transport of mt proteins.

The integrity and positioning of the previous EVAR endograft was risked by transfemoral access. The right subclavian artery was only 4.5 mm and the left subclavian was totally occluded so transcarotid access was chosen. The patient recovered well, with no neurological deficit and was discharged home after 72 h. He was last seen and was doing well 6 months post-procedure. DISCUSSION: In patients with severe aortoiliac disease, or previous aortic endografting, transfemoral access for TAVI can be challenging or even prohibitive. Alternative access sites such as transapical or transaortic are associated with added risk because they carry increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, longer intensive care unit and hospital stay, and increased cost. A transcaval approach for TAVI has also been reported but was not suitable for our patient due to prior EVAR. Concomitant TAVI via transcarotid access and CEA can be successful in experienced hands. This case highlights the importance of a team-based approach to complex TAVI cases in high-risk patients with complex vascular access.","output":"A case report of a transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve implantation with concomitant carotid endarterectomy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: An excessive immune response during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can induce cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is associated with life-threatening complications and disease progression. Methods: This study was aimed to investigate the differences and similarities between CRS induced by COVID-19 and CAR-T therapy, then provide valuable experiences for early identification and controlling CRS progression in COVID-19. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical characteristics of severe CRS (sCRS, grade 3-4) induced by COVID-19 (40 patients) or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy as a comparator (41 patients). Results: Grade 4 CRS was significantly more common in the COVID-19 group (15/40 [35.7%] vs. 5/41 [12.2%], P=0.008). CAR-T group had more more dramatic increase in cytokine than COVID-19 group (Figure1), including IL-2 (7.3pg/mL [IQR: 2.0-12.7] vs.1.7 [0.7-2.7], P<0.001), IL-6 (7120.6 pg/mL [1066.8-15 136.4] vs. 110.3 [41.7-728.1], P<0.001), IL-10 (174.5pg/mL [61.7, 434.6] vs. 10.1 [6.3-20.6], P<0.001) and IFN- (1308.5pg/mL [296.6, 3108.2] vs .35.0 [16.9-60.8], P<0.001). Interestingly, COVID-19 group had significantly higher levels for TNF- (31.1 pg/ml [16.1-70.0] vs. 3.3 [1.8-9.6], P<0.001).The correlations between viral load/ tumor burden and various cytokine levels were shown in Figure 2. Lg viral loads were correlated with lg IL-6 (R2=0.101; P<0.001) and lg IL-10 (R2=0.105; P<0.001) .In CAR-T group, LDH was a common indicator related to tumor burden among patients with ALL, NHL, and MM. The lg LDH concentration was correlated with the lg serum concentration of IL-6 (R2=0.161; P=0.01). The independent risk factors for COVID-19-related sCRS were hypertension history (OR: 7.167, 95% CI: 2.345-21.903; P=0.001) and minimum platelets <100109 /L during disease course (OR: 9.237, 95% CI: 2.544-33.546; P=0.001). Conclusion:Our study demonstrated that there were similar processes but different intensity of inflammatory responses of sCRS in COVID-19 and CAR-T group.

Fatal outcomes in patients with these characteristics are due to a dysfunctional immune response. Understanding COVID-19's immunopathogenesis helps in designing strategies to prevent and mitigate complications during treatment. OBJECTIVE: Describe the main immunopathogenic alterations of COVID-19 in patients of advanced age or with chronic non-communicable diseases. DATA ACQUISITION: We carried out a bibliographic search of primary references in PubMed, Elsevier, Science Direct and SciELO. A total of 270 articles met our initial search criteria. Duplicate articles or those unrelated to at least one chronic comorbidity, senescence or inflammation and those that studied only patient clinical characteristics, laboratory tests or treatments were excluded. Finally, our selection included 124 articles for analysis: 10 meta-analyses, 24 original research articles, 67 review articles, 9 editorials, 9 comments, 3 books and 2 websites. DEVELOPMENT: Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are the most common comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. Risk of developing severe manifestations of the disease, including death, is increased in senescent and obese patients and those with cardiovascular disease, cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Low-grade chronic inflammation is characteristic of all these conditions, reflected in a pro-inflammatory state, endothelial dysfunction, and changes to innate immunity; mainly of the monocyte-macrophage system with changes in polarization, inflammation, cytotoxicity and altered antigenic presentation. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, mechanisms involved in acute inflammation overlap with the patient's pro-inflammatory state, causing immune system dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2 infection amplifies already-existing alterations, causing failures in the immune system's control mechanisms. The resulting cytokine storm causes an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response marked by high serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers and a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile with decompensation of underlying diseases. In asthma, chronic eosinophilic inflammation protects against infection by producing a reduced interferon-mediated response and a reduced number of ACE2 receptors. CONCLUSIONS: Low-grade chronic inflammation present in advanced age and chronic diseases-but not in bronchial asthma-produces a pro-inflammatory state that triggers a dysregulated immune response, favoring development of severe forms of COVID-19 and increasing lethality.","output":"Implications of Low-grade Inflammation in SARS-CoV-2 Immunopathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Influenza vaccination coverages among health care students are low. The aim of this study was to find out which measures, according to medical and nursing students, could contribute to improve these vaccination rates. METHODS: A cross-sectional study that included medical and nursing students of the University of Zaragoza who were doing internships in health centers during the 2020-2021 school year. The information was obtained in December 2020 by a self-administered online questionnaire, in which they were asked to describe the measures that, in their opinion, are necessary to increase their influenza vaccination coverage. A qualitative analysis of the content of the answers was carried out, extracting themes, sub-themes and selecting the most representative verbatims. RESULTS: The questionnaire was answered by 83 students (response rate: 5.9%);64 (77.1%) were women, and 74.7% of them were studying medicine. The main measures proposed were improving the accessibility of the vaccine, improving the training on influenza vaccine, promoting vaccination by the teaching staff, and increasing the diffusion of information about the vaccination campaign. CONCLUSIONS: This study has found measures to be applied specifically to medical and nursing students to potentially improve their influenza vaccination coverage.

Its findings reveal participants' disappointment with the top-down, predetermined nature of the curriculum, which makes it inadequate for situations such as the Covid-19 pandemic. The curriculum was perceived as being highly rigid, with little room for alternative modalities. Participants believed the curriculum could not support children's learning in normal times, much less during a pandemic. Therefore, this article suggests a complete revamping of the curriculum and strengthening of teachers' capabilities. It also suggests curricular material be updated to make it context specific, responsive to the needs of learners, and supportive of independent learning.","output":"Exploring the need for a responsive school curriculum to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic in Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed a paradox in historical models of medical education: organizations responsible for applying consistent standards for progression have needed to adapt to training environments marked by inconsistency and change. Although some institutions have maintained their traditional requirements, others have accelerated their programs to rush nearly graduated trainees to the front lines. One interpretation of the unplanned shortening of the duration of training programs during a crisis is that standards have been lowered. But it is also possible that these trainees were examined according to the same standards as usual and were judged to have already met them. This paper discusses the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the current workforce, provides an analysis of how competency-based medical education (CBME) in the context of the pandemic might have mitigated wide-scale disruption, and identifies structural barriers to achieving an ideal state. The paper further calls upon universities, health centres, governments, certifying bodies, regulatory authorities, and health care professionals to work collectively on a truly time-variable model of CBME. The pandemic has made clear that time variability in medical education already exists and should be adopted widely and formally. If our systems today had used a framework of outcome competencies, sequenced progression, tailored learning, focused instruction, and programmatic assessment, we may have been even more nimble in changing our systems to care for our patients with COVID-19.","output":"If we could turn back time: Imagining time-variable, competency-based medical education in the context of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Neurosurgery is one of the youngest and rapidly evolving surgical disciplines After adequate training, residents graduate with the capability to practice across different settings such as academic centers, community hospitals, and others We present the effect of COVID 19 pandemic on the surgical case volume in a US training program METHODS We retrospectively reviewed operative case volume at our program for the year 2019 and January-mid April 2020 We chose to include the mid-March to mid-April period as it corresponded to the time when our institution started deferring elective cases We categorized cases as an elective cranial, elective spine, and emergency (trauma and other non-elective cases) We then summarized and compared the number of cases during this period RESULTS The average number of cases in 2019 was 99 cases per month (37 elective cranial, 42 elective spine, and 20 emergent) In 2020, The total case number in January, February, March, and mid-March to mid-April was 97, 86, 71, and 41cases respectively In comparison to January 2020, February, March, mid-March to mid-April showed a 12%, 27%, and 58% reduction in the number of cases The absolute number of emergent cases was comparable in January through mid-April 2020 (17,11,15, and 16) but in mid-March to mid-April emergent cases constituted 39% of the total case number CONCLUSION Neurosurgical residency is an eighty-four months of rigorous training with a minimum of 800 cases is required to prepare residents for a successful career in neurosurgery The significant decline in the number of cases due to COVID 19 might affect the quality of training, especially for senior residents","output":"The Effects of COVID 19 Pandemic on Neurosurgical Training in The United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ideas surrounding risk, especially as it relates to health behaviors, contribute substantially to our understandings of health and wellbeing.

The phenomenon has been implicated in critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus implicated in COVID-19. Critically ill COVID-19 patients experiencing cytokine storm are believed to have a worse prognosis and increased fatality rate. In SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, cytokine storm appears important to the pathogenesis of several severe manifestations of COVID-19: acute respiratory distress syndrome, thromboembolic diseases such as acute ischemic strokes caused by large vessel occlusion and myocardial infarction, encephalitis, acute kidney injury, and vasculitis (Kawasaki-like syndrome in children and renal vasculitis in adult). Understanding the pathogenesis of cytokine storm will help unravel not only risk factors for the condition but also therapeutic strategies to modulate the immune response and deliver improved outcomes in COVID-19 patients at high risk for severe disease. In this article, we present an overview of the cytokine storm and its implications in COVID-19 settings and identify potential pathways or biomarkers that could be targeted for therapy.

This project was implemented at these two comparable general medicine units, totaling 64 beds. On each of these units, Pareto analyses on causal factors related to discharge order to exit time (DOTE) were performed. DOTE was defined as the period in minutes from when a provider orders a discharge to when the patient actually exits a room. Prime DOTE reduction opportunities were elicited that highlighted the need to address coordination of hospital discharge transportation; that is, arriving family members averaged 120 and 129 min for the two units, and medicars and ambulances averaged 122 and 156 min, which fell above the established 90-min overall strategic DOTE goal. Coordinating efficient discharges decreases the likelihood of hospital bottlenecking and improves patient satisfaction. CASE MANAGEMENT SETTING The health care team is composed of physician and provider services, nursing, and case management, as well as the patient and family. Team-focused interventions aimed at reducing DOTE included leveraging interdisciplinary communication technology and messaging for efficiency and accuracy within the health care team and proactive scheduling of hospital discharge transportation arrival. Process objectives measured included percentage of the health care team educated and utilization of the discharge suite. Outcome objectives measured included median DOTE times, patient satisfaction, and emergency department boarding volume and times. Significantly, admissions for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases were also rapidly increasing early on during program implementation resulting in one of the two general medicine units to be designated for COVID-19 overflow. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY Using Lean methodology, the project design was formed based on the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's work on improving hospital-wide patient flow and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) IDEAL patient discharge framework to better achieve the well-known, triple aim. In response to COVID-19 demands, the Plan-Do-Study-Act process was warranted to be able to manage acute changes, using iterative processing. RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS This program evaluation study assessed whether a communication training program that taught an interdisciplinary team of case managers, nurses, physicians, and related staff how to reduce DOTE was useful. The program had a material impact on the DOTE metric knowing that the hospital's ultimate strategic goal is to reduce DOTE to 90 min or less. A reduction in discharge time was documented when using weekly data from the hospital's discharge dashboard powered by the Maestro database. More specifically, nurses fully trained in the interdisciplinary communications program aimed to reduce DOTE had significantly lower DOTE outcomes on their discharges compared with untrained staff (i.e., average untrained = 127 min, average trained = 93 min). In addition, the fully trained nurses had 14% more of their discharges fall at or below the 90-min goal compared with untrained staff (i.e., untrained = 40%, trained = 54%). Supplemental research also suggested that the content of the communication training program was very relevant (e.g., empowering families to pick up the patients and using scheduling vs. will-call transportation strategies with patients lowered the DOTE metric). Corollary analyses showed that readmissions were also lowered, and patient satisfaction ratings increased. In addition, the interdisciplinary communications training program can benefit from being updated to include content on how COVID-19 issues adversely impact discharge times since significant relationships between various COVID-19 measures and higher discharge exit times were documented.","output":"Influencing Discharge Efficiency: Addressing Interdisciplinary Communication, Transportation, and COVID-19 as Barriers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe potential roles of affective responses to environmental stressors in individuals physical and mental health are complex and multi-faceted.

MethodsFrom late March to early June (2020), a cross-sectional study was conducted using an anonymous online questionnaire included demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related stressors related to individuals daily functioning, and the self-assessed impact of protective and adverse internal factors on emotions. Results1,662 questionnaires were received from residents in 32 Chinese provinces classified by prevalence level according to COVID-19 infections. Among the 17 positive and negative emotional responses, agglomerative hierarchical clustering revealed four subclassifications: (1) stress relations; (2) missing someone relations; (3) individual relations; and (4) social relations. Additionally, heightened regional prevalence levels positively corresponded to intensity of stress relations. Lowest intensity of social relations was found in the areas surrounding Wuhan and coastal areas. Specially, economic- and work-related stressors as well as negative self-perceptions (e.g., suppression, emotionally unstable, self-denial) implicated in negative emotions. While positive emotions were tied to demographic characteristics (e.g., high education, young age and male) and protective traits (e.g., creativity, sympathy, social responsibility), and inversely linked to relationships- and pandemic-related stressors, etc. ConclusionAssociations were clearly noted among Chinese residents emotions to specific stressors during pandemic.

APPROACH Maniilaq Association, a rural and remote tribal health organization in Northwest Alaska, partnered with Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School to address health care needs through physician staffing, training, and quality improvement initiatives. This partnership, called Siamit, falls under tribal governance, focuses on supporting community health leaders, addresses challenges shaped by extreme geographic remoteness, and advances the mission of academic medicine in the context of tribal health priorities. OUTCOMES Throughout the 2019-2020 academic year, Siamit augmented local physician staffing, mentored health professions trainees, provided continuing medical education courses, implemented quality improvement initiatives, and provided clinical care and operational support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Siamit began with a small budget and limited human resources, demonstrating that relatively small investments in academic-tribal health partnerships can support meaningful and positive outcomes. NEXT STEPS During the 2020-2021 academic year, the authors plan to expand Siamit's efforts with a broader social medicine curriculum, additional attending staff, more frequent trainee rotations, an increasingly robust mentorship network for Indigenous health professions trainees, and further study of the impact of these efforts. Such partnerships may be replicable in other settings, and represent a significant opportunity to advance community health priorities, strengthen tribal health systems, support the next generation of Indigenous health leaders, and carry out the academic medicine mission of teaching, research, and service.","output":"Siamit: A Novel Academic-Tribal Health Partnership in Northwest Alaska."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the last decade, targeted genome-editing technologies, especially clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR/Cas) technologies, have permitted efficient targeting of genomes, thereby modifying these genomes to offer tremendous opportunities for deciphering gene function and engineering beneficial traits in many biological systems.

The M2 protein of influenza A is a proton-gated, proton-selective ion channel, which is essential for influenza replication and an established antiviral target. However, all currently circulating influenza A virus strains are now resistant to licensed M2-targeting adamantane drugs, primarily due to the widespread prevalence of an M2 variant encoding a serine to asparagine 31 mutation (S31N). To identify new chemical leads that may target M2(S31N), we performed a virtual screen of molecules from two natural product libraries and identified chebulagic acid as a candidate M2(S31N) inhibitor and influenza antiviral. Chebulagic acid selectively restores growth of M2(S31N)-expressing yeast. Molecular modeling also suggests that chebulagic acid hydrolysis fragments preferentially interact with the highly-conserved histidine residue within the pore of M2(S31N) but not adamantane-sensitive M2(S31). In contrast, chebulagic acid inhibits in vitro influenza A replication regardless of M2 sequence, suggesting that it also acts on other influenza targets. Taken together, results implicate chebulagic acid and/or its hydrolysis fragments as new chemical leads for M2(S31N) and influenza-directed antiviral development.","output":"Virtual Screening Identifies Chebulagic Acid as an Inhibitor of the M2(S31N) Viral Ion Channel and Influenza A Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Midregional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) is a vasoactive peptide with key roles in reducing vascular hyperpermeability and thereby improving endothelial stability during infection. While MR-proADM is useful for risk stratification in patients with sepsis, clinical data about prediction accuracy in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19) is currently missing. Methods We included consecutively adult patients hospitalized for confirmed COVID-19 at a tertiary care center in Switzerland between February and April 2020. We investigated the association of MR-proADM levels with in-hospital mortality in logistic regression and discrimination analyses. Results Of 89 included COVID-19 patients, 19% (n=17) died while in the hospital. Median admission MR-proADM levels (nmol/L) were increased almost 1.5-fold increased in non-survivors compared to survivors (1.3 [interquartile range IQR 1.1-2.3]) vs. 0.8 [IQR 0.7-1.1]) and showed good discrimination (area under the curve 0.78). An increase of 1 nmol/L of admission MR-proADM was independently associated with a more than fivefold increase in in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio of 5.5, 95% confidence interval 1.4-21.4, p=0.015). An admission MR-proADM threshold of 0.93 nmol/L showed the best prognostic accuracy for in-hospital mortality with a sensitivity of 93%, a specificity of 60% and a negative predictive value of 97%. Kinetics of follow-up MR-proADM provided further prognostic information for in-hospital treatment. Conclusions Increased levels of MR-proADM on admission and during hospital stay were independently associated with in-hospital mortality and may allow a better risk stratification, and particularly rule-out of fatal outcome, in COVID-19 patients.","output":"The vasoactive peptide MR-pro-adrenomedullin in COVID-19 patients: an observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND This study aimed to compare single-port transumbilical total laparoscopic hysterectomy (SPLS-TLH) and four-port total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) in terms of postoperative pain.

We demonstrate herein the first case, to our knowledge, of pure transanal NOTES colorectal surgery. DESIGN Case report. SETTING University hospital. PATIENT The patient was a 56-year-old woman with a midrectal neoplasia. INTERVENTION Pure transanal NOTES total mesorectal excision with a coloanal anastomosis and without a diverting stoma. Using a transanal endoscopic operation device as a surgical platform, we created a viscerotomy distal to an endoluminal purse-string suture. We performed a total mesorectal excision using a bottom-up approach. The sigmoid colon was mobilized by a posterior, retroperitoneal approach and the colon was divided intraperitoneally. A hand-sewn, side-to-end, coloanal anastomosis was performed. Because the viscerotomy was incorporated into the anastomosis, the concerns of both accidental organ damage and viscerotomy closure were abrogated. RESULTS The procedure was completed entirely by a transanal fashion. We successfully mobilized the rectum, mesorectum, and sigmoid colon. The specimen length was more than 20 cm. The patient required minimal analgesia and her pain was nonabdominal.

METHODS: This prospective observational study enrolled 1825 water polo athletes from 54 high schools and 36 colleges. Surveys were sent to coaches throughout the season, and survey data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: We identified 17 COVID-19 cases among 1223 high school water polo athletes (1.4%) and 66 cases among 602 college athletes (11.0%). Of these cases, contact tracing suggested that three were water poloCassociated in high school, and none were water poloCassociated in college. Quarantine data suggest low transmission during water polo play as only three out of 232 (1.3%) high school athletes quarantined for a water poloCrelated exposure developed COVID-19. In college, none of the 54 athletes quarantined for exposure with an infected opponent contracted COVID-19. However, in both high school and college, despite the physical condition of water polo athletes, both high school (47%) and college athletes (21%) had prolonged return to play after contracting COVID-19, indicating the danger of COVID-19, even to athletes.

LVT is typically seen 3-12 days following AMI and is seldom seen within the first 24 hours. LVT increases the risk of mortality due to systemic thromboembolism. Patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) are potentially hypercoagulable and this may promote early development of LVT. CASE: A 50-year-old man with no past medical history was admitted with a severe diabetic ketoacidosis following a 4-day history of cough and fever. The patient tested positive for COVID-19 and required intensive care treatment for ventilation and haemofiltration. After returning to ward-based care, the patient developed chest pain and electrocadiographic changes consistent with an acute anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Emergency percutaneous coronary intervention was performed to the left anterior descending artery. However, the patient developed diuretic-resistant pulmonary oedema and a bedside echocardiogram revealed significant LVT despite only 4 hours of chest pain. The thrombus was associated with the anteroseptal wall of the left ventricle which was hypokinetic but not aneurysmal. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was inserted, but the patient developed ipsilateral lower limb ischaemia due to the formation of thrombus in the femoral artery and irreversible cardiogenic shock from which he ultimately succumbed. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-positive patients are potentially hypercoagulable, and MI in this population may precipitate LVT earlier than expected. Consideration should be made for routine early screening of post-MI COVID-19 patients for LVT.

De-etiolation has been extensively studied in maize (Zea mays L). However, little is known about how this transition is regulated. In this study, we describe a quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic atlas of the de-etiolation process in maize. We identified 16,420 proteins and quantified 14,168. In addition, 8746 phosphorylation sites within 3110 proteins were identified. From the proteomic and phosphoproteomic data combined, we identified a total of 17,436 proteins, 27.6% of which are annotated protein coding genes in the Zea_mays AGPv3.28 database. Only 7% of proteins significantly changed in abundance during de-etiolation. In contrast, the phosphorylation levels of more than 26% of phosphoproteins significantly changed; these included proteins involved in gene expression and homeostatic pathways and rate-limiting enzymes involved in photosynthesis light and carbon reactions. Based on phosphoproteomic analysis, 34% (1057) of all phosphoproteins identified in this study contained more than three phosphorylation sites, and 37 proteins contained more than 16 phosphorylation sites, which shows that multi-phosphorylation is ubiquitous during the de-etiolation process. Our results suggest that plants might preferentially regulate the level of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) rather than protein abundance for adapting to changing environments.

Early and accurate diagnosis and treatment of IA remain challenging. Given the broad range of non-specific clinical symptoms and the shortcomings of current diagnostic techniques, most patients are either diagnosed as possible or probable cases but not proven. Moreover, because of the lack of sensitive and specific tests, many high-risk patients receive an empirical therapy or a prolonged treatment of high-priced antifungal agents, leading to unnecessary adverse effects and a high risk of drug resistance. More precise diagnostic techniques alongside a targeted antifungal treatment are fundamental requirements for reducing the morbidity and mortality of IA. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with high specificity in targeting the corresponding antigen(s) may have the potential to improve diagnostic tests and form the basis for novel IA treatments.

AIM: The purpose of this study was to explore student perceptions and acceptance of the advantages and disadvantages of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyze the factors that influence these perceptions. METHODS: The research is in the form of a survey using Google forms about the perception and acceptance of online lectures during the COVID-19 pandemic for nursing students at universities in Indonesia, a questionnaire sent through WhatsApp and held from July 1, 2021 to July 30, 2021. RESULTS: The many of respondents aged 17C19 years (50%) with Diploma-students (62.9%). The most of them have intermediate-level skills in using information technology (82.2%). The platform that is often used is Zoom meeting. The advantages of online learning are that students state that they can study from home (22.2%) and easily access online sources of material (19.9%) and can obtain recordings of each lesson (18.6%). Constraints that are often faced are technical problems (24.6%), very minimal interaction with lecturers (18.4%), and very minimal interaction between students (17.5%). Age and skills in using technology, information and communication have a significant effect on students perceptions of online learning (p < 0.05). Most respondents have a negative perception (52.2%) about online learning. CONCLUSION: Although there are several advantages to online learning, students perceptions of the learning process are negative, meaning that they are happier and still want face-to-face learning.","output":"Nursing Students Perceptions and Acceptance of Online Learning during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spatial diffusion of the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak has resulted in the total economic disruption of the Tourism Supply Chain (TSC) causing a significant reduction in revenue and creating liquidity issues for all operators Firms in TSC are linked to each other in complex patterns, leading one risk to another The purpose of this article is to understand the role of relationship management between hotel chains and their key TSC agents in order to overcome economic disruptions caused by epidemic outbreaks Among the main contributions of this article are the identification of governments, tour operators, and competitors as the key relationships to be managed by hospitality firms In addition, key areas for coordination with these actors are explored Finally, the objectives of relationship management according to the partner are also addressed","output":"Managing relationships in the Tourism Supply Chain to overcome epidemic outbreaks: The case of COVID-19 and the hospitality industry in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The major Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused tens of thousands of diagnosed patients quarantined and treated in designated hospitals in Wuhan, the epicenter of the disease in China.

In this paper, we analyze some 17,000 publicly listed firms in a sample of 24 countries, and assess their ability to withstand shocks induced by the pandemic to their liquidity, viability and solvency. For this purpose, we develop novel multi-factor sensitivity analysis and dynamic scenario-based stress test techniques to assess the impact of shocks on firms ability to service their debt, and on their liquidity and solvency positions. Applying the October 2020 WEO baseline and adverse scenarios, we find that a large share of publicly-listed firms become vulnerable as a result of the pandemic shock and additional borrowing needs to overcome cash shortfalls are large, while firm behavioral responses and policies substantially help overcome the impact of the shock in the near term. Looking forward, while interest coverage ratios tend to improve over time after the initial shock as earnings recover in line with projected macroeconomic conditions, liquidity needs remain substantial in many firms across countries and across industries, while insolvencies rise over time in specific industries. To inform policy debates, we offer an approach to a triage between viable and unviable firms, and find that the needs for liquidity support of viable firms remain important beyond 2020, and that medium-term debt restructuring needs and liquidations of firms may be substantial in the medium-term.

DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study designed to evaluate the association between body mass index and risk of severe disease in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Data were abstracted from the electronic health record. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death. SETTING: Two hospitals in Massachusetts (one quaternary referral center and one affiliated community hospital). PATIENTS: Consecutive patients hospitalized with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 admitted between March 13, 2020, and April 3, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 305 patients were included in this study. We stratified patients by body mass index category: < 25 kg/m (54 patients, 18%), &#8805; 25 kg/m to < 30 kg/m (124 patients, 41%), &#8805; 30 kg/m to < 35 kg/m (58 patients, 19%), and &#8805; 35 kg/m (69 patients, 23%). In total, 128 patients (42%) had a primary endpoint (119 patients [39%] were intubated and nine died [3%] without intubation). Sixty-five patients (51%) with body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m were intubated or died. Adjusted Cox models demonstrated that body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m was associated with a 2.3-fold increased risk of intubation or death (95% CI, 1.2-4.3) compared with individuals with body mass index less than 25 kg/m. Diabetes was also independently associated with risk of intubation or death (hazard ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.7). Fifty-six out of 127 patients (44%) with body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m had diabetes, and the combination of both diabetes and body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m was associated with a 4.5-fold increased risk of intubation or death (95% CI, 2.0-10.2) compared with patients without diabetes and body mass index less than 25 kg/m.

In recent years, the study related to occupancy and its impact on building energy consumption has gained momentum and is also promoted by ASHRAE as it has created a multi-disciplinary group to encourage a comprehensive study of occupant behaviour in buildings. Past studies suggest that building systems do not consume the same energy and provide similar Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) to their designed specifications due to inaccurate assumptions of occupants and their behaviour. Supplying ASHRAE specified minimum required ventilation based on accurate occupancy may lead to significant air-conditioning energy savings. However, the same strategy is not suitable in the current time since minimum required ventilation may not be sufficient to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread in confined spaces. High-temperature cooling augmented with elevated air movement across an acceptable range of velocity can maintain the health and comfort of occupants by providing higher ventilation and without an energy penalty.

The goal of this survey was to assess the impact of the pandemic on global LT practices. METHOD: A prospective web-based survey (available online from 7(th) September 2020 to 31(st) December 2020) was proposed to the active members of the EASL-ESOT/ELITA-ILTS in the Americas (including North, Central, and South America) (R1), Europe (R2), and the rest of the world (R3). The survey comprised four parts concerning the transplant processes, therapy, living donor, and organ procurement. RESULTS: Of the 470 transplant centers reached, 128 answered each part of the survey, 29 centers (23%), 64 centers (50%), and 35 centers (27%) from R1, R2, and R3, respectively. When we compared the practices during the first six months of the pandemic in 2020 with that a year earlier in 2019, statistically significant differences were found in the number of patients added to the waiting list (WL), the number of WL mortality, and the number of transplantations. At the regional level, we found that in R2 the number of LTs was significantly higher in 2019 (p < 0.01), while R3 had more patients listed, higher WL mortality, and more LTs performed before the pandemic. Countries severely affected by the pandemic (hit countries) had a lower number of WL patients (p = 0.009) and LT (p = 0.002) during the pandemic. Interestingly, WL mortality was higher in the pandemic in non-hit countries (p = 0.022) compared to 2019. CONCLUSION: The first wave of the pandemic differentially impacted LT across the world, especially with detrimental effects on the hit countries. The modifications in the policies for recipient and donor selection, organ retrieval, and postoperative recipient management were adopted at a regional or national level. LAY SUMMARY: The health emergency caused by the Coronavirus has dramatically changed clinical practice during the pandemic. The first wave of pandemic impacted Liver Transplantation across the world differently, especially with detrimental effects on the hit countries. The resilience of the entire transplant network has enabled the support of organ donations and transplants to ultimately improve the lives of patients with end-stage liver disease.","output":"Global impact of the first wave of COVID-19 on liver transplant centers: A multi-society survey (EASL-ESOT/ELITA-ILTS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although COVID-19 causes cardiac dysfunction in up to 25% of patients, its pathogenesis remains unclear. Exposure of human iPSC-derived heart cells to SARS-CoV-2 revealed productive infection and robust transcriptomic and morphological signatures of damage, particularly in cardiomyocytes. Transcriptomic disruption of structural proteins corroborated adverse morphologic features, which included a distinct pattern of myofibrillar fragmentation and numerous iPSC-cardiomyocytes lacking nuclear DNA. Human autopsy specimens from COVID-19 patients displayed similar sarcomeric disruption, as well as cardiomyocytes without DNA staining. These striking cytopathic features provide new insights into SARS-CoV-2 induced cardiac damage, offer a platform for discovery of potential therapeutics, and raise serious concerns about the long-term consequences of COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection of human iPSC-derived cardiac cells predicts novel cytopathic features in hearts of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Sotrovimab is a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by binding to a highly conserved epitope in the receptor binding domain. It retains activity against the Omicron BA.1 variant and is used to treat immunocompromised patients as they are at increased risk for a severe outcome of COVID-19. Methods: We studied viral evolution in 47 immunocompromised patients infected with Omicron BA.1 or 2 and treated with sotrovimab. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was performed at baseline and weekly thereafter until Ct-value was [] 30. All RNA samples were sequenced to determine the variant and occurrence of mutations, in particular in the Spike protein, after treatment. Results: Twenty-four (51%) of the 47 patients were male and their median age was 63 years. Thirty-one (66%) had undergone a solid organ transplantation and 13 (28%) had received prior B-cell depleting therapy. Despite a history of vaccination, 24 of 30 patients with available data on anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG Spike antibodies prior to treatment with sotrovimab had very low or no antibodies. Median time to viral clearance (Ct-value [] 30) after treatment was 15 days (IQR 7-22). However, viral RNA with low Ct-values was continuously detected for at least 28 days after treatment in four patients infected with BA.1. Mutations in the Spike protein at position 337 or 340 were observed in all four patients. Similar mutations were also found after treatment of two patients with a BA.2 infection but both cleared the virus within two weeks. Thus following treatment with sotrovimab, spike mutations associated with reduced in vitro susceptibility were detected in 6 of 47 (13%) patients. Conclusion: Viral evolution towards resistance against sotrovimab can explain treatment failure in most immunocompromised patients and these patients can remain infectious after treatment. Therefore, documenting viral clearance after treatment is recommended to avoid that these patients unintentionally become a source of new, sotrovimab resistant, variants. Research on direct acting antivirals and possibly combination therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients is needed.","output":"High incidence of sotrovimab resistance and viral persistence after treatment of immunocompromised patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With South Africa in its third week of a COVID-19 lockdown that will last at least through April, scientists advising the government gave a preview of the next phase of the response in a televised address on Monday evening They offered a glimpse at the science behind the decision-making, Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize said during the briefingand a road map for reopening the country South Africa detected its first novel coronavirus infection on 5 March For the next few weeks, the epidemic followed an exponential curve similar to those in the United Kingdom, the United States, and many other countries On 15 March, the countrys president, Cyril Ramaphosa, declared a national state of emergency banning visitors from high-risk countries, stopping large gatherings, closing more than half of its land borders, and shutting schools On 27 March the country started a 21-day lockdown, closing all borders and confining everyone except those performing essential services to their homes except to buy groceries and medicine or to collect welfare payments","output":"South Africa flattens its coronavirus curveand considers how to ease restrictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In past two decades, the globe has faced many infectious disease outbreaks. 2019 Novel Corona-virus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome Corona-virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as a global risk and put the entire globe into unrest.

This study examined whether sociodemographic disparities in hospitalization and clinical outcomes changed between two temporal waves of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of primary care patients at Mass General Brigham (a large northeastern health system serving 1.27 million primary care patients) hospitalized in-system with COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and March 1, 2021, categorized into two 6-month wave periods. We used chi-square tests to compare demographics between waves, and regression analysis to characterize the association of race/ethnicity and language with in-hospital severe outcomes (death, hospice discharge, intensive unit care need). RESULTS: Hispanic/Latino, Black, and non-English-speaking patients constituted 30.3%, 12.5%, and 29.7% of COVID-19 admissions in wave 1 (N = 5844) and 22.2%, 9.0%, and 22.7% in wave 2 (N = 4007), compared to 2019 general admission proportions of 8.8%, 6.3%, and 7.7%, respectively. Admissions from highly socially vulnerable census tracts decreased between waves. Non-English speakers had significantly higher odds of severe illness during wave 1 (OR 1.35; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.66) compared to English speakers; this association was non-significant during wave 2 (OR 1.01; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.36). CONCLUSIONS: Comparing two COVID-19 temporal waves, significant sociodemographic disparities in COVID-19 admissions improved between waves but continued to persist over a year, demonstrating the need for ongoing interventions to truly close equity gaps.

This study seeks to assess knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) as well as training needs and preferences related to COVID-19 among frontline HCWs in Nigeria. SETTING: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 1852 HCWs in primary, secondary and tertiary care settings across Nigeria using a 33-item questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS: Respondents included doctors, nurses, pharmacy and clinical laboratory professionals who have direct clinical contact with patients at the various healthcare settings. ANALYSIS: Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to establish independent factors related to COVID-19 KAP. Analysis of variance was used to identify any differences in the factors among different categories of HCWs. RESULTS: EFA identified four factors: safety and prevention (factor 1), practice and knowledge (factor 2), control and mitigation (factor 3) and national perceptions (factor 4). Significant group differences were found on three factors: Factor 1 (F(1,1655)=5.79, p=0.0006), factor 3 (F(1,1633)=12.9, p<0.0.0001) and factor 4 (F(1,1655)=7.31, p<0.0001) with doctors scoring higher on these three factors when compared with nurses, pharmaceutical workers and medical laboratory scientist. The most endorsed training need was how to reorganise the workplace to prevent spread of COVID-19. This was chosen by 61.8% of medical laboratory professionals, 55.6% of doctors, 51.7% of nurses and 51.6% of pharmaceutical health workers.

COVID-19 is highly contagious and can be spread by symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals. As such, determining the risk of infection within a community is difficult. To mitigate the risk of the spread of COVID-19, the government of Malaysia implemented seven phases of the movement control order (MCO) from 18 March to 31 December 2020. However, the socioeconomic cost was substantial despite the effectiveness of the MCO in bringing down cases of infection.

This excessive sedentary behaviour and lack of physical activity (PA) is potentially detrimental to the health of GPs, as well as their ability to counsel patients regarding sedentary behaviour and PA. There is a lack of prior research examining the perspectives of GPs regarding their sedentary behaviour and PA. AIM To explore GPs' perspectives regarding their sedentary behaviour and PA.

Fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common complication of RA. Whether MTX exposure increases the risk of ILD in patients with RA is disputed. We aimed to evaluate the association of prior MTX use with development of RA-ILD. METHODS Through a case-control study design with discovery and international replication samples, we examined the association of MTX exposure with ILD in 410 patients with chronic fibrotic ILD associated with RA (RA-ILD) and 673 patients with RA without ILD. Estimates were pooled over the different samples using meta-analysis techniques. RESULTS Analysis of the discovery sample revealed an inverse relationship between MTX exposure and RA-ILD (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.90; p=0.022), which was confirmed in the replication samples (pooled adjusted OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.19-0.79; p=0.009). The combined estimate using both the derivation and validation samples revealed an adjusted OR of 0.43 (95% CI, 0.26-0.69; p=0.0006). MTX ever users were less frequent among patients with RA-ILD compared to those without ILD, irrespective of chest high resolution computed tomography pattern. In patients with RA-ILD, ILD detection was significantly delayed in MTX ever users compared to never users (11.410.4 years and 4.07.4 years, respectively; p<0.001).

However, inconsistencies in frameworks across different jurisdictions remain, and bridging gaps between competency frameworks and clinical practice has proved challenging. Entrustable professional activities have been proposed as a solution but integration of such activities into busy clinical cardiology practices will present its own challenges.

Differentiation between superficial and deep learning, the vital role of rich formative feedback and coaching, should guide our trainees to become self-regulated learners, capable of critical reasoning yet retaining an awareness of uncertainty and ambiguity. Furthermore, disruptive innovations such as 'technology enhanced learning' may be leveraged to improve education, especially for trainees from low- and middle-income countries.

METHODS: A random anonymous telephone survey interviewed 450 Chinese adults from September 16-30, 2020 in Hong Kong, China. Nine scenarios of behavioral intentions of COVID-19 vaccinations were measured combining effectiveness (80% versus 50%), safety (rare versus common mild side effect), and cost (free versus HK$ 500). RESULTS: The prevalence of behavioral intentions of COVID-19 vaccination under the 9 specific scenarios was very low and varied greatly (4.2% to 38.0%). The prospective countries of manufacture also influenced vaccination intention (eg, Japan: 55.8% vs China: 31.1%).

This study aimed to investigate clinical characteristics and outcomes of CLD confirmed in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: A total of 104 cases (each group containing 52 patients) were analyzed in this study. The CLD group showed an average of 14 (10.0~21.2) length of stay (LOS) days, compared to the group without CLD that only showed an average of 12.5 (10~16) LOS days (Relative Risk [RR] = 1.34, 95% CI (1.22~1.48), P<0.001; Adjusted Relative Risk was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.12~1.39)). The CLD group contained a higher mortality rate and slight liver injury. Furthermore, COX regression model analyses suggested that the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was an independent predictor of mortality risk (P < 0.001) in the CLD group. Additionally, a high NLR significantly correlated with a shorter overall survival (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients also diagnosed with CLD suffered longer LOS, slight liver injuries and a higher mortality when compared to COVID-19 patients without CLD. The NLR was an independent risk factor for in-hospital deaths. Increased expression of NLR was an indicator of poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients with CLD.

As many real-world complex systems can be modeled as multilayer networks, the question of identifying important nodes in multilayer network has attracted much attention. Existing studies focus on the multilayer network structure, while neglecting how the structural and dynamical coupling of multiple layers influence the dynamical importance of nodes in the network. Here we investigate on this question in an information-disease coupled spreading dynamics on multiplex networks. Firstly, we explicitly reveal that three interlayer coupling factors, which are the two-layer relative spreading speed, the interlayer coupling strength and the two-layer degree correlation, significantly impact the spreading influence of a node on the contact layer. The suppression effect from the information layer makes the structural centrality on the contact layer fail to predict the spreading influence of nodes in the multiplex network. Then by mapping the coevolving spreading dynamics into percolation process and using the message-passing approach, we propose a method to calculate the size of the disease outbreaks from a single seed node, which can be used to estimate the nodes' spreading influence in the coevolving dynamics.

The different public and private sectors have suffered from the consequent disruption, leading to numerous cases of work discontinuity. The pandemic experience is an example of a national crisis where sustaining work and duties comprise a serious challenge, but it has also introduced the concept of remote and hybrid working. This paper explores sustaining work continuity through hybrid work environments by analyzing the different challenges and threats that would lead to work discontinuities, including culture, technology, geography, focusing on the public sector experience in the Kingdom of Bahrain. It mainly questions the efficiency and quality of services provided by public sector institutions during the pandemic in addition to employees' satisfaction with the continuity of remote work as a permanent alternative to the traditional ways of in-person attendance. In order to deduce feasible and pragmatic solutions, the adopted methodology integrates two approaches to analyze data, which substantially relies on the Institute of Public Administration in Bahrain (BIPA) and other academic resources. First, the collected data is analyzed through the Design Thinking approach, and then the addressed problems and possible solutions are validated through two Delphi Protocol rounds. In terms of building hybrid environments, a model has been adopted based on looking into employee and customer satisfaction by extracting a number of indicators related to the sustainability of work continuity. The paper concludes with recommendations that would improve work continuity during and after crises through hybrid work systems and policies that would assure smooth work performance and effective internal and external communication. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Sustaining Work Continuity through Hybrid Work Environments: Tracking Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bats are the suggested natural hosts for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the causal agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, SARS-CoV-2.

We specifically examine the role of asymmetry in Parkinsons disease, Alzheimers disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, and interrogate whether these imbalances may reveal meaningful clues about the origins of these diseases. We also propose several hypotheses for how lateralization may contribute to the distinctive and enigmatic features of asymmetry in neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting a role for asymmetry in the choroid plexus, neurochemistry, protein distribution, brain connectivity and the vagus nerve.

Inspired by the design principles proposed by the late Nobel Prize Elinor Ostrom, here we study the evolution and impact of a new form of institutional sanctioning, where punishment is graduated, growing with the incidence of free-riding. We develop an analytical model capable of identifying the conditions under which this design principle is conducive to the self-organization of stable institutions and cooperation. We employ evolutionary game theory in finite populations and non-linear public goods dilemmas in the presence of risk of global losses whose solution requires the self-organization of decision makers into an overall cooperative state. We show that graduated punishment is more effective in promoting widespread cooperation than conventional forms of punishment studied to date, being also less severe and thus, presumably, easier to implement. This effect is enhanced whenever the costs of its implementation are positively correlated with the severity of punishment.

Here, we characterized the cytokine/chemokine expression profiles of immunocompetent patients complicated with ARDS during HAdV infection and identified biomarkers for disease severity/progression. Forty-eight cytokines/chemokines in the plasma samples from 19 HAdV-infected immunocompetent adolescent and adult patients (ten complicated with ARDS) were measured and analyzed in combination with clinical indices. Immunocompetent patients with ARDS caused by severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, 2009 pandemic H1N1 (panH1N1) or bacteria were included for comparative analyses. Similar indices of disease course/progression were found in immunocompetent patients with ARDS caused by HAdV, SARS-CoV-2 or panH1N infections, whereas the HAdV-infected group showed a higher prevalence of viremia, as well as increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK). Expression levels of 33 cytokines/chemokines were increased significantly in HAdV-infected patients with ARDS compared with that in healthy controls, and many of them were also significantly higher than those in SARS-CoV-2-infected and panH1N1-infected patients.

The SASP can be amplified by infection-related pathogen-associated molecular profile factors. Senolytic agents, such as Fisetin, selectively eliminate SnCs and delay, prevent, or alleviate multiple disorders in aged experimental animals and animal models of human chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and respiratory diseases.

PS instillation therapy is dramatically effective for infant respiratory distress syndrome but has been clinically ineffective for ARDS. Nowadays, ARDS is regarded as non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema with vascular hyper-permeability regardless of direct relation to PS dysfunction. However, there is a possibility that this ineffectiveness of PS instillation for ARDS is caused by insufficient delivery. Then, we performed PS instillation simulation with realistic human airway models by the use of computational fluid dynamics, and investigated how instilled PS would move in the liquid layer covering the airway wall and reach to alveolar regions. METHODS: Two types of 3D human airway models were prepared: one was from the trachea to the lobular bronchi and the other was from a subsegmental bronchus to respiratory bronchioles. The thickness of the liquid layer covering the airway was assigned as 14 % of the inner radius of the airway segment. The liquid layer was assumed to be replaced by an instilled PS. The flow rate of the instilled PS was assigned a constant value, which was determined by the total amount and instillation time in clinical use. The PS concentration of the liquid layer during instillation was computed by solving the advective-diffusion equation. RESULTS: The driving pressure from the trachea to respiratory bronchioles was calculated at 317 cmH(2)O, which is about 20 times of a standard value in conventional PS instillation method where the driving pressure was given by difference between inspiratory and end-expiratory pressures of a ventilator. It means that almost all PS does not reach the alveolar regions but moves to and fro within the airway according to the change in ventilator pressure. The driving pressure from subsegmental bronchus was calculated at 273 cm H(2)O, that is clinically possible by wedge instillation under bronchoscopic observation. CONCLUSIONS: The simulation study has revealed that selective wedge instillation under bronchoscopic observation should be tried for COVID-19 pneumonia before the onset of ARDS.

OBJECTIVES: Examine how hospital admission and mortality are affected by disability, age and disease modifying treatments (DMTs) in people with Multiple Sclerosis with COVID-19. METHODS: Anonymised data were submitted by clinical teams. Regression models were tested for predictors of hospitalisation and mortality outcomes. Separate analyzes compared the first and second 'waves' of the pandemic. RESULTS: Univariable analysis found hospitalisation and mortality were associated with increasing age, male gender, comorbidities, severe disability, and progressive MS; severe disability showed the highest magnitude of association. Being on a DMT was associated with a small, lower risk. Multivariable analysis found only age and male gender were significant. Post hoc analysis demonstrated that factors were significant for hospitalisation but not mortality. In the second wave, hospitalisation and mortality were lower. Separate models of the first and second wave using age and gender found they had a more important role in the second wave. CONCLUSIONS: Features associated with poor outcome in COVID-19 are similar to other populations and being on a DMT was not found to be associated with adverse outcomes, consistent with smaller studies.

The standard process for sampling municipal wastewater is both time-consuming and requires the handling of large quantities of wastewater, which negatively affect throughput and timely reporting, and can increase safety risks. We report on a method to assay multiple sub-samples of a bulk wastewater sample. We document the effectiveness of this new approach by way of comparison of technologies for automating RNA purification from wastewater samples. We compared processes using the Perkin-Elmer Chemagic 360 to a PEG/NaCl/Qiagen protocol that is used for detection of N1 and N2 SARS-CoV-2 markers by the majority of 19 pandemic wastewater testing labs in the State of Michigan. Specifically, we found that the Chemagic 360 lowered handling time, decreased the amount of wastewater required by 10-fold, increased the amount of RNA isolated per {micro}l of final elution product by approximately five-fold, and had no deleterious effect on subsequent ddPCR analysis. Moreover, for detection of markers on the borderline of detectability, we found that use of the Chemagic 360 enabled the detection of viral markers in a significant number of samples for which the result with the PEG/NaCl/Qiagen method was below the level of detectability.

Caring for persons with dementia is a challenge and often leads to negative psychological, physiological and financial consequences for informal carers (family members or friends). Many informal carers experience moderate to severe levels of burden. Advances in technology have the potential to assist persons with dementia and their carers, through assistive technology (AT) devices such as electronic medication dispensers, robotic devices and motion detectors. However, little is known about informal carers' experience and the impact of these technologies on them. This review aims to investigate the outcomes and experience of carers of persons with dementia, who live at home and use AT. METHOD MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, ALOIS, PsycINFO, Trial registries and OpenGrey databases will be searched for studies of any design that have investigated carer experience and/or outcomes of AT use for persons with dementia living at home. Manual searches from reference lists of relevant papers will also be undertaken. Outcomes of interest are carers' self-reported outcomes (which include perceived burden, quality of life and wellbeing) and carer experiences (such as usefulness, benefits and disadvantages of AT and impact on caregiver/care receiver relationship). Two independent reviewers will screen identified papers with pre-defined eligibility criteria and extract data using a bespoke extraction form. Discrepancies will be resolved in discussion with a third reviewer. A synthesis of eligible studies and summary will be provided. DISCUSSION A systematic review of quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods evidence of informal carers' experience of AT use in dementia in the community will be carried out. It is anticipated that this will highlight (1) investigations on impact of AT use on carers, (2) outcome measures and experience questionnaires that have been used and (3) the types of studies carried out so far on this topic. The results from the review will be presented in a summary matrix of common types (e.g. mobile phones, alarms) and uses (e.g. communication, safety, personal care) of AT in dementia care and also identify AT that is not usually available through government or health system funding.

Nitrobenzene (NB), benzoic acid (BA), and p-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) are widely used as model probe compounds in the UV/chlorine system to calculate the second-order rate constants of the specific radical reaction with target contaminates by a competitive kinetics method. A comprehensive understanding of probe compounds' reaction mechanism with reactive radicals is critical for investigation of the UV/chlorine reaction system. Here, we evaluated the radical-mediated reaction kinetics and mechanism of NB, BA, and pCBA in the UV/chlorine process using theoretical calculations and experimental studies. The main reactive radicals a?OH, a?ClO, and a?Cl in the UV/chlorine process for the initial reaction with NB, BA, and pCBA can be explained by H-abstraction and addition pathways. The E 0, values for the a?OH reaction with NB, BA, and pCBA were in the range of 5.0-8.0, 3.7-8.2, and 3.4-8.2 kcal mol-1, respectively. The E 0, values for a?ClO and a?Cl reactions with these three probe compounds were higher than those of a?OH, indicating slower a?ClO- and a?Cl-initiated reactions than that of the a?OH-initiated reaction. The theoretically calculated radical-mediated reaction kinetic rate constants (k CP C) for NB, BA, and pCBA were 4.58  10-3, 1.28  10-2, and 1.6  10-2 s-1, respectively, which was consistent with the experimentally determined pseudo-first-order rate constant (k CP RR) in the UV/chlorine process. Interestingly, theoretical calculations showed that a?ClO and a?Cl played an important role in subsequent reactions of NB-OH radicals, converting to hydroxylated and chlorinated products, which were further confirmed by experimental products' identification.

RESULTS: Trabeculectomy was the procedure of choice for 61 (87%) glaucoma specialists. A total of 51 (73%) respondents reported performing minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) procedures before the COVID-19 pandemic. The most commonly performed MIGS procedure was the iStent inject (51%), followed by XEN 45 (36%) and Preserflo (17%). Forty-three (61%) respondents reported modifying their glaucoma surgery practice subsequent to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Effective use of such programs requires methods to estimate their current and anticipated impact. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We present a mathematical modeling framework to evaluate the expected reductions in the reproductive number, R, from test-trace-isolate programs. This framework is implemented in a publicly available R package and an online application. We evaluated the effects of completeness in case detection and contact tracing and speed of isolation and quarantine using parameters consistent with COVID-19 transmission (R0: 2.5, generation time: 6.5 days). We show that R is most sensitive to changes in the proportion of cases detected in almost all scenarios, and other metrics have a reduced impact when case detection levels are low (<30%). Although test-trace-isolate programs can contribute substantially to reducing R, exceptional performance across all metrics is needed to bring R below one through test-trace-isolate alone, highlighting the need for comprehensive control strategies. Results from this model also indicate that metrics used to evaluate performance of test-trace-isolate, such as the proportion of identified infections among traced contacts, may be misleading. While estimates of the impact of test-trace-isolate are sensitive to assumptions about COVID-19 natural history and adherence to isolation and quarantine, our qualitative findings are robust across numerous sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Effective test-trace-isolate programs first need to be strong in the \\"test\\" component, as case detection underlies all other program activities.

The rs10774671 polymorphism is a base change from G to A in the last nucleotide of intron-5 of the OAS1 gene. This change modifies a splicing site and generates isoforms of the OAS1 protein with a higher molecular weight and a demonstrated lower enzymatic activity. The low activity of these OAS1 isoforms makes the innate immune response against RNA virus infections less efficient, representing a previously unattended risk factor for certain populations. OBJECTIVE Determine the distribution of rs10774671 in the open population of Mexico. METHODS In 98 healthy volunteers, allelic and genotypic frequencies were determined by qPCR using allele specific labeled probes, and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was determined.

Fresh, ready-to-eat produce such as leafy greens and salad mixes are considered potential transmission vehicles for Giardia infection in humans. Therefore, a specific, sensitive, and reliable method for Giardia detection in leafy greens is needed. We optimized washing procedures for the recovery of Giardia cysts from leafy greens and adapted and validated an existing EF1 LAMP assay for the detection of Giardia DNA to support routine diagnostic surveillance and disease outbreak investigations. Four leafy green types (35  1 g) were spiked with 100 Giardia cysts and we compared washing by shaking with 1 M glycine (n = 20) or 0.1% Alconox (n = 20). DNA was extracted from washes, tested by LAMP and melt curve analysis, and time to positive (TTP) values compared. The detection limit was determined by spiking 10 (n = 40) Giardia cysts onto these same types of leafy greens and processing as above with 0.1% Alconox. Method robustness was assessed by subjecting spring mix (n = 45 total) to aging (1, 3 or 7 days) and washes to aging and freezing conditions prior to testing. Assay repeatability and specificity were evaluated, and an artificial positive control (APC) distinguishable by melt temperature (Tm) from DNA of Giardia spiked on leafy greens was designed to rule out cross-contamination from the control. Giardia detection rates were higher and TTP was lower (P < 0.05) for 0.1% Alconox (19/20, 8.85  0.3 min) compared with 1 M glycine (15/20, 14.53  7.2 min). The LAMP assay detected 10 Giardia cysts spiked on leafy greens in 13C34 min in 14/40 samples tested. Robustness assessment showed that TTP was higher (P < 0.0001) when spiked produce was stored for 7 days (13.09  1.14 min) compared to fresh (9.72  0.43 min). No unspiked samples were positive by LAMP, and the Tm for DNA of Giardia spiked on leafy greens was higher (P < 0.0001, 87.43  0.05 C) than the APC (86.43  0.12 C). Within-assay repeatability co-efficient of variation (CV) for TTP was 5.4% and no cross-contamination occurred when spiked and un-spiked samples were processed in alternate order. The optimized sample processing procedure combined with the EF1 LAMP assay is a sensitive, specific, labour-saving, and rapid method for the detection of Giardia cysts in leafy greens.","output":"Optimization and validation of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for detection of Giardia duodenalis in leafy greens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveTo estimate the 2020 all-cause and COVID-19 excess mortality according to sex, age, race/color, and state, and to compare mortality rates by selected causes with that of the five previous years in Brazil. MethodsData from the Mortality Information System were used. Expected deaths for 2020 were estimated from 2015 to 2019 data using a negative binomial log-linear model. ResultsExcess deaths in Brazil in 2020 amounted to 13.7%, and the ratio of excess deaths to COVID-19 deaths was 0.90. Reductions in deaths from cardiovascular diseases (CVD), respiratory diseases, and external causes, and an increase in ill-defined causes were all noted. Excess deaths were also found to be heterogeneous, being higher in the Northern, Center-Western, and Northeastern states. In some states, the number of COVID-19 deaths was lower than that of excess deaths, whereas the opposite occurred in others. Moreover, excess deaths were higher in men, in those aged 20 to 59, and in black, yellow, or indigenous individuals. Meanwhile, excess mortality was lower in women, individuals aged 80 years or older, and in whites. Additionally, deaths among those aged 0 to 19 were 7.2% lower than expected, with reduction in mortality from respiratory diseases and external causes. There was also a drop in mortality due to external causes in men and in those aged 20 to 39 years. Furthermore, reductions in deaths from CVD and neoplasms were noted in some states and groups. ConclusionThere is evidence of underreporting of COVID-19 deaths and of the possible impact of restrictive measures in the reduction of deaths from external causes and respiratory diseases. The impacts of COVID-19 on mortality were heterogeneous among the states and groups, revealing that regional, demographic, socioeconomic, and racial differences expose individuals in distinct ways to the risk of death from both COVID-19 and other causes.","output":"Excess Deaths from All Causes and by Covid-19 in Brazil in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Organizations need to develop their resilience to foster future success to survive complex environments.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with IMID who required hospital admission due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondly, to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes between patients who required hospital admission due to SARS-CoV-2 infection with IMID and those who were not affected. METHODS: We performed an observational retrospective cohort study, including admitted patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, treated according to medical criteria and local protocols based on the best available scientific evidence. Clinical data were collected from their electronical clinical history. Statistical analysis determined the differences in the characteristics and clinical outcome of the infection in IMID patients. RESULTS: Of a total number of 612 revised patients, 23 had an IMID and 9 of them were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We did not observe a correlation between these two disorders. There was a higher frequency of obesity and cardiovascular disease among IMID patients, but without statistical significance.

DESIGN A syndemic approach unravels social and biological connections which shape the distribution of infections over space and time and is useful in de-racializing and de-medicalizing these epidemiologic models. The socio-historic framework allows us to examine social factors which, refracted through medical science, were central to the development of TB control in Canada at the beginning of twentieth century. RESULTS We expose the ideological assumptions about race, immigration, and social status which underpin current policies designed to control TB within the immigrant population. We argue that TB control policies which divert the attention from structural health determinants perpetuate health and social inequities of racialized populations in Canada. Medical screening and surveillance is an ineffective control policy because the proportion of TB cases attributed to immigrants increased from 18 to 66% between 1970 and 2007. CONCLUSION More effective TB control policies require shifting the focus from the individual disease carriers toward social inequities which underlie the problem of immigrant TB in Canada. In addition, de-racialization and de-medicalization of the contemporary epidemiological models of infectious diseases entail an in-depth exploration of how the categories of ethnicity, culture, and immigration status are played out in everyday health-related experiences of racialized groups.","output":"Coloring the white plague: a syndemic approach to immigrant tuberculosis in Canada."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microfluidic technology has great advantages in the precise manipulation of micro and nano particles, and the separation of micro and nano particles based on ultrasonic standing waves has attracted much attention for its high efficiency and simplicity of structure.

Three modes of acoustic standing waves are used simultaneously in different parts of the microchannel. According to the different acoustic radiation force received by the particles, the particles are finally separated to the pressure node lines on both sides and the center of the microchannel. In this separation method, initial hydrodynamic focusing and satisfying various equilibrium constraints during the separation process are the key. Through numerical simulation, the resonance frequency of the interdigital transducer, the distribution of sound pressure in the liquid, and the relationship between the interdigital electrode voltage and the output sound pressure are obtained. Finally, the entire separation process in the microchannel was simulated, and the separation of the two particles was successfully achieved.

However, relevant comprehensive estimates lack in China. Here, we measure the energy potential of China's domestic biomass resources (including crop residues, forest residues, animal manure, municipal solid waste and sewage sludge) from 2000 to 2016 and draw the spatial-temporal variation trajectories at provincial resolution. Scenario analysis and life cycle assessment are also applied to discuss the greenhouse gas mitigation potentials. Results show that the collectable potential of domestic biomass resources increased from 18.31 EJ in 2000 to 22.67 EJ in 2016 with overall uncertainties fluctuating between (?26.6%, 39.7%) and (?27.6%, 39.5%). Taking energy crops into account, the total potential in 2016 (32.69 EJ) was equivalent to 27.6% of China's energy consumption. If this potential can be realized in a planned way to displace fossil fuels during the period 2020C2050, cumulative greenhouse gas emissions mitigation would be in the range of 1652.73C5859.56 Mt CO2-equivalent, in which the negative greenhouse gas emissions due to the introduction of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage would account for 923.78C1344.13 Mt CO2-equivalent.

Cancer patients are felt to be a high-risk group for COVID-19, and therefore, concerns have been raised regarding the safety of operating during this time; however, the potential risk of cancer progression if untreated must also be considered. The aim of this study was therefore to identify the incidence of COVID-19 post-operatively in patients undergoing elective cancer surgery of all types. METHODS: Data were collected on all patients who had an elective therapeutic cancer operation in a single large district general hospital, where standard COVID-19 precautions were in place, between 01/02/2020 and 27/4/2020, Follow-up was for a minimum of 2 weeks post-discharge.

This nationally-funded study is analysing the response of the Colombian health system to the COVID-19 pandemic, drawing on qualitative case studies of three local health systems within the country. The approach will be informed by the concept of 'major system change' - or coordinated change among a variety of healthcare organisations and other relevant stakeholders - in order to identify processes that both enable and inhibit adaptation of health services to the challenges presented by COVID-19. The study will collect information on capacity bottlenecks as well as successful practices and forms of innovation that have emerged locally, which have the potential for being 'scaled up' across Colombia's health services. Methods/design This qualitative study will be undertaken in two phases. In the first, up to 30 stakeholder interviews will be conducted to ascertain and share immediate challenges and opportunities for improvement in response to COVID-19 that can be shared in a timely way with health service leaders to inform immediate health service planning. The stakeholders will be selected in order to sample a range of planning, provider and intermediary organizations within the health system at the national level. In the second, up to 60 further interviews will be conducted to develop in-depth case studies of three local health systems at the metropolitan area level within Colombia. The interview data will be supplemented with documentary analysis and, where feasible, non-participant observation of meetings directly related to the planning and implementation of actions responding to COVID-19.

Using existing survey data to conduct analyses beyond estimating coverage may help immunization programmes better tailor strategies to reach un- and under-immunized children. The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and the Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey (MICS), routinely conducted in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), collect immunization data, yet vaccination coverage is often the only indicator reported and used. We conducted a review of published immunization-related analyses to characterize and quantify immunization secondary analyses done using DHS and MICS databases. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the literature, of immunization-related secondary analyses from DHS or MICS published between 2006 and August 2018. We searched 15 electronic databases without language restrictions. For the articles included, relevant information was extracted and analyzed to summarize the characteristics of immunization-related secondary analyses. Results are presented following the PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Among 1411 papers identified, 115 met our eligibility criteria; additionally, one article was supplemented by the Pan American Health Organization. The majority were published since 2012 (77.6%), and most (68.9%) had a first or corresponding author affiliated with institutions in high-income countries (as opposed to LMICs where these surveys are conducted). The median delay between survey implementation and publication of the secondary analysis was 5.4 years, with papers with authors affiliated to institutions in LMIC having a longer median publication delay (p < 0.001). Over 80% of the published analyses looked at factors associated with a specific vaccine or with full immunization. Quality proxies, such as reporting percent of immunization data from cards vs recall; occurrence and handling of missing data; whether survey analyses were weighted; and listing of potential biases or limitations of the original survey or analyses, were infrequently mentioned.

Therapeutic outcomes evaluated included feasibility, safety, and local efficacy. Complications were assessed based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. RESULTS The transosseous route was successfully employed in all patients, and the electrode was successfully advanced into all tumors with this approach. The mean distance of penetrated bone was 0.57 cm (range, 0.19-1.16 cm).

Despite rapid advances in diagnostic test development and scale-up, there remains an ongoing need for SARS-CoV-2 tests which are highly sensitive, specific, minimally invasive, cost-effective and scalable for broad testing and surveillance. Here we report development of a highly sensitive single molecule array (Simoa) immunoassay on the automated HD-X platform for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) in venous and capillary blood (fingerstick). In pre-pandemic and clinical sample sets, the assay has 100% specificity and 97.4% sensitivity for serum / plasma samples.

No cross-reactivity to other common respiratory viruses, including hCoV229E, hCoVOC43, hCoVNL63, Influenza A or Influenza B, was observed. We detected elevated N-protein concentrations in symptomatic, asymptomatic, and pre-symptomatic PCR+ individuals using capillary blood from a finger-stick collection device.

By providing insight into how illness and interventions impact on patients' lives, they can help to bridge the gap between clinicians' expectations and what matters most to the patient. Given increasing focus on patient-centred care, the objective of this meta-synthesis was to summarise the qualitative evidence regarding patients' perspectives and experiences of the use of PROMs in clinical care. METHODS A systematic search of the following databases was undertaken in August 2020: Medline, EMBASE, EMCARE, PsychINFO, Scopus and the Cochrane Library. This review was conducted and reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist for qualitative research (CASP). A meta-ethnographic approach was used for data extraction and meta-synthesis of findings (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020202506). RESULTS Fourteen studies from a range of countries with differing qualitative research methodologies were identified. Three themes were identified, namely 'patient preferences regarding PROMs', 'patient perceived benefits' and 'barriers to patient engagement with PROMs'. The perspectives of patients suggested they preferred PROMs that were simple and relevant to their conditions and found benefits in the way they facilitated self-reflection and effective communication with their clinicians. Patients, however, questioned the relevance of some individual questions and purpose. CONCLUSION PROMs can be a useful tool in the clinical setting by enabling individualisation and patient centred care. This meta-synthesis provides insights into what patients find beneficial as well as barriers to their engagement, highlighting the importance of educating patients about PROMs.","output":"Patients' experiences and perspectives of patient-reported outcome measures in clinical care: A systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Isavuconazole (ISA) is an alternative treatment for Aspergillus spp. and other fungal infections, but evidence regarding its use in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR) is scarce. All SOTR who received ISA for treatment of a fungal infection (FI) at our center from December 2017 to January 2021 were included. The duration of the treatment depended on the type of infection. All patients were followed up to 3 months after treatment. Fifty-three SOTR were included, and the majority (44, 83%) were lung transplant recipients. The most frequently treated FI was tracheobronchitis (25, 46.3%). Aspergillus spp. (43, 81.1%); specially A. flavus (16, 37.2%) and A. fumigatus (12, 27.9%), was the most frequent etiology. Other filamentous fungi including one mucormycosis, and four yeast infections were treated. The median duration of treatment was 81 days (IQR 15-197). Mild gamma-glutamyltransferase elevation was the most frequent adverse event (34%). ISA was prematurely discontinued in six patients (11.3%) due to mild hepatotoxicity (2), fatigue (2), gastrointestinal intolerance (1) and myopathy (1). The mean tacrolimus dose decrease was 30% after starting ISA. Seven patients received ISA with mTOR inhibitors with good tolerability. Two patients developed breakthrough FI (3.8%). Among patients who completed the treatment, 27 (50.9%) showed clinical cure and 15 (34.1%) presented fungal persistence. Three patients (6%) died while on ISA due to FI. ISA was well tolerated and appeared to be an effective treatment for FI in SOTR. IMPORTANCE We describe 53 solid organ transplant recipients treated with isavuconazole for fungal infections. Because its use in clinical practice, there is scarce data of its use in solid organ transplant recipients, where interactions with calcineurin inhibitors and mTOR and adverse drug events have limited the use of other triazoles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article describing the safety regarding adverse events and drug interactions of isavuconazole for the treatment of fungal infections in a cohort of solid organ transplant recipients.

Due to their computational complexity, many reachability analysis methods are restricted to systems with relatively small dimensions. One significant reason for such limitation is that those approaches, and their implementations, are not designed to leverage parallelism. They use algorithms that are designed to run serially within one compute unit and they can not utilize widely-available high-performance computing (HPC) platforms such as many-core CPUs, GPUs and Cloud-computing services. This paper presents PIRK, a tool to efficiently compute reachable sets for general nonlinear systems of extremely high dimensions. PIRK can utilize HPC platforms for computing reachable sets for general high-dimensional non-linear systems. PIRK has been tested on several systems, with state dimensions up to 4 billion.

This non-contact sensing modality can drive various applications from cardiac health, sleep, and emotion management. Under the circumstance of the COVID-19 pandemic, non-contact heart monitoring receives increasingly market demands. However, existing wireless heart monitoring schemes can only detect limited heart activities, such as heart rate, fiducial points, and Seismocardiography (SCG)-like information. In this paper, we present CardiacWave to enable a non-contact high-definition heart monitoring. CardiacWave can provide a full spectrum of Electrocardiogram (ECG)-like heart activities, including the details of P-wave, T-wave, and QRS complex. Specifically, CardiacWave is built upon the Cardiac-mmWave scattering effect (CaSE), which is a variable frequency response of the cardiac electromagnetic field under the mmWave interrogation. The CardiacWave design consists of a noise-resistant sensing scheme to interrogate CaSE and a cardiac activity profiling module for extracting cardiac electrical activities from the interrogation response. Our experiments show that the CardiacWave-induced ECG measures have a high positive correlation with the heart activity ground truth (i.e., measurements from a medical-grade instrument). The timing difference of P-waves, T-waves, and QRS complex is 0.67%, 0.71%, and 0.49%, respectively, and a mean cardiac event difference is within a delay of 5.3 milliseconds. These results indicate that CaridacWave offers high-fidelity and integral heart clinical characteristics. Furthermore, we evaluate the CardiacWave system with participants under various conditions, including heart and breath rates, ages, and heart habits (e.g., tobacco use). ? 2021 ACM.","output":"CardiacWave: A mmWave-based Scheme of Non-Contact and High-Definition Heart Activity Computing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: World Health Organization formally announced COVID-19 global pandemic on March 11, 2020 due to its widespread infection.

The physical and mental health of older people is affected by depression. Health literacy is a major determinant of health and healthcare for the aging; middle-aged and older people with high health literacy are more likely to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and control or manage their chronic diseases. Therefore, this study explored the relationship between health literacy, social support with exchange, and depression, in middle-aged and older adults in the community, using data from the 2015 Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging (TLSA) database. Of the 7636 participants, 1481 (19.4%) were middle-aged or older persons with depression symptoms. We found age, gender, and education level to be significantly related to health literacy status, social support with exchange, and depression. Health literacy was positively correlated with depression and social exchange in social support with exchange, whereas the emotional support component of social support with exchange was negatively correlated with depression. Regression-based process analysis was used to verify the mediation effect of health literacy. Our results indicated that when health literacy was entered into the regression model (a  b path), the effect of social exchange on depression was insignificant (c = ?0.01, p = 0.84), indicating a complete mediation effect. These findings suggest that improving health literacy may offset the impact of social support with exchange on depression, and lead to the mitigation of depression in middle-aged and older people in Taiwanese communities.","output":"The Mediation Effect of Health Literacy on Social Support with Exchange and Depression in Community-Dwelling Middle-Aged and Older People in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has exponentially spread across the globe and formed one of the greatest health threats in history.

The importance of conceptualizing family care as a transnational, collective undertaking emerged from the outset as critical for understanding care practices in all three cultural communities. Three themes identified contributed to this conceptualization: the need to broaden the understanding of family care; the centrality of geographic mobility, and the need to rethink the location of aging and consider its relationship to mobility; and the use of technology by extended family networks to facilitate continuity and connection. An over-riding notion of flow or fluid movement, rather than a fixed, static arrangement, emerged as critical for understanding family care.

Countries have responded with various levels of lockdown to save lives and stop health systems from being overwhelmed. At the same time, lockdowns entail large socio-economic costs. One exit strategy under consideration is a mobile phone app that traces close contacts of those infected with COVID- 19. Recent research has demonstrated the theoretical effectiveness of this solution in different disease settings. However, concerns have been raised about such apps because of the potential privacy implications. This could limit the acceptability of app-based contact tracing among the general population. As the effectiveness of this approach increases strongly with app take-up, it is crucial to understand public support for this intervention. Objectives: The objective of this study is to investigate user acceptability of a contact-tracing app in five countries hit by the pandemic. Methods We conducted a multi-country, large-scale (N = 5995) study to measure public support for digital contact tracing of COVID-19 infections. We ran anonymous online surveys in France, Germany, Italy, the UK and the US. We measured intentions to use a contact-tracing app across different installation regimes (voluntary installation vs. automatic installation by mobile phone providers), and studied how these intentions vary across individuals and countries. Results: We found strong support for the app under both regimes, in all countries, across all sub-groups of the population, and irrespective of regional-level COVID-19 mortality rates. We inves- tigated the main factors that may hinder or facilitate take-up and found that concerns about cyber security and privacy, together with lack of trust in government, are the main barriers to adoption. Conclusions: Epidemiological evidence shows that app-based contact-tracing can suppress the spread of COVID-19 if a high enough proportion of the population uses the app and that it can still reduce the number of infections if take-up is moderate. Our findings show that the willingness to install the app is very high. The available evidence suggests that app-based contact tracing may be a viable approach to control the diffusion of COVID-19.","output":"Acceptability of app-based contact tracing for COVID-19: Cross-country survey evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Corona virus is an infectious disease came in December 2019 in China People with infection get the respiratory problem but doesnt show any symptoms and not required any treatment But those are having underlying problems like diabetes mellitus, pregnant women and children are having risk of getting complication with corona virus infection The government announced immediate lockdown in country for the prevention of spread of infection and has change life of million children into complete confusion Many are starving for the foods and calling for the help as the country shuts down to battle the pandemic The largest child population is in India with 472 million, and Promoters say due to this immediate lockdown many children has disturbed A assessment survey was done among parents has shown that childrens are having more anxiety, increased use of TV and Social media and changed eating pattern Another study shows that 37% of the children are psychological disturb and 88% spent most of the time on using social networking sites Objective: To assess stress and coping mechanism due to lockdown among school going children Methodology: A Descriptive Research Approach is used 60 samples were selected by using Non Probability Purposive Sampling Technique Data was taken using Stress and coping mechanism questinnarrie through online Google form Result: The study findings show that majority (41%) of the children answered were from 10th standard,30% from 9th standard,17% from 8th standard and 12% from 7th standard It also shows that 58% were male and 42% were girl children The assessment of stress is done by using the questionnaire based on the stress parameter like physical, psychological, family, financial burden, academics, quarrel with siblings, food The rating were selected through 5 point likert scale from strongly disagree to Strongly agree The result of stress due to lockdown findings shows that in majority of the children are strongly agree and agree with the physical stress, psychological stress,family stress, stress due to financial burden, Academics stress, quareel with sibling and food due to lockdown The children were using the many coping mechanism to relive this stress and majority of the children were using the coping mechanisms like using social media, exercise, doing study, doing household work, entertainment Conclusion: The findings indicate that the questionnaire was effective in assessing the stress and coping mechanism among school going children The study also concluded that majority of the children are having the stress due to lockdown but they are also using the coping mechanism to reduce this stress ? 2020, Institute of Medico-Legal Publications All rights reserved","output":"A descriptive study to assess the stress and coping mechanism due to lockdown among school going children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, a novel tumor-targeting drug delivery system (DDS) based on red blood cells (RBCs) were fabricated for combinational chemo-phototherapy against cancer.

Drug repurposing is a promising strategy for rapid identification of treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and several attractive molecular viral targets can be exploited. Among those, 3CL protease is a potential target of great interest. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to screen potential 3CLpro inhibitors compounds based on chemical fingerprints among anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, and respiratory system agents. METHODS: The screening was developed based on a drug property prediction framework, in which the evaluated property was the ability to inhibit the activity of the 3CLpro protein, and the predictions were performed using a dense neural network trained and validated on bioassay data. RESULTS: On the validation and test set, the model obtained area under the curve values of 98.2 and 76.3, respectively, demonstrating high specificity for both sets (98.5% and 94.7%). Regarding the 1278 compounds screened, the model indicated four anti-inflammatory agents, two anticoagulants, and one respiratory agent as potential 3CLpro inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Those findings point to a possible desirable synergistic effect in the management of patients with COVID-19 and provide potential directions for in vitro and in vivo research, which are indispensable for the validation of their results.","output":"Screening Anti-inflammatory, Anticoagulant, and Respiratory Agents for SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro Inhibition from Chemical Fingerprints Through a Deep Learning Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is well recognized that many psychiatric disorders are strongly influenced by cultural and social factors.

Comparative pathogenesis caused by Korean H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 SIV was evaluated in this study. FINDINGS: The H3N2 infected pigs had severe scores of gross and histopathological lesions at post-inoculation days (PID) 2, and this then progressively decreased. Both the H1N1 and H1N2 infected pigs lacked gross lesions at PID 2, but they showed moderate to severe pneumonia on PID 4, 7 and 14. The pigs infected with H1N1 had significant scores of gross and histopathological lesions when compared with the other pigs infected with H1N2, H3N2, and mock at PID 14.

Characterizing the consistency and temporal responses of the gut microbiome to glycans is critical for rationally developing and deploying these compounds as therapeutics. METHODS: We investigated the effect of two chemically distinct glycans (fructooligosaccharides and polydextrose) through three clinical studies conducted with 80 healthy volunteers. Stool samples, collected at dense temporal resolution (~ 4 times per week over 10 weeks) and analyzed using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, enabled detailed characterization of participants microbiomes. For analyzing the microbiome time-series data, we developed MC-TIMME2 (Microbial Counts Trajectories Infinite Mixture Model Engine 2.0), a purpose-built computational tool based on nonparametric Bayesian methods that infer temporal patterns induced by perturbations and groups of microbes sharing these patterns. RESULTS: Overall microbiome structure as well as individual taxa showed rapid, consistent, and durable alterations across participants, regardless of compound dose or the order in which glycans were consumed. Significant changes also occurred in the abundances of microbial carbohydrate utilization genes in response to polydextrose, but not in response to fructooligosaccharides.

Most participants were aware of the dangers posed by HCV infection. However, there was a high degree of misinformation about transmission mechanisms and treatment eligibility requirements. Low priority for HCV treatment also surfaced as a barrier to treatment uptake. Participants reported being unable to seek care due to time and resource limitations in the presence of a highly demanding treatment process.

Design, Setting, and Participants This case series enrolled newborns from April to November 2020 from 3 different maternity hospitals in S?o Paulo, Brazil. The diagnosis of COVID-19 in mothers and newborns was based on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays with material obtained from oronasopharyngeal swab sample; positive IGM serology was also considered as a diagnostic test for mothers. Newborns were excluded if they had any evidence of another congenital infection. All infants underwent external ocular examination and binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy. Exposures Serology test for COVID-19 and detection of SARS-CoV-2 from oronasopharyngeal specimen using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay on both mothers and newborns. Main Outcomes and Measures Screening for ophthalmologic manifestation in newborns after maternal COVID-19 infection. Results A total of 165 newborns (age range at examination, 1 to 18 days) were evaluated. Of these, 123 (74.5%) were born at full term, and 42 (25.4%) were born preterm.

We investigated the impact of cardiac CT on the utilization of cardiac catheterization among children with congenital heart disease. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 2648 cardiac CT and 3814 cardiac catheterization from 1999 to 2009 for congenital heart diseases. Diagnoses were categorized into 11 disease groups. The numbers of examination, according to the different modalities, were compared using temporal trend analyses. The estimated effective radiation doses (mSv) of CT and catheterization were calculated and compared. RESULTS: The number of CT scans and interventional catheterizations had a slight annual increase of 1.2% and 2.7%, respectively, whereas that of diagnostic catheterization decreased by 6.2% per year. Disease groups fell into two categories according to utilization trend differences between CT and diagnostic catheterization. The increased use of CT reduces the need for diagnostic catheterization in patients with atrioventricular connection disorder, coronary arterial disorder, great vessel disorder, septal disorder, tetralogy of Fallot, and ventriculoarterial connection disorder. Clinicians choose either catheterization or CT, or both examinations, depending on clinical conditions, in patients with semilunar valvular disorder, heterotaxy, myocardial disorder, pericardial disorder, and pulmonary vein disorder. The radiation dose of CT was lower than that of diagnostic cardiac catheterization in all age groups. CONCLUSION: The use of noninvasive CT in children with selected heart conditions might reduce the use of diagnostic cardiac catheterization.

Employing non-registered support workers is common across many countries to expand service capacity of nursing teams. One task delegated to non-registered support workers is medication administration, which is considered a complex task, with associated risks. This is an important topic given the predicted global increase in patients requiring assistance with medication in community settings. This review explores the evidence on delegation of medication administration from registered nurse to non-registered support workers within community settings, to better understand factors that influence the process of delegation and its impact on service delivery and patient care. METHODS: The review followed key principles of Critical Interpretative Synthesis and was structured around Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta\\\\analysis guidelines. Literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, and ProQuest-British Nursing Index databases. Twenty studies were included. RESULTS: Findings are reported under four themes: 1, Regulatory and contextual factors; 2, Individual and team level factors; 3, Outcomes of delegation; and 4, Process of implementation and evaluation. Delegation was found to be a complex phenomenon, influenced by a myriad of interconnecting factors at the macro, meso, micro level. At the macro level, the consistency and clarity of government and state level regulations was found to facilitate or impede delegation of medication administration. Lack of clarity at the macro level, impacted at meso and micro levels, resulting in confusion around what medication administration could be delegated and who held responsibility. At the micro level, central to the interpretation of success was the relationship between the delegator and delegatee. This relationship was influenced by personal views, educational and systems factors. Many benefits were reported as an outcome of delegation, including service efficiency and improved patient care. The implementation of delegating medication administration was influenced by regulatory factors, communication, stakeholder engagement, and service champions. CONCLUSION: Delegation of medication administration is a complex process influenced by many interrelating factors. Due to the increased risk associated with medication administration, clear and consistent regulatory and governance frameworks and procedures are crucial. Delegation of medication administration is more acceptable within a framework that adequately supports the process, backed by appropriate policy, skills, training, and supervisory arrangements. There is a need for further research around implementation, clinical outcomes and medication errors associated with delegation of medication administration.","output":"Delegation of medication administration from registered nurses to non-registered support workers in community care settings: A systematic review with critical interpretive synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The need for technological solutions that can help improve interactivity in online learning environments is increasing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In contrast, Jansen et al. take this splitting point as input of their analysis. Our estimated effective reproduction numbers R are in good agreement with those found by Jansen et al. In conclusion, our methodology for detecting temporal changes in R using outbreak-size data worked satisfactorily with both simulated and real-world data. The methodology may be used for updating R in real time, as surveillance outbreak data become available.","output":"Bayesian monitoring of emerging infectious diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Technology use has become the most critical approach to maintaining social connectedness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older adults (aged >65 years) are perceived as the most physiologically susceptible population to developing COVID-19 and are at risk of secondary mental health challenges related to the social isolation that has been imposed by virus containment strategies. To mitigate concerns regarding sampling bias, we analyzed a random sample of older adults to understand the uptake and acceptance of technologies that support socialization during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to conduct a population-based assessment of the barriers and facilitators to engaging in the use of technology for web-based socialization among older adults in the Canadian province of British Columbia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, population-based, regionally representative survey by using the random-digit dialing method to reach participants aged >65 years who live in British Columbia. Data were analyzed using SPSS (IBM Corporation), and open-text responses were analyzed via thematic analysis. RESULTS: Respondents included 400 older adults aged an average of 72 years, and 63.7% (n=255) of respondents were female. Most respondents (n=358, 89.5%) were aware of how to use technology to connect with others, and slightly more than half of the respondents (n=224, 56%) reported that, since the beginning of the pandemic, they used technology differently to connect with others during the pandemic. Additionally, 55.9% (n=223) of respondents reported that they adopted new technology since the beginning of the pandemic. Older adults reported the following key barriers to using technology: (1) a lack of access (including finance-, knowledge-, and age-related issues); (2) a lack of interest (including a preference for telephones and a general lack of interest in computers); and (3) physical barriers (resultant of cognitive impairments, stroke, and arthritis). Older adults also reported the following facilitators: (1) a knowledge of technologies (from self-teaching or external courses); (2) reliance on others (family, friends, and general internet searches); (3) technology accessibility (including appropriate environments, user-friendly technology, and clear instructions); and (4) social motivation (everyone else is doing it). CONCLUSIONS: Much data on older adults use of technology are limited by sampling biases, but this study, which used a random sampling method, demonstrated that older adults used technology to mitigate social isolation during the pandemic. Web-based socialization is the most promising method for mitigating potential mental health effects that are related to virus containment strategies. Providing telephone training; creating task lists; and implementing the facilitators described by participants, such as facilitated socialization activities, are important strategies for addressing barriers, and these strategies can be implemented during and beyond the pandemic to bolster the mental health needs of older adults.","output":"Older Adults Experiences With Using Technology for Socialization During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1,533 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were recorded in Central Java until June 3, 2020 It is estimated to increase every day However, reports on the epidemiological characteristics of confirmed cases of Covid- 19 are still limited The purpose of this study is to describe the confirmed case of COVID-19 in Central Java This study uses descriptive quantitative design, in which we describe 1,533 cases based on patient characteristics, history of comorbidities, travel history and symptoms The data of patients processed with descriptive statistical analysis from the Department of Health of Central Java The results of the study showed that of 1,533 confirmed cases, 64 05 % were male patients and 46 7% aged 19-44 years From 102 death cases, it is dominated by men (64 7 %) and the elderly 60 years (50 %) The highest IR is the City of Semarang with IR of 17 9 / 100,000 population The most common history of comorbidities is hypertension and diabetes mellitus with a total of 5 cases each Cases with a domestic travel history had the highest number of 34 1% while those without a travel history amounted to 65% The symptoms experienced by most confirmed patients are Cough, Fever with 10 8% Thus, it was concluded that confirmed cases in Central Java were spread in 35 cities / regencies with high number It is necessary to conduct a detailed confirmed case reports to control the policy on Covid-19 prevention and countermeasures in Central Java ?

As in many other types of crises, epidemic outbreaks may pose various degrees of surprise as well as various degrees of derivatives of the surprise (i.e., the speed and acceleration of the surprise). Often, crises such as epidemic outbreaks are accompanied by a secondary set of crises, which might pose a more challenging prediction problem. One of the unique features of epidemic crises is the amount of fuzzy data related to the outbreak that spreads through numerous communication channels, including media and social networks. Hence, the key for improving epidemic crises prediction capabilities is in employing sound techniques for data collection, information processing, and decision making under uncertainty and exploiting the modalities and media of the spread of the fuzzy information related to the outbreak. Fuzzy logic-based techniques are some of the most promising approaches for crisis management. Furthermore, complex fuzzy graphs can be used to formalize the techniques and methods used for the data mining. Another advantage of the fuzzy-based approach is that it enables keeping account of events with perceived low possibility of occurrence via low fuzzy membership/truth-values and updating these values as information is accumulated or changed. In this chapter we introduce several soft computing based methods and tools for epidemic crises prediction. In addition to classical fuzzy techniques, the use of complex fuzzy graphs as well as incremental fuzzy clustering in the context of complex and high order fuzzy logic system is presented.","output":"Soft Computing Based Epidemical Crisis Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Schools play a central role in the transmission of many respiratory infections. Heterogeneous social contact patterns associated with the social structures of schools (i.e. classes/grades) are likely to influence the within-school transmission dynamics, but data-driven evidence on fine-scale transmission patterns between students has been limited. Using a mathematical model, we analysed a large-scale dataset of seasonal influenza outbreaks in Matsumoto city, Japan to infer social interactions within and between classes/grades from observed transmission patterns. While the relative contribution of within-class and within-grade transmissions to the reproduction number varied with the number of classes per grade, tThe overall within-school reproduction number, which determines the initial growth of cases and the risk of sustained transmission, was only minimally associated with class sizes and the number of classes per grade. This finding suggests that interventions that change the size and number of classes, e.g. splitting classes and staggered attendance, may have limited effect on the control of school outbreaks. We also found that vaccination and mask-wearing of students were associated with reduced susceptibility (vaccination and mask-wearing) and infectiousness (mask-wearing) and hand washing with increased susceptibility.

Many countries' water shortage problem, specifically in the Gulf area, has led to increased challenging electricity demand. Electric power is currently generated from mainly fossil fuel, which has an enormous ongoing impact on environmental pollutions and, thus, climate problems. UAE has recently started to look and was managed to deploy environmental-friendly energy resources, such as renewables for power generation. Attempts were made to utilise solar energy for desalination systems, and none of these attempts was made regarding using wind energy systems. The water need is met by seawater desalination. This purpose's energy consumption is getting high with the increase of demand to separate the salt from seawater. There exists more consumption in building and street lighting. Ajman is the smallest Emirate in the UAE, which imports its power from the neighbouring emirates with a cost to be paid. This research reviews the feasibility of resourcing more than 20% of the electricity demand by wind energy to satisfy power needs towards desalination and lighting for street and official and newly built buildings. Wind energy potential at the Emirate of Ajman has been reviewed and showed a suitable wind energy potential for utilisation to supply more than 20% of the demand of about 350 MW.

AV, CV, IV, CV/AV, IV/AV, and HU of the first peak position were extracted. Relevant clinical parameters were prospectively collected. The population was composed by training (n = 166) and validation (n = 85) consecutive cohorts, and backward multi-variate logistic regression was applied on the training group to build a CT_model. Similarly, models including only clinical parameters (CLIN_model) and both CT/clinical parameters (COMB_model) were developed. Model's performances were assessed by goodness-of-fit (H&L-test), calibration and discrimination. Model's performances were tested in the validation group. RESULTS: Forty-three patients died (25/18 in training/validation). CT_model included AVmax (i.e. maximum AV between lungs), CV and CV/AE, while CLIN_model included random glycemia, C-reactive protein and biological drugs (protective). Goodness-of-fit and discrimination were similar (H&L:0.70 vs 0.80; AUC:0.80 vs 0.80). COMB_model including AVmax, CV, CV/AE, random glycemia, biological drugs and active cancer, outperformed both models (H&L:0.91; AUC:0.89, 95%CI:0.82-0.93).

SETTING Six ICUs in a single institution in Lyon, France. PATIENTS Consecutive patients admitted to an ICU with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia from 27 February to 4 April 2020 (COVID-19 group) and seasonal influenza pneumonia from 1 November 2015 to 30 April 2019 (influenza group). A total of 350 patients were included in the COVID-19 group (18 refused to consent) and 325 in the influenza group (one refused to consent). Diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR. Follow-up was completed on 1 April 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Differences in 90-day adjusted-mortality between the COVID-19 and influenza groups were evaluated using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS COVID-19 patients were younger, mostly men and had a higher median BMI, and comorbidities, including immunosuppressive condition or respiratory history were less frequent. In univariate analysis, no significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding in-ICU mortality, 30, 60 and 90-day mortality. After Cox modelling adjusted on age, sex, BMI, cancer, sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, simplified acute physiology score SAPS II score, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and myocardial infarction, the probability of death associated with COVID-19 was significantly higher in comparison to seasonal influenza [hazard ratio 1.57, 95% CI (1.14 to 2.17); P = 0.006]. The clinical course and morbidity profile of both groups was markedly different; COVID-19 patients had less severe illness at admission (SAPS II score, 37 [28 to 48] vs. 48 [39 to 61], P < 0.001 and SOFA score, 4 [2 to 8] vs. 8 [5 to 11], P < 0.001), but the disease was more severe considering ICU length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, PEEP level and prone positioning requirement.

Of these, 101 (16.5%) were admitted on the cold site and 510 (83.5%) on the hot site. Surgical procedures were performed in 495 patients of which 8 (1.6%) contracted COVID-19 post-operatively with 1 (0.2%) post-operative mortality due to COVID-19. Overall, COVID-19 was detected in 20 (3.3%) patients with 2 (0.3%) deaths. On multivariate analysis, length of stay was associated with contracting COVID-19 in our cohort (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13-1.39). Conclusions and Relevance: Continuation of surgical procedures using hot and cold sites throughout the COVID-19 pandemic was safe practice, although the risk of COVID-19 remained and is underlined by a post-operative mortality. Reducing length of stay may be able to reduce contraction of COVID-19.","output":"Safety of hot and cold site admissions within a high volume urology department in the United Kingdom at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many infection prevention policy and practice changes were introduced to mitigate hospital transmission. Although each change had evidence-based infection prevention rationale, healthcare personnel (HCP) may have variable perceptions of their relative values. METHODS: Between October-December 2020, we conducted a voluntary, anonymous, IRB-approved survey of UNC Medical Center HCP regarding their views on personal protective equipment (PPE) and hospital policies designed to prevent COVID acquisition. The survey collected occupational and primary work location data (COVID unit or not) as well as their views on specific infection prevention practices during COVID. Chi squared tests (two tailed) were used to compare differences in the proportions. RESULTS: The overall results are displayed (Figure). Among the 694 HCP who responded to the survey, we found HCP were largely (68%) satisfied that the organization was taking all the necessary measures to protect them from COVID-19. A significantly greater proportion (14% more) of HCP (81.7% compared to 67.6%; 95% CI of difference 9.4-18.5%, P< 0.0001) agreed that all PPE was available to them compared to those who were confident that the organization was taking necessary steps for protection, highlighting that safety is more than simply availability of supplies. More than 90% felt that daily screening of patients/visitors and patient/visitor mask requirements were important for protecting them from acquiring COVID in the workplace and that wearing a mask themselves was a key intervention for protecting others. Fewer HCP (72-80%), although still a majority, perceived that eye protection and daily symptom screening for HCP were beneficial. Symptom screening for patients/visitors was perceived by 19% more HCP (90.9% compared to 72.2%; 95% CI of difference 15-23%) to be beneficial than symptom screening of HCP (P< 0.0001). Figure.

The objective of this systematic review and network meta\\\\analysis is to determine the effects of yoga, massage therapy, progressive muscle relaxation, and stretching on alleviating stress and improving physical and mental health in healthcare workers. METHODS: Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials on the use of physical relaxation methods for occupational stress in healthcare workers with any duration of follow\\\\up. Meta\\\\analysis was performed for standard mean differences in stress measures from baseline between subjects undergoing relaxation vs non\\\\intervention controls. Network meta\\\\analysis was conducted to determine the best relaxation method. RESULTS: Fifteen trials representing 688 healthcare workers were identified. Random\\\\effects meta\\\\analysis shows that physical relaxation methods overall reduced measures of occupational stress at the longest duration of follow\\\\up vs baseline compared to non\\\\intervention controls (SMD ?0.53; 95% CI [?0.74 to ?0.33]; p < .00001).

Before August 2020, minimal data were available regarding COVID-19 outbreaks in these settings. On August 3, 2020, university A in North Carolina broadly opened campus for the first time since transitioning to primarily remote learning in March. Consistent with CDC guidance at that time (1,2), steps were taken to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 on campus. During August 3-25, 670 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified; 96% were among patients aged <22 years. Eighteen clusters of five or more epidemiologically linked cases within 14 days of one another were reported; 30% of cases were linked to a cluster. Student gatherings and congregate living settings, both on and off campus, likely contributed to the rapid spread of COVID-19 within the university community. On August 19, all university A classes transitioned to online, and additional mitigation efforts were implemented. At this point, 334 university A-associated COVID-19 cases had been reported to the local health department.

Despite the broad antiviral activity of IFITM3, viruses like Lassa virus (LASV), are fully resistant to its inhibitory effects. It is currently unclear whether resistance arises from a highly efficient fusion machinery that is capable of overcoming IFITM3 restriction or the ability to enter from cellular sites devoid of this factor. Here, we constructed and validated a functional IFITM3 tagged with EGFP or other fluorescent proteins. This breakthrough allowed live cell imaging of virus co-trafficking and fusion with endosomal compartments in cells expressing fluorescent IFITM3. Three-color single virus and endosome tracking revealed that sensitive (IAV), but not resistant (LASV), viruses become trapped within IFITM3-positive endosomes where they underwent hemifusion but failed to release their content into the cytoplasm. IAV fusion with IFITM3-containing compartments could be rescued by amphotericin B treatment, which has been previously shown to antagonize the antiviral activity of this protein. By comparison, virtually all LASV particles trafficked and fused with endosomes lacking detectable levels of fluorescent IFITM3, implying that this virus escapes restriction by utilizing endocytic pathways that are distinct from the IAV entry pathways. The importance of virus uptake and transport pathways is further reinforced by the observation that LASV glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion is inhibited by IFITM3 and other members of the IFITM family expressed in target cells. Together, our results strongly support a model according to which IFITM3 accumulation at the sites of virus fusion is a prerequisite for its antiviral activity and that this protein traps viral fusion at a hemifusion stage by preventing the formation of fusion pores. We conclude that the ability to utilize alternative endocytic pathways for entry confers IFITM3-resistance to otherwise sensitive viruses.","output":"Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 blocks fusion of sensitive but not resistant viruses by partitioning into virus-carrying endosomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Social media is a crucial part of our daily life.

A complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was done for one hundred twenty-six COVID-19 patients (76 males and 50 females; aged 20-70 years). Patients were randomly recruited from multicenter in Al-Najaf Governorate, Iraq. RESULTS: The study had revealed an inverse correlation between severity of COVID-19 infection and both lymphocytes and monocytes ratio even in patients with normal WBC count. Additionally, there was a direct correlation between platelets and leukocyte count. The relation between leukocyte count and ESR level was significant in a patient with elevated WBC only.

Health care workers face significant risk of infection when treating patients with a viral severe acute respiratory infection. To ensure health care worker safety and limit nosocomial transmission of such infection, it is crucial to synthesize the evidence regarding the infection risk associated with different modalities of oxygen therapy used in treating patients with severe acute respiratory infection. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2000, to April 1, 2020, for studies describing the risk of infection associated with the modalities of oxygen therapy used for patients with severe acute respiratory infection. The study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by independent reviewers. The primary outcome measure was the infection of health care workers with a severe acute respiratory infection. Random-effect models were used to synthesize the extracted data. RESULTS: Of 22,123 citations, 50 studies were eligible for qualitative synthesis and 16 for meta-analysis. Globally, the quality of the included studies provided a very low certainty of evidence. Being exposed or performing an intubation (odds ratio 6.48; 95% confidence interval 2.90 to 14.44), bag-valve-mask ventilation (odds ratio 2.70; 95% confidence interval 1.31 to 5.36), and noninvasive ventilation (odds ratio 3.96; 95% confidence interval 2.12 to 7.40) were associated with an increased risk of infection. All modalities of oxygen therapy generate air dispersion. CONCLUSION: Most modalities of oxygen therapy are associated with an increased risk of infection and none have been demonstrated as safe. The lowest flow of oxygen should be used to maintain an adequate oxygen saturation for patients with severe acute respiratory infection, and manipulation of oxygen delivery equipment should be minimized.","output":"Oxygen Therapy and Risk of Infection for Health Care Workers Caring for Patients With Viral Severe Acute Respiratory Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the most common clinical infectious disease threatening the safety of human life. Herein, we provided a sensitive and specific method for detection and differentiation of RSV subgroups A (RSVA) and B (RSVB) with colorimetric toehold switch sensors in a paper-based cell-free system. In this method, we applied the toehold switch, an RNA-based riboswitch, to regulate the translation level of ?-galactosidase (lacZ) gene. In the presence of target trigger RNA, the toehold switch sensor was activated and the expressed LacZ hydrolyzed chromogenic substrates to produce a colorimetric result that can be observed directly with the naked eye in a cell-free system. In addition, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) was used to improve the sensitivity by amplifying target trigger RNAs. Under optimal conditions, our method produced a visible result for the detection of RSVA and RSVB with the detection limit of 52 aM and 91 aM, respectively. The cross-reaction of this method was validated with other closely related respiratory viruses, including human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, we used the paper-based carrier material that allows stable storage of our detection elements and rapid detection outside laboratory. In conclusion, this method can sensitively and specifically differentiate RSVA and RSVB and generate a visible colorimetric result without specialized operators and sophisticated equipment. Based on these advantages above, this method serves as a simple and portable detector in resource-poor areas and point-of-care testing (POCT) scenarios.","output":"Detection and differentiation of respiratory syncytial virus subgroups A and B with colorimetric toehold switch sensors in a paper-based cell-free system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physical inactivity and poor dietary pattern are considered as health related challenges in ASD (ASD) which seems to be affected by Covid-19 pandemic.

The purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes of omentum folding at the time of primary open catheter insertion. METHODS From March 2008 to December 2012, a total of 67 PD subjects were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to receive either regular open insertion (ROI group, n = 33) or open insertion with omentum folding (OIOF group, n = 34). The primary outcome was defined as PD catheter tip migration with dysfunction. A systematic review was performed to analyze the outcomes of omentum management in PD catheter implantation, based on published data from 1990 to 2013. RESULTS There was no statistical difference in baseline patient characteristics between the ROI and OIOF groups. Nine (27.3%) patients in the ROI group presented with catheter malposition in the late stage (>60 days) of the study, significantly more than in the OIOF group (two; 5.9%) (P = 0.049). Significant differences in catheter survival rate between the two groups were observed in the late stage (P = 0.030) and over the entire study period (P = 0.028). A higher incidence of irreversible catheter dysfunction was shown in the ROI group (15.2%), whereas none occurred in the OIOF group (P = 0.031). No statistical difference was determined in other catheter-related complications or patient survival rate. There were no statistical differences in peritoneal transport characteristics or dialysis adequacy between the two groups upon evaluation at 3, 6 and 12 months. Systemic review of current publications suggested that PD catheter placement with omentum management could lead to less irreversible catheter dysfunction and improved outcome of catheter survival. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that omentum folding at the initial time of open catheter placement can significantly reduce the risk of catheter tip migration with dysfunction and improve the outcome of the PD technique.","output":"Greater omentum folding in the open surgical placement of peritoneal dialysis catheters: a randomized controlled study and systemic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented threat to individual and public health, psychosocial, and economic well-being, although COVID-19 threats and impacts may vary by age and other demographic characteristics.

These associations were examined in an ongoing 3-wave investigation of over 1,700 U.S. adults (age 18-89; 53.1% female). Wave 1 analyses indicate no significant age variation in perceived threat of COVID-19 infection, with older and younger individuals reporting similar levels of COVID-19 infection threat. However, greater age was associated with lower perceived negative impact on financial and needed resources (r=-.10**), lower perceptions of COVID-19 induced harm to mental well-being (r=-.17**), and more favorable well-being profiles. Greater perceived COVID-19 threat and negative impact on resources and well-being were linked to greater feelings of stress (¡s=.45 to .68***), loneliness (¡s=.24 to .49***), social well-being (¡s=-.19 to -.36***), and poor sleep quality (¡s=.34 to .51***).

METHODS We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library in June 2021 for studies that estimated PCa RRs for male BRCA1/2 carriers, with no time or language restrictions. The literature search identified 27 studies (BRCA1: n = 20, BRCA2: n = 21). RESULTS The heterogeneity between the published estimates was high (BRCA1: I2 = 30%, BRCA2: I2 = 83%); this could partly be explained by selection for age, family history or aggressive disease, and study-level differences in ethnicity composition, use of historical controls, and location of PVs within BRCA2. The pooled RRs were 2.08 (95% CI 1.38-3.12) for Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA2 carriers, 4.35 (95% CI 3.50-5.41) for non-Ashkenazi European ancestry BRCA2 carriers, and 1.18 (95% CI 0.95-1.47) for BRCA1 carriers. At ages <65 years, the RRs were 7.14 (95% CI 5.33-9.56) for non-Ashkenazi European ancestry BRCA2 and 1.78 (95% CI 1.09-2.91) for BRCA1 carriers.

INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan at the end of 2019 had considerable impact on our lives. In the absence of specific therapy, some people have resorted to alternative therapies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to explore the effect of the coronavirus epidemic on the patients' attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine. METHOD: We have performed anonymous questionnaire survey among patients of a Hungarian university hospital and a city hospital waiting for elective surgery between August 3, 2020 and December 18, 2020. We received 279 questionnaires, the response rate was 69.7%. RESULTS: As a result of the coronavirus epidemic, 91.4% of the respondents did not change their opinion about complementary and alternative treatments, 8.2% were more optimistic about them. 16.8% of respondents were optimistic, 25.4% rejected, and 57.7% did not form an opinion about the disease-preventing effect of complementary therapy. A quarter of respondents (24.7%) had used complementary therapies in their lifetime, with only 10% of respondents using such therapies to prevent coronavirus infection. As a result of the pandemic, no one started using complementary therapies. 55.6% of the respondents used a herbal preparation during their lifetime. In the course of the epidemic, a high proportion of respondents (27.5%) used herbal preparations; no correlation was found between the use of the treatment and the socio-demographic factors examined. The use of herbs was lower among cancer and thromboembolic patients. CONCLUSION: Based on our study, the use of complementary therapies presumably decreased due to the restrictions imposed in the epidemic, however, the use of herbs did not change significantly.

In 1999, 22 countries and territories in the Pacific joined together and launched the Pacific Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis. Shortly after, the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis was launched in 2000. In 2004, 12 countries in the Asia subregion of the Western Pacific Region and Southeast Asian Region joined and developed the Mekong-Plus Strategic Plan for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis. Since then, significant efforts have been made by all endemic countries, with annual mass drug administration (MDA) as a principal strategy, through strong partnership with the WHO and other donors and partners. As a result, by the end of 2019, 10 of 22 endemic countries in the region, including 8 of 16 countries in the Pacific and 2 countries in the Asia subregion, achieved WHO validation for elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) as a public health problem. All the other countries are either progressing with post-MDA surveillance or accelerating efforts by adoption of the new triple drug therapy strategy and enhancement of MDA campaigns to tackle persistent transmission. Some 85% of the originally endemic implementation units have stopped MDA and the number of people requiring MDA for LF in the Western Pacific Region was reduced by 72% from 2000 to 2018.

METHODS: A facility-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among 301 adult HIV patients who initiated antiretroviral treatment from February, 2018 to January, 2020. Five trained nurses collected the data using data abstraction checklists. The collected data were entered into the computer using EpiData version 3.1 and then exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25. The median survival time to immunologic recovery was described using KaplanCMeier (KM) estimator. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to identify the potential determinant factors of the time to immunologic recovery. An adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-values <0.05 were used to determine the strength and significance of associations between variables. RESULTS: In this study, the overall median time required to reach normal CD4 count was 11 months [95% CI = (9.50, 12.51)]. Baseline functional status, ambulatory [AHR=1.383, 95% CI (1.05, 1.83)], bedridden [AHR=1.712 (1.11, 2.64)], first-line treatment classes (TDF/3TC/DTG) [AHR= 1.63, 95% CI (1.21, 2.18)], and baseline CD4 count > 350 cells/mm3 [AHR=1.65, 95% CI (1.11, 2.45)] were significantly associated with the time to immunologic recovery. CONCLUSION: The median time to immunologic recovery was relatively shorter. Baseline functional status (ambulatory and bedridden), baseline CD4 count, and first-line treatment class were significant predictors of time to immunologic recovery. HIV patients with working functional status should be given the necessary attention.

METHODS: We investigated the duration and effectiveness of immunity in a prospective cohort of asymptomatic health care workers in the United Kingdom who underwent routine polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing. Vaccine effectiveness (10 months after the first dose of vaccine) and infection-acquired immunity were assessed by comparing the time to PCR-confirmed infection in vaccinated persons with that in unvaccinated persons, stratified according to previous infection status. We used a Cox regression model with adjustment for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status, vaccine type and dosing interval, demographic characteristics, and workplace exposure to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Of 35,768 participants, 27% (9488) had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine coverage was high: 97% of the participants had received two doses (78% had received BNT162b2 vaccine [PfizerCBioNTech] with a long interval between doses, 9% BNT162b2 vaccine with a short interval between doses, and 8% ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine [AstraZeneca]). Between December 7, 2020, and September 21, 2021, a total of 2747 primary infections and 210 reinfections were observed. Among previously uninfected participants who received long-interval BNT162b2 vaccine, adjusted vaccine effectiveness decreased from 85% (95% confidence interval [CI], 72 to 92) 14 to 73 days after the second dose to 51% (95% CI, 22 to 69) at a median of 201 days (interquartile range, 197 to 205) after the second dose; this effectiveness did not differ significantly between the long-interval and short-interval BNT162b2 vaccine recipients. At 14 to 73 days after the second dose, adjusted vaccine effectiveness among ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine recipients was 58% (95% CI, 23 to 77)  considerably lower than that among BNT162b2 vaccine recipients. Infection-acquired immunity waned after 1 year in unvaccinated participants but remained consistently higher than 90% in those who were subsequently vaccinated, even in persons infected more than 18 months previously. CONCLUSIONS: Two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine were associated with high short-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection; this protection waned considerably after 6 months.

The most commonly used delivery vectors are based on three single-stranded encapsulated alphaviruses, namely Semliki Forest virus, Sindbis virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. Alphavirus vectors have been applied as replication-deficient recombinant viral particles and, more recently, as replication-proficient particles. Moreover, in vitro transcribed RNA, as well as layered DNA vectors have been applied for immunization. A large number of highly immunogenic viral structural proteins expressed from alphavirus vectors have elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses in multispecies animal models. Furthermore, immunization studies have demonstrated robust protection against challenges with lethal doses of virus in rodents and primates. Similarly, vaccination with alphavirus vectors expressing tumor antigens resulted in prophylactic protection against challenges with tumor-inducing cancerous cells. As certain alphaviruses, such as Chikungunya virus, have been associated with epidemics in animals and humans, attention has also been paid to the development of vaccines against alphaviruses themselves.

Patients participating in vOTVs were surveyed about their satisfaction with vOTVs, quality of vOTVs, and confidence in their physician's ability to manage their care through vOTVs, as well as their support of, and preferences related to vOTVs. Participating physicians were also surveyed about their comfort and satisfaction with vOTVs. Medical Directors at non-participating centers within our network were surveyed regarding their reasoning for not using vOTVs. Results: In week 1, 72 of 81 patients between 2 pilot centers were seen using vOTVs. In week 2, 189 of 211 patients were seen using vOTVs at 6 centers. Patient satisfaction and confidence in their physician's ability to address their concerns through the vOTV was high at 4.75 on a 5-point scale.

Growing evidence suggests a role for the neuroimmune system in this relationship. There is now substantial evidence that the immune system is critical for normal brain development and behaviour, and responds to environmental perturbations experienced early in life. Severe or chronic stress results in dysregulated neuroimmune function, concomitant with abnormal brain morphology and function. Positive experiences including environmental enrichment and exercise exert the opposite effect, promoting normal brain and immune function even in the face of early life stress. The neuroimmune system may therefore provide a viable target for prevention and treatment of psychiatric illness.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with COVID-19 treated with lopinavir-ritonavir or hydroxychloroquine at a single center in Korea from February 17 to March 31, 2020. Patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine concurrently and those treated with lopinavir-ritonavir or hydroxychloroquine for less than 7 days were excluded. Time to negative conversion of viral RNA, time to clinical improvement, and safety outcomes were assessed after 6 weeks of follow-up. RESULTS: Of 65 patients (mean age, 64.3 years; 25 men [38.5%]), 31 were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir and 34 were treated with hydroxychloroquine. The median duration of symptoms before treatment was 7 days and 26 patients (40%) required oxygen support at baseline. Patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir had a significantly shorter time to negative conversion of viral RNA than those treated with hydroxychloroquine (median, 21 days vs. 28 days). Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24 to 4.21) and younger age (aHR, 2.64; 95% CI 1.43 to 4.87) was associated with negative conversion of viral RNA. There was no significant difference in time to clinical improvement between lopinavir-ritonavir- and hydroxychloroquine-treated patients (median, 18 days vs. 21 days).

METHODS: NCDs were self-reported by 176 older community-dwelling UK adults via questionnaire. Social isolation was assessed using the six-item Lubben Social Network Scale. Frailty was assessed by the Fried phenotype of physical frailty. RESULTS: The median (IQR) age of participants in this study was 83.1 (81.5C85.5) years for men and 83.8 (81.5C85.9) years for women. The proportion of socially isolated individuals was 19% in men and 20% in women. More women (18%) than men (13%) were identified as frail. The number of NCDs was associated with higher odds of being isolated in women (unadjusted odds ratio per additional NCD: 1.65, 95% CI 1.08, 2.52, p = 0.021), but not in men, and the association remained robust to adjustment, even when accounting for frailty (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.06, 3.22, p = 0.031).

Methods: A total of 36 PWID participated in semi-structured interviews at an SSP in New York City. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded by three coders, following a constructivist grounded theory approach. Relevant themes were identified as they emerged from the data. Results: Interviews with PWID revealed three themes related to the impact of SSPs on HCV care: (1) non-stigmatizing SSP environments, (2) the role of SSPs in improving HCV knowledge, and (3) acceptability of SSPs as sites for HCV care among PWID. Discussion: This paper contributes to the ongoing understanding that SSPs provide a well-accepted source of HCV services for PWID. Participants believed that SSPs are accessible and effective sites for HCV care, and suggested that stigma among PWID continues to affect receipt of HCV care in traditional settings. Conclusions: Understanding attitudes and beliefs of PWID regarding the effectiveness of SSPs as sites for HCV care is crucial for the development of focused strategies to reduce HCV transmission, and to ultimately achieve HCV elimination.

Data sources covering the last decade on overdose deaths, drug treatment entrants and drug-related emergencies suggest that the health burden associated with opioid use is mostly related to the consumption of heroin - and to a lesser extent diverted opioid substitution treatment medications - and that it is primarily affecting an ageing cohort of vulnerable users, with little evidence of an increase in initiation. While opioid-related deaths are currently at much lower levels than in the United States, they still represent a large preventable health burden with differences across EU countries. There is also increasing concern related to the high availability of heroin, illicitly produced synthetic opioids and diverted opioid pain medications on the European drugs market.

First, guaranteed loans were mostly extended to small but comparatively creditworthy firms in sectors severely affected by the pandemic, borrowing from large, liquid and well-capitalized banks. Second, guaranteed loans partially substitute pre-existing non-guaranteed debt. For firms borrowing from multiple banks, the substitution mainly arises from the lending behavior of the bank extending guaranteed loans. Substitution was highest for funding granted to riskier and smaller firms in sectors more affected by the pandemic, and borrowing from larger and stronger banks.

Currently, there are no FDA-licensed vaccines or specific therapeutics for VEEV. Previous studies have demonstrated that VEEV infection results in increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability that is mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Furthermore, after subarachnoid hemorrhage in mice, MMP-9 is upregulated in the brain and mediates BBB permeability in a toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent manner. Here, we demonstrate that disease in C3H mice during VEEV TC-83 infection is dependent on TLR4 because intranasal infection of C3H/HeN (TLR4(WT)) mice with VEEV TC-83 resulted in mortality as opposed to survival of TLR4-defective C3H/HeJ (TLR4(mut)) mice. In addition, BBB permeability was induced to a lesser extent in TLR4(mut) mice compared with TLR4(WT) mice during VEEV TC-83 infection as determined by sodium fluorescein and fluorescently-conjugated dextran extravasation. Moreover, MMP-9, MMP-2, ICAM-1, CCL2 and IFN- were all induced to significantly lower levels in the brains of infected TLR4(mut) mice compared with infected TLR4(WT) mice despite the absence of significantly different viral titers or immune cell populations in the brains of infected TLR4(WT) and TLR4(mut) mice.

OBJECTIVE: We assessed the impact of ASTHMAXcel Adventures, a gamified, guideline-based, pediatric version on asthma control, knowledge, healthcare utilization, and patient satisfaction. METHODS: Pediatric asthma patients received the ASTHMAXcel Adventures mobile intervention on-site only at baseline (Visit 1), 4 months (Visit 2) and 6 months (Visit 3). The Asthma Control Test (ACT), Asthma Illness Representation Scale-Self Administered (AIRS-SR), Pediatric Asthma Impact Survey (PAIS), and Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) were used to assess asthma control, knowledge, and patient satisfaction. Patients reported the number of asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and oral prednisone use. RESULTS: 39 patients completed the study. The proportion of controlled asthma increased from Visit 1 to Visits 2 and 3 (30.8% vs. 53.9%, p=0.04; 30.8% vs. 59.0%, p=0.02), and largely seen in males.

The aim of this study was to update the monthly COVID-19 and rehabilitation literature research up to October 31th, 2020. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION Methodology described in the second edition of the rapid living systematic review 2020 conducted by Cochrane Rehabilitation REH-COVER action was applied. PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and PEDro databases were searched, and papers related to COVID-19 and rehabilitation were retrieved and summarized descriptively. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS The database search retrieved 2704 publications. Duplicates were removed, and 1185 unique records were screened for inclusion. After screening titles, abstracts and full-texts, 22 papers were included in the present review. According to OCEBM 2011 Levels of Evidence table, 17 studies (77%) fall within the level of evidence 4 category, while the remainder (23%) are categorized as level of evidence 3. Most studies (N.=19; 86%) provided epidemiological data about the disease natural history/determining factor or the clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection, while only two studies focused on health service organization and intervention efficacy. CONCLUSIONS The most recent published COVID-19 research relevant to rehabilitation primarily provides data on the clinical course and the clinical presentation of the pathology, rather than on rehabilitation interventions or service delivery. Studies with high levels of evidence regarding the efficacy of interventions, long-term monitoring, or new health service organization models are lacking.","output":"Rehabilitation and COVID-19: a rapid living systematic review 2020 by Cochrane Rehabilitation Field.

In Thailand, the number of infected cases increased rapidly in the middle of April 2021, especially in Bangkok and surrounding provinces. Since then, the hospitalization demand has been rising significantly and, as a result, healthcare resource management especially hospital bed allocation has been in a state of chaos. A major factor that delayed the bed allocation process was the duplication of bed requests from many organizations. Therefore, the implementation of CO-link to consolidate and exchange those data in real-time was introduced. In the CO-link system, data of bed demand from different sources, such as hot-line operators, disease control teams and relevant systems, are ingested. The data are cleansed to be in a consistent format and then consolidated to reduce overlapping information. In just two months, CO-link significantly improves the bed allocation process. System users utilize real-time information to cooperate and allocate beds to COVID-19 patients.

This situation may poorly impact our capacity to care for critically injured patients. We need to devise a strategy to provide rational and essential care to hand trauma victims whilst the access to theatres and anaesthetic support is limited. Our center is a level 1 trauma center, where the pandemic preparedness required reorganization of the trauma services. We aim to summarise the clinical profile and management of these patients and highlight, how we modified our practice to optimize their care. Methods: This is a single-centre retrospective observational study of all patients with hand injuries visiting the Department of Plastic Surgery from 22nd March to 31st May 2020. Patient characteristics, management details, and outcomes were analysed. Results: A total of 102 hand injuries were encountered. Five patients were COVID-19 positive. The mean age was 28.9  14.8 years and eighty-two (80.4%) were males. Thirty-one injuries involved fractures/dislocations, of which 23 (74.2%) were managed non-operatively. Seventy-five (73.5%) patients underwent wound wash or procedure under local anaesthetic and were discharged as soon as they were comfortable. Seventeen cases performed under brachial-plexus block, were discharged within 24 hours except four cases of finger replantation/ revascularisation and one flap cover which were discharged after monitoring for four days. At mean follow-up of 54.4  21.8 days, the rates of early complication and loss to follow-up were 6.9% and 12.7% respectively. Conclusions: Essential trauma care needs to continue keeping in mind, rational use of resources while ensuring safety of the patients and health-care professionals.

Our assumption was that this practice adaptation would vary according to both geographical area (timing of pandemic effect) and whether they practiced alone or in a group. DESIGN: We conducted an online national survey of independent midwives in France from March 16-23, 2020. SETTING: All districts in mainland France and the overseas territories. PARTICIPANTS: Respondents from the population of all independent midwives working in France. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: The primary outcome measure was the proportion of midwives reporting that they had adapted their practices to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the rank, in order of frequency, of the postponed or cancelled activities. RESULTS: Of the 1517 midwives who responded, i.e., 20.3% of the independent midwives in France, 90.6% reported adapting one or more of their practices . The main adjustment was the postponement or cancellation of consultations deemed non-essential, listed in descending order: postpartum pelvic floor rehabilitation (n = 1270, 83.7%), birth preparation (n = 1188, 78.3%), non-emergency preventive gynaecology consultation (n = 976, 64.3%), early prenatal interview (n = 170, 11.2%), and postnatal follow-up (n = 158, 10.4%). KEY CONCLUSIONS: Without guidelines, each midwife had to decide individually if and how to adapt her practice. Postpartum pelvic floor rehabilitation and birth preparation have been strongly affected. The results of this national survey indicate that a large majority of midwives have adapted their practices, independently of the local course of the pandemic, and that this reduction of contacts with women raises questions in this period of anxiety about intermediate-term adaptations to guarantee the continuity and safety of care. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study's results can be used to develop tools to handle cancelled consultations.

We proposed to study the course of the pandemic along 2020 from the outlook of two major Parisian hospitals earliest involved in the fight against COVID-19. Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed on samples from patients and health care workers (HCWs) from Bichat (BCB) and Piti-Salptrire (PSL) hospitals. A tree-based phylogenetic clustering method and epidemiological data were used to investigate suspected nosocomial transmission clusters. Clades 20A, 20B and 20C were prevalent during the spring wave and, following summer, clades 20A.EU2 and 20E.EU1 emerged and took over. Phylogenetic clustering identified 57 potential transmission clusters. Epidemiological connections between participants were found for 17 of these, with a higher proportion of HCWs. The joint presence of HCWs and patients suggest viral contaminations between these two groups. We provide an enhanced overview of SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic changes over 2020 in the Paris area, one of the regions with highest incidence in France.

In situ real-life experiences were recorded with ecological momentary assessment (EMA) techniques combined with real-time acoustical data logging and standard retrospective questionnaires. Methods: Nineteen experienced BCD users participated in this study. They all used a Ponto 4 BCD from Oticon Medical during a 4-week trial period. Environmental data and device parameters (i.e., device usage and volume control) were logged in real-time on an iPhone via a custom iOS research app. At the end of the trial period, subjects filled in APHAB, SSQ, and preference questionnaires. Listening abilities with the two programs were evaluated with speech reception threshold tests. Results: The APHAB and SSQ questionnaires did not reveal any differences between the two listening programs. The EMAs revealed group-level effects, indicating that in speech and noisy listening environments, subjects preferred the default listening program, and found the program with additional high-frequency gain too loud. This finding was corroborated by the volume logsubjects avoided the higher volume control setting and reacted more to changes in environmental sound pressure levels when using the high-frequency gain program. Finally, day-to-day changes in EMAs revealed acclimatization effects in the listening experience for ratings of sound quality and program suitability of the BCD, but not for ratings of loudness perception and speech understanding. The acclimatization effect did not differ among the listening programs. Conclusion: Adding custom high-frequency amplification to the BCD target-gain prescription improves speech reception in laboratory tests under quiet conditions, but results in poorer real-life listening experiences due to loudness.","output":"Investigating Real-World Benefits of High-Frequency Gain in Bone-Anchored Users with Ecological Momentary Assessment and Real-Time Data Logging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and increasing rate of mortality among different countries has raised the global concern regarding this disease.

Enteromyxum leei is a myxozoan intestinal parasite that invades the paracellular space of the intestinal epithelium, producing a slow-progressing disease, leading to anorexia, cachexia and mortalities. We have previously demonstrated that gilthead sea bream (GSB, Sparus aurata) that survive E. leei infection become resistant upon re-exposure, and this resistance is directly related to the presence of high levels of specific IgM in serum. Thus, the current work was aimed to determine if passive immunization could help to prevent enteromyxosis in GSB and to study in detail the nature of these protective antibodies. Serum from a pool of resistant (SUR) or na?ve (NAI) animals was intracoelomically injected 24 h prior to the E. leei-effluent challenge and at 9 days post-challenge (dpc). Effluent challenge lasted for 23 days, and then the injected groups were allocated in separate tanks with clean water. A non-lethal parasite diagnosis was performed at 56 dpc. At the final sampling (100 dpc), blood, serum and tissues were collected for histology, molecular diagnosis and the detection of circulating antibodies. In parallel, we performed an immunoglobulin repertoire analysis of the fish generating SUR and NAI sera. The results showed that, fish injected with parasite-specific antibodies (spAbs) became infected with the parasite, but showed lower disease signs and intensity of infection than the other groups, indicating a later establishment of the parasite. Repertoire analysis revealed that E. leei induced a polyclonal expansion of diverse IgM and IgT subsets that could be in part an evasion strategy of the parasite. Nonetheless, GSB was able to produce sufficient levels of parasite-spAbs to avoid re-infection of surviving animals and confer certain degree of protection upon passive transfer of antibodies. These results highlight the crucial role of spAb responses against E. leei and set the basis for the development of effective treatment or prophylactic methods for aquaculture.","output":"Passive Immunization Delays Disease Outcome in Gilthead Sea Bream Infected With Enteromyxum leei (Myxozoa), Despite the Moderate Changes in IgM and IgT Repertoire"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recreational road running is growing in popularity and has been linked to numerous mental and physical health benefits.

Here, we hypothesized that, in a similar manner to neutrophils, blood monocytes undergo significant adaptations upon recruitment to CFASN. To test this hypothesis, primary human blood monocytes were transmigrated in our in vitro model into the ASN from healthy control (HC) or CF subjects to mimic in vivo recruitment to normal or CF airways, respectively. Surface phenotype, metabolic and bacterial killing activities, and transcriptomic profile by RNA sequencing were quantified post-transmigration. Unlike neutrophils, monocytes were not metabolically activated, nor did they show broad differences in activation and scavenger receptor expression upon recruitment to the CFASN compared to HCASN. However, monocytes recruited to CFASN showed decreased bactericidal activity. RNASeq analysis showed strong effects of transmigration on monocyte RNA profile, with differences between CFASN and HCASN conditions, notably in immune signaling, including lower expression in the former of the antimicrobial factor ISG15, defensin-like chemokine CXCL11, and nitric oxide-producing enzyme NOS3. While monocytes undergo qualitatively different adaptations from those seen in neutrophils upon recruitment to the CF airway microenvironment, their bactericidal activity is also dysregulated, which could explain why they also fail to protect CF airways from infection.","output":"Functional and Transcriptional Adaptations of Blood Monocytes Recruited to the Cystic Fibrosis Airway Microenvironment In Vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Uncovering the tail risk spillover among global financial markets helps provide a more comprehensive understanding of the information transmission in extreme market conditions such as the COVID-19 outbreak.

RESULTS The constant positive association between the incidence of coronary heart disease and cholesterol concentration of LDL is apparent in observational studies in different populations. Thus, the reduction of LDL cholesterol in those populations, particularly with regard to initial cholesterol concentrations, can reduce the risk of vascular diseases.

METHODS: We investigated air and environmental contamination in the rooms of eight COVID-19 patients in four hospitals. Some patients were in negative-pressure rooms, and others were not. None had undergone aerosol-generating procedures. On days 0, 3, 5, and 7 of hospitalization, the surfaces in the rooms and anterooms were swabbed, and air samples were collected 2 m from the patient and from the anterooms. RESULTS: All 52 air samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Widespread surface contamination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed. In total, 89 of 320 (27%) environmental surface samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Surface contamination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was common in rooms without surface disinfection and in rooms sprayed with disinfectant twice a day. However, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in a room cleaned with disinfectant wipes on a regular basis. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that remote (> 2 m) airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from hospitalized COVID-19 patients is uncommon when aerosol-generating procedures have not been performed.

Hematological ratios are indicators of inflammatory response widely used in viral pneumonia with affordability in developing countries. PURPOSE: Study the role of the neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived NLR ratio (d-NLR), platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte monocyte ratio (LMR) in predicting the outcome of COVID-19 Egyptian patients. METHODS: A retrospective study on 496 COVID-19 Egyptian patients, managed in four tertiary centers, grouped into non-severe, severe, and critical. Patients laboratory assessment including total leucocyte count (TLC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), absolute monocyte count (AMC), NLR, d-NLR, LMR and, PLR were reported as well as C reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer and serum ferritin. RESULTS: TLC, ANC, AMC, NLR, d-NLR and, PLR were highest in the critical group (p<0.001 for all except AMC p=0.033), while this group had the least ALC and LMR (p=0.049 and <0.001, respectively). Higher CRP and d-dimer levels were reported in the critical group (p<0.001). At the same time, higher ferritin was found in the severe group more than the critical and non-severe groups (p<0.001, p=0.005, respectively). We calculated the optimal cut-off values of the hematological ratio; NLR (3.5), d-NLR (2.86), PLR (192), and LMR (3). D-NLR had the highest specificity (89.19%), while NLR had the highest sensitivity (71.38%). By univariate logistic regression, age, DM, HTN, cardiovascular diseases, COPD, NLR, d-NLR, LMR and PLR, CRP, steroid, oxygen aids, and mechanical ventilation were associated with the severity of COVID-19. Still, only age, NLR, CRP, and oxygen aid were independent predictors in multivariate logistic regression. CONCLUSION: NLR is a predictor for severity in COVID-19.

Methods: Firstly, the potential targets and pathways of XCHD on fever were analyzed using network pharmacology. Compounds and potential targets in XCHD were screened using TCMSP and PharmMapper databases. The targets in fever reducing were identified from OMMI and Genecards databases. The protein-protein interaction network was established by String database to analyze key targets. The gene oncology (GO) analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis of key targets were also conducted to generate the relative pathways based on DAVID and KOBAS 3.0 databases, respectively. The compound-target-pathway network was established using Cytoscape 3.2.7. In addition, we used molecular docking method to identify the crucial compounds with higher connectivity on SARS-CoV-2 and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 has been identified as the key target of SARS-CoV-2 entering cells. The possible binding sites of compounds on SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 were predicted. Results: Network pharmacology analysis indicated that 165 active compounds and 168 relative targets were selected. A total of 7006 targets related to fever were identified. In addition, 141 potential targets of XCH on fever were identified. Totally, 292 GO terms of XCHD on fever and 30 pathways were identified using GO and KEGG analysis. Furthermore, molecular docking indicated that main active compounds in XCHD exhibited higher affinity with both SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2. Beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, 3-hydroxy-4-O-methylglabridin were top three candidates with highest affinity. Conclusion: In summary, our study identified the potential mechanisms of XCHD on fever. Besides, Beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, 3-hydroxy-4-O-methylglabridin could be the key compounds to exert anti-viral effects against SARS-CoV-2. Our prediction also provided the research fields to further study the mechanisms of XCH on SARS-CoV-2 infection in future.","output":"Feasibility of Xiaochaihu Decoction on fever induced by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on network pharmacology/ ҩѧС͹״ףCOVID-19ȵĿ̽"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of COVID-19 has tremendously shifted the process of facilitating learning for undergraduates.

This new virus produces the so-called coronavirus 2019 or COVID-19. Although several studies have supported the epidemiological hypothesis that weather patterns may affect the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, the most recent have concluded that summer weather may offer partial or no relief of the COVID-19 pandemic to some regions of the world. Some of these studies have considered only meteorological variables, while others have included non-meteorological factors. The statistical and modelling techniques considered in this research line have included correlation analyses, generalized linear models, generalized additive models, differential equations, or spatio-temporal models, among others. In this paper we provide a systematic review of the recent literature on the effects of climate on COVID-19s global expansion. The review focuses on both the findings and the statistical and modelling techniques used. The disparate findings reported seem to indicate that the estimated impact of hot weather on the transmission risk is not large enough to control the pandemic, although the wide range of statistical and modelling approaches considered may have partly contributed to the inconsistency of the findings. In this regard, we highlight the importance of being aware of the limitations of the different mathematical approaches, the influence of choosing geographical units and the need to analyse COVID-19 data with great caution. The review seems to indicate that governments should remain vigilant and maintain the restrictions in force against the pandemic rather than assume that warm weather and ultraviolet exposure will naturally reduce COVID-19 transmission.","output":"The effect of climate on the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic: A review of findings, and statistical and modelling techniques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Early reports indicate that AKI is common among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated with worse outcomes.

We describe the frequency of AKI and dialysis requirement, AKI recovery, and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with mortality. RESULTS: Of 3993 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, AKI occurred in 1835 (46%) patients; 347 (19%) of the patients with AKI required dialysis. The proportions with stages 1, 2, or 3 AKI were 39%, 19%, and 42%, respectively. A total of 976 (24%) patients were admitted to intensive care, and 745 (76%) experienced AKI. Of the 435 patients with AKI and urine studies, 84% had proteinuria, 81% had hematuria, and 60% had leukocyturia. Independent predictors of severe AKI were CKD, men, and higher serum potassium at admission. In-hospital mortality was 50% among patients with AKI versus 8% among those without AKI (aOR, 9.2; 95% confidence interval, 7.5 to 11.3).

Among the herpes simplex viruses, both HSV 1 and 2 cause significant morbidity. HSV-2 accounts for most genital infections with extragenital complications involving the groin, thigh, or other pelvic areas. HSV-2 is the leading viral cause of sexually transmitted diseases. Viral dissemination via the blood or the cutaneous route during primary infection can affect joints, liver, lungs, spinal cord, and brain. HSV-2, by nature of its higher reactivation frequency, leads to clinical reactivation or subclinical shedding, resulting in increased transmission risk during unprotected sexual encounters. HSV-2 reactivation can result in lesions involving the fingers, skin, eyes, brain, and visceral organs such as the esophagus, lung, and liver. Ocular involvement results in keratitis, blepharitis, conjunctivitis, and rarely necrotizing retinitis. Oculomotor cranial nerve involvement by HSV is a rare entity even in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Clinical features associated with reactivation are seen in primary infections, especially in children and adolescents. A medical literature search resulted in a few cases caused by a varicella-zoster virus but none by HSV.

The objective of this study was to describe India's biennial HIV estimation 2017 process, data inputs, tool, methodology and epidemiological assumptions used to generate the HIV estimates and trends of key indicators for 2010-2017 at national and State/Union Territory levels. Methods: Demographic Projection (DemProj) and AIDS Impact Modules (AIM) of Spectrum 5.63 software recommended by the United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS Global Reference Group on HIV Estimates, Modelling and Projections, were used for generating HIV estimations on key indicators. HIV sentinel surveillance, epidemiological and programme data were entered into Estimation Projection Package (EPP), and curve fitting was done using EPP classic model. Finally, calibration was done using the State HIV prevalence of two rounds of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) -3 and -4 and Integrated Biological and Behavioural Surveillance (IBBS), 2014-2015. Results: The national adult prevalence of HIV was estimated to be 0.22 per cent in 2017. Mizoram, Manipur and Nagaland had the highest prevalence over one per cent. An estimated 2.1 million people were living with HIV in 2017, with Maharashtra estimated to have the highest number. Of the 88 thousand annual new HIV infections estimated nationally in 2017, Telangana accounted for the largest share. HIV incidence was found to be higher among key population groups, especially people who inject drugs. The annual AIDS-related deaths were estimated to be 69 thousand nationally. For all indicators, geographic variation in levels and trends between States existed. Interpretation & conclusions: With a slow decline in annual new HIV infections by only 27 per cent from 2010 to 2017 against the national target of 75 per cent by 2020, the national target to end AIDS by 2030 may be missed; although at the sub-national level some States have made better progress to reduce new HIV infection.

Emerging studies indicate association between the HCV infection and a higher incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events such as: coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke and peripheral artery disease, when compared to general population. Atherosclerosis is a common pathophysiologic mechanism of cardiovascular disease (CVD) development which is the leading cause of mortality in the Western world. Proposed mechanisms of HCV-induced atherosclerosis includes systemic inflammation due to the chronic infection with increased levels of pro-atherogenic cytokines and chemokines. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that HCV exists and replicates within atheroschlerotic plaques, supporting the theory of direct pro-atherogenic effect of the virus. Direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) represent a safe and highly effective treatment of HCV infection. Beside the improvement in liver-related outcomes, DAAs exhibit a beneficial effect on extra-hepatic manifestations of chronic HCV infection. Recently, it has been shown that patients with chronic HCV infection treated with DAA-based therapeutic regimes had a 43% reduction of CVD events incidence risk.

Such large outbreaks have drained university resources and forced several institutions to shift to remote learning and send students home, further contributing to community disease spread. Many of these outbreaks can be attributed to the large numbers of active infections returning to campus, alongside high-density social events that typically take place at the semester start. In the absence of effective mitigation measures (e.g., high-frequency testing), a phased return of students to campus is a practical intervention to minimize the student population size and density early in the semester, reduce outbreaks, preserve institutional resources, and ultimately help mitigate disease spread in communities. METHODS: We develop dynamic compartmental SARS-CoV-2 transmission models to assess the impact of a phased reopening, in conjunction with pre-arrival testing, on minimizing on-campus outbreaks and preserving university resources (measured by isolation bed capacity). We assumed an on-campus population of N = 7500, 40% of infected students require isolation, 10 day isolation period, pre-arrival testing removes 90% of incoming infections, and that phased reopening returns one-third of the student population to campus each month. We vary the disease reproductive number (R(t)) between 1.5 and 3.5 to represent the effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies throughout the semester. RESULTS: Compared to pre-arrival testing only or neither intervention, phased reopening with pre-arrival testing reduced peak active infections by 3 and 22% (R(t) = 1.5), 22 and 29% (R(t) = 2.5), 41 and 45% (R(t) = 3.5), and 54 and 58% (improving R(t)), respectively. Required isolation bed capacity decreased between 20 and 57% for values of R(t)  2.5. CONCLUSION: Unless highly effective mitigation measures are in place, a reopening with pre-arrival testing substantially reduces peak number of active infections throughout the semester and preserves university resources compared to the simultaneous return of all students to campus. Phased reopenings allow institutions to ensure sufficient resources are in place, improve disease mitigation strategies, or if needed, preemptively move online before the return of additional students to campus, thus preventing unnecessary harm to students, institutional faculty and staff, and local communities.

Their contribution is especially important in the resource-scarce settings of developing nations such as Vietnam. Yet, the intention of medical students, in particular, nursing students, to participate in COVID-19 frontline prevention activities has not been well-understood. This study aimed to examine factors associated with the intentionto participate in COVID-19 frontline prevention activities among Vietnamese nursing students. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a total of 597 students in December 2020 in Hanoi, Vietnam. Information regarding the socioeconomic characteristics of participants, their source of COVID-19 related knowledge, and their perception and attitude toward participating in COVID-19 frontline activities [based on Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)] was collected. A hierarchical regression model was employed to examine the association between intentions of students and associated factors. Results: A positive intention to participate in COVID-19 frontline prevention activities was found (mean score of 25.3 over 35; SD = 4.4; min = 5; max = 35). Attitude toward behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control (PBC) was found to be significantly associated with the intention of students. These variables explained the 37% variation in the intention of students in the model. Among three factors, subjective norm showed the strongest correlation with intention of students ( = 0.358; p < 0.001). Obtaining information from official sources and community was also found to be positively correlated with intention to participate. Conclusion: Most of the respondents reported a positive intention to participate in COVID-19 frontline prevention activities. The findings suggested that the TPB was a good instrument to predict the intention to perform behavior among Vietnamese students. Enhancing the positive attitude of students, encouraging family and community supports, and providing adequately essential resources will contribute to optimizing the participation of students to confront COVID-19.","output":"Factors Associated With the Intention to Participate in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Frontline Prevention Activities Among Nursing Students in Vietnam: An Application of the Theory of Planned Behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Current strategies for risk stratification and prediction of neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) are inefficient and lack diagnostic performance. The aim of this study was to use machine learning to analyze the diagnostic accuracy of risk factors (RFs), clinical signs and biomarkers and to develop a prediction model for culture-proven EOS. We hypothesized that the contribution to diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers is higher than of RFs or clinical signs. STUDY DESIGN Secondary analysis of the prospective international multicenter NeoPInS study. Neonates born after completed 34 weeks of gestation with antibiotic therapy due to suspected EOS within the first 72 hours of life participated. Primary outcome was defined as predictive performance for culture-proven EOS with variables known at the start of antibiotic therapy. Machine learning was used in form of a random forest classifier. RESULTS One thousand six hundred eighty-five neonates treated for suspected infection were analyzed. Biomarkers were superior to clinical signs and RFs for prediction of culture-proven EOS. C-reactive protein and white blood cells were most important for the prediction of the culture result. Our full model achieved an area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve of 83.41% (8.8%) and an area-under-the-precision-recall-curve of 28.42% (11.5%). The predictive performance of the model with RFs alone was comparable with random. CONCLUSIONS Biomarkers have to be considered in algorithms for the management of neonates suspected of EOS. A 2-step approach with a screening tool for all neonates in combination with our model in the preselected population with an increased risk for EOS may have the potential to reduce the start of unnecessary antibiotics.","output":"Machine Learning Used to Compare the Diagnostic Accuracy of Risk Factors, Clinical Signs and Biomarkers and to Develop a New Prediction Model for Neonatal Early-onset Sepsis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background COVID-19 limitation strategies led to widespread school closures around the world.

This suggests that a host switch is more probable if a potential host is closely related to the original host than if it is a more distant relative. However, despite its importance for the health of humans, livestock, and wildlife, the detailed dynamics of preferential host switching have, so far, been little studied. We present an empirical test of two theoretical models of preferential host switching, using observed phylogenetic distributions of host species for RNA viruses of three mammal orders (primates, carnivores, and ungulates). The analysis focuses on multihost RNA virus species, because their presence on multiple hosts and their estimated ages of origin indicate recent host switching. Approximate Bayesian computation was used to compare observed phylogenetic distances between hosts with those simulated under the theoretical models. The results support a decreasing sigmoidal model of preferential host switching, with a strong effect from increasing phylogenetic distance, on all three studied host phylogenies. This suggests that the dynamics of host switching are fundamentally similar for RNA viruses of different mammal orders and, potentially, a wider range of coevolutionary systems.","output":"A SIMPLE MODEL EXPLAINS THE DYNAMICS OF PREFERENTIAL HOST SWITCHING AMONG MAMMAL RNA VIRUSES"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cases of COVID-19 are still increasing day-by-day worldwide, even after a year of its first occurrence in Wuhan city of China. The spreading of SARS-CoV-2 infection is very fast and different from other SARS-CoV infections possibly due to structural differences in S proteins. The patients with severe diseases may die due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by systemic inflammatory reactions due to the excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by the immune effector cells. In India too, it is spreading very rapidly, although the case fatality rate is below 1.50% (https://www.statista.com), which is markedly less than in other countries, despite the dense population and minimal health infrastructure in rural areas. This may be due to the routine use of many immunomodulator medicinal plants and traditional AYUSH formulations by the Indian people. This communication reviews the AYUSH recommended formulations and their ingredients, routinely used medicinal plants and formulations by Indian population as well as other promising Indian medicinal plants, which can be tested against COVID-19. Special emphasis is placed on Indian medicinal plants reported for antiviral, immunomodulatory and anti-allergic/anti-inflammatory activities and they are categorized for prioritization in research on the basis of earlier reports. The traditional AYUSH medicines currently under clinical trials against COVID-19 are also discussed as well as furtherance of pre-clinical and clinical testing of the potential traditional medicines against COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2. The results of the clinical studies on AYUSH drugs will guide the policymakers from the AYUSH systems of medicines to maneuver their policies for public health, provide information to the global scientific community and could form a platform for collaborative studies at national and global levels.

DESIGN: Rapid review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/Medline, PsycInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar, searched up to late March 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STUDY SELECTION: Any study that described the psychological reactions of healthcare staff working with patients in an outbreak of any emerging virus in any clinical setting, irrespective of any comparison with other clinicians or the general population. RESULTS: 59 papers met the inclusion criteria: 37 were of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), eight of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), seven of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), three each of Ebola virus disease and influenza A virus subtype H1N1, and one of influenza A virus subtype H7N9. Of the 38 studies that compared psychological outcomes of healthcare workers in direct contact with affected patients, 25 contained data that could be combined in a pairwise meta-analysis comparing healthcare workers at high and low risk of exposure. Compared with lower risk controls, staff in contact with affected patients had greater levels of both acute or post-traumatic stress (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 2.29) and psychological distress (1.74, 1.50 to 2.03), with similar results for continuous outcomes. These findings were the same as in the other studies not included in the meta-analysis. Risk factors for psychological distress included being younger, being more junior, being the parents of dependent children, or having an infected family member. Longer quarantine, lack of practical support, and stigma also contributed. Clear communication, access to adequate personal protection, adequate rest, and both practical and psychological support were associated with reduced morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Effective interventions are available to help mitigate the psychological distress experienced by staff caring for patients in an emerging disease outbreak. These interventions were similar despite the wide range of settings and types of outbreaks covered in this review, and thus could be applicable to the current covid-19 outbreak.","output":"Occurrence, prevention, and management of the psychological effects of emerging virus outbreaks on healthcare workers: rapid review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, in the face of the health crisis caused by the Coronavirus COVID-19 which has spread throughout the worldwide The fight against this pandemic has become an unavoidable reality for many countries It is now a matter involving many areas of research in the use of new information technologies, particularly those related to artificial intelligence In this paper, we present a novel contribution to help in the fight against this pandemic It concerns the detection of people wearing masks because they cannot work or move around as usual without protection against COVID-19 However, there are only a few research studies about face mask detection In this work, we investigated using different deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract deep features from images of faces The extracted features are further processed using various machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Were used and examined all different metrics such as accuracy and precision, to compare all model performances The best classification rate was getting is 97 1%, which was achieved by combining SVM and the MobileNetV2 model Despite the small dataset used (1376 images), we have obtained very satisfactory results for the detection of masks on the faces ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Control the COVID-19 Pandemic: Face Mask Detection Using Transfer Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since there are reports of cases of 2019-coronavirus disease (COVID-19) asymptomatic carriers in China recently and fever is one of the main symptoms, we aimed to distinguish COVID-19 cases from other febrile patients with clinical examinations in this study Methods: A total of 134 suspected COVID-19 patients in the isolation ward of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University were recruited from January 23 to May 23, 2020 We analyze the pathogenic form and clinical characteristics Results: Among them, pathogens were identified in only 84 patients (62 7%), including 23 (17 1%) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), 30 (22 3%) with other viruses, 31 (25 0%) with other pathogens and 3 (3 5%) with mixed infections The commonly observed symptoms of COVID-19 patients were cough, fever, fatigue, and muscle aches, which were significantly different than the symptoms of nonviral infections (P&gt;0 05) but from those of other viral infections (P&gt;0 05) Furthermore, lactate dehydrogenase and the neutrophil/lymphocyte were found significantly high in COVID-19 patients compared to non-COVID-19 patients (P&gt;0 05) The most common manifestations of COVID-19 patients were ground-glass opacities (100%) with or without lung consolidation, however, they also often showed involvement of several lobes of both lungs (P&gt;0 05) Due to the clear differential diagnosis, the overall antibiotic use rate was 35 8% (31/87) Conclusions: When diagnosing COVID-19, infections with other pathogens should not be ignored Successful pathogen identification will support accurate treatment","output":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of suspected COVID-19 patients in the isolation ward in Guangzhou, China: A cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thanks to the drastic proliferation of the Internet, e-learning has been recognized as an effective medium for various kinds of aggressive learners.

We sought to characterize biomarker levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and develop and validate a mortality risk score. Methods and Results An observational cohort study of 1053 patients with COVID-19 was conducted. Patients with all of the following biomarkers measured: troponin-I (TnI), B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, ferritin and D-dimer (n = 446) were identified. Maximum levels for each biomarker were recorded. Primary endpoint was 30-day in-hospital mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was used to construct a mortality risk score. Validation of the risk score was performed using an independent patient cohort (n = 440). Mean age of patients was 65.0  15.2 years and 65.3% were men. Overall, 444 (99.6%) had elevation of any biomarker. Among tested biomarkers, TnI &#8805; 0.34 ng/ml was the only independent predictor of 30-day mortality (adjusted OR 4.38; P < 0.001).

In this study, we proposed an innovative multi-layer hybrid modelling and simulation approach to simulate disease transmission and emotional contagion together. In each layer, we used a hybrid simulation method combining agent-based modelling (ABM) with system dynamics modelling (SDM), keeping spatial heterogeneity while reducing computation costs. We designed a new emotion dynamics model IWAN (indifferent, worried, afraid and numb) to simulate emotional contagion inside a community during an epidemic. Our model was well fit to the data of China, the UK and the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. If there werent emotional contagion, our experiments showed that the confirmed cases would increase rapidly, for instance, the total confirmed cases during simulation in Guangzhou, China would grow from 334 to 2096, which increased by 528%. We compared the calibrated emotional contagion parameters of different countries and found that the suppression effect of emotional contagion in China is relatively more visible than that in the US and the UK.

Here we review the literature and find no conclusive evidence at this time for significant biological differences between the American Zika virus strains and those circulating elsewhere. Rather, the epidemic scale in the Americas may be facilitated by an abnormally warm climate, dense human and mosquito populations, and previous exposure to other viruses. Severe disease associated with Zika virus may therefore not be a new trait for the virus, rather it may have been overlooked due to previously small outbreaks. Much of the recent panic regarding Zika virus has been about the Olympics in Brazil. We do not find any substantial evidence that the Olympics will result in a significant number of new Zika virus infections (~10 predicted) or that the Olympics will promote further epidemic spread over what is already expected.

Yet while youth experiencing homelessness are 6 to 12 times more likely to become infected with HIV than housed youth, with HIV prevalence as high as 16%, many do not access the prevention services they need. Despite adversities, youth experiencing homelessness are interested in health promotion programs, can be recruited and retained in interventions and research studies, and demonstrate improved outcomes when programs are tailored and relevant to them. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to compare the efficacy of a nurse case management HIV prevention and care intervention, titled Come As You Are, with that of usual care among youth experiencing homelessness aged 16 to 25 years. METHODS: The study is designed as a 2-armed randomized wait-list controlled trial. Participants (n=450) will be recruited and followed up for 9 months after the intervention for a total study period of 12 months. Come As You Are combines nurse case management with a smartphone-based daily ecological momentary assessment to develop participant-driven HIV prevention behavioral goals that can be monitored in real-time. Youth in the city of Houston, Texas will be recruited from drop-in centers, shelters, street outreach programs, youth-serving organizations, and clinics. RESULTS: Institutional review board approval (Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston) was obtained in November 2018. The first participant was enrolled in November 2019. Data collection is ongoing. To date, 123 participants have consented to participate in the study, 89 have been enrolled, and 15 have completed their final follow-up.

Recent observational studies suggest that extratropical-tropical coupling between the KE and the central tropical Pacific El Ni?o Southern Oscillation (CP-ENSO) leads to the observed preferred decadal time-scale of Pacific climate variability. By combining reanalysis data with numerical simulations from a high-resolution climate model and a linear inverse model (LIM), we confirm that KE and CP-ENSO dynamics are linked through extratropical-tropical teleconnections. Specifically, the atmospheric response to the KE excites Meridional Modes that energize the CP-ENSO (extratropicstropics), and in turn, CP-ENSO teleconnections energize the extratropical atmospheric forcing of the KE (tropicsextratropics). However, both observations and the model show that the KE/CP-ENSO coupling is non-stationary and has intensified in recent decades after the mid-1980. Given the short length of the observational and climate model record, it is difficult to attribute this shift to anthropogenic forcing. However, using a large-ensemble of the LIM we show that the intensification in the KE/CP-ENSO coupling after the mid-1980 is significant and linked to changes in the KE atmospheric downstream response, which exhibit a stronger imprint on the subtropical winds that excite the Pacific Meridional modes and CP-ENSO.","output":"Enhanced interactions of Kuroshio Extension with tropical Pacific in a changing climate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte imbalance seen in clinical practice, and a common laboratory finding in children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This study aimed to identify the incidence of hyponatraemia in cases of CAP, to find predictive tools in order to classify the severity and outcome of CAP and to explore possible differences of clinical importance between the two sexes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The medical files of 54 children (66.4% males), 4.67 2.88 years old, were retro-prospectively reviewed. RESULTS: 35/54 (64.8%) children with pneumonia had normal values of sodium at admission, 18/54 (33.3%) had mild hyponatraemia and 1 child (1.9%) moderate hyponatraemia. Increased heart rhythm and tachypnoea at admission were correlated with lower values of sodium (z= ?2.664, p = 0.007 and z = ?1.705, p = 0.089 respectively). No differences were found between the two sexes concerning the characteristics of pneumonia or the range of sodium in serum at admission. A correlation was found between sodium admission values and: a) C-reactive protein (p = 0.000), and b) leukocyte count (p = 0.006). Sedimentation rate (p = 0.021) was also considered as a possible risk factor affecting the value of sodium at admission to hospital. Finally, a negative association was also observed between the degree of hyponatraemia and the duration of hospitalization (z = ?3.398, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although studies in larger population groups are needed, in our study increased heart rhythm, tachypnoea, leucocyte count, C-reactive protein, and also erythrocyte sedimentation rate could be considered as possible risk factors influencing the degree of hyponatraemia, and thus the outcome of hospitalized children with CAP.","output":"Hyponatraemia in cases of children with pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To quantify the secondary impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic disruptions to cervical cancer screening in the United States, stratified by step in the screening process and primary test modality, on cervical cancer burden. METHODS: We conducted a comparative model-based analysis using three independent NCI Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network cervical models to quantify the impact of eight alternative COVID-19-related screening disruption scenarios compared to a scenario of no disruptions. Scenarios varied by the duration of the disruption (6 or 24 months), steps in the screening process being disrupted (primary screening, surveillance, colposcopy, excisional treatment), and primary screening modality (cytology alone or cytology plus human papillomavirus \\"cotesting\\"). RESULTS: The models consistently showed that COVID-19-related disruptions yield small net increases in cervical cancer cases by 2027, which are greater for women previously screened with cytology compared with cotesting. When disruptions affected all four steps in the screening process under cytology-based screening, there were an additional 5-7 and 38-45 cases per one million screened for 6- and 24-month disruptions, respectively. In contrast, under cotesting, there were additional 4-5 and 35-45 cases per one million screened for 6- and 24-month disruptions, respectively. The majority (58-79%) of the projected increases in cases under cotesting were due to disruptions to surveillance, colposcopies, or excisional treatment, rather than to primary screening.

We found that IMD alleviated lung injury and inflammatory response in VILI, mainly in reducing ROS levels, upregulating SOD content, downregulating MDA content, reducing the expression of Bax and caspase-3, and increasing the expression of Bcl-2. In addition, we also found that IMD played its anti-oxidative stress and anti-apoptotic effects via JAK2/STAT3 signaling.

Using data from the wild, we here provide an ecological context for a wealth of laboratory studies. By integrating calibrated sound recordings, sound transmission experiments and social ecology of zebra finches in the wild with insights from hearing physiology we show that wild zebra finch song is a very short-range signal with an audible range of about nine meters and that even the louder distance calls do not carry much farther (up to about fourteen meters). These integrated findings provide an ecological context for the interpretation of laboratory studies of this species and indicate that the vocal communication distance of the main laboratory species for avian acoustics contrasts strikingly with songbirds that use their song as a long-range advertisement signal.","output":"Zebra finch song is a very short-range signal in the wild: evidence from an integrated approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media has significantly transformed how political discussions and deliberations occur, mainly by providing a digital realm for the public sphere.

In line with previous research, the hypothesis was that the degree of polarization does not crystallize in the same manner in different countries digital spheres. Therefore, it could be said that higher levels of polarization occur amongst Southern European countries like Spain and Italy (both countries adhering to a polarised pluralism model), compared to other countries ascribing to the liberal model (the United Kingdom in our study), which provides evidence supporting previous research studies. The results confirmed the hypothesis that the polarization of digital deliberation between Spain and Italy is higher than in the United Kingdom.

This study evaluated the efficacy of a prototype nasolaryngoscopy hood (PNLH) during various clinical scenarios that are known to generate aerosols and droplets. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective detection of airborne aerosol generation during clinical simulation while wearing an PNLH. SETTING: Clinical examination room. METHODS: A particle counter was used to calculate the average number of 0.3-m particles/L detected during various clinical scenarios that included sneezing, nasolaryngoscopy, sneezing during nasolaryngoscopy, and topical spray administration. Experiments were repeated to compare the PNLH versus no protection. During the sneeze experiments, additional measurements with a conventional N95 were documented. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in aerosols detected during sneezing, sneezing during nasolaryngoscopy, and spray administration, as compared with baseline when no patient barrier was used. With the PNLH in place, the level of aerosols returned to comparable baseline levels in each scenario. Of note, routine nasolaryngoscopy did not lead to a statistically significant increase in aerosols. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the PNLH is a safe and effective form of protection that can be used in clinical practice to help mitigate the generation of aerosols during nasolaryngoscopy.

We previously identified a novel accessory protein NS7a encoded by PDCoV; however, the function of NS7a was not resolved. In this study, we demonstrated that PDCoV NS7a is an interferon antagonist. Overexpression of NS7a notably inhibited Sendai virus (SeV)-induced interferon- (IFN-) production and the activation of IRF3 rather than NF-B. NS7a also inhibited IFN- promoter activity induced by RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, TBK1, and IKK, which are key components of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway but not IRF3, the transcription factor downstream of TBK1/IKK. Surprisingly, NS7a specifically interacts with IKK but not with the closely related TBK1. Furthermore, NS7a interacts simultaneously with the kinase domain (KD) and the scaffold dimerization domain (SDD) of IKK, competing with TRAF3, and IRF3 for binding to IKK, leading to the reduction of RLR-mediated IFN- production. The interactions of TRAF3-IKK and IKK-IRF3 are also attenuated in PDCoV-infected cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PDCoV NS7a inhibits IFN- production by disrupting the association of IKK with both TRAF3 and IRF3, revealing a new mechanism utilized by a PDCoV accessory protein to evade the host antiviral innate immune response.","output":"Porcine Deltacoronavirus Accessory Protein NS7a Antagonizes IFN- Production by Competing With TRAF3 and IRF3 for Binding to IKK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the valuation effect of capital account liberalization.

The overarching goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide the first comprehensive summary of the findings of published studies thus far describing COVID-19 lung imaging data in the pediatric population. METHODS: A systematic literature search of PubMed was performed to identify studies assessing lung-imaging features of COVID-19 pediatric patients (0-18 years). A single-arm meta-analysis was conducted to obtain the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). RESULTS: A total of 29 articles (n = 1026 children) based on chest computerized tomography (CT) images were included. The main results of this comprehensive analysis are as follows: (1) Over a third of pediatric patients with COVID-19 (35.7%, 95% CI: 27.5%-44%) had normal chest CT scans and only 27.7% (95% CI: 19.9%-35.6%) had bilateral lesions.

METHODS: Participants were male professional football players from the two highest German leagues and the officials working closely with them. Our report covers nine match days spread over 9 weeks (May to July 2020). Daily symptom monitoring, PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA twice weekly, and antibody tests (on two occasions-early during the phase in May 2020 and in the week of the last match) were conducted. Target variables were: (1) onset of typical COVID-19 symptoms, (2) positive PCR results, and (3) IgG seroconversion against SARS-CoV-2. All detected seroconversions were controlled by neutralisation tests. FINDINGS: Suspicious symptoms were reported for one player; an immediate additional PCR test as well as all subsequent diagnostic and antibody tests proved negative for coronavirus. Of 1702 regularly tested individuals (1079 players, 623 officials members), 8 players and 4 officials tested positive during one of the first rounds of PCR testing prior to the onset of team training, 2 players during the third round. No further positive results occurred during the remainder of the season. 694 players and 291 officials provided two serum samples for antibody testing. Nine players converted from negative/borderline to positive (without symptoms); two players who initially tested positive tested negative at the end of the season. 22 players remained seropositive throughout the season. None of the seroconversions was confirmed in the neutralisation test. CONCLUSION: Professional football training and matches can be carried out safely during the COVID-19 pandemic.

ObjectiveTo project the potential timing and intensity of re-emergent RSV epidemics in different age groups. Design, Setting, ParticipantsMathematical models were used to reproduce the annual RSV epidemics before the COVID-19 pandemic in New York and California. These models were modified to project the trajectory of RSV epidemics in 2020-2025 under different scenarios with varying stringency of mitigation measures for SARS-CoV-2: 1) constant low RSV transmission rate from March 2020 to March 2021; 2) an immediate decrease in RSV transmission in March 2020 followed by a gradual increase in transmission until April 2021; 3) a decrease in non-household contacts from April to July 2020. Simulations also evaluated factors likely to impact the re-emergence of RSV epidemics, including introduction of virus from out-of-state sources and decreased transplacentally-acquired immunity in infants. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome of this study was defined as the predicted number of RSV hospitalizations each month in the entire population. Secondary outcomes included the age distribution of hospitalizations among children <5 years of age, incidence of any RSV infection, and incidence of RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRI). ResultsIn the 2021-2022 RSV season, we expect that the lifting of mitigation measures and build-up of susceptibility will lead to a larger-than-normal RSV outbreak. We predict an earlier-than-usual onset in the upcoming RSV season if there is substantial external introduction of RSV. Among children 1-4 years of age, the incidence of RSV infections could be twice that of a typical RSV season, with infants <6 months of age having the greatest seasonal increase in the incidence of both severe RSV LRIs and hospitalizations.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the different elements of interconnected digital mental health and neurodevelopmental services of a well-established provider to the UK National Health Service and how web-based delivery enables young people and their families to access high-quality assessments and interventions in a more timely, flexible, and person-centered manner than in-person delivery. METHODS: A realist evaluation multiple caseCstudy design was used, with 9 pediatric cases (aged 8-15 years) identified as representative of the services provided by Healios. Presenting concerns included autism and ADHD, anxiety and panic attacks, low self-esteem, anger and self-harm. The research literature was used to define the program theory and six context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) statements. The CMOs formed the basis for the initial data extraction, with novel elements added via an iterative process. RESULTS: We identified 10 key elements of web-based services: flexible delivery and timely response, personalized care to the individual, comprehensive care enabled by multiple interconnected services, effective client engagement and productive therapeutic alliances, use of multiple communication tools, client satisfaction with the service, good clinical outcomes, ease of family involvement throughout sessions or from different locations, facilitation of multi-agency working and integration with National Health Services, and management of risk and safeguarding. These elements supported the six CMOs; there was clear evidence that young people and their families valued the responsiveness and flexibility of the web-based mental health service and, in particular, how quickly they were seen. There was also clear evidence of individual needs being met, good therapeutic alliances, and client satisfaction. Multiple communication tools appeared to maximize engagement and working digitally facilitated multi-agency communication and delivery of safe care. The abovementioned factors may be related to the finding of good clinical outcomes, but the methodology of this study does not allow any conclusions to be drawn regarding causality. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of interconnected digital mental health and neurodevelopmental services as well as how web-based delivery enables young people and their families to access assessments and interventions in a more timely, flexible, and person-centered manner than in-person delivery. The 10 key elements of web-based service delivery identified through the 9 case studies suggest the potential advantages of web-based work. These elements can inform future research and aid in the delivery of high-quality digital services.","output":"Digital Mental Health and Neurodevelopmental Services: Case-Based Realist Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A multitude of smart things and wirelessly connected Sensor Nodes (SNs) have pervasively facilitated the use of smart applications in every domain of life. Along with the bounties of smart things and applications, there are hazards of external and internal attacks. Unfortunately, mitigating internal attacks is quite challenging, where network lifespan (w.r.t. energy consumption at node level), latency, and scalability are the three main factors that influence the efficacy of security measures. Furthermore, most of the security measures provide centralized solutions, ignoring the decentralized nature of SN-powered Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. This paper presents an energy-efficient decentralized trust mechanism using a blockchain-based multi-mobile code-driven solution for detecting internal attacks in sensor node-powered IoT. The results validate the better performance of the proposed solution over existing solutions with 43.94% and 2.67% less message overhead in blackhole and greyhole attack scenarios, respectively. Similarly, the malicious node detection time is reduced by 20.35% and 11.35% in both blackhole and greyhole attacks. Both of these factors play a vital role in improving network lifetime.","output":"A Blockchain-Based Multi-Mobile Code-Driven Trust Mechanism for Detecting Internal Attacks in Internet of Things"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) metabolic variables, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) tumor expression, and other factors as predictors of disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (stage IACIIIA) who underwent surgical resection. We still lack predictor of immune checkpoint (programmed cell death-1 [PD-1]/PD-L1) inhibitors. Herein, we investigated the correlation between metabolic parameters from (18)F-FDG PET/CT and PD-L1 expression in patients with surgically resected LUAD. Seventy-four patients who underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT prior to treatment were consecutively enrolled. The main (18)F-FDG PET/CT-derived variables were primary tumor maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG). Surgical tumor specimens were analyzed for PD-L1 and p-STAT3 expression using immunohistochemistry. Correlations between immunohistochemistry results and (18)F-FDG PET/CT-derived variables were compared. Associations of PD-L1 and p-STAT3 tumor expression, (18)F-FDG PET/CT-derived variables, and other factors with DFS in resected LUAD were evaluated. All tumors were FDG-avid. The cutoff values of low and high SUVmax, MTV, and TLG were 12.60, 14.87, and 90.85, respectively. The results indicated that TNM stage, PD-L1 positivity, and high (18)F-FDG PET/CT metabolic volume parameters (TLG 90.85 or MTV 14.87) were independent predictors of worse DFS in resected LUAD. No (18)F-FDG metabolic parameters associated with PD-L1 expression were observed (chi-square test), but we found that patients with positive PD-L1 expression have significantly higher SUVmax (P = .01), MTV (P = .00), and TLG (P = .00) than patients with negative PD-L1 expression. (18)F-FDG PET/CT metabolic volume parameters (TLG 90.85 or MTV 14.87) were more helpful in prognostication than the conventional parameter (SUVmax), PD-L1 expression was an independent predictor of DFS in patients with resected LUAD.

Researchers have sought to better understand the risk and clinical outcomes of LT recipients infected with COVID-19 globally, however, there is a paucity of data from within Canada. AIMS: Our multi-center study aims to examine the characteristics and clinical outcomes of LT patients with COVID-19 in Canada. METHODS: We identified a retrospective cohort of adult LT recipients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 from 7 Canadian tertiary care centers between March 2020 and June 2021. Demographic and clinical data were compiled by clinicians within those centers. We identified liver enzyme profile at the time of COVID-19 infection, immunosuppression type and post-infection adjustments, rate of hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death. RESULTS: A total of 49 patients with a history of LT and COVID-19 infection were identified. Twenty nine patients (59%) were male, the median time from LT was 66 months (1, 128) and the median age at COVID-19 infection was 59 years (52, 65). At COVID-19 diagnosis, the median ALT was 37 U/L (21, 41), AST U/L was 34 (20, 37), ALP U/L was 156 (88, 156), Total Bilirubin was 11 umol/L (7, 14), and INR was 1.1 (1.0, 1.1). The majority of patients (92%) were on tacrolimus monotherapy or a combination of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF); median tacrolimus level at COVID-19 diagnosis was 5.3 ug/L (4.0, 8.1). Immunosuppression was modified in 8 (16%) patients post-infection; either the tacrolimus dose was reduced or MMF was held. One patient developed acute cellular rejection which recovered after re-initiation of the prior regimen. Eighteen patients (37%) required hospitalization, 6 (12%) were treated with dexamethasone, and 3 (6%) required ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. Four patients (8%) died due to complications of COVID-19. On univariate analysis, neither age, sex, co-morbidities nor duration post-transplant were associated with risk of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: In our national retrospective study, approximately 40% of patients required hospitalization with a mortality rate of < 10%. Previous studies have shown proximity to LT as an independent factor for mortality with COVID-19; the median time from LT for our patients was 5 years, which may explain the lower mortality rate. Of note, the median tacrolimus levels were much lower in comparison to the target of 8C10 ug/L used in the first year post-transplant. As the landscape of COVID-19 changes with vaccination, evolving treatments, and increasing rates of variant transmission, additional studies are required to continue identifying trends in clinical outcomes.

METHODS This is a multicentric retrospective observational cohort analysis conducted on patients who underwent EGS procedures during the lockdown and the same period of the previous year in the three Third Level Hospitals of Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy. RESULTS During the study period, 138 patients underwent EGS procedures versus the 197 patients operated on in 2019, meaning a 30.0% decrease in the number of surgeries performed. The incidence rate for EGS procedures was 2.5 surgeries per day during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 3.5 surgeries per day in 2019 (P<0.001). The characteristics of patients operated on in 2020 were comparable to those of patients who underwent EGS in 2019, except for the higher prevalence of male patients during the COVID-19 pandemic (76.8 vs. 55.8; P<0.001).

METHODS: A retrospective study of 1148 optical coherence tomography (OCT) and color fundus photography (CFP) retinal images obtained using Topcon's Maestro care unit on 647 patients with diabetes. To identify retinal pathology, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with dual-modal inputs (i.e. CFP and OCT images) was developed. We developed a novel alternate gradient descent algorithm to train the CNN, which allows for the use of uninterpretable CFP/OCT images (i.e. ungradable images that do not contain sufficient image biomarkers for the reviewer to conclude absence or presence of retinal pathology). Specifically, a 9:1 ratio to split the training and testing dataset was used for training and validating the CNN. Paired CFP/OCT inputs (obtained from a single eye of a patient) were grouped as retinal pathology negative (RPN; 924 images) in the absence of retinal pathology in both imaging modalities, or if one of the imaging modalities was uninterpretable and the other without retinal pathology. If any imaging modality exhibited referable retinal pathology, the corresponding CFP/OCT inputs were deemed retinal pathology positive (RPP; 224 images) if any imaging modality exhibited referable retinal pathology. RESULTS: Our approach achieved 88.60% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 82.76% to 94.43%) accuracy in identifying pathology, along with the false negative rate (FNR) of 12.28% (95% CI = 6.26% to 18.31%), recall (sensitivity) of 87.72% (95% CI = 81.69% to 93.74%), specificity of 89.47% (95% CI = 83.84% to 95.11%), and area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) was 92.74% (95% CI = 87.71% to 97.76%).

We developed an evidence-based, multifaceted and customizable intervention to improve the immunization experience at school called the CARD? (C-Comfort, A-Ask, R-Relax, D-Distract) system. We evaluated the feasibility of CARD? implementation for school-based immunizations in Calgary, Canada. METHODS: In a mixed methods study, two Community Health Centres providing immunization services, including 5 schools each with grade 9 students (aged approximately 14 years), were randomized to CARD? or control (usual care). In the CARD? group, public health staff and students were educated about coping strategies prior to immunization clinics. Clinics were organized to reduce fear and to support students choices for coping strategies. Public health staff in the CARD? group participated in a focus group discussion afterwards. We sought a recruitment rate of 80% for eligible schools, an external stakeholder focus group (e.g., school staff) with 6 or more individuals, 85% of individual injection-related data acquisition (student and immunizer surveys), and 80% absolute agreement between raters for a subset of data that were double-coded. Across focus groups, we examined perceptions of acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility and fidelity of CARD?. RESULTS: Nine (90%) of eligible schools participated. Of 219 students immunized, injection-related student and immunizer data forms were acquired for 195 (89.0%) and 196 (89.5%), respectively. Reliability of data collection was high. Fifteen public health and 5 school staff participated in separate focus groups. Overall, attitudes towards CARD? were positive and compliance with individual components of CARD? was high.

While there are a number of early publications relating to risk factors for COVID-19 infection, low sample size and heterogeneity in study design impacted consolidation of early findings. There is a pressing need to identify the factors which predispose patients to severe cases of COVID-19. For rapid and widespread risk stratification, these factors should be easily obtainable, inexpensive, and avoid invasive clinical procedures. The aim of our study is to fill this knowledge gap by systematically mapping all the available evidence on the association of various clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables with the risk of specific adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The systematic review was conducted using standardized methodology, searching two electronic databases (PubMed and SCOPUS) for relevant literature published between 1(st) January 2020 and 9(th) July 2020. Included studies reported characteristics of patients with COVID-19 while reporting outcomes relating to disease severity. In the case of sufficient comparable data, meta-analyses were conducted to estimate risk of each variable. RESULTS: Seventy-six studies were identified, with a total of 17,860,001 patients across 14 countries. The studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of the sample under study, outcomes, and risk measures reported. A large number of risk factors were presented for COVID-19. Commonly reported variables for adverse outcome from COVID-19 comprised patient characteristics, including age >75 (OR: 2.65, 95% CI: 1.81C3.90), male sex (OR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.39C3.04) and severe obesity (OR: 2.57, 95% CI: 1.31C5.05).

Pregnant persons with COVID-19 are at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with pregnant persons without COVID-19. This study presents preliminary findings of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnant persons from the United States. To conduct this study, the researchers extracted data from 3 different US vaccine safety monitoring systems: the \\"v-safe after vaccination health checker\\" surveillance system, the v-safe pregnancy registry, and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). V-safe asks participants to report local and systemic signs and symptoms as mild, moderate, or severe during daily surveys. Women were eligible if they received their mRNA vaccination during pregnancy or during the preconception period, defined as 30 days before the last menstrual period through 14 days after, and were 18 years of age or older. Participant-reported pregnancy outcomes were spontaneous pregnancy loss (defined as spontaneous abortion and stillbirth) and neonatal outcomes (such as preterm birth, congenital anomalies, small size for gestational age, and neonatal death). Data were obtained through December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021. In all, 35,691 v-safe participants ages 16 to 54 years identified themselves as pregnant. The majority of enrolled participants were between the ages of 25 and 44 years (98.8%), non-Hispanic White (79.0%), and did not report a COVID-19 diagnosis during pregnancy (97.6%). Overall, 92 (2.3%) of participants received their first vaccination dose during the preconception period, 1132 (28.6%) in the first trimester, 1714 (43.3%) in the second trimester, and 1019 (25.7%) in the third trimester. In terms of adverse effects, injection site pain was described more among pregnant persons compared with nonpregnant women. Headache, myalgia, chills, and fever were reported less often among pregnant persons compared with nonpregnant people. Of the 3958 participants enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry, 827 had a completed pregnancy. Of these, 827 completed pregnancies, 115 (13.9%) resulted in a pregnancy loss, and 712 (86.1%) resulted in a live birth (mainly among participants with vaccination in the third trimester). Adverse neonatal outcomes included preterm birth (in 9.4%) and small size for gestational age (in 3.2%);no neonatal deaths were reported. There were 221 pregnancy-related adverse events reported to VAERS, of which the most frequently reported event was spontaneous abortion (46 cases). No congenital anomalies were reported. Of note, the proportions of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in the v-safe pregnancy database were similar to those published before the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings from this study did not show obvious safety concerns among pregnant persons who received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. More longitudinal follow-up and studies including larger numbers of women vaccinated earlier in pregnancy are needed to better inform outcomes.

Patients with RHRF caused by Adv pneumonia who received ECMO support after mechanical ventilation failed to achieve adequate oxygenation between 2017 and 2020 were included. The outcome variables were the in-hospital survival rate and the effects of ECMO on the survival rate. RESULTS: In total, 18 children with RHRF received ECMO. The median age was 19 (9.5, 39.8) months, and the median ECMO duration was 196 (152, 309) h. The in-hospital survival rate was 72.2% (13/18). Thirteen patients (72.2%) required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to fluid imbalance or acute kidney injury (AKI). At ECMO initiation, compared with survivors, nonsurvivors had a lower PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio [49 (34.5, 62) vs. 63 (56, 71); p = 0.04], higher oxygen index (OI) [41 (34.5, 62) vs. 30 (26.5, 35); p = 0.03], higher vasoactive inotropic score (VIS) [30 (16.3, 80) vs. 100 (60, 142.5); p = 0.04], longer duration from mechanical ventilation to ECMO support [8 (4, 14) vs. 4 (3, 5.5) h, p=0.02], and longer time from confirmed RHRF to ECMO initiation [9 (4.8, 13) vs. 5 (1.3, 5.5) h; p = 0.004].

Both episodes led to mild COVID-19. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 infections was detected by RT-PCR on naso-pharyngeal specimens. Reinfection was confirmed by whole-genome sequencing. Kinetics of total anti-S receptor binding domain immunoglobulins (Ig anti-S RBD), anti-nucleoprotein (anti-N) and neutralizing antibodies were determined in serial serum samples retrieved during both infection episodes. Memory B cells responses were assessed at day 12 post reinfection. RESULTS: Whole-genome sequencing identified two different SARS-CoV-2 genomes both belonging to clade 20A, with only one non-synonymous mutation in the spike protein, and clustered with viruses circulating in Geneva (Switzerland) at the time of each of the corresponding episodes. Seroconversion was documented with low level of total Ig anti-S RBD and anti-N antibodies at one month after the first infection whereas neutralizing antibodies quickly declined after the first episode and then were boosted by the reinfection, with high titers detectable 4 days after symptoms onset. A strong memory B cell response was detected at day 12 post onset of symptoms during reinfection, indicating that the first episode elicited cellular memory responses. CONCLUSION: Rapid decline of neutralizing antibodies may put medical personnel at risk of reinfection as shown in this case. Reinfection however leads to a significant boosting of previous immune responses.

Conversely, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease colon resection viromes provoked inflammation, which was successfully dampened by non-IBD viromes.

Furthermore, there were detrimental consequences for IBD patient-derived intestinal epithelial cells bearing loss-of-function mutations within virus sensor MDA5 when exposed to viromes. Our results demonstrate that innate recognition of IBD or non-IBD human viromes autonomously influences intestinal homeostasis and disease phenotypes.

In LMIC, three types of public health training have been tried: the university-based model; streamed training for specialised workers; and field-based programs. The first has low rates of production and teaching may not always be based on the needs and priorities of the host country. The second model is efficient, but does not accord the workers sufficient status to enable them to impact on policy. The third has the most potential as a capacity development measure for LMIC, but in practice faces challenges which may limit its ability to promote capacity development. DISCUSSION: We describe Australia's first Master of Applied Epidemiology (MAE) model (established in 1991), which uses field-based training to strengthen the control of communicable diseases. A central attribute of this model is the way it partners and complements health department initiatives to enhance workforce skills, health system performance and the evidence-base for policies, programs and practice. SUMMARY: The MAE experience throws light on ways Australia could collaborate in regional capacity development initiatives. Key needs are a shared vision for a regional approach to integrate training with initiatives that strengthen service and research, and the pooling of human, financial and technical resources. We focus on communicable diseases, but our findings and recommendations are generalisable to other areas of public health.","output":"Strengthening field-based training in low and middle-income countries to build public health capacity: Lessons from Australia's Master of Applied Epidemiology program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To provide the latest evidence on the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir compared to other treatment options for COVID-19.

METHODS: This is a retrospective study conducted in an underserved area with a predominance of African American patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample population. The onset of AKI and relation to clinical outcomes were determined. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with AKI. RESULTS: Nearly half (49.3%) of the patients with COVID-19 had AKI. Patients with AKI had a significantly lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and higher FiO2 requirement and D-dimer levels on admission. More subnephrotic proteinuria and microhematuria was seen in these patients, and the majority had a pre-renal urine electrolyte profile. Patients with hospital-acquired AKI (HA-AKI) as opposed to those with community-acquired AKI (CA-AKI) had higher rates of in-hospital death (52 vs. 23%, p = 0.005), need for vasopressors (42 vs. 25%, p = 0.024), and need for intubation (55 vs. 25%, p = 0.006).

Secondly, usage rates in Victoria were compared with equivalent national rates. Methods: Monthly antimicrobial dispensing data for all 31 Australian principal referral hospitals were analysed for the period January 2019 to December 2020. Grams of antimicrobial agents used were converted into the World Health Organization (WHO) assigned metric 'Defined Daily Dose' (Using the hospital activity metric Occupied Bed Days (OBD), a standardised usage density rate was calculated (in units of  / 00 OBD). Results: The typical expected seasonal trend in aggregate usage rates, for antibacterials used in the treatment of CAP, was not evident in 2020. Overall usage of doxycycline, azithromycin, amoxicillin and cefuroxime decreased in principal referral hospitals compared to 2019.

This topic is becoming increasingly relevant as the number of issued prescriptions in Slovenia is rising every year, treatment with prescription medicine is experienced by almost everyone. Medicine packaging must therefore provide essential information effectively and efficiently. AIM: The purpose of this thesis is to improve current heterogeneous conditions by developing a standardized design system for all prescription drugs by taking into account users needs at each stage of the process. The final goal is a simpler and more effective use of products for everyone involved. METHODS: Research was conducted in three stages. In the first stage, the existing condition in packaging design was analysed: information hierarchy/arrangement on 8 significant manufacturers products considering 1 - the type of information and 2 - different user groups. Second stage consisted of conducting surveys with 2 focus groups representing two main user groups who use the packaging differently - medicine consumers and healthcare professionals.(1) Consumer focus group consisted of 81 participants, recruited randomly from various age groups (age 10 to 89). They were asked closed-ended questions. Healthcare professionals focus group consisted of 5 pharmacists with extensive experience. They were asked open-ended questions. The collected data from both research stages was statistically and qualitatively analysed in order to define the main problems with medicine packaging design and use. Identified problems were then addressed through the design process. The third stage included development of a standardised design system in accordance with information design theory and cognitive psychology findings.(2) These helped establish the system building blocks/rules: information hierarchy and organization, use of colour, shape and typography. RESULTS: Analysis of existing conditions clearly exposed the heterogeneity and unsuitability of the majority of medicine packaging design. These caused similar problems to both user groups: trouble finding information (73 %), lack/redundancy of information (47 %/17 %), illegible, unreadable typography (39 %), distracting visual elements (26 %), unclear distinction between medicines (17 %). These lead to various consequences: incorrect route of administration (39 %), consuming/prescribing expired (30 %) or incorrect product (8 %), time loss (8 %). Each of these problems was addressed through establishment of new, highly precise rules in packaging design: regulating hierarchy and typography, introducing visual categorization through symbols and illustrations (information category, pharmaceutical form, ATC group) and color-coding medicine strength. The rules form a standardised system which provides unity, consistency and quality regulation, improving the everyday experience of many people. CONCLUSION: The research was carried out as a part of a BA thesis. The execution of the project would require a change in the legislation on state level. It therefore serves as a speculative proposal, aiming to raise questions that are currently not being addressed properly within the industry. The possibility of implementation could be recognized through gradual transformation of individual rules/building blocks of the system into new state regulations or guidelines.

RESULTS: The sample appeared to be fearful of COVID-19 and this fear was related to disgust sensitivity, anxiety sensitivity-related physical concerns, body vigilance, contamination cognitions, and general distress. Results suggested that the tendency of overestimating the severity of contamination and anxiety sensitivity towards physical concerns are significant predictors of COVID-19 related fear and consequent safety behaviors. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that people with a greater concern of contamination are likely to respond fearfully to COVID-19 and that people with higher fear of COVID-19 are likely to feel contamination concerns.","output":"Psychological Predictors of Anxious Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid or ascorbate, is a water-soluble vitamin synthesized in plants as well as in animals except humans and several other animal species.

METHODS: A total of 71 severe patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were treated in Wuhan First Hospital from February 12 to March 20, 2020, were enrolled. The blood coagulation data in these patients and in 61 healthy controls were collected. The patients with COVID-19 were divided into two groups: the aggravated group and the nonaggravated group, respectively, basing on whether the patients' conditions turned to critically ill or not after admission. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with COVID-19 had significant performances with coagulation dysfunction, including dramatically elevated values of FIB, PT, APTT, INR, FDP, and D-Dimers but markedly reduced AT value (P < .05). Importantly, more noteworthy coagulation disorders similar to the differences between patients and controls were found in the aggravated patients with conditions deterioration after admission than those in the nonaggravated patients without conditions deterioration (P < .05). Moreover, the aggravated patients possessed a longer hospital stay and a higher mortality compared with the nonaggravated patients (P < .001). The coagulation parameters of COVID-19 patients were widely and closely related to the indexes of liver function and inflammation (P < .05), indicating the coagulation dysfunction of these patients may be caused by liver injury and inflammatory storm. CONCLUSION: Severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection often possess coagulation dysfunction on admission.

We also discuss the implications of this functional classification for potential therapeutic avenues targeting mutant subtypes. SIGNIFICANCE: Efforts in the recent past to inhibit KRAS oncogenicity have focused on kinases that function in downstream signal transduction cascades, although preclinical successes have not translated to patients with KRAS-mutant cancer. Recently, clinically effective covalent inhibitors of KRASG12C have been developed, establishing two principles that form a foundation for future efforts. First, KRAS is druggable.

Despite governments efforts to translate World Health Organization recommendations into practice, implementation remains challenging. This review aimed to explore and compare CPT and IPT with respect to similarities and differences of barriers identified across high TB/HIV burden countries. A secondary objective was to identify facilitators for implementing both preventive therapies. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science and SCOPUS databases for peer-reviewed literature published before September 2020. We extracted and synthesized our findings using Maxqda software. We applied framework synthesis in conjunction with metasummary to compare both therapies with respect to similarities and differences of barriers identified across seven health system components (in line with the modified WHOs Framework for action). Protocol registration: PROSPERO (CRD42019137778). FINDINGS: We identified four hundred and eighty-two papers, of which we included forty for review. Although most barrier themes were identical for both preventive therapies, we identified seven intervention-specific themes. Like for CPT, barriers identified for IPT were most frequently classified as service delivery-related barriers and patient & community-related barriers. Health provider-related barriers played an important role for implementing IPT. Most facilitators identified referred to health system strengthening activities. CONCLUSIONS: For researchers with limited working experience in high TB/HIV burden countries, this review can provide valuable insights about barriers that may arise at different levels of the health system. For policymakers in high TB/HIV burden countries, this review offers strategies for improving the delivery of IPT (or any newer therapy regimen) for the prevention of TB.

Despite their limited genome size, arterivirus particles contain a multitude of membrane proteins, the Gp5/M and the Gp2/3/4 complex, the small and hydrophobic E protein and the ORF5a protein. Their function during virus entry and budding is understood only incompletely. We summarize current knowledge of their primary structure, membrane topology, (co-translational) processing and intracellular targeting to membranes of the exocytic pathway, which are the budding site. We profoundly describe experimental data that led to widely believed conceptions about the function of these proteins and also report new results about processing steps for each glycoprotein. Further, we depict the location and characteristics of epitopes in the membrane proteins since the late appearance of neutralizing antibodies may lead to persistence, a characteristic hallmark of arterivirus infection. Some molecular features of the arteriviral proteins are rare or even unique from a cell biological point of view, particularly the prevention of signal peptide cleavage by co-translational glycosylation, discovered in EAV-Gp3, and the efficient use of overlapping sequons for glycosylation. This article reviews the molecular mechanisms of these cellular processes.

Many have turned to online platforms in order to conduct criminal proceedings without undue delay. The convenience of remote proceedings has led some to advocate for their expanded use after the pandemic is over. To assess the promise and peril of online criminal justice, I surveyed state and federal judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys across Texas, where virtual proceedings have been employed for a range of criminal proceedings, starting in March 2020. The survey responses were supplemented with direct observations of remote plea hearings and the first criminal jury trial conducted via Zoom. The survey responses paint a complicated picture. They suggest that, on the whole, online proceedings can save time and resources for the participants in criminal cases and can provide broader access to the courts for the public. Yet respondents also noted the dangers of remote justice, particularly in contested or evidentiary hearings and trials. These include the inability of the parties to present evidence and confront witnesses effectively, and the challenges of providing adequate legal assistance remotely. Respondents also expressed concern that the courts perception of defendants may be negatively skewed by technology and that indigent defendants might be disproportionately harmed by the use of remote hearings. Defense attorneys were especially likely to be concerned about the use of the online format and to believe that it tends to harm their clients. Federal judges and prosecutors were also more likely than their state counterparts to be skeptical of the benefits of online criminal proceedings outside the context of the pandemic. Based on the survey responses, an analysis of scholarship and case law, and first-hand observations of virtual criminal proceedings, the Article concludes with several recommendations about the future use of online criminal justice. It argues that states should be wary of expanding the use of remote proceedings after the pandemic is over. Online technology could be used more broadly to conduct status hearings and hearings on questions of law and to increase the frequency of attorney-client consultations. Beyond these narrow circumstances, however, remote hearings post-pandemic should be used only sparingly, as they carry too many risks to the fairness of the proceedings. If jurisdictions make the choice to use virtual proceedings in circumstances beyond status hearings and legal arguments, this should be done only after obtaining an informed and voluntary consent from the defendant, and with great care taken to reduce the risks of unfairness and unreliable results.","output":"Remote Criminal Justice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is rare in infants and toddlers and is usually associated with a relatively high mortality when complicated with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

RESULTS: The longest test highlighted that during phase 2, after 8 minutes from the end of phase 1, the system acted significantly (p = 0.001) on the reduction of environmental contamination up to a mean of 70 (95% C.I. 64 - 77) CFU/500 liters (about 70% at 22 C) and 50% at 36 C. In phase 3 the mean values became 171 (144 - 198) CFU/500 liters at 22C and 259 (228-291) at 36 C. CONCLUSIONS: The system was able to significantly reduce the environmental contamination in real time. The experimental tests show how, as soon as the device is turned OFF after at least half an hour of operation, air healthiness drops dramatically within 10 minutes, bringing the levels of microbial contamination (induced by the presence of the operators in the room) to levels even higher than 150%. KEY MESSAGES: In order to convey a correct and truthful message about the disinfection capabilities of an air purification system, testing the device under real operating would be necessary. Testing the device under real operating conditions, with and without the presence of people in controlled environments, would be necessary before the final product is placed on the market.","output":"Wind of change: better air for microbial environmental control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Guided by the social-cognitive theory and job demands-resources model, this study examined how educators perceived online teaching self-efficacy and social and emotional learning (SEL) competencies concurrently and interactively influenced educators' compassion fatigue during distance learning in the COVID-19 pandemic among 321 educators in California. Survey results suggested that educators with longer years of working in education and White educators reported higher levels of compassion fatigue than their counterparts. Controlling for educators' demographic factors, online teaching self-efficacy had a negative and significant association with compassion fatigue. Moreover, the negative association between online teaching self-efficacy and compassion fatigue was intensified among educators with a higher level of SEL competencies. The findings highlight the importance of promoting educators' online teaching self-efficacy in preventing educator compassion fatigue. It also indicates that educators with higher SEL competencies were more attuned to the negative association between online teaching self-efficacy and compassion fatigue than educators with lower SEL competencies. IMPACT STATEMENT This is one of the first empirical studies examining educators' experiences with online teaching self-efficacy, compassion fatigue, and SEL competencies during the COVID-19 pandemic and distance education. It highlights the importance of promoting educators' online teaching self-efficacy and monitoring their SEL competencies in preventing compassion fatigue among educators. It also indicates that educators with a higher level of SEL competencies were more attuned to the negative influence of online teaching self-efficacy on compassion fatigue than educators with a lower SEL competency level.","output":"Online Teaching Self-Efficacy, Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) Competencies, and Compassion Fatigue Among Educators During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Tonsillectomies are among the most common surgeries in otorhinolaryngology. A novel electrosurgical temperature-controlled instrument (device) promises rapid tonsillectomies and might reduce postoperative pain, but comparative studies to assess performance are warranted. METHODS This randomized self-controlled clinical trial was conducted from October 2019 to October 2020 at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery of the Medical University of Vienna. Forty-eight patients underwent a tonsillectomy with the device on one side and using cold-steel with localized bipolar cauterization on the other side (control). Main outcomes were the time for tonsil removal (per side) and the time to stop bleeding (per side). Secondary measurements were postoperative pain, assessed once on day 0 and five times on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10. Postoperative bleeding episodes and consequences were recorded. RESULTS Device tonsillectomies were performed significantly faster than controls; the mean surgical time difference was 209 s (p < 0.001, 95% CI 129; 288). Intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower on the device side (all p < 0.05). Postoperative measurements of pain and bleeding were similar for both sides. Two return-to-theatre secondary bleeding events were recorded for the control side. CONCLUSION The novel electrosurgical temperature-controlled divider reduced the tonsillectomy surgical time and intraoperative blood loss, with no apparent negative effects on postoperative pain or bleeding, compared to a cold-steel tonsillectomy with localized bipolar cauterization. In time-restricted settings, the device could be beneficial, particularly after familiarization with device handling.

These actions have had devastating effects on the economy, but some positive effects on the environment. As the world recovers from the pandemic, we ask the following question: What is the public attitude towards climate action during COVID-19 recovery and beyond? We answer this question by analyzing discussions on the Twitter social media platform. We find that most discussions support climate action and point out lessons learned during pandemic response that can shape future climate policy, although skeptics continue to have a presence. Additionally, concerns arise in the context of climate action during the pandemic, such as mitigating the risk of COVID-19 transmission on public transit.","output":"Climate Action During COVID-19 Recovery and Beyond: A Twitter Text Mining Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) Ad26.COV2.S non-replicating viral vector vaccine, which requires only a single dose and conventional cold chain storage, is a valuable tool for COVID-19 vaccination programs in resource-limited settings. Here we show that neutralizing and binding responses to Ad26.COV2.S vaccination are stable for 6-months post-vaccination, with responses highest against the ancestral vaccine-similar D614G variant. Secondly, using longitudinal samples from individuals who experienced clinically mild breakthrough infections 3-4 months after vaccination, we show dramatically boosted binding antibodies, Fc effector function and neutralization. These responses, which are cross-reactive against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV-1, are of similar magnitude to humoral immune responses measured in severely ill, hospitalized donors. These data highlight the significant priming capacity of Ad26.COV2.S, and have implications for population immunity in areas where the single dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine has been deployed.","output":"Ad26.COV2.S breakthrough infections induce high titers of antibodies capable of neutralizing variants of concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study is aimed to help promote the development of the oral healthcare system and dental public health system in China and to help achieve the goal of improving the nation's oral health. We herein provided an overview and critical evaluation of recent developments in oral healthcare systems and dental public health systems in China and other countries, and discussed a number of potential directions for the future development of dental public health. The current global public health emergency of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was also taken into account in our discussions. Thus, to facilitate the accomplishment of the goals of the Healthy China 2030 Program, we suggested the establishment of a community-based, prevention-oriented model for the oral healthcare system and dental public health system. The model we proposed features the integration of oral and general health services, the utilization of technological innovations and big data concerning health, and a forceful promotion of remote dental services focused on prevention and early diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, under the background of COVID-19 becoming a normal part of people's lives, we should adopt differentiated prevention and protection measures and emergency response preplans appropriate for the actual epidemic situation of a particular region so that clinical services are strengthened while unnecessary wastes of resources are avoided. We should actively explore for alternative approaches to care in the face of special circumstances.","output":"[Recent Developments and Future Directions of Oral Healthcare System and Dental Public Health System in China in Light of the Current Global Emergency]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has had an unprecedented effect, especially among under-resourced minority communities. Surveillance of those at high risk is critical for preventing and controlling the pandemic. We must better understand the relationships between COVID-19-related cases or deaths and characteristics in our most vulnerable population that put them at risk to target COVID-19 prevention and management efforts. Population characteristics strongly related to United States (US) county-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths during all stages of the pandemic were identified from the onset of the epidemic and included county-level socio-demographic and comorbidities data, as well as daily meteorological modeled observation data from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), and the NARR high spatial resolution model to assess the environment. Advanced machine learning (ML) approaches were used to identify outbreaks (geographic clusters of COVID-19) and included spatiotemporal risk factors and COVID-19 vaccination efforts, especially among vulnerable and underserved communities. COVID-19 outcomes were found to be negatively associated with the number of people vaccinated and positively associated with age, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and the minority population. There was also a strong positive correlation between unauthorized immigrants and the prevalence of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Meteorological variables were also investigated, but correlations with COVID-19 were relatively weak. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact across the US population among vulnerable and minority communities. Findings also emphasize the importance of vaccinations and tailored public health initiatives (e.g., mask mandates, vaccination) to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and the number of COVID-19 related deaths across all populations.","output":"The Disproportionate Impact of COVID-19 among Undocumented Immigrants and Racial Minorities in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to prevent people from touching the floor buttons when riding in the elevator in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose a design method of elevator auxiliary control system based on speech recognition. The hardware design part of the system includes voice module, photoelectric sensor module and main control circuit module. On the basis of hardware design, the process from recognizing the voice commands of passengers in the elevator car to transmitting the recognition results to the elevator control main system is realized through programming. With the goal of improving the accuracy of speech recognition, the differential feature parameter algorithm based on the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) is used. Then, our experiments show that least mean square (LMS) adaptive filtering is an effective method for the noise reduction of the voice signal when processing passengers' commands. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Design of Elevator Auxiliary Control System Based on Speech Recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE to describe de functional development of swallowing in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19, who were submitted to a swallowing intervention.
