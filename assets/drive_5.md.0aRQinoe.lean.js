Some years ago bundle interventions have been introduced to reduce CLABSI. The use of checklists may be an additional tool to improve the effect of these bundles even in highly specialized institutions. In this study we investigate if the introduction of a checklist reduces the frequency of CLABSI. METHODS During the study period from October 2011 to September 2012, we investigated the effect of implementing a checklist for the placement of central venous lines (CVL). Patients were allocated either to the checklist group or to the control group, roughly in a 1:2 ratio. The frequency of CLABSI was compared between the two groups. RESULTS During the study period 4416 CVL were inserted; 1518 in the checklist group and 2898 in the control group. The use of the checklist during CVL placement resulted in a lower CLABSI frequency. The incidence in the checklist group was 3.8 per 1000 catheter days as compared to 5.9 per 1000 catheter days in the control group (IRR = 0.57; p = 0.001). The use of the checklist also reduced the frequency of catheter colonisation significantly, 36.3 per 1000 catheter days in the checklist group vs 21.2 per 1000 catheter days in the control group, respectively (IRR = 0.58; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION The introduction of a checklist to improve the adherence to hygiene standards while placement of central venous lines reduced the frequency of infections significantly.","output":"Efficacy of introducing a checklist to reduce central venous line associated bloodstream infections in the ICU caring for adult patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS Pediatric feeding disorder (PFD) is defined as impaired oral intake that is not age-appropriate, and is associated with medical, nutritional, feeding skill, and/or psychosocial dysfunction. As PFD is prevalent and increasing, so are publications on the topic; however, the research literature is often disparate in terminology used and siloed by discipline. Greater understanding of the current research concerning PFD will help identify areas in need of further study. The purpose of this scoping review is to examine the extent, range, and nature of research activities concerning PFD and to identify gaps in the empirical literature. METHODS Three electronic databases (PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO) were searched using terms related to pediatric feeding disorder, which include, but not limited to, \\"feeding disorder/problem/difficulty\\", \\"avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID)\\", \\"dysphagia\\", \\"selective/picky eating\\", \\"problematic mealtime behaviors\\" or \\"food refusal\\". The following limits were placed on the search: full text, humans, English, and age limit (up to 18 years old), and publication date (last 10 years). Covidence software was used to facilitate a systematic data management/analysis. Two people in the research team independently reviewed each result (screening titles and abstracts first, then moving to the full texts) to identify studies that met our inclusion/exclusion criteria and conflicts were resolved through a team discussion. Data were charted regarding disciplines of the authors, study purposes, study settings/locations, study methodologies, and study participants. Descriptive statistics and thematic analyses were used to summarize the characteristics of the studies. RESULTS The initial search resulted in 5354 articles after removing duplicates between the databases. With a final set of articles (n = 415), data charting was completed. The majority of studies were completed by authors from Psychology (n = 171) and Medicine (n = 123). The most studied aims were to examine attributes of feeding problems (n = 168) and/or factors associated with feeding problems (n = 183). Sample size median was 53. A total of 166 of the 415 studies examined the effect of an intervention, treatment, or program, but dose of the intervention was difficult or impossible to report across studies. Feeding was studied as an outcome in 400 out of the 415 studies. A closer accounting of the systematically developed parent-report tools revealed 50 distinct parent report tools used across the subset of studies utilizing parent report outcomes (n = 123). CONCLUSIONS The results of this scoping review highlight the designs and methods used in research on PFD.

Due of its blinding, it will seriously reduce the quality of life. Macular edema (ME) caused by CRVO is one of the serious complications of visual impairment. We found that the severity of ME in CRVO was positively associated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the anterior chamber. With the accelerated pace of modern life and the changed dietary structure, the incidence of this disease will continue to rise. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to seek effective treatment methods. Intraocular injection of anti-VEGF can effectively alleviate ME and improve visual acuity, showing excellent clinical application prospects. In recent years, there have been some new understandings and advances on the etiology and treatment methods of the present disease, such as the deepening into the molecular biology and gene level. Clinical studies on the efficacy of the disease have emerging. Therefore, a network meta-analysis (NMA) of anti-VEGF treatment for CRVO is particularly necessary to systematically compare its efficacy. METHODS: The two reviewers will comprehensively retrieved electronic databases such as PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Wanfang database, Web of Science, Chinese Scientifific Journals Database, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and China BioMedical Literature. A randomized controlled trial for CRVO against VEGF between January 2010 and June 2021 was included according to the relevant content of the study. In addition, 2 researchers will screen the literature to assess the risk bias for the included articles. We will evaluate the collected evidence and data using a Bayesian NMA method, and analyzed it with STATA and WinBUGS software. RESULTS: Anti-VEGF is one of the effective methods for ME in CRVO patients, accordingly, this study will evaluate its efficacy and safety using a Bayesian NMA system. CONCLUSION: This study can provide an effective rationale for the clinical application of anti-VEGF for CRVO, contribute to the treatment of CRVO and patient condition rehabilitation in clinical work.

The aim of the current study is to investigate the factors that help individuals maintain psychological well-being under the condition of self-isolation, a global restriction against the spread of the pandemic. Specifically, the role of trait emotional intelligence, self-compassion, and rumination was explored in order to determine how these variables relate to psychological well-being. According to the results, trait emotional intelligence and self-compassion positively correlate with psychological well-being, while rumination is negatively correlated. Self-compassion mediates the relationship between emotional intelligence and well-being. The relationship between rumination and well-being is affected by emotional intelligence and self-compassion: Self-compassion mediates the relationship between depression related rumination and well-being, while self-control and emotionality factors of trait emotional intelligence moderate the relationship between reflection rumination and well-being.

Instead of testing nasal swab or blood samples from individual persons, we propose to test mixtures of samples from many individuals. The pooled sample testing method proposed in this paper also serves a different purpose: for increasing test reliability and providing accurate diagnoses even if the tests themselves are not very accurate. Our method uses ideas from compressed sensing and error-correction coding to correct for a certain number of errors in the test results. The intuition is that when each individual's sample is part of many pooled sample mixtures, the test results from all of the sample mixtures contain redundant information about each individual's diagnosis, which can be exploited to automatically correct for wrong test results in exactly the same way that error correction codes correct errors introduced in noisy communication channels. While such redundancy can also be achieved by simply testing each individual's sample multiple times, we present simulations and theoretical arguments that show that our method is significantly more efficient in increasing diagnostic accuracy. In contrast to group testing and compressed sensing which aim to reduce the number of required tests, this proposed error correction code idea purposefully uses pooled testing to increase test accuracy, and works not only in the \\"undersampling\\" regime, but also in the \\"oversampling\\" regime, where the number of tests is bigger than the number of subjects.

Bilateral retinal detachments in healthy individuals are even more rare. Additionally, there are no cases to date of retinal detachment associated with either COVID-19 or after receiving the Moderna (mRNA-1273) SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. CASE REPORT: A 22-year-old female with myopia but no ocular trauma or other major past medical history presented to the emergency department with five days of progressive, painless vision loss in her right eye. On examination, her visual acuity with corrective lenses was 20/70 in the right eye, 20/20 in the left eye, and 20/25 with both eyes open. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) of the eye showed a retinal detachment in the right eye. She was subsequently seen by ophthalmology and diagnosed with bilateral retinal detachments (macula-off in the right, macula-on in the left) despite being asymptomatic in her left eye. She underwent bilateral vitrectomies for simultaneous rhegmatogenous retinal detachments.

However, uptake is considerably affected by vaccine hesitancy. An example is Malawi, with a decline in second vaccine doses and the highest cervical cancer incidence and mortality rate in Sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding vaccine hesitancy is especially important when new vaccines are introduced. This study explores factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy for routine childhood immunization and the human papillomavirus vaccine in Malawi. Methods: The study used a cross-sectional survey design targeting caregivers of children under five years old and adolescent girls. The sample population was derived using three inclusion criteria: one district with low vaccine uptake (Dowa), one district with high vaccine uptake (Salima), and one district where human papillomavirus vaccine was piloted earlier (Zomba). A convenience sample of one primary and one secondary health facility was selected within each district, and participants were systematically included (n = 600). The measures were based on 5C scale for measuring vaccine hesitancy. Multiple regression analyses were performed to explore vaccination intention predictors. Results: Confidence in vaccine safety was the strongest predictor of routine childhood immunization, followed by constraints due to everyday stress. Caregivers had lower confidence in vaccine safety and efficacy when they believed rumors and misinformation and were unemployed. Confidence was higher for those who had more trust in healthcare workers. Age, gender, religion, education, employment, belief in rumors, and trust in healthcare workers were considered predictors of vaccination intention. A husbands positive attitude (approval) increased childhood vaccination intention. For human papillomavirus, vaccination intentions were higher for those with lower education, more trust in healthcare workers, lower complacency, and a lower tendency toward calculating the benefits and risks of vaccination. Knowledge of human papillomavirus did not increase vaccination intention, but the need to attain a husbands approval did. Being a young adult and unemployed increased belief in rumors, while trust in healthcare workers reduced the belief. Conclusions: This study provides good insights into the drivers of vaccine hesitancy across different contexts in Malawi.

Evidence suggests that video consulting is acceptable, safe, and effective in selected conditions and settings. However, research to date has mostly focused on initial adoption, with limited consideration of how video consulting can be mainstreamed and sustained. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to do the following: (1) review and synthesize reported opportunities, challenges, and lessons learned in the scale-up, spread, and sustainability of video consultations, and (2) identify transferable insights that can inform policy and practice. METHODS: We identified papers through systematic searches in PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Included articles reported on synchronous, video-based consultations that had spread to more than one setting beyond an initial pilot or feasibility stage, and were published since 2010. We used the Nonadoption, Abandonment, and challenges to the Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework to synthesize findings relating to 7 domains: an understanding of the health condition(s) for which video consultations were being used, the material properties of the technological platform and relevant peripherals, the value proposition for patients and developers, the role of the adopter system, organizational factors, wider macro-level considerations, and emergence over time. RESULTS: We identified 13 papers describing 10 different video consultation services in 6 regions, covering the following: (1) video-to-home services, connecting providers directly to the patient; (2) hub-and-spoke models, connecting a provider at a central hub to a patient at a rural center; and (3) large-scale top-down evaluations scaled up or spread across a national health administration. Services covered rehabilitation, geriatrics, cancer surgery, diabetes, and mental health, as well as general specialist care and primary care. Potential enablers of spread and scale-up included embedded leadership and the presence of a telehealth champion, appropriate reimbursement mechanisms, user-friendly technology, pre-existing staff relationships, and adaptation (of technology and services) over time. Challenges tended to be related to service development, such as the absence of a long-term strategic plan, resistance to change, cost and reimbursement issues, and the technical experience of staff. There was limited articulation of the challenges to scale-up and spread of video consultations. This was combined with a lack of theorization, with papers tending to view spread and scale-up as the sum of multiple technical implementations, rather than theorizing the distinct processes required to achieve widespread adoption. CONCLUSIONS: There remains a significant lack of evidence that can support the spread and scale-up of video consulting. Given the recent pace of change due to COVID-19, a more definitive evidence base is urgently needed to support global efforts and match enthusiasm for extending use.","output":"Spread, Scale-up, and Sustainability of Video Consulting in Health Care: Systematic Review and Synthesis Guided by the NASSS Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social distancing guidelines greatly impacted the quality of life (QoL) of nursing faculty.

METHODS: Eight databases were systematically searched using keywords and indexed terms. Studies were included if they presented qualitative data from young adults aged 16C25 reporting smoking histories and/or smoking identities from countries culturally similar to the UK. A systematic and rigorous meta-ethnographic approach was employed, consistent with Noblit and Hares methodology. RESULTS: Thirty papers were included. Reasons stated for taking up smoking and becoming a smoker included alleviating stress, transforming ones identity, and coping with the transition to further education, employment or leaving home. Many used smoking to aid acceptance within new peer groups, particularly when alcohol was present. Smoking was also perceived as an act of resistance and a coping mechanism for those with marginalised identities. Barriers to quitting smoking included young adults minimisation or denial of the health risks of smoking and not identifying with being a smoker.

Patient preferences for telehealth or in-person care are an important factor in defining the role of telehealth in the postpandemic world. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain patient preferences for video visits after the ongoing COVID-19 public health emergency and to identify patient perceptions of the value of video visits and the role of out-of-pocket cost in changing patient preference for each visit modality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study was conducted using a nationally representative sample of adult members of the RAND American Life Panel. The data were obtained from the American Life Panel Omnibus Survey, which was fielded between March 8 and 19, 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Preferences for video visits vs in-person care were analyzed in the survey. The first question was about participants baseline preference for an in-person or a video visit for a nonemergency health issue. The second question entailed choosing between the preferred visit modality with a cost of $30 and another modality with a cost of $10. Questions also involved demographic characteristics, experience with video visits, willingness to use video visits, and preferences for the amount of telehealth use after the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 2080 of 3391 sampled panel members completed the survey (participation rate, 61.3%). Participants in the weighted sample had a mean (SE) age of 51.1 (0.67) years and were primarily women (1079 [51.9%]). Most participants (66.5%) preferred at least some video visits in the future, but when faced with a choice between an in-person or a video visit for a health care encounter that could be conducted either way, more than half of respondents (53.0%) preferred an in-person visit. Among those who initially preferred an in-person visit when out-of-pocket costs were not a factor, 49.8% still preferred in-person care and 23.5% switched to a video visit when confronted with higher relative costs for in-person care. In contrast, among those who initially preferred a video visit, only 18.9% still preferred a video visit and 61.7% switched to in-person visit when confronted with higher relative costs for video visits. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This survey study found that participants were generally willing to use video visits but preferred in-person care, and those who preferred video visits were more sensitive to paying out-of-pocket cost.

The combination of ipsilateral lymphadenopathy and diffuse breast edema after COVID-19 vaccination presents a clinical management challenge, as edema may obscure underlying abnormalities on imaging. We propose that, in patients with symptomatic lymphadenopathy and associated breast parenchymal abnormality, prompt action is appropriate, including diagnostic evaluation and consideration for tissue sampling. This approach may prevent delays in diagnosis and treatment for patients with malignancy masked by symptoms from the vaccination.","output":"Management Strategies for Patients Presenting With Symptomatic Lymphadenopathy and Breast Edema After Recent COVID-19 Vaccination."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transient local over-dry environment might be a contributor and an explanation for the observed asynchronous local rises in Covid-19 mortality.

Clinical education during COVID-19 has high risk of disease transmission to learners due to contamination of equipment, supplies and surfaces, in addition to increased clinical-related stress and fear. Simulation-based education (SBE) has potential to help manage the pandemic by rapidly upskilling nurses clinical responsibilities. METHODS: Upskilling of 445 non-critical care nurses was conducted using SBE between 14th March and 30 May 2020. Training consisted of completing a mandatory online critical care awareness module, followed by 3 hours of critical care simulation-based scenarios using demonstration and return-demonstration approach. RESULTS: All 445 non-critical care nurses completed required modules and simulation experiences. The critical care simulation-based upskilling programme was evaluated as an effective way to learn how to manage critically ill patients. The majority of evaluation items were rated over 95% for effectiveness of the education; four items were less than 95% (88C94%). Lower rated items considered training and practice time, improved competency and commitment to apply learning. CONCLUSION: Rapidly developed and implemented upskilling of critical care nurses was effectively accomplished with SBE. However, learners noted the need for longer learning times and increased practice opportunity to improve competency. Lack of intent to apply the patient care techniques requires further study. SBE has potential as an effective educational method for rapid preparedness in future crisis.","output":"Simulation-based education programme for upskilling non-critical care nurses for COVID-19 deployment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 outbreak has caused a pandemonium in modern world.

Molecular detection for 18 viral pathogens using multiplex polymerase chain reaction/reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions was performed. RESULTS We enrolled 1006 children less than 5 years of age of whom 423 (42%), 428 (42%) and 155 (16%) had pneumonia, bronchiolitis and unclassified lower respiratory tract infections, respectively. Of the 551 (55%) with documented viral infection, a single virus was detected in 491 (89%), including rhinovirus (n = 169; 34%), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 167; 34%), parainfluenza virus (n = 40; 8%), human metapneumovirus (n = 39; 8%), influenza virus (n = 31; 6%), bocavirus (n = 16; 3%), adenovirus (n = 15; 3%), coronavirus (n = 9; 2%) and enterovirus (n = 5; 1%).

The disease is often complicated by cytokine storm and/or a coagulopathy These two complications appear to be responsible for much of the increased mortality seen in severe COVID-19. While available treatment options including systemic corticosteroids and heparin have been beneficial in some ventilator dependent patients, mortality rates remain excessive. Several clinical trials using previously approved drugs and drug combinations are urgently underway to improve the current situation. The primary purpose of this project was to evaluate the DeepNEU stem-cell simulation platform by creating and validating computer simulations of artificial lung cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 to enable rapid identification of therapeutic targets and drug repurposing for specifically treating both the cytokine storm and coagulopathy associated with severe COVID-19. The data generated from this project confirm that (1) COVID-19 can be simulated in human alveolar type lung cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, (2) these simulated lung cells can develop features of the cytokine storm and coagulopathy that often complicate severe COVID-19, (3) the unsupervised machine learning system performed well in all COVID-19 simulations based on available published wet lab data and (4) the platform successfully identified potentially effective double drug combinations for both COVID-19 associated cytokine storm and coagulopathy for urgent clinical study. We conclude that while DeepNEU (v5.0) requires further validation, it is very likely that the most important application of this machine learning platform will be to improve our preparedness for serious future viral outbreaks and their life-threatening complications.","output":"DeepNEU: a machine learning platform for simulating Cytokine Storm and Coagulopathy that complicate severe COVID-19 to enable targeted drug repurposing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new human infectious disease.

METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively collected data from 99 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 between January 19 and February 17 in Zhejiang Province, China. We classified them into two groups based on whether the virus test results eventually became negative. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 shedding. RESULTS: Among 99 patients, 61 patients had SARS-CoV-2 clearance (virus-negative group), but 38 patients had sustained positive results (virus-positive group). The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 excretion was 15 days (IQR 12-19) among the virus-negative patients. The shedding time was significantly increased if fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA test results was positive.

It is therefore important to derive general case definitions that can be useful and accurate in the absence of timely test results. We aim to validate the World Health Organization (WHO) case definition, a symptom-screening tool currently used to identify SARS-CoV-2 cases in a cohort of symptomatic health care providers (HCP) who completed a symptom survey interview and received a PCR test at Boston Medical Center (BMC) between March 13, 2020 and May 5, 2020. METHODS: We classified each HCP as a probable or not probable case of SARS-CoV-2 based on the WHO case definition. Using PCR test as gold standard, we computed the sensitivity and specificity of the WHO case definition. We used a stepwise logistic regression model on all PCR-tested HCP to identify symptoms predictive of PCR positivity. RESULTS: Of 328 included HCP, 109 (33.2%) were PCR positive, 213 (64.9%) negative, and 6 (1.8%) had indeterminate test result. The sensitivity and specificity of the WHO case definition were 65.1% and 74.6%, respectively. The positive predictive value was 56.8% and the negative predictive value was 80.7%. Symptoms found to be predictive of PCR positivity were fever, headache, loss of smell and/or loss of taste, and muscle ache/joint pain. Sore throat was found to be predictive of PCR negativity. The area under the curve using the final model was 0.8412. All statistically significant symptoms included in the final model, were also included in the WHO case definition. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: In our largely symptomatic HCP cohort, our model yielded similar symptoms to those identified in the WHO probable case definition. As seen in similar studies, it is unlikely that further adjustment will improve the performance of a SARS-CoV-2 case definition. However, it is concerning that 35% (38/109) of PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 HCP would have been classified as not probable cases by the WHO definition, given that this definition does not even include asymptomatic cases. This is further evidence for global building of laboratory capacity and development of affordable diagnostics to improve global pandemic control.

Patients with MS are likely to depend on multiple healthcare providers and various authorities, which are often difficult to coordinate. Thus, they will probably benefit from comprehensive cross-sectoral coordination of services provided by care and case management (CCM). Though studies have shown that case management improves quality of life (QoL), functional status and reduces service use, such benefits have not yet been investigated in severely affected patients with MS. In this explorative phase ll clinical trial, we evaluated a CCM with long-term, cross-sectoral and outreaching services and, in addition, considered the unit of care (patients and caregivers). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Eighty patients with MS and their caregivers will be randomly assigned to either the control (standard care) or the intervention group (standard care plus CCM (for 12 months)). Regular data assessments will be done at baseline and then at 3-month intervals. As primary outcome, we will evaluate patients QoL. Secondary outcomes are patients treatment-related risk perception, palliative care needs, anxiety/depression, use of healthcare services, caregivers burden and QoL, meeting patients and caregivers needs, and evaluating the CCM intervention. We will also evaluate CCM through individual interviews and focus groups. The sample size calculation is based on a standardised effect of 0.5, and one baseline and four follow-up assessments (with correlation 0.5). Linear mixed models for repeated measures will be applied to analyse changes in quantitative outcomes over time. Multiple imputation approaches are taken to assess the robustness of the results. The explorative approach (phase ll clinical trial) with embedded qualitative research will allow for the development of a final design for a confirmative phase lll trial.

Therefore, the operators may consider shut in the wells. Current investigation offers an insight into the effect of near-wellbore skin buildup because of such shut-in. A series of simulation studies was performed to quantitatively address the impact of well shut-in on the long-term performance of well, in particular on key performance indicators of the well including cumulative steam to oil ratio and cumulative oil production. The long-term shut-in contributes to three main modes of plugging: (1) near-wellbore pore plugging by clays and fines, (2) scaling, and (3) chemical consolidation induced by corrosion. A series of carefully designed simulations was also utilized to understand the potential of skin buildup in the near-wellbore region and within different sand control devices. The simulation results showed a higher sensitivity of well performance to shut-in for the wells in the ITinitial stage of SAGD production. If the well is shut in during the first years, the total reduction in cumulative oil production is much higher compared to a well which is shut-in during late SAGD production life. As the induced skin due to shut-in increases, the ultimate cumulative oil production drops whose magnitude depends on well completion designs. The highest effect on the cumulative oil production is in the case of completion designs with flow control devices (liner deployed and tubing deployed completions). Therefore, wellbore hydraulics and completion design play key roles in the maintenance of uniform inflow profile, and the skin buildup due to shut-in poses a high risk of inflow problem and increases the risk of hot-spot development and steam breakthrough. This investigation offers a new understanding concerning the effect of shut-in and wellbore skin buildup on SAGD operation. It helps production and completion engineers to better understand and select candidate wells for shut-in and subsequently to minimize the skin buildup in wells.

Because nuclear factor kappa B (NF-??B) is at the bottom of many inflammatory conditions, methods to evaluate the net effect of inflammation modulators on this master regulator have been conceptualized for years. METHODS: Using an ex vivo NF-??B reporter cell line-based assay, plasma samples of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 27), psoriasis (n = 15), or severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) (n = 21) were investigated for NF-??B activation compared to plasma samples from 9 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: When separated by C-reactive protein (CRP) threshold levels, samples of patients exhibiting increased CRP levels (&#8805;5 mg/l) activated NF-??B more efficiently than samples from patients with levels below 5 mg/l (P = 0.0001) or healthy controls (P = 0.04). Overall, there was a moderate association of CRP levels with NF-??B activation (Spearman r = 0.66; p < 0.0001). Plasma from COVID-19 patients activated NF-??B more efficiently (mean 2.4-fold compared to untreated reporter cells) than samples from any other condition (healthy controls, 1.8-fold, P = 0.0025; rheumatoid arthritis, 1.7-fold, P < 0.0001; psoriasis, 1.7-fold, P < 0.0001).

After examining visual acuity, refractive defect detection, anterior and posterior segment examinations, and specular microscopy measurements were calculated from images with at least 100 cells. The mean cell density (CD), mean coefficient of variation (CV), mean hexagonal cell percentage, mean cell area (AVG), and central corneal thickness (CCT) were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean time from diagnosis of the disease in group 1 was 54.25  6.36 days. The mean time elapsed since the PCR test became negative was 38.45  6.87 days. Only four were treated in the hospital. Specular microscopy data showed that the CD was 2713.56  246.25 and 2845.80  299.27 in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.003). The CV values were 42.92  6.79 and 40.16  5.97, respectively (p = 0.009). The hexagonality were 46.51  7.35 and 49.12  6.87, respectively (p = 0.024).

We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL) from inception through June 4, 2021 to identify studies reporting data on RBC transfusions in MDS patients. Full text publications that assessed RBC transfusions as an intervention and reported at least one clinical, laboratory, or healthcare outcome associated with transfusion were included. Study characteristics, transfusion information and transfusion-related outcomes were extracted and reported. We identified 1243 original studies, of which 38 met eligibility requirements and were included. Fourteen reported on survival following diagnosis of MDS, with the majority reporting poorer survival among patients receiving or requiring more frequent transfusions. Nine reported on transfusion-related iron overload and its complications. Other outcomes included rates of allo/autoimmunization and adverse transfusion reactions, and healthcare costs incurred by patients with a greater transfusion burden. Only two studies reported on symptom relief following transfusion. This review underscores transfusion dependence as a negative prognostic factor for MDS patients and highlights the paucity of evidence surrounding quality of life and symptom-related outcomes following RBC transfusions in this population.

To facilitate adoption of multiple health technologies across a hospital setting, four Virtual Health Resource Centers (VHRCs) were established to provide clinical adoption support to healthcare staff and patients in four hospitals in a large healthcare system. This study spanned a 3-year period, with the first half including pre-implementation efforts, and the second half involved in implementation efforts. In order to compare sites to the national population, a binomial regression was used which allowed for adjustment of relevant covariates (e.g., differences in number of enrollees, level of complexity of facility). The pre-implementation phase and the initial year-and-a-half of the implementation phase resulted in an increase in internal facilitators knowledge and skills of virtual care technologies, an increase in facilitator and site capacity, and high levels of adherence to implementation strategies were maintained across sites. Virtual care utilization increased across all sites and across the healthcare system during the implementation phase; however, a comparison to the increase in national level virtual care utilization metrics yielded no meaningful difference. While many implementation strategies aim to increase the adoption of a particular health technology product (e.g., a particular app or remote monitoring use case), the establishment of VHRCs may increase efficiencies in delivery of virtual care training and consultation to healthcare staff and patients, which may increase capacity and decrease barriers to adoption. However, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the need for rapid adoption of technology and decreased in person care and services, it is not yet known the longer term impact that the establishment of VHRCs may have on the sustained adoption of health technologies.","output":"Results and Lessons Learned when Implementing Virtual Health Resource Centers to Increase Virtual Care Adoption During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 global health crisis has required direct governmental intervention in both social and economic spheres on a scale not seen in recent times in most European countries.

Any technological tool enabling rapid screening of the COVID-19 infection with high accuracy can be crucially helpful to the healthcare professionals. The main clinical tool currently in use for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is expensive, less-sensitive and requires specialized medical personnel. X-ray imaging is an easily accessible tool that can be an excellent alternative in the COVID-19 diagnosis. This research was taken to investigate the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The aim of this paper is to propose a robust technique for automatic detection of COVID-19 pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images applying pre-trained deep-learning algorithms while maximizing the detection accuracy. A public database was created by the authors combining several public databases and also by collecting images from recently published articles. The database contains a mixture of 423 COVID-19, 1485 viral pneumonia, and 1579 normal chest X-ray images. Transfer learning technique was used with the help of image augmentation to train and validate several pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The networks were trained to classify two different schemes: i) normal and COVID-19 pneumonia; ii) normal, viral and COVID-19 pneumonia with and without image augmentation. The classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity for both the schemes were 99.7%, 99.7%, 99.7% and 99.55% and 97.9%, 97.95%, 97.9%, and 98.8%, respectively. The high accuracy of this computer-aided diagnostic tool can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis.

A database search was conducted using PubMed, Medline, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Library.

The primary outcome of this review was subsequent presentation to an ED following a non-transport decision. Secondary outcome measures included hospital admission, subsequent presentation to alternative service provider (e.g. private physician), and death at follow up. The search yielded 1953 non-duplicate articles, of which 10 met the inclusion criteria. Three studies specified that the non-transport decision was emergency medical services (EMS)-initiated, seven studies did not specify. Meta-analysis found substantial heterogeneity between estimates (I2 >50%) that was likely because of differences in study design, length of follow up, patient demographic and sample size. Between 5% and 46% (pooled estimate 21%; 95% CI 11-31%) of non-transport patients subsequently presented to ED. Few (pooled estimate 8%; 95% CI 5-12%) EMS-initiated non-transport patients were admitted to hospital compared to the unspecified group (pooled estimate 40%; 95% CI 7-72%). Mortality rates were low across included studies. Studies found varying estimates for the proportion of patients discharged at the scene that subsequently presented to ED. Few patients were admitted to hospital when the non-transport decision was initiated by EMS, indicating EMS triage is a relatively safe practice.

The aim is to understand the role of benzodiazepines in precipitating delirium and advanced mortality in palliative care population at the end of life. METHODS A retrospective medical chart review was conducted at a hospice and palliative care inpatient unit between the periods of June 2017-December 2017 and October 2017-November 2018. It included patients in hospice and palliative care inpatient units who received a benzodiazepine and those who did not. Patient characteristics, as well as Palliative Performance Scale score, diagnosis, and occurrence of admission, terminal, and/or recurrent delirium, were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Use of a benzodiazepine was not significantly associated with overall mortality nor cause-specific death without terminal delirium rate. However, it was significantly associated with higher cause-specific death with terminal delirium rate and a higher recurrent delirium rate. DISCUSSION This retrospective chart review suggests an association between benzodiazepine use and specific states of delirium and cause-specific death. However, it does not provide strong evidence on the use of this drug, especially at the end of life, as it pertains to the overall mortality rate.

The ATP required by intracellular organelles is amply available in the cytosol, largely generated by mitochondria. However, such is not the case for cilia and flagella, whose slender structures cannot accommodate mitochondria.

RESULTS The development set for GPA consisted of 578 cases of GPA and 652 comparators. The validation set consisted of an additional 146 cases of GPA and 161 comparators. From 91 candidate items, regression analysis identified 26 items for GPA, 10 of which were retained. The final criteria and their weights were as follows: bloody nasal discharge, nasal crusting, or sino-nasal congestion (+3); cartilaginous involvement (+2); conductive or sensorineural hearing loss (+1); cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) or anti-proteinase 3 ANCA positivity (+5); pulmonary nodules, mass, or cavitation on chest imaging (+2); granuloma or giant cells on biopsy (+2); inflammation or consolidation of the nasal/paranasal sinuses on imaging (+1); pauci-immune glomerulonephritis (+1); perinuclear ANCA or antimyeloperoxidase ANCA positivity (-1); and eosinophil count 1  109 /liter (-4). After excluding mimics of vasculitis, a patient with a diagnosis of small- or medium-vessel vasculitis could be classified as having GPA if the cumulative score was 5 points. When these criteria were tested in the validation data set, the sensitivity was 93% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 87-96%) and the specificity was 94% (95% CI 89-97%). CONCLUSION The 2022 American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology classification criteria for GPA demonstrate strong performance characteristics and are validated for use in research.","output":"2022 American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology Classification Criteria for Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study evaluated the antimicrobial and antioxidant effects of the combinations of nisin (NS), tea polyphenols (TP), rosemary extract (RE) and chitosan (CS) on low-temperature chicken sausage.

This study assesses the relationship between visible fractures on the top and bottom of core samples and the resulting hydraulic and mass transport properties of the core. We hypothesized that more visible fractures would indicate the presence of a well-connected fracture network, leading to greater hydraulic conductivity (K) values and earlier chemical breakthrough times. To test this hypothesis, water flow and bromide (Br-) tracer experiments were performed on ten, 16-cm diameter, 16-cm-tall samples of fractured Dows Formation till from central Iowa. Visually identifiable fractures were present on the top and bottom of every sample. Results indicate that the visual identification of fractures does not predict a connected fracture network, as some samples produced breakthrough curves showing rapid first arrival times and shapes characteristic of solute transport in a fractured medium, while others appeared similar to an unfractured medium. No correlation was found between the number of visible fractures and K (Pearson's r = 0.25), or Br- first arrival time (r = -0.33), but a strong negative correlation between K and first arrival time (r = -0.92). Results indicate that the sample volume was not large enough to reliably contain a connected fracture network. Thus, testing large volumes of till at the field scale coupled with fracture-flow modeling likely represents the best approach for estimating hydraulic and mass transport properties for fractured till.

System Dynamics is a well-established computer-based simulation modeling methodology for analyzing complex social systems that are difficult to change and predict. This approach has been applied for decades to a wide variety of issues of healthcare and other types of service capacity and delivery, and more recently, to some issues of disaster planning and mitigation. The study will use the System Dynamics approach to create computer simulation models as what-if tools for disaster preparedness planners. We have recently applied the approach to the issue of hospital surge capacity, and have reached some preliminary conclusions C for example, on the question of where in the hospital to place supplementary nursing staff during a severe infectious disease outbreaksome of which we had not expected. Other hospital disaster preparedness issues well suited to System Dynamics analysis include sustaining employee competence and reducing turnover, coordination of medical care and public health resources, and hospital coordination with the wider community to address mass casualties. The approach may also be applied to preparedness issues for agencies other than hospitals, and could help to improve the interactions among all agencies represented in a community's local emergency planning committee. The simulation models will support an evidence-based approach to rural disaster planning, helping to tie empirical data to decision-making. Disaster planners will be able to simulate a wide variety of scenarios, learn responses to each and develop principles or best practices that apply to a broad spectrum of disaster scenarios. These skills and insights would improve public health practice and be of particular use in the promotion of injury and disease prevention programs and practices.","output":"Systems modeling in support of evidence-based disaster planning for rural areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Introduction: The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created unprecedented challenges for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and for the delivery of health care and human services to the American people HHS leads the Federal public health and medical response during public health emergencies This plan sets forth the four goals that drive the Office of Inspector General's (OIG's) strategic planning and mission execution with respect to HHS's COVID-19 response and recovery These goals are to (1) protect people, (2) protect funds, (3) protect infrastructure, and (4) promote effectiveness of HHS programs--now and into the future This plan highlights our main objectives and ongoing and potential OIG work to advance each goal COVID-19 (Disease);Disaster response--Plans;Emergency management","output":"OIG Strategic Plan: Oversight of COVID-19 Response and Recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic of COVID-19 caused thousands of deaths and healthcare professionals struggle to properly manage infected patients.

There is an opportunity to complement these trials with investigation of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) because an ARB (losartan) was effective in murine influenza pneumonia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Our innovative design includes: ARBs; alignment with the WHO Ordinal Scale (primary endpoint) to align with other COVID-19 trials; joint longitudinal analysis; and predictive biomarkers (angiotensins I, 1C7, II and ACE1 and ACE2). Our hypothesis is: ARBs decrease the need for hospitalisation, severity (need for ventilation, vasopressors, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or renal replacement therapy) or mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 infected adults. Our two-pronged multicentre pragmatic observational cohort study examines safety and effectiveness of ARBs in (1) hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 and (2) out-patients already on or not on ARBs. The primary outcome will be evaluated by ordinal logistic regression and main secondary outcomes by both joint longitudinal modelling analyses. We will compare rates of hospitalisation of ARB-exposed versus not ARB-exposed patients. We will also determine whether continuing ARBs or not decreases the primary outcome. Based on published COVID-19 cohorts, assuming 15% of patients are ARB-exposed, a total sample size of 497 patients can detect a proportional OR of 0.5 (alpha=0.05, 80% power) comparing WHO scale of ARB-exposed versus non-ARB-exposed patients.

However, various facets of diarrheal disease caused by coronavirus and rotavirus in calves in Ethiopia are inadequately understood. A cross-sectional study was conducted with the aim of isolation and molecular characterization of coronavirus and rotavirus from calves in the central part of Oromia (Bishoftu, Sebata, Holeta, and Addis Ababa), Ethiopia, from November 2018 to May 2019. The four study areas were purposively selected and faecal samples were collected by simple random sampling for diagnosis of coronavirus and rotavirus infection by using the antigen detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Ag-ELISA) kit. In addition, this study was carried out to have insight in prevalence and associated risk factors of coronavirus and rotavirus infection in calves. RESULT: During the study, 83 diarrheic and 162 nondiarrheic faecal samples collected from calves less than 4 weeks of age were screened for coronavirus and rotavirus. Of the 83 diarrheic samples, 1 sample (1.2%) was positive for coronavirus antigen and 6 samples (7.2%) were found to be positive for rotavirus antigen by Ag-ELISA. All the nondiarrheic samples were negative for both coronavirus and rotavirus Ag. The overall prevalence of coronavirus and rotavirus infection in calves was estimated at 0.4% (1/245) and 2.45% (6/245), respectively. All samples (7) of ELISA test positive of both coronavirus and rotavirus were propagated in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. After 3 subsequent passages, progressive cytopathic effect (CPE), i.e., rounding, detachment, and the destruction of monolayer cell of five samples (1 sample of coronavirus and 4 samples of rotavirus) (71.4%) were observed. At the molecular stage, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was used to determine the presence of coronavirus and rotavirus nucleic acid by using specific primers. The 5 samples that were coronavirus and rotavirus antigen positive by ELISA and develop CPE on cell culture were also positive on RT-PCR technique. The prevalence of infection peaked at 1st and 2nd weeks of age in male calves. CONCLUSION: Diarrheal disease caused by coronavirus and rotavirus has a great health problem in calves that interrupts production benefits with reduced weight gain and increased mortality and its potential for zoonotic spread. So, the present findings show coronavirus and rotavirus infection in calves in Ethiopia that needs to be addressed by practising early colostrum feeding in newborn calves, using vaccine, or improving livestock management.","output":"Isolation and Characterization of Coronavirus and Rotavirus Associated with Calves in Central Part of Oromia, Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges for instructors who seek high-impact educational practices that can be facilitated online without creating excessive burdens with technology, grading, or enforcement of honor codes. These practices must also account for the possibility that some students may need to join courses asynchronously and have limited or unreliable connectivity. Of the American Association of Colleges and University's list of 11 high-impact educational practices, writing-intensive courses may be the easiest for science faculty to adopt during these difficult times.

Furthermore, writing assignments can be incredibly flexible in terms of how they are implemented online and can be designed to reduce the possibility of cheating and plagiarism. To accelerate the adoption of writing pedagogies, we summarize evidence-based characteristics of effective writing assignments and offer a sample writing assignment from an introductory ecology course. We then suggest five strategies to help instructors manage their workload.

We managed to release doctors to support other departments, ensuring that surgical inpatients were receiving the pre-COVID-19 standards of care. We, also, created a buddy system, predicting possible COVID-19 sickness in the on-call or the ward-cover team. On this contingency rota, there was a ward cover team with one SHO, three FY1s and two registrars, including the team for ITU support and a standby ward-cover team. Two of the FY1 doctors were redeployed to reinforce Acute Medicine. There was constant feedback via a WhatsApp group from the on-call and the ward-cover team to recruit help from the standby teamAll doctors who were part of this rota were invited to provide feedback via a satisfaction survey. Out of 13 responses, 61.54% replied that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the contingency rota, and 76.92% replied that the rota was fair to very fair.

Infiltrating leukocytes, cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells secrete MMP-9 during all phases of cardiac repair. MMP-9 both exacerbates the inflammatory response and aids in inflammation resolution by stimulating the pro-inflammatory to reparative cell transition. In addition, MMP-9 has a dual effect on neovascularization and prevents an overly stiff scar. Here, we review the complex role of MMP-9 in cardiac wound healing, and highlight the importance of targeting MMP-9 only for its detrimental actions.

The results show the importance of early intervention: shutdowns and mask mandates reduced the COVID-19 infection growth rate immediately after being imposed statewide. Over the longer term, mask mandates had a larger effect on flattening the curve than shutdowns. The increase in the daily infection growth rate pushed state governments to shut down, but reopening led to significant increases in new cases 21 days afterward. The results suggest a dynamic social distancing approach: a shutdown for a short period followed by reopening, combined with universal mask wearing. We also found that the COVID-19 growth rate increased in states with higher percentages of essential workers (during reopening) and higher percentages of minorities (during the mask mandate period). Health insurance access for low-income workers (via Medicaid expansion) helped to reduce COVID-19 cases in the reopening model. The implications for public health show the importance of access to health insurance and mask mandates to protect low-income essential workers, but minority groups still face a higher risk of infection during the pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 Policy Differences across US States: Shutdowns, Reopening, and Mask Mandates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regional economic patterns affect the resiliency of geographic regions with regards to business cycle shocks.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between July 2009 and April 2013, we treated 200 clinically localized prostate cancer patients with high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapyintensity modulated radiation therapy. Half of the patients received a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided transperineal injection of 10mL PEG hydrogel (DuraSeal? Spinal Sealant System; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) in their anterior perirectal fat immediately prior to the first HDR brachytherapy treatment and 5mL PEG hydrogel prior to the second HDR brachytherapy treatment. Prostate, rectal, and bladder doses and prostate-rectal distances were calculated based upon treatment planning CT scans. RESULTS There was a success rate of 100% (100/100) with PEG hydrogel implantation. PEG hydrogel significantly increased the prostate-rectal separation (meanSD, 124mm with gel vs. 42mm without gel, p<0.001) and significantly decreased the mean rectal D2 mL (479% with gel vs. 608% without gel, p<0.001).

The performance of the MaelstromTM 8 (Taiwan Advanced Nanotech) and the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) were compared for the extraction of nucleic acid from viral transport medium. The extracts were used for the validation of the RNA extraction procedures. The RNase P target was amplified in a one-step reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) reaction, as internal control for the extraction method. RESULTS: In this study, the agreement between the two methods was good and Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was 0.919 (p < 0.001). The mean cycle threshold value of the two methods was 29.1.

The main goals of therapy are to restore hydration and electrolyte concentrations, correct strong ion (metabolic) acidemia, and provide nutritional support. Administration of oral electrolyte solutions (OES) has long been the primary method used to treat neonatal diarrhea in humans and calves because OES are capable of addressing each of the primary goals of therapy. In calves with moderate dehydration, we hypothesized that oral electrolytes would be as good as or better than small volumes of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) fluids. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to compare the ability of a commercially available oral electrolyte solution (OES) administered alone or in combination with hypertonic saline with small volumes of IV or SC fluid therapy to resuscitate calves with diarrhea. Thirty-three Holstein calves from 5 to 14 d of age were utilized in this clinical trial. Diarrhea and dehydration were induced by adding sucrose to the milk replacer. In addition, hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone were given orally and furosemide intramuscularly. Depression status, clinical hydration scores, fecal consistency, and body weight were recorded at regular intervals. Treatment began when calves had severe diarrhea and had a decrease in plasma volume of at least 10%. Calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups of 8 to 9 calves per group: (1) OES; (2) OES with hypertonic saline (4 mL/kg, IV); (3) IV fluids (lactated Ringer's, 2 L); or (4) SC fluids (lactated Ringer's, 2 L). Treatments were given at 0 and 12 h. Changes in plasma volume, blood pH, electrolyte levels, and physical examination scores were determined before therapy and again at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after each treatment. All 4 treatments were ultimately successful in improving hydration as well as increasing blood pH; however, animals in both groups that received OES had much faster resuscitation than those in either the IV or SC fluid group. In conclusion, oral electrolyte products remain the gold standard for resuscitating diarrheic calves with moderate dehydration and acidemia and will likely perform better than small volumes of IV lactated Ringer's solution. Subcutaneous fluids by themselves are a poor treatment option and should be only be used as supportive therapy following the initial correction of hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis.","output":"Comparison of oral, intravenous, and subcutaneous fluid therapy for resuscitation of calves with diarrhea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The research landscape in science and engineering is heavily reliant on computation and data storage.

In many cases, ARTs can be viewed as environmentally-cued threshold traits, such that ARTs coexist if their relative fitness alternates over the environmental cue gradient. Surprisingly, the chemical ecology of ARTs has been underexplored in this context. To our knowledge, no prior study has directly quantified pheromone production for ARTs in a male-polymorphic species. Here, we used the bulb mitein which males are either armed fighters that kill conspecifics, or unarmed scramblersas a model system to gain insight into the role of pheromones in the evolutionary maintenance of ARTs. Given that scramblers forgo investment into weaponry, we tested whether scramblers produce higher pheromone quantities than fighters, which would improve the fitness of the scrambler phenotype, e.g. through female mimicry to avoid aggression from competitors. To this end, we sampled mites from a rich and a poor nutritional environment and quantified their production of the female sex pheromone -acaridial through gas chromatography analysis. Results We found a positive relationship between pheromone production and body size, but males exhibited a steeper slope in pheromone production with increasing size than females. Females exhibited a higher average pheromone production than males. We found no significant difference in slope of pheromone production over body size between fighters and scramblers. However, scramblers reached larger body sizes and higher pheromone production than fighters, providing some evidence for a potential female mimic strategy adopted by large scramblers. Pheromone production was significantly higher in mites from the rich nutritional environment than the poor environment. Conclusion Further elucidation of pheromone functionality in bulb mites, and additional inter-and intrasexual comparisons of pheromone profiles are needed to determine if the observed intersexual and intrasexual differences in pheromone production are adaptive, if they are a by-product of allometric scaling, or diet-mediated pheromone production under weak selection. We argue chemical ecology offers a novel perspective for research on ARTs and other complex life-history traits.","output":"Toward an understanding of the chemical ecology of alternative reproductive tactics in the bulb mite (Rhizoglyphus robini)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper discusses the uneven consequences of the macroeconomic fallout from the Coronavirus and related economic policy responses against the background of an analysis of longer-term macroeconomic divergence in the Eurozone We show that the macroeconomic impact of the Corona crisis is estimated to be more severe in Southern Eurozone countries than in Northern Eurozone countries, which further reinforces the tendency of an increasing economic polarisation This polarisation process can be traced back to existing differences in production structures and uneven vulnerabilities of the underlying growth models As a consequence, any policy response to the Corona crisis that does not take the deeper problems of structural polarisation into account will suffer from limited impact in the medium to long run","output":"Pandemic pushes polarisation: the Corona crisis and macroeconomic divergence in the Eurozone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vpu, an integral membrane protein encoded in HIV-1, is implicated in the release of new virus particles from infected cells, presumably mediated by ion channel activity of homo-oligomeric Vpu bundles.

This ester group has striking effects on many biological phenomena, including microbe-host interactions, complement action, regulation of immune responses, sialidase action, cellular apoptosis, and tumor immunology. Despite such findings, 9-O-acetyl sialoglycoconjugates have remained largely understudied, primarily because of marked lability of the 9-O-acetyl group to even small pH variations and/or the action of mammalian or microbial esterases. Our current studies involving 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans on glycan microarrays revealed that even the most careful precautions cannot ensure complete stability of the 9-O-acetyl group. We now demonstrate a simple chemical biology solution to many of these problems by substituting the oxygen atom in the ester with a nitrogen atom, resulting in sialic acids with a chemically and biologically stable 9-N-acetyl group. We present an efficient one-pot multienzyme method to synthesize a sialoglycan containing 9-acetamido-9-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac9NAc) and compare it to the one with naturally occurring 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2). Conformational resemblance of the two molecules was confirmed by computational molecular dynamics simulations. Microarray studies showed that the Neu5Ac9NAc-sialoglycan is a ligand for viruses naturally recognizing Neu5,9Ac2, with a similar affinity but with much improved stability in handling and study. Feeding of Neu5Ac9NAc or Neu5,9Ac2 to mammalian cells resulted in comparable incorporation and surface expression as well as binding to 9-O-acetyl-Sia-specific viruses. However, cells fed with Neu5Ac9NAc remained resistant to viral esterases and showed a slower turnover.

Patients with eosinophil counts less than 0.0210(9)/L were considered to have eosinopenia. Individuals with chronic respiratory diseases (n = 384) were classified according to their particular underlying condition, i.e., asthma, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, or obstructive sleep apnea.

China has experienced a long period without indigenous cases, unfortunately, multi local outbreaks caused by imported cases and other factors have been reported, posing great challenges to COVID-19 prevention and control in China. Thus it is necessary to explore the mechanisms of the re-emerged COVID-19 epidemics and their differences. Methods: Based on susceptible exposed infectious recovered (SEIR) epidemic dynamics model, we developed a set of novel evolution equations which can describe the dynamic processes of integrated influence of interventions, vaccination coverage and individual behavior changes on the re-emergency of COVID-19 epidemic. We developed methods to calculate the optimal intervention intensity and vaccination rate at which the size of susceptible population can be reduced to less than threshold for the re-emergency of COVID-19 epidemic. Results: If strong interventions or super interventions are lifted too early, even a small cause can lead to the re-emergence of COVID-19 epidemic at different degrees. Moreover, the stronger the early control measures lifted are, the more severe the epidemic is. The individual behavior changes for the susceptibility to the epidemic and the enhancement or lifting of prevention and control measures are key factors to influence the incidence the multi outbreaks of COVID-19.

RECENT FINDINGS: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the principal host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 (TMRSS2) is the main priming protease. Models have linked atopic endotypes to reductions in ACE2 and increases in TMRSS2 on respiratory epithelia. Epidemiologic and experimental findings imply alterations in ACE2 expression correlate with clinical COVID-19 disease, but limitations restrict the ability to draw direct conclusions. SUMMARY: There is reasonable evidence to assert atopic endotypes modulate COVID-19 susceptibility, but it remains premature to classify this association as protective or deleterious. Asthma is a heterogeneous disease and epidemiologic studies should focus on investigating COVID-19 outcomes by underlying endotype. Direct experimental and clinical evidence is needed to draw definitive conclusions on how the complex interplay of ACE2 and TMRSS2 affect viral entry.

SOURCES: This scoping review was conducted using PRISMA methodology. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials. Search strategies were developed with a medical librarian and revised through a peer review of electronic search strategies. All databases were searched from inception to 14 April 2020. Only full-text articles available in English were included. All identified articles were reviewed independently and in duplicate using predetermined criteria. All study designs were eligible if they reported on comfort-holding in a PICU. Data were extracted independently and in duplicate. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Of 13,326 studies identified, 13 were included. Comfort-holding was studied in the context of end-of-life care, developmental care, mobilization, and as a unique intervention. Comfort-holding is common during end-of-life care with 77.8% of children held, but rare during acute management (51% of children < three years, < 5% of children  three years). Commonly reported outcomes included child outcomes (e.g., physiologic measurements), safety outcomes (e.g., accidental line removal), parent outcomes (e.g., psychological symptoms), and frequency of holding. CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of literature on comfort-holding in PICUs. This scoping review identifies significant gaps in the literature, including assessment of child-based outcomes of comfort-holding or safety assessment of comfort-holding, and highlights core outcomes to consider in future evaluations of this intervention including child-based outcomes, parent-based outcomes, and safety of the intervention.

Novel test strategies are urgently needed to ensure safe operation of schools and childcare institutions and to avoid prolonged closures. Methods A weekly SARS-CoV-2 sentinel study in primary schools, kindergartens and childcare facilities over a 12 week period was conducted. In total, 3123 concurrent oropharyngeal and saliva samples were processed for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR testing in both children (n=2104) and staff (n=1019). Saliva sampling was optimised, and a novel sampling system was introduced and assessed for feasibility, the Salivette system. Results For children across all age groups a mean of 1,18 ml saliva could be obtained with this easy-to-handle system. Using 1293 concurrent oropharyngeal swabs from children, staff and participants of a positive control cohort as reference, the Salivette testing method could be assigned an overall specificity of 99.8% and sensititity of 95.1%. Of note clinical sensitivity defined as detection of positive cases with an oropharyngeal-swab derived Ct value < 33, was 100%. Comparative analysis of Ct values derived from saliva vs. oropharyngeal swabs demonstrated a significant difference (mean difference 4.23 (95% CI 2.48 to 6.00). Conclusions The Salivette system is an easy-to-use, safe and feasible collection method for saliva sampling and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 testing in children aged 3 years and above. In view of the excellent sensitivity and specificity documented in our study, this novel testing approach is a very reliable and much more pleasant alternative to oropharyngeal swab based testing, particularly in children and for self-testing in the home setting.","output":"Feasibility and accuracy of a novel saliva sampling method for large-scale SARS-CoV-2 screening in children < 12 years of age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the latest evidence on the association between cerebrovascular, and cardiovascular diseases and poor outcome in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. METHODS A comprehensive systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, SCOPUS, EuropePMC, and Cochrane Central Database. The outcome of interest was composite poor outcome that comprised of mortality and severe COVID-19. RESULTS A total of 4448 patients were obtained from 16 studies. Cerebrovascular disease was associated with an increased composite poor outcome (RR 2.04 [1.43,2.91], p<0.001; I2: 77%). Subgroup analysis revealed that cerebrovascular disease was associated with mortality (RR 2.38 [1.92,2.96], p<0.001; I2: 0%) and showed borderline significance for severe COVID-19 (RR 1.88 [1.00,3.51], p = 0.05; I2: 87%).

Changes are described in vaccination coverage and the numbers of unvaccinated and undervaccinated children as measured by receipt of the first and third doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP) in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic began, compared with 2019. Global estimates of coverage with the third dose of DTP (DTP3) and a polio vaccine (Pol3) decreased from 86% in 2019 to 83% in 2020. Similarly, coverage with the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) dropped from 86% in 2019 to 84% in 2020. The last year that coverage estimates were at 2020 levels was 2009 for DTP3 and 2014 for both MCV1 and Pol3. Worldwide, 22.7 million children (17% of the target population) were not vaccinated with DTP3 in 2020 compared with 19.0 million (14%) in 2019. Children who did not receive the first DTP dose (DTP1) by age 12 months (zero-dose children) accounted for 95% of the increased number. Among those who did not receive DTP3 in 2020, approximately 17.1 million (75%) were zero-dose children. Global coverage decreased in 2020 compared with 2019 estimates for the completed series of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV), and rubella-containing vaccine (RCV).

Despite increasing cases in rural communities across America, surveys have revealed that residents may feel less threatened by the virus compared to their urban counterparts. This difference in attitude and information appraisal can negatively affect rural health by discouraging coronavirus disease (COVID-19) preventative behaviors. Understanding social influences that contribute to the formation of opinions about the pandemic can help public health officials and clinicians better address rural health. Methodology This cross-sectional study surveyed 299 participants from three primary care clinics in Shiawassee County of Michigan during a seven-week interval. Statistical analysis, primarily through SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), included descriptive statistics, multiple linear regression models, paired t-tests, and correlation coefficients. A p-value less than or equal to 0.05 was considered significant. Results Patients believed the risk COVID-19 posed to their family was significantly higher than the risk it posed to themselves (p < 0.001). Patients who reported that they would follow their providers advice for treatment of a non-COVID-19 medical illness were found to be more likely to follow a providers advice on COVID-19 (p < 0.001). However, patients overall were more agreeable with following provider advice for non-COVID-19 medical illnesses than they were for COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Conclusions As patients were more agreeable with following medical advice on chronic conditions than COVID-19, there may be extrinsic factors influencing patient views of COVID-19. Polarization of COVID-19 in the media has heavily influenced attitudes toward the virus in America. Initiatives to provide reliable patient education is key to encouraging constructive discussions and a healthy rural community. In a strong patient-provider relationship, primary care providers can share and encourage appropriate healthy behaviors regarding COVID-19, which have a direct impact on community health.","output":"Patients Attitudes and Sources of Information on Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Rural Michigan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Poaching activity has been described in the literature as harmful due to impacts on biodiversity, especially in protected areas. Although the main reason for this activity is subsistence, in many regions motivation goes beyond the limits of food necessity. We applied single-species, single season occupancy models to evaluate the spatial distribution of poachers and identify potential poaching hotspots in a mosaic of protected areas in the Caatinga domain, northeastern Brazil. We used camera-traps over a period of 200 days at 60 sites randomly selected. We used distances from human settlements, roads and the nearest water holes, frequency of game species and sampling effort as covariables that could influence poachers' occupancy and detectability and to identify potential poaching areas. Occupancy poachers were higher in sites with higher frequency of game species. Frequency of game species and distance from roads had a negative effect on the detectability of poachers. Spatial analysis indicated three critical poaching areas within and around the Boqueir?o da On?a National Park, associated with roads and some isolated cattle and goat farms. In this study, we provided an assessment of poaching spatial patterns in relation to different landscape elements and biotic influences, indicating critical areas where enforcement efforts should be focused. Hotspots are clearly concentrated within and on the edge of National Park.

ObjectivePerform a meta-analysis of the available randomized clinical trial evidence for fluvoxamine in the outpatient management of COVID-19. Data SourcesWorld Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Study SelectionCompleted outpatient trials with available results which compared fluvoxamine to placebo. Data Extraction and SynthesisWe followed the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. We extracted study details in terms of inclusion criteria, trial demographics and the pre-specified outcome of all-cause hospitalization. Risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. We conducted a frequentist random effects meta-analysis, as well as two sensitivity analyses using a Bayesian random effects meta-analysis with different estimates of prior probability: a weakly neutral prior (50% chance of efficacy with 95% confidence interval for Risk Ratio [RR] between 0.5 and 2) and a moderately optimistic prior (85% chance of efficacy). We contextualized the results by estimating the probability of any effect (RR []1) and moderate effect (RR []0.9) on reducing hospitalization. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)All cause hospitalization. Results2196 participants were included from 3 identified trials. The risk ratios for hospitalization were 0.75 (95%CI, 0.57-0.97) for the frequentist analysis, 0.78 (95%CI 0.58-1.08) for the Bayesian weakly neutral prior, and 0.73 (95%CI, 0.53-1.01) for the Bayesian moderately optimistic prior. Depending on the scenario, the probability of any effect on hospitalization ranged from 94.1% to 98.3% and a moderate effect from 81.6% to 91.1%. Conclusions and RelevanceUnder a variety of assumptions, fluvoxamine shows a high probability of preventing hospitalization in outpatients with COVID-19. While ongoing randomized trials are important to evaluate alternative doses, explore the effectiveness in vaccinated patients, and provide further refinement to these estimates, fluvoxamine could be recommended as a treatment option, particularly in resource-limited settings or persons without access to SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody therapy or direct antivirals.

In order to assess a potential harmful effect of a mechanical thrombectomy on patient outcome, the number of retrieval attempts was analyzed. Only patients with a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) score of 0 were reviewed to exclude the impact of eventual successful reperfusion on the mechanical hazardousness of repeated retrievals. METHODS In this study 6635 patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute large vessel occlusion (LVO) from the prospectively administered multicenter German Stroke Registry were screened. Insufficient reperfusion was defined as no reperfusion (TICI score of 0), whereas a primary outcome was defined as functional independence (modified Rankin scale [mRS] 0-2 at day 90). Propensity score matching and multivariable logistic regressions were then performed to adjust for confounders. RESULTS A total of 377 patients (7.8%) had a final TICI score of 0 and were included in the study. After propensity score matching functional independence was found to be significantly more frequent in patients who underwent  2 retrieval attempts (14%), compared to patients with > 2 retrieval attempts (3.9%, OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.07-0.73, p = 0.009). After adjusting for age, sex, admission NIHSS score, and location of occlusion, more than two retrieval attempts remained significantly associated with lower odds of functional independence at 90 days (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.07-0.52, p = 0.002).

It is an uncommon syndrome with elusive pathophysiologic mechanisms. We observed POS in patients of moderate COVID-19 who required hospital admission to our indoor facility and oxygen supplementation when saturation was documented in sitting and supine positions for evaluation of platypnea. Materials and methods: We conducted an observational, cross sectional, retrospective analysis of pulse oximetry readings of patients with stage 2 COVID-19 admitted in ward during the period from 15th May 2020 to 30th May 2020. The difference in the peripheral oxygen saturation in sitting and supine positions, documented as a routine standard of care, especially in patients with platypnea, was calculated and demographic details and co-morbidities were noted from indoor record forms. Results: Of the 53 patients of stage 2 COVID-19 who were included in the study, 15 (28%) had platypnoea-orthodeoxia syndrome at the time of presentation and 18(33.9%) patients with platypnoea had  3% desaturation in sitting position as compared to supine position. Rest of the 20 (37.7%) patients had neither platypnoea nor orthodeoxia. All the patients presenting with platypnoea-orthodeoxia required oxygen therapy during the course of treatment. Amongst the 33 patients who were hypoxic and required oxygen supplementation, 15 patients (45.4%) had oxygen saturation of 94% in the supine position at presentation. Conclusion: Platypnoea-orthodeoxia syndrome is common in patients with stage 2 COVID 19 infection who require oxygen therapy. POS can be easily documented by using pulse oximeter without the need of any specialised equipment. Hence, we propose that documentation of POS at the time of admission in primary health care or resource depleted settings would help in successful triage of the patients needing oxygen therapy. We also propose that oxygen saturation in sitting position be documented as far as possible.

Tuberculosis, which is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), is highly contagious and can be transmitted through inhalation of the bacteria. However, it has been assumed that the infectiousness of bacteria and viruses in dead bodies weakens as the time from death increases. In particular, there is little awareness of infection control measures concerning decomposed bodies or even the need for such measures. The deceased, in whom we discovered MTB 3 months following her death, was a woman in her 80s who died at home. We performed judicial autopsy, because police suspected homicide when her husband hanged himself. Obtained organs were used for microscopic examination by hematoxylin-eosin staining and Ziehl-Neelsen staining. In addition, real-time PCR and mycobacterial culture testing using Ogawa's medium were performed for the detection of MTB. We found that the MTB in the decomposed body remained viable and potentially infectious. To identify the bacterial strain further, we performed DNA-DNA hybridization and identified the strain as MTB complex. Potentially infectious live MTB survived in the dead body far longer than had been previously reported. Pathologists should consider microbial culture tests for all autopsied cases in which the decedent's medical history or macro-examination suggests possible infection, even when a long duration of time has passed since death.

We also propose a laryngeal disease classification method, which uses attention mechanism to obtain the critical area under the supervision of image labels for laryngeal disease classification. That is, we first train a CNN model to classify the laryngeal images. If the classification result is correct, the region with strong response is most likely a critical area. The regions with strong responses are used as training data to train an object localization model that can automatically locate the critical area. Given an image for classification, the trained object localization model is employed to locate the critical area. Then, the located critical area is employed for image classification. The entire process only requires image-level labels and does not require manual labeling of the critical area.

The B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant has been seen to be twice more transmissible coupled with potential increases in disease severity and immune escape. As a result, case numbers and hospitalisations are once again on the rise in the USA. On 16 July 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a 7-day average 69.3% increase in new cases and a 35% increase in hospitalisations. Although the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 variants identification remains genomic sequencing, this approach is not accessible to many clinical laboratories. The main goal of this study was to validate and implement the detection of the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant utilising an open reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) platform by explicitly detecting the S-gene target failure (SGTF) corresponding to the deletion of two amino acids (E156/F157) characteristic of B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant. This approach was conceived as a rapid screening of B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant in conjunction with CDCs recommended N1 (nucleocapsid gene), N2, and RP (human RNase P) genes, as a pre-screening tool prior to viral genomic sequencing. We assessed 4,937 samples from 5 July to 5 September 2021. We identified the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant in 435 of 495 positive samples (87.8%);the additional positive samples (7 samples, 1.4%) were found to belong to the B.1.1.7 (Alpha, UK) lineage and the remaining 53 samples (10.7%) were reported as other lineages.

METHODS: Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was evaluated for the majority of HCW in an English teaching hospital 2 months following the peak of COVID-19 first wave. A questionnaire investigating the long-term complications was sent through global e-mail to HCW 4 months following the peak of the wave enquiring about the persistent health issues still affecting them at that point. RESULTS: Out of 3759 subjects tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 932 were positive (24%). Forty-five per cent of 138 HCW responding to the questionnaire reported persistent symptoms with 32% struggling to cope 3C4 months following the peak of the wave. Moderate-to-severe fatigue stood out as the most disabling symptom (39%) but mild-to-moderate shortness of breath, anxiety and sleep disturbance were almost universal in the subjects still struggling with symptoms. Only 16% consulted their general practitioner (GP) about their symptoms with only 2% taking sick leave after recovering from the acute illness.

A focus on health equity by researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers prioritizes action to address the systematic, avoidable, and unjust differences in health status across population groups sustained over time and generations that are beyond the control of individuals. Health equity requires a collective process in shaping the health and wellbeing of the communities in which we live, learn, work, play, and grow. This paper explores multisectoral leaders understanding of the social, environmental, and economic conditions that produce and sustain health inequity in northern Arizona, a geographically expansive, largely rural, and culturally diverse region. METHODS: Data are drawn from the Southwest Health Equity Research Collaboratives Regional Health Equity Survey (RHES). The RHES is a community-engaged, cross-sectional online survey comprised of 31 close-ended and 17 open-ended questions. Created to assess cross-sectoral regional and collective capacity to address health inequity and inform multisectoral action for improving community health, the RHES targeted leaders representing five rural northern Arizona counties and 13 sectors. Select open-ended questions were analyzed using an a priori coding scheme and emergent coding with thematic analysis. RESULTS: Although leaders were provided the definition and asked to describe the root causes of inequities, the majority of leaders described social determinants of health (SDoH). When leaders described root causes of health inequity, they articulated systemic factors affecting their communities, describing discrimination and unequal allocation of power and resources. Most leaders described the SDoH by discussing compounding factors of poverty, transportation, housing, and rurality among others, that together exacerbate inequity. Leaders also identified specific strategies to address SDoH and advance health equity in their communities, ranging from providing direct services to activating partnerships across organizations and sectors in advocacy for policy change. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that community leaders in the northern Arizona region acknowledge the importance of multisectoral collaborations in improving health equity for the populations that they serve. However, a common understanding of health equity remains to be widely established, which is essential for conducting effective multisectoral work to advance health equity.

Virtually all broiler and layer breeder flocks are routinely vaccinated against IBV. Two hatches of 1-day-old chicks from four lines were mistakenly vaccinated for infectious bronchitis using a moderately attenuated vaccine designed for chicks of an older age. The vaccination resulted in high mortality, and chicks from three of four lines died with signs typical of infectious bronchitis. The mortality that occurred using this less-attenuated vaccine was significantly influenced by the genetic line, and the MHC (B) haplotype in chickens of three B congenic lines. B congenic chickens possessing the B*15 haplotype were resistant in contrast to chickens possessing the B*13 or B*21 haplotypes. Chicks from two further hatches of the four lines were vaccinated appropriately with a more attenuated IBV vaccine, and only limited chick mortality was seen. These retrospective data from two repeated hatches confirm earlier data indicating chicken genes influence resistance to IBV, and indicate for the first time that genes tightly linked to the B haplotype are relevant in resistance to IBV. Due to extenuating circumstances it was not possible to verify results with chicks from F2 matings. Factors that may enhance definition of the role of the B haplotype in immune response to IBV, and the desirability for further analysis of a B haplotype-linked influence on immunity to IBV are discussed.","output":"Retrospective evidence that the MHC (B haplotype) of chickens influences genetic resistance to attenuated infectious bronchitis vaccine strains in chickens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection alters various blood parameters, which may indicate disease severity and thus help in better clinical management. AIM: To study the association between various hematological parameters and disease severity of COVID-19. To analyze the effects of hypertension and diabetes on neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and neutrophil-monocyte ratio in patients suffering from COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional study involving 148 laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patients were divided into three groups on the basis of disease severity. Various hematological parameters were analyzed. The effects of hypertension and diabetes on NLR and NMR in COVID-19 patients were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 148 patients, 78.4%, 8.1% and 13.5% cases were in the mild, moderate and severe groups, respectively. Mean age was 42.63  16.04 years (IQR: 29, 54.75; Range: 7C74). 58.8% patients were male while the rest (42.2%) were female. Mean TLC (cells/mm(3)), neutrophil (%), lymphocyte (%), monocyte (%), eosinophil (%), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and neutrophil-monocyte ratio (NMR) among mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Basophil (%) and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) was statistically insignificant among the three groups. Lymphocyte (%), monocyte (%) and eosinophil (%) were negatively correlated to disease severity. Among diabetics, both NLR and NMR were statistically significant (p < 0.05). However, among hypertensive cases, only the NLR was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Older age, higher TLC, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, eosinopenia, high NLR and high NMR are associated with severe COVID-19. High NLR and high NMR are indicative of severe disease among diabetic patients. High NLR also indicates severe disease among hypertensive patients.","output":"Differential white blood cell count in the COVID-19: A cross-sectional study of 148 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In contemporary high-risk society, unexpected disasters (epidemics and extreme weather) and chronic pressures (aging problems) put tremendous pressure on healthcare facilities. Enhancing the healthcare facilities' resilience ability to resist, absorb, and respond to disaster disruptions is urgent. This study presents a scientometric review for healthcare facility resilience research. A total of 374 relevant articles published between 2000 and 2020, collected from Web of Science (WoS) core collection database, Scopus database and MEDLINE database were reviewed and analyzed. The results indicated that research on resilience in healthcare facilities went through three development periods, and the research involved countries or institutions that are relatively scattered. The studies have been focused on the subject categories of engineering, public, environmental, and occupational health. The keywords of resilience, hospital, disaster, healthcare, and healthcare facility had the most frequency. Furthermore, based on the literature co-citation networks and content analysis, the detected seven co-citation clusters were grouped into four knowledge domains: climate change impact, strengthening resilience in response to war and epidemic, resilience assessment of healthcare facility, and the applications of information system. Moreover, the timeline view of literature reflected the evolution of each domain. Finally, a knowledge map for resilience of healthcare facilities was put forward, in which critical research contents, current knowledge gaps, and future research work were discussed. This contribution will promote researchers and practitioners to detect the hot topics, fill the knowledge gaps, and extend the body of research on resilience of healthcare facilities.","output":"Analyzing Healthcare Facility Resilience: Scientometric Review and Knowledge Map"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Currently, drones represent a promising technology for combating Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to the transport of goods, medical supplies to a given target location in the quarantine areas experiencing an epidemic outbreak Drone missions will increasingly rely on drone collaboration, which requires the drones to reduce communication complexity and be controlled in a decentralized fashion Blockchain technology becomes a must in industrial applications because it provides decentralized data, accessibility, immutability, and irreversibility Therefore, Blockchain makes data public for all drones and enables drones to log information concerning world states, time, location, resources, delivery data, and drone relation to all neighbors drones This paper introduces decentralized independent multi-drones to accomplish the task collaboratively Improving blockchain with a consensus algorithm can improve network partitioning and scalability in order to combat COVID-19 The multi-drones task is to combat COVID-19 via monitoring and detecting, social distancing, sanitization, data analysis, delivering goods and medical supplies, and announcement while avoiding collisions with one another We discuss End to End (E2E) delivery application of combination blockchain and multi-drone in combating COVID-19 and beyond future pandemics Furthermore, the challenges and opportunities of our proposed framework are highlighted","output":"Blockchain for decentralized multi-drone to combat COVID-19 and future pandemics: Framework and proposed solutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Discussions on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Andean region highlight authoritarian visions and economic interests taking advantage of the pandemic to profit and to reorganize dynamics of exploitation and accumulation. Less visible are the grassroots, organizational initiatives based on reciprocity that emerged across the region in response to the health crisis and in the context of national lockdowns. The pandemic has deepened the danger of famine among the most vulnerable in rural and urban areas. In response, grassroots organizations using reciprocal practices are mobilizing resources to provide food and to prevent and manage the disease. We ask two questions: What reciprocity-based practices are grassroots organizations in the Andes able to marshal in support of basic provisioning during the COVID-19 pandemic? And what is the potential of these practices to shape alternatives to development post-COVID-19? We analyze reciprocity practices as hybrid spaces that combine Andean worldviews, market and non-market motivations and political claims against the state. Based on the case studies of the Cauca Regional Indigenous Council in Colombia (CRIC) and The National Campesino Movement (FECAOL) in Ecuador, this paper develops three arguments. First, as a socio-natural actor, the pandemic forces Andean communities and their organizations to coordinate their efforts to mantain life. Second, the COVID-19 pandemic catalyzes long-standing recognition of grassroots processes and claims in the Colombian and Ecuadorian Andes. The revitalization by the CRIC of reciprocity-based practices such as barters and local markets strongly links self-provisioning with the mobilization of its Indigenous identity and struggles for autonomy. These practices also forge a horizontal 'solidarity' with other social movements, consolidating a common framework of self-protection against the neoliberal state. For example, FECAOL does politics and builds coalitions through reciprocity-based action as an expression of its desire to engage with the state at different scales. Fair markets and agroecological baskets are combined with barter and gifts to provide for populations in need and to shift oppressive power-relations in the agro-chain and towards a holistic, bottom-up construction of the 'public' to address societal needs. Finally, studied grassroots organizations build coalitions and present their visions of a diverse or mixed economy to the society at large to erode the dominance of capitalism. To become a 'counter-movement' post-COVID-19, we conclude, they need to scale up to broader levels of society.","output":"Shaping alternatives to development: solidarity and reciprocity in the Andes during COVID-19.

Schools are valuable social institutions to this effect and school safety and adolescent health outcomes can be threatened by drug use and violence. As such, collaborative, multi-level, evidence-based, developmentally sensitive, substance use prevention programs are imperative. The International Standards, in their latest version, did not reflect specific evidence of law enforcement officer-based programs with effect on drug use prevention, including in school settings. Nevertheless, the collaboration between law enforcement agencies and school-based substance use prevention programs continue to be the focus of research and policy. In this project, we aim to explore in more detail the role of law enforcement in preventing substance use in schools. We use mixed methods, including three phases: (i) scoping review on the best practices for effective law enforcement in school-based drug and crime prevention; (ii) interviews with experts, using the Delphi method, in substance use prevention and training law enforcement in school-based drug prevention; and iii) developing guidelines for law enforcement based on the findings. Initially, we identified a total of 17 papers that were categorized in four categories based on their results (negative or null effect n = 11 studies, positive effect n = 1 study, mixed effects n = 4 studies and indefinite conclusion n = 1 study). However, the authors of the studies with negative or null effect did recommend being cautious about these results due to the respective studies methodological limitations. The actual and perceived roles of police are largely unclear and/or variable. Therefore, clear outlines regarding law enforcements role within schools are crucial as one study showed that an officers role influences how they respond to student conduct. A secondary emergent theme from this review indicates that there is potential for positively impacting a youths perceptions of police through collaborative and engaging school-based programs. Currently the project is gradually moving to Phase II, where we are identifying the key experts based on scientifically published peer reviewed and grey literature/guidelines to investigate elements that make the role of law enforcement officers in school-based prevention more effective. Given the frequency with which policy makers around the world request information about the role of law enforcement in effective prevention efforts, guidelines on their roles within schools is a gap that needs to be filled. Such efforts would improve drug prevention in schools and better orient law enforcements role in drug prevention within educational settings.","output":"The Role of Law Enforcement Officers/Police in Drug Prevention within Educational SettingsStudy Protocol for the Development of a Guiding Document Based on Experts Opinions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present optimality results for robust Kalman filtering where robustness is understood in a distributional sense, i.e.; we enlarge the distribution assumptions made in the ideal model by suitable neighborhoods.

The corresponding minimax MSE-problems are solved for both types of outliers separately, resulting in closed-form saddle-points which consist of an optimally-robust procedure and a corresponding least favorable outlier situation. The results are valid in a surprisingly general setup of state space models, which is not limited to a Euclidean or time-discrete framework. The solution however involves computation of conditional means in the ideal model, which may pose computational problems. In the particular situation that the ideal conditional mean is linear in the observation innovation, we come up with a straight-forward Huberization, the rLS filter, which is very easy to compute.

Receiving a vaccination is a beneficial strategy to prevent the disease and reduce the severity of influenza illnesses. This cross-sectional questionnaire-based study aimed to evaluate the influence of sociodemographic, clinical, and mental parameters as well as other potential risk factors on refusal to vaccinate against influenza among the elderly population in Poland. Furthermore, due to the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic, we put efforts into finding any statistical correlations between the fear of COVID-19 infection in patients and their attitudes toward receiving an influenza vaccination. The study was conducted in NovemberCDecember 2020 in Poland on a representative nationwide sample of 500 individuals aged > 60. Of the respondents, 62 (12.4%) and 51 (10.2%) underwent influenza vaccination in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Out of ten different factors analyzed in this study, three were significantly associated with attitudes towards influenza vaccination. Participants with net income below the national average of PLN 3000 (OR = 2.37, CI 95% [1.26C4.47]), compared to those earning more than PLN 3000, had significantly higher odds of having a negative attitude towards influenza vaccination. Furthermore, respondents with <174 cm height (OR = 2.56, CI 95% [1.51C4.33]) and those with strong fear of COVID-19 infection (OR = 1.65, CI95% [1.02C2.66]) were also more likely to refrain from influenza vaccination. We believe the identification of factors limiting the willingness to receive influenza vaccination is an effective way to help clinicians focus their efforts on educating the groups of patients with the highest odds of refusing to receive the vaccine. Moreover, it may aid the design and enforcement of national solutions or the implementation of novel legislative measures and preventive programs, increasing public confidence and promoting vaccination, especially among groups at high risk of developing this disease.","output":"Identification of Barriers Limiting the Use of Preventive Vaccinations against Influenza among the Elderly Population: A Cross-Sectional Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The problem of defining burnout concerns its overlapping effect with other syndromes and disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Additionally, some individual characteristics influence susceptibility to burnout (e.g., neuroticism). Therefore, the question arises whether burnout is or is not a distinct syndrome. The aim of the study is to compare 2 distinct burnout measures by analyzing their connections with organizational and individual variables. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study was conducted in the Institute of Applied Psychology at the Jagiellonian University, Krakw, Poland on a group of employees (N = 100; 40 men; mean age 36.03 years). All participants completed 2 burnout scales: the Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey (MBI-GS) and the Link Burnout Questionnaire (LBQ). Organizational and individual factors were controlled with Areas of Worklife Survey, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, NEO Five-Factor Inventory and Beck's Depression Inventory scales. A structural equation path model was created to quantify the relations between organizational factors and burnout, as well as to control the individual factors of anxiety, neuroticism and depression. RESULTS The results indicate high compatibility between MBI-GS and LBQ on burnout diagnosis. The MBI-GS and LBQ revealed stronger connections with organizational context and individual characteristics, respectively. Depression explains dimensions of exhaustion (MBI-GS, LBQ), sense of disillusion (LBQ), neuroticism-exhaustion (MBI-GS); anxiety explains sense of professional inefficacy (LBQ). CONCLUSIONS Besides organizational variables, individual characteristics also play an important role in explaining burnout syndrome. Exploring the 2 burnout models has revealed that depression is an important determinant of exhaustion.

However, most of these have never been tested under real quarantine situations or derive from older investigations conducted mostly in China and Canada in the face of infections other than COVIDC19. The present study aimed at exploring the relationship between a comprehensive set of recommended lifestyles, socioCdemographic, and personality variables and mood during the first stages of quarantine. Methods: A virtual snowCball recollection technique was used to disseminate the survey across the general population in Spain starting the first day of mandatory quarantine (15 March 2020) until three days later (17 March). In total, 2683 Spanish adults (mean age = 34.86 years, SD = 13.74 years; 77.7% women) from the general population completed measures on socioCdemographic, COVIDCrelated, behavioral, personality/cognitive, and mood characteristics. Results: In the present study, depression and anger were higher than levels reported in a previous investigation before the COVIDC19 crisis, while vigor, friendliness, and fatigue were lower. Anxiety levels were comparable. The expected direction of associations was confirmed for the majority of predictors. However, effect sizes were generally small and only a subset of them correlated to most outcomes. Intolerance of unpleasant emotions, neuroticism, and, to a lesser extent, agreeableness, sleep quality, young age, and time spent Internet surfing were the most robust and strongest correlates of mood states. Conclusions: Some recommended lifestyles (i.e., maintaining good quality of sleep and reducing Internet surfing) might be more important than others during the first days of quarantine. Promoting tolerance to unpleasant emotions (e.g., through online, selfCmanaged programs) might also be of upmost importance. So far, recommendations have been made in general, but certain subgroups (e.g., certain personality profiles and young adults) might be especially vulnerable and should receive more attention.","output":"How Much Support Is There for the Recommendations Made to the General Population during Confinement?

Yet, as with other types of crises and emergencies, there have been doubts about the extent to which the public are able to engage effectively with the required behaviour. These doubts are based on outdated models of group psychology. AIMS AND ARGUMENT: We analyse the role of group processes in the COVID-19 pandemic in three domains: recognition of threat, adherence by the public to the required public health behaviours (and the factors that increase such adherence) and actions of the many community mutual aid groups that arose during lockdown. In each case, we draw upon the accumulated research on behaviour in emergencies and disasters, as well as the latest findings in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, to show that explanations in terms of social identity processes make better sense of the patterns of evidence than alternative explanations. CONCLUSIONS: If behaviour in the pandemic is a function of mutable group processes rather than fixed tendencies, then behavioural change is possible. There was evidence of significant change in behaviour from the public, particularly in the early days of the pandemic. Understanding the role of group processes means we can help design more effective interventions to support collective resilience in the public in the face of the pandemic and other threats. We draw out from the evidence a set of recommendations on facilitating the public response to COVID-19 by harnessing group processes.","output":"Public behaviour in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: understanding the role of group processes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Regaining independent ambulatory ability is one of the primary goals of treatment in patients with trochanteric fractures. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the discriminative accuracy of a clinical prediction model for ambulatory ability outcomes 3 months after surgery for trochanteric fractures. METHODS This retrospective cohort study included 346 patients treated with intramedullary nailing for trochanteric fractures who had independent ambulatory ability before their injury. Multiple regression models with preoperative and postoperative factors were used to predict ambulatory ability outcomes at 3 months. A clinical prediction model (CPM) was created based on a decision tree developed using a chi-square automatic interaction detector technique. RESULTS Three months after surgery, 263 (76.0%) and 83 (24.0%) patients regained and lost independent ambulatory ability, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that the Barthel index (BI) total score at 2 weeks predicted the ambulatory ability outcome at 3 months with good discriminative accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC]: 0.819; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.769, 0.868], cut-off value: 22.5; sensitivity: 69.5%; specificity: 82.3%). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative factors (residence before injury, diagnosis of dementia, and serum albumin at admission) and postoperative factors (BI total score at 2 weeks) predicted ambulatory ability outcomes at 3 months (AUROC: 0.710; 95%CI: [0.636, 0.783]; sensitivity: 91.3%; specificity: 41.8%).

We explored the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions on projected SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Canada. METHODS: We developed an age-structured agent-based model of the Canadian population simulating the impact of current and projected levels of public health interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Interventions included case detection and isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, physical distancing and community closures, evaluated alone and in combination. RESULTS: Without any interventions, 64.6% (95% credible interval [CrI] 63.9%-65.0%) of Canadians will be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (total attack rate) and 3.6% (95% CrI 2.4%-3.8%) of those infected and symptomatic will die. If case detection and contact tracing continued at baseline levels without maintained physical distancing and reimplementation of restrictive measures, this combination brought the total attack rate to 56.1% (95% CrI 0.05%-57.1%), but it dropped to 0.4% (95% CrI 0.03%-23.5%) with enhanced case detection and contact tracing. Combining the latter scenario with maintained physical distancing reduced the total attack rate to 0.2% (95% CrI 0.03%-1.7%) and was the only scenario that consistently kept hospital and intensive care unit bed use under capacity, prevented nearly all deaths and eliminated the epidemic. Extending school closures had minimal effects but did reduce transmission in schools; however, extending closures of workplaces and mixed-age venues markedly reduced attack rates and usually or always eliminated the epidemic under any scenario. INTERPRETATION: Controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission will depend on enhancing and maintaining interventions at both the community and individual levels.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention programs using fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) in screening rely on colonoscopy for secondary and surveillance testing. Colonoscopy capacity is an important constraint. Some European programs lack sufficient capacity to provide optimal screening intensity regarding age ranges, intervals, and FIT cutoffs. It is currently unclear how to optimize programs within colonoscopy capacity constraints. Design. Microsimulation modeling, using the MISCAN-Colon model, was used to determine if more effective CRC screening programs can be identified within constrained colonoscopy capacity. A total of 525 strategies were modeled and compared, varying 3 key screening parameters: screening intervals, age ranges, and FIT cutoffs, including previously unevaluated 4- and 5-year screening intervals (using a lifetime horizon and 100% adherence). Results were compared with the policy decisions taken in Ireland to provide CRC screening within available colonoscopy capacity. Outcomes estimated net costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and required colonoscopies. The optimal strategies within finite colonoscopy capacity constraints were identified. Results. Combining a reduced FIT cutoff of 10 g Hb/g, an extended screening interval of 4 y and an age range of 60C72 y requires 6% fewer colonoscopies, reduces net costs by 23% while preventing 15% more CRC deaths and saving 16% more QALYs relative to a strategy (FIT 40 g Hb/g, 2-yearly, 60C70 year) approximating current policy. Conclusion. Previously overlooked longer screening intervals may optimize cancer prevention with finite colonoscopy capacity constraints. Changes could save lives, reduce costs, and relieve colonoscopy capacity pressures. These findings are relevant to CRC screening programs across Europe that employ FIT-based testing, which face colonoscopy capacity constraints.","output":"Colorectal Cancer Screening within Colonoscopy Capacity Constraints: Can FIT-Based Programs Save More Lives by Trading off More Sensitive Test Cutoffs against Longer Screening Intervals?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research was based on virtual docking screening and molecular dynamics simulation among the 30 drugs analyzed, which drug had the best inhibitory effect on 3CL protease (Mpro) hydrolase. AutoDock Vina is used for molecular docking. Through our research, the binding affinity of saquinavir and raltegravir to the protein is higher than other candidate drugs in molecular docking; they are -9.1 kcal/mol and -9 kcal/mol, respectively. Among them remdesivir performance was mediocre, only -7.9 kcal/mol. In our study, ultimately, these systems are also basically stable. The overall contraction of the protein structure is most obvious after the combination of remdesivir. In the remdesivir-protein system, the structure of the terminal end has undergone relatively large changes. And the total number of hydrogen bonds formed in the remdesivir-protein system is larger. The hydrogen bonds can be maintained for a longer time, and the final interaction energy is stronger than other systems. These amino acid sequence fragments have high affinity with the remdesivir molecule. Remdesivir can change the structure of the protein to make it stronger in binding with itself through the interaction with the protein. The simulation study of drug screening for new coronaviruses can provide further support for new coronavirus effective drugs and provide powerful support to defeat the virus.","output":"A Study of Potential SARS-CoV-2 Antiviral Drugs and Preliminary Research of Their Molecular Mechanism, Based on Anti-SARS-CoV Drug Screening and Molecular Dynamics Simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to Philipsen et al.'s (Educ Technol Res Dev 67:1145-1174, 2019) article titled \\"Improving teacher professional development [TPD] for online and blended learning [OBL]: a systematic meta-aggregative review\\", we apply their proposed framework of important components of TPD for OBL to the support we provided to primary and secondary teachers as they engaged with online education during the COVID-19 pandemic.

If mark-to-market accounting standards may entail positive feedbacks which amplify economic or financial shocks, unconventional policies may introduce negative feedbacks that might dampen instabilities in financial and real markets. For these reasons, we jointly study these two sets of policies by employing a modified version of the Schumpeter meeting Keynes (K+S) macroeconomic agent-based model. Our results confirm that, due to its pro-cyclical nature, the mark-to-market accounting standard amplifies credit cycles, generating more instability with respect to a simulated economy wherein the historical accounting principle is employed. In contrast, unconventional monetary policy is counter-cyclical and it improves macroeconomic indicators. Finally, we study a scenario wherein mark-to-market accounting and unconventional monetary policy interact. We find that unconventional monetary policy can counterbalance the negative effects brought about by the application of mark-to-market accounting. Our results suggest that unconventional monetary policy instruments should not be considered as temporary interventions to be employed only during crisis periods.

Patients and methods This survey was conducted from August 1 to 31, 2021. The participants were 512 nurses, 198 nurses of whom were from temporary NAT sites in communities/towns in Zhangjiajie city, and the rest were from NAT sites inside hospitals. The psychological status and the job burnout were measured by the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Scale (MBI-GS). Results The prevalence of the SCL-90 positive result and job burnout were 49.4% and 61.1%, respectively. The factors influencing the psychological status of nurses included the contact with COVID-19 patients or their body fluids and specimens, working seniority and the duration of working in the frontline of the novel coronavirus. The independent risk factors of nurses job burnout included the following four factors. Firstly, the contact with COVID-19 patients or their body fluids and specimens (OR=150.95, 95% CI=(44.87,507.77), P<0.001). Secondly, five to nine years of working seniority (OR=8.91, 95% CI=(3.59,22.14), P<0.001). Thirdly, 10 to 19 days (OR=2.63, 95% CI=(1.19,5.82), P=0.017), 20 to 29 days (OR=161.31, 95% CI=(49.48,525.9), P<0.001).

Considering the massive numbers of college students, school reopening should be supported by adequate COVID-19 vaccination. As a result, the first dose of the inactivated virus COVID-19 vaccine has been administered, including to college students aged over 18 years old. While COVID-19 vaccination is widely available, there is still a scarcity of information on post-vaccination symptoms. As reported from other locations, post vaccination has been reported.

Children may possess an immunity that adults lack, possibly from childhood vaccinations. This retrospective study suggests immunization against the poliovirus may provide an immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Publicly available data were analyzed for possible correlations between national median ages and epidemiological outbreak patterns across 100 countries. Sera from 204 adults and children, who were immunized with the poliovirus vaccine, were analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effects of polio-immune serum on SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathology in cell culture were then evaluated. Results: Analyses of median population age demonstrated a positive correlation between median age and SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and death rates. Countries with effective poliovirus immunization protocols and younger populations have fewer and less pathogenic cases of COVID-19. Antibodies to poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2 were found in pediatric sera and in sera from adults recently immunized with polio. Western blot demonstrated antibodies recognized the RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) of either virus. Sera from polio-immunized individuals inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cell cultures. These results suggest the anti-D3-pol-antibody, induced by poliovirus vaccination, may provide a similar degree of protection from SARS-CoV-2 to adults as to children. Conclusions: Poliovirus vaccination induces an adaptive humoral immune response.

METHODS: Analyses are based on an original data set of 2,675 TikToks (529 unique videos across 68 COVID-relevant hashtags) viewed over 2,840,347,014 times. TikToks were tracked daily for 65 days after the beginning of U.S. stay-at-home orders (March 17 to May 20, 2020). A thematic analysis used 28 content codes and nine codes related to subject(s) to examine content patterns. Chi-square tests facilitated analyses of changes over time. RESULTS: Trending TikToks related to COVID-19 most often featured details of everyday circumstances and/or relatable commentary on Pandemic Life.

This review summarizes current epidemiologic data, highlights pathogenetic mechanisms on the association between excess body weight and COVID-19, compares data from previous pandemics, discusses why COVID-19 challenges the obesity paradox, and presents implications in prevention and treatment as well as future perspectives. RECENT FINDINGS: Data from meta-analyses based on recent observational studies have indicated that obesity increases the risks of infection from SARS-CoV-2, severe infection and hospitalization, admission to the ICU and need of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and the risk of mortality, particularly in severe obesity. The risks of IMV and mortality associated with obesity are accentuated in younger individuals (age  50 years old). The meta-inflammation in obesity intersects with and exacerbates underlying pathogenetic mechanisms in COVID-19 through the following mechanisms and factors: (i) impaired innate and adaptive immune responses; (ii) chronic inflammation and oxidative stress; (iii) endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulability, and aberrant activation of the complement; (iv) overactivation of the reninCangiotensinCaldosterone system; (v) overexpression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in the adipose tissue; (vi) associated cardiometabolic comorbidities; (vii) vitamin D deficiency; (viii) gut dysbiosis; and (ix) mechanical and psychological issues. SUMMARY: Mechanistic and large epidemiologic studies using big data sources with omics data exploring genetic determinants of risk and disease severity as well as large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are necessary to shed light on the pathways connecting chronic subclinical inflammation/meta-inflammation with adverse COVID-19 outcomes and establish the ideal preventive and therapeutic approaches for patients with obesity.","output":"Understanding the Co-Epidemic of Obesity and COVID-19: Current Evidence, Comparison with Previous Epidemics, Mechanisms, and Preventive and Therapeutic Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current trend of infections from COVID-19 outbreak in Central Visayas (CV) is posing higher risk of continued spreading. When uncontrolled, swarming of infected individuals to hospitals puts a greater challenge to the health care systems in the region and may breakdown. It is imperative in this situation that data-driven decisions and policies are required the most. In response, this study provided estimates of the epidemiologically important parameters namely, reproduction metric (R-o) and infection (alpha), recovery (beta) and mortality (gamma) rates, by using a modified Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model. This modified model incorporated control parameters, sigma and omega, associated with enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) implementation and observance of social distancing (SD), respectively. For the covered months from 27 March 2020-10 May 2020, results of the simulation estimated these parameters at: R-o=3.12, alpha=0.18, beta= 0.029, and gamma=0.029 with 90% confidence. Moreover, the reproduction metric can be effectively reduced with the combined effect of the control parameters at sigma, omega &gt;= 0.5 resulting to an effective R-o below unity. Similarly, this lowered the peak value of infection to 23% (or 7% of the total number of susceptible population) compared to when these measures are not observed and moved the peak time farther as well. While these estimates reflected the timely implementation of ECQ keeping its current level comparable with the country's estimates and the world, reducing the reproduction metric effectively requires strict observance to both ECQ and SD control measures.

METHODS: Using a scoping review approach, we searched 9 databases for studies on waiting lists and mental health and reported study characteristics, impacts and intervention attributes and outcomes. RESULTS: We included 51 studies that focussed on organ transplant (60.8%), surgery (21.6%) or cancer management (13.7%). Most patients and caregivers reported anxiety, depression and poor quality of life, which deteriorated with increasing wait time. The impact of waiting on mental health was greater among women and new immigrants, and those of younger age, lower socio-economic status, or with less-positive coping ability. Six studies evaluated educational strategies to develop coping skills: 2 reduced depression (2 did not), 1 reduced anxiety (2 did not) and 2 improved quality of life (2 did not). In contrast, patients desired acknowledgement of concerns, peer support, and periodic communication about wait-list position, prioritization criteria and anticipated procedure date.

Several reports have described the gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations in the infected patients. The systematic review was designed to highlight the gaps in our knowledge about the prevalence and clinical significance of GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed database and Google articles published in both English and Chinese up to June 3, 2020, using search terms \\"Clinical features\\", \\"2019 novel coronavirus\\", \\"2019-nCoV\\", \\"COVID-19\\", or \\"SARS-Cov-2\\". Observational studies, case reports or letters describing the clinical features or observational studies regarding the detection and/or isolation of SARS-Cov-2 viruses in stools were included. RESULTS: A total of 22 publications were finally selected. It was reported that GI symptoms occurred in about 3%-40.7% of patients. GI manifestations included nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, belching, abdominal distension and GI haemorrhage. Diarrhea was the most common GI symptom. Infected patients had various degrees of liver dysfunction, and the severity of liver dysfunction was significantly associated with the severity of the disease. Therapy focusing on digestive system like liver supportive therapy or nutrition support or probiotics have been demonstrated to be effective interventions, which greatly improve prognosis.

However, the waning of humoral immunity over time has raised concern over the durability of immune memory following vaccination. Thus, we conducted a nonrandomized trial among the healthcare workers (HCWs) to investigate the long-term sustainability of SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells and T cells stimulated by inactivated vaccines and the potential need for a third booster dose. Although neutralizing antibodies elicited by the standard two-dose vaccination schedule dropped from a peak of 29.3 arbitrary units (AU)/mL to 8.8 AU/mL 5 months after the second vaccination, spike-specific memory B and T cells were still detectable, forming the basis for a quick recall response. As expected, the faded humoral immune response was vigorously elevated to 63.6 AU/mL by 7.2 folds 1 week after the third dose along with abundant spike-specific circulating follicular helper T cells in parallel. Meanwhile, spike-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were also robustly elevated by 5.9 and 2.7 folds respectively. Robust expansion of memory pools by the third dose potentiated greater durability of protective immune responses. Another key finding in this trial was that HCWs with low serological response to two doses were not truly non-responders but fully equipped with immune memory that could be quickly recalled by a third dose even 5 months after the second vaccination. Collectively, these data provide insights into the generation of long-term immunological memory by the inactivated vaccine, which could be rapidly recalled and further boosted by a third dose.","output":"Robust induction of B cell and T cell responses by a third dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is highly contagious and causes substantial morbidity and mortality. Mask usage has been advocated by health professionals to minimize its spread. Thus, it is important to develop a simulation that models SARS-CoV-2 spread in indoor environments to evaluate mask usage effectiveness. Methods: A visual computer simulation was developed with Pygame in Python 3. A virtual indoor supermarket is simulated by a given flow of customers with an initial infection percentage and mask usage percentage who enter, move around, and exit a supermarket with shelves, tables and cashiers to demonstrate a systems dynamic complexity, i.e. nonlinear interactions of system elements over time. A supermarket was simulated with initial infection rates of 5%, 10%, and 20% and mask use percentages of 0%, 25%, 50% 75%, and 100%. The environmental settings (e.g. shelf number and location) and total customers (N=200) were kept constant. Results: The number of infected customers increased as the percentage of mask usage decreased (p < 0.01). At 5% initial infection, almost no infections were observed at 50% mask usage, with a logarithmic best-fit model (R2 = 0.947). At 10% initial infection, the association between mask usage and decrease in number of infections was best fit with a linear model (R2 = 0.924). For 20% initial infection, a quadratic model was the best fit (R2 = 0.934). While a linear model suggests proportional decreases in infection, the quadratic model suggests more significant reductions in infections at higher rates of mask use (i.e. increasing mask usage from 5% to 10% is less impactful than from 65% to 70%). Conclusion: The results suggest that mask usage has a significant impact on decreasing COVID-19 transmission. Ideally, mask usage should be as high as possible to achieve more significant reductions in COVID-19 infections. Various parameters can be adjusted during simulation as we learn more about SARS-CoV-2 to guide policies for minimizing COVID-19 transmission.","output":"Assessing the Impact of Mask Usage on COVID-19 Transmission Using a Computer Simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and particularly exhibits severe symptoms and mortality in elderly individuals. Mounting evidence shows that the characteristics of the age-related clinical severity of COVID-19 are attributed to insufficient antiviral immune function and excessive self-damaging immune reaction, involving T cell immunity and associated with pre-existing basal inflammation in the elderly. Age-related changes to T cell immunosenescence is characterized by not only restricted T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity, accumulation of exhausted and/or senescent memory T cells, but also by increased self-reactive T cell- and innate immune cell-induced chronic inflammation, and accumulated and functionally enhanced polyclonal regulatory T (Treg) cells. Many of these changes can be traced back to age-related thymic involution/degeneration. How these changes contribute to differences in COVID-19 disease severity between young and aged patients is an urgent area of investigation. Therefore, we attempt to connect various clues in this field by reviewing and discussing recent research on the role of the thymus and T cells in COVID-19 immunity during aging (a synergistic effect of diminished responses to pathogens and enhanced responses to self) impacting age-related clinical severity of COVID-19.

The HCoV-NL63 spike (S) protein mediates virion attachment to cells and subsequent fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. This viral entry process is a primary target for vaccine and drug development. HCoV-NL63 S is expressed as a single-chain glycoprotein and consists of an N-terminal receptor-binding domain (S1) and a C-terminal transmembrane fusion domain (S2). The latter contains two highly conserved heptad-repeat (HR) sequences that are each extended by 14 amino acids relative to those of the SARS coronavirus or the prototypic murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus. Limited proteolysis studies of the HCoV-NL63 S2 fusion core identify an alpha-helical domain composed of a trimer of the HR segments N57 and C42. The crystal structure of this complex reveals three C42 helices entwined in an oblique and antiparallel manner around a central triple-stranded coiled coil formed by three N57 helices. The overall geometry comprises distinctive high-affinity conformations of interacting cross-sectional layers of the six helices. As a result, this structure is unusually stable, with an apparent melting temperature of 78 degrees C in the presence of the denaturant guanidine hydrochloride at 5 M concentration. The extended HR regions may therefore be required to prime the group 1 S glycoproteins for their fusion-activating conformational changes during viral entry.

While most medical resources are allocated to treat COVID-19 patients, several non-COVID-19 medical emergencies still need to be treated, including vertebral fractures and spinal cord compression. The aim of this paper is to report the early experience and an organizational protocol for emergency spinal surgery currently being used in a large metropolitan area by an integrated team of orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons. METHODS: An organizational model is presented based on case centralization in hub hospitals and early management of surgical cases to reduce hospital stay. Data from all the patients admitted for emergency spinal surgery from the beginning of the outbreak were prospectively collected and compared to data from patients admitted for the same reason in the same time span in the previous year, and treated by the same integrated team. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients (11 males and eight females, with a mean age of 49.9 years (14 to 83)) were admitted either for vertebral fracture or spinal cord compression in a 19-day period, compared to the ten admitted in the previous year. No COVID-19 patients were treated. The mean time between admission and surgery was 1.7 days, significantly lower than 6.8 days the previous year (p < 0.001).

The increased incidence of CC raise questions about the possible heightened susceptibility of patients with cardiac disease to develop severe COVID-19, and whether the virus itself is involved in the pathogenesis of CC. The wide array of CC seems to stem from multiple mechanisms, including the ability of the virus to directly enter cardiomyocytes, and to indirectly damage the heart through systemic hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states, endothelial injury of the coronary arteries and hypoxemia. The induced CC seem to dramatically impact the prognosis of COVID-19, with some studies suggesting over 50% mortality rates with myocardial damage, up from ~ 5% overall mortality of COVID-19 alone.

There was a statistically significant improvement in anxiety level following redeployment which was mainly attributed to the support received by staff within the redeployed area. 71% of the redeployed group were found to have sufficient PPE was provided for the area they worked in. INTERPRETATION: This is the first national survey performed on redeployment of ophthalmologists in the UK. The study showed that ophthalmologists across all grades were able to contribute in most aspects of patient care. Anxiety of redeployment was reduced by prior training and good support in the redeployment area.","output":"Redeployment of ophthalmologists in the United Kingdom during the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In mass media, the positions of science deniers and scientific-consensus advocates are repeatedly presented in a balanced manner. This false balance increases the spread of misinformation under the guise of objectivity. Weight-of-evidence strategies are an alternative, in which journalists lend weight to each position that is equivalent to the amount of evidence that supports the position. In public discussions, journalists can invite more advocates of scientific consensuses than science deniers (outnumbering) or they can employ warnings about the false-balance effect prior to the discussions (forewarning). In three pre-registered laboratory experiments, we tested the efficacy of outnumbering and forewarning as weight-of-evidence strategies to mitigate science deniers influence on individuals attitudes towards vaccination and their intention to vaccinate. We explored whether advocates responses to science deniers (rebuttal) and audiences issue involvement moderate the efficacy of these strategies. A total of N = 887 individuals indicated their attitudes towards vaccination and their intention to vaccinate before and after watching a television (TV) discussion. The presence and absence of forewarning, outnumbering and rebuttal were manipulated between subjects; participants also indicated their individual issue involvement. We obtained no evidence that outnumbering mitigates damage from denialism, even when advocates served as multiple sources. However, forewarning about the false-balance effect mitigated deniers negative effects. Moreover, the protective effect was independent of rebuttal and issue involvement. Thus, forewarnings can serve as an effective, economic and theory-driven strategy to counter science denialism in public discussions, at least for highly educated individuals such as university students.","output":"Weight-of-Evidence Strategies to Mitigate the Influence of Messages of Science Denialism in Public Discussions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Unplanned transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) lead to reduced trust of patients and their families in medical staff and challenge medical staff to allocate scarce ICU resources. This study aimed to explore the incidence and risk factors of unplanned transfer to ICU during emergence from general anesthesia after cerebral surgery, and to provide guidelines for preventing unplanned transfer from post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) to ICU following cerebral surgery. Methods This was a retrospective case-control study and included patients with unplanned transfer from PACU to ICU following cerebral surgery between January 2016 and December 2020. The control group comprised patients matched (2:1) for age ({+/-}5 years), sex, and operation date ({+/-}48 hours) as those in the case group. Stata14.0 was used for statistical analysis, and p <0.05 indicated statistical significance. Results A total of 11,807 patients following cerebral surgery operations were cared in PACU during the study period. Of the 11,807 operations, 81 unscheduled ICU transfer occurred (0.686%). Finally, 76 patients were included in the case group, and 152 in the control group. The following factors were identified as independent risk factors for unplanned ICU admission after neurosurgery: low mean blood oxygen (OR=1.57, 95%CI: 1.20-2.04), low mean albumin (OR=1.14, 95%CI: 1.03-1.25), slow mean heart rate (OR=1.04, 95%CI: 1.00-1.08), blood transfusion (OR=2.78, 95%CI: 1.02-7.58), emergency surgery (OR=3.08, 95%CI: 1.07-8.87), lung disease (OR=2.64, 95%CI: 1.06-6.60), and high mean blood glucose (OR=1.71, 95%CI: 1.21-2.41). Conclusion We identified independent risk factors for unplanned transfer from PACU to ICU after cerebral surgery based on electronic medical records.

Despite decades of study, the behavior of the pulmonary surfactant is poorly understood on the molecular scale, which hinders the development of effective surfactant replacement therapies, useful in the treatment of several lung-related diseases. In this work, we combined all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, Langmuir trough measurements, and AFM imaging to study synthetic four-component lipid monolayers designed to model protein-free pulmonary surfactant. We characterized the structural and dynamic properties of the monolayers with a special focus on lateral heterogeneity. Remarkably, simulations reproduce almost quantitatively the experimental data on pressureCarea isotherms and the presence of lateral heterogeneities highlighted by AFM. Quite surprisingly, the pressureCarea isotherms do not show a plateau region, despite the presence of liquid-condensed nanometerCsized domains at surface pressures larger than 20 mN/m. In the simulations, the domains were small and transient, but they did not coalesce to yield a separate phase. The liquidCcondensed domains were only slightly enriched in DPPC and cholesterol, and their chemical composition remained very similar to the overall composition of the monolayer membrane. Instead, they differed from liquid-expanded regions in terms of membrane thickness (in agreement with AFM data), diffusion rates, acyl chain packing, and orientation. We hypothesize that such lateral heterogeneities are crucial for lung surfactant function, as they allow both efficient packing, to achieve low surface tension, and sufficient fluidity, critical for rapid adsorption to the airCliquid interface during the breathing cycle.","output":"Understanding the Functional Properties of Lipid Heterogeneity in Pulmonary Surfactant Monolayers at the Atomistic Level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung ultrasound (LUS) is one of the most important and innovative applications in emergency and critical care medicine for the management of critically ill patients.

This paper discusses the potential for scenario planning processes in the Colorado River Basin in the southwestern United States to build collective understanding of compound and cascading risks, and to identify possible solutions at multiple scales. Under the Colorado River Conversations Project, we convened a series of conferences and scenario planning workshops over the past 3 years to explore the potential to enhance the use of social and physical sciences in river management, and to broaden the community of people and entities engaged in discussions about managing the Colorado River. Working with a group of thirty water managers and other interested parties representing all 7 basin states, several Tribes, NGOs and Mexico, we used a participatory, mixed-methods approach to scenario planning that identified multiple drivers of change and developed eight science-based storylines from the intersection of these drivers. The development of the storylines and the subsequent conversations with participants about impacts and solutions resulted in a framework for understanding low probability-high consequence climate and other risks across the Colorado River Basin. We highlight three lessons that speak to the value and role of SP for fostering collaboration and creativity. These lessons include: (1) the importance of process in SP in fostering deliberate community building across sectors and geographies; (2) identifying challenges with engaging with uncertainty, complexity, and risk; and (3) determining what these findings mean for future SP in the Colorado River Basin and beyond.","output":"Scenario Planning: Embracing the Potential for Extreme Events in the Colorado River Basin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Older adults are susceptible to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes as a consequence of their age and, in some cases, underlying health conditions (1). A COVID-19 outbreak in a long-term care skilled nursing facility (SNF) in King County, Washington that was first identified on February 28, 2020, highlighted the potential for rapid spread among residents of these types of facilities (2). On March 1, a health care provider at a second long-term care skilled nursing facility (facility A) in King County, Washington, had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, after working while symptomatic on February 26 and 28. By March 6, seven residents of this second facility were symptomatic and had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. On March 13, CDC performed symptom assessments and SARS-CoV-2 testing for 76 (93%) of the 82 facility A residents to evaluate the utility of symptom screening for identification of COVID-19 in SNF residents. Residents were categorized as asymptomatic or symptomatic at the time of testing, based on the absence or presence of fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms on the day of testing or during the preceding 14 days. Among 23 (30%) residents with positive test results, 10 (43%) had symptoms on the date of testing, and 13 (57%) were asymptomatic. Seven days after testing, 10 of these 13 previously asymptomatic residents had developed symptoms and were recategorized as presymptomatic at the time of testing. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing cycle threshold (Ct) values indicated large quantities of viral RNA in asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic residents, suggesting the potential for transmission regardless of symptoms. Symptom-based screening in SNFs could fail to identify approximately half of residents with COVID-19. Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 (3). Once a confirmed case is identified in an SNF, all residents should be placed on isolation precautions if possible (3), with considerations for extended use or reuse of personal protective equipment (PPE) as needed (4).","output":"Asymptomatic and Presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Residents of a Long-Term Care Skilled Nursing Facility - King County, Washington, March 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid and accurate sequencing covering the entire genome is essential to identify genetic variations of viral pathogens. However, due to the low viral titers in clinical samples, certain amplification steps are required for viral genome sequencing.

Thus, in this study, we aimed to develop a universal primer set valid for all human alphacoronaviruses and applicable to samples containing trace amounts of the virus. To this aim, we designed overlapping primer pairs capable of amplifying the entire genome of all known human alphacoronaviruses. The selected primers, named the AC primer set, were composed of 10 primer pairs stretching over the entire genome of alphacoronaviruses, and produced PCR products of the expected size (3C5 kb) from both the HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 strains. After genome amplification, an evaluation using various sequencing platforms was carried out. The amplicon library sequencing data were assembled into complete genome sequences in all sequencing strategies examined in this study. The sequencing accuracy varied depending on the sequencing technology, but all sequencing methods showed a sequencing error of less than 0.01%.

We have recently reported that novel (99m)Tc-labeled small-molecule PSMA inhibitors bind with high affinity to PSMA-positive tumor cells in vitro and localize in PCa xenografts. This study reports the first, to our knowledge, human data in men with metastatic PCa and in healthy male subjects. METHODS Under an exploratory investigational new drug, using a cross-over design, we compared the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and tumor uptake of (99m)Tc-MIP-1404 and (99m)Tc-MIP-1405 in 6 healthy men and 6 men with radiographic evidence of metastatic PCa. Whole-body images were obtained at 10 min and 1, 2, 4, and 24 h. SPECT was performed between 3 and 4 h after injection. RESULTS Both agents cleared the blood rapidly, with MIP-1404 demonstrating significantly lower urinary activity (7%) than MIP-1405 (26%). Both agents showed persistent uptake in the salivary, lacrimal, and parotid glands. Uptake in the liver and kidney was acceptable for imaging at 1-2 h. In men with PCa, both agents rapidly localized in bone and lymph node lesions as early as 1 h. SPECT demonstrated excellent lesion contrast. Good correlation was seen with bone scanning; however, more lesions were demonstrated with (99m)Tc-MIP-1404 and (99m)Tc-MIP-1405. The high-contrast images exhibited tumor-to-background ratios from 3:1 to 9:1 at 4 and 20 h. CONCLUSION Compared with the standard-of-care bone scanning, (99m)Tc-MIP-1404 and (99m)Tc-MIP-1405 identified most bone metastatic lesions and rapidly detected soft-tissue PCa lesions including subcentimeter lymph nodes.

Patients with nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 PCR Ct values < 25.09 had SARS-CoV-2 detected on facemask sampling, while patients with Ct values  25.2 had no SARS-CoV-2 detected on facemask sampling. Facemask sampling can identify patients with COVID-19 during the early symptomatic phase or those with high viral loads, hence allowing timely identification and isolation of those with the highest transmission risk.

Zebrafishes are widely used for measuring and detecting the toxicity. However, measuring and testing toxicity manually is not feasible due to the large number of embryos. This work presents an automated model to investigate the toxicity of two toxicants (3, 4-Dichloroaniline (34DCA) and p-Tert-Butylphenol (PTBP)). METHODS: The proposed model consists of two steps. In the first step, a set of features is extracted from microscopic images of zebrafish embryos using the Segmentation-Based Fractal Texture Analysis (SFTA) technique. Secondly, a novel rough set-based model using Social ski-driver (SSD) is used to find a global minimal subset of features that preserves important information of the original features. In the third step, the AdaBoost classifier is used to classify an unknown sample to alive or coagulant after exposing the embryo to a toxic compound. RESULTS: For detecting the toxicity, the proposed model is compared with (i) three deterministic rough set reduction algorithms and (ii) the PSO-based algorithm. The classification performance rate of our model was ranged from 97.1% to 99.5% and it outperformed the other algorithms.

One of the critical problems harming the wide adoption of such displays is the presence of speckle noise inherent to holography, that compromises its quality by introducing perceptible artifacts. Although speckle noise suppression has been an active research area, the previous works have not considered the perceptual characteristics of the Human Visual System (HVS), which receives the final displayed imagery. However, it is well studied that the sensitivity of the HVS is not uniform across the visual field, which has led to gaze-contingent rendering schemes for maximizing the perceptual quality in various computer-generated imagery. Inspired by this, we present the first method that reduces the \\"perceived speckle noise\\" by integrating foveal and peripheral vision characteristics of the HVS, along with the retinal point spread function, into the phase hologram computation. Specifically, we introduce the anatomical and statistical retinal receptor distribution into our computational hologram optimization, which places a higher priority on reducing the perceived foveal speckle noise while being adaptable to any individual's optical aberration on the retina. Our method demonstrates superior perceptual quality on our emulated holographic display. Our evaluations with objective measurements and subjective studies demonstrate a significant reduction of the human perceived noise.","output":"Gaze-Contingent Retinal Speckle Suppression for Perceptually-Matched Foveated Holographic Displays."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter examines the current literature regarding the use of telehealth, and its potential benefits and limitations for diagnosis, treatment, and coordination of care for children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Barriers to access drive the need to have telehealth as a modality for delivering evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic processes, which can be impactful in improving developmental trajectories and functional outcomes The chapter concludes with guidance for clinicians interested in leveraging telehealth, with directions elucidated to further advance the use of telehealth to support families with ASD More recently, in light of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and social distancing guidelines and restrictions, this chapter highlights changes in telehealth policy and the use of telehealth for diagnosis and treatment of ASD as well as thoughts about future directions","output":"Telehealth Approaches to Care Coordination in Autism Spectrum Disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are at a substantially higher risk for developing cognitive impairment compared with the healthy population. Dialysis is an essential way to maintain the life of ESRD patients. Based on previous research, there isn't an uncontested result whether cognition was improved or worsened during dialysis. METHODS To explore the impact of dialysis treatment on cognitive performance, we recruited healthy controls (HCs), predialysis ESRD patients (predialysis group), and maintenance hemodialysis ESRD patients (HD group). All ESRD patients performed six blood biochemistry tests (hemoglobin, urea, cystatin C, Na+, K+, and parathyroid hormone). Neuropsychological tests were used to measure cognitive function. By using diffusion tensor imaging and graph-theory approaches, the topological organization of the whole-brain structural network was investigated. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were performed to investigate blood biochemistry predictors of the neuropsychological tests and the results of graph analyses in the HD group and predialysis group. RESULTS Neuropsychological analysis showed the HD group exhibited better cognitive function than the predialysis group, but both were worse than HCs. Whole-brain graph analyses revealed that increased global efficiency and normalized shortest path length remained in the predialysis group and HD group than the HCs. Besides, a lower normalized clustering coefficient was found in the predialysis group relative to the HCs and HD group. For the GLM analysis, only the Cystatin C level was significantly associated with the average fiber length of rich club connections in the predialysis group.

Functions of 3HB have been studied more and more extensively. It has been found that 3HB can not only provide energy for a body, but also participate in cell signal transduction events as a signal regulatory molecule. At present, how 3HB participates in the process of inflammation and immune regulation is still unclear. This study therefore focuses on 3HB immunomodulatory mechanisms. Proteomic analysis indicates a new post-translational modification of -hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) on antibodies. Kbhb on antibodies was found improving the stability of antibodies to protease and heat treatments. Furthermore, Kbhb of antibodies stabilizes the antibodies in plasma. As a remarkable example, COVID-19 neutralizing antibody B38 produced by 293T cells was Kbhb modified and stabilized in vivo, providing a strategy for possibility of extending protection effects of COVID-19 antibodies.Funding: This research was financially supported by a grant from Chunfeng Foundation (2020Z99CFG002) of Tsinghua University.

BACKGROUND: Due to governmental stay\\\\at\\\\home orders during the pandemic, families with dislocated (compelled to return home) college students would likely encounter unique stressors while also being limited in their normal ways of coping. METHODS: Using an online survey, the current study sought to discover how diverse individual characteristics and family living situations of 323 dislocated students associated with varying homelife experiences (e.g., intrusive parenting, students making an extra effort to spend time with family), and how such experiences associated with relationship changes during the quarantine. RESULTS: Analyses detected some differences in the students' homelife experiences based on background and living situations, especially related to being a first\\\\year student, having been excited about returning home, and feeling accepted by parents about being home. Negative family relationship quality during the quarantine was most predicted by negative attitudes from students and parents about students being home, the student feeling less adultlike (based on treatment and own identity conception), and having low autonomy. CONCLUSION: Returning home for quarantine was challenging for most students, and circumstances and attitudes appeared to contribute to how such challenges associated with family relationship changes.

Thus, one may assume that the specific work organization of companies impacts the work of ASD teams. A major change in work organization is the switch to a 4-day work week, which some companies investigated in experiments. Also, recent studies show that ASD teams are affected by the switch to remote work since the Covid 19 pandemic outbreak in 2020. Objective: Our study presents empirical findings on the effects on ASD teams operating remote in a 4-day work week organization. Method: We performed a qualitative single case study and conducted seven semi-structured interviews, observed 14 agile practices and screened eight project documents and protocols of agile practices. Results: We found, that the teams adapted the agile method in use due to the change to a 4-day work week environment and the switch to remote work. The productivity of the two ASD teams did not decrease. Although the stress level of the ASD team member increased due to the 4-day work week, we found that the job satisfaction of the individual ASD team members is affected positively. Finally, we point to affects on social facets of the ASD teams.

The PDMP system has been utilized in different states at various organizational levels in an effort to achieve improved health outcomes, reduce the number of prescription drug overdoses, and lighten the economic burden that follows. However, during the implementation of PDMP, there were several barriers and limitations that were discovered. Those barriers impeded the process of utilization of PDMP, such as the complex user interface and lack of training for healthcare providers. The purpose of this paper was to examine the advances and limitations in the utilization and implementation of PDMP in the US healthcare industry and develop strategies for effective use of PDMP in West Virginia. The qualitative part of this paper was a literature review. The paper referred to several peer-reviewed studies and research articles from several reliable resources, which were reached by databases or Google Scholar. A total of 44 articles were reviewed for this study. The implementation of the PDMP was influenced by benefits and barriers. This article reviewed several studies in general that demonstrated positive outcomes from the implementation of PDMP, including a reduced number of prescription drug overdoses, coordinated care for patients, and improved health outcomes. However, the barriers and limitations were not neglected, which mainly include integration of PDMP into the electronic health record (EHR) system, lack of training for the providers, and lack of basic standards for the use of PDMP. Although the new health reforms encouraged the adaption of PDMP among providers, data reporting and data interpretation still remain major concerns for assessing the health outcomes of PDMP implementation.","output":"Optimization of Prescription Drug Monitoring Program to Overcome Opioid Epidemic in West Virginia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has challenged the medical community. While diagnostic and therapeutic efforts have been focused on respiratory complications of the disease, several ocular implications have also emerged. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been found in tears of the infected patients, and reports suggest that the ocular surface could serve as a portal of entry and a reservoir for viral transmission. Clinically, COVID-19 has been associated with mild conjunctivitis, which can be the first and only symptom of the disease. Subtle retinal changes like hyperreflective lesions in the inner layers on optical coherence tomography (OCT), cotton-wool spots, and microhemorrhages have also been reported. In addition, COVID-19 has been associated with an increased incidence of systemic diseases like diabetes mellitus and Kawasaki disease, which are particularly relevant for ophthalmologists due to their potentially severe ocular manifestations. Several treatment strategies are currently under investigation for COVID-19, but none of them have been proved to be safe and effective to date. Intensive care unit patients, due to risk factors like invasive mechanical ventilation, prone position, and multiresistant bacterial exposure, may develop ocular complications like ocular surface disorders, secondary infections, and less frequently acute ischemic optic neuropathy and intraocular pressure elevation. Among the array of drugs that have shown positive results, the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine has raised a concern due to their well-known retinal toxic effects. However, the risk of retinal toxicity with short-term high-dose use of antimalarials is still unknown. Ocular side effects have also been reported with other investigational drugs like lopinavir-ritonavir, interferons, and interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 inhibitors.

In clinical practice, comprehensive care for COPD patients includes the diagnosis using spirometry, clinical examination and comprehensive pharmacological and non-pharmacological management. The diagnosis is based on symptoms, dyspnea and lung function impairment and can be mild to very severe. Symptoms are examined using the COPD assessment test (CAT) score, and dyspnea grade are examined using a modified MRC from GOLD guidelines. When mild, the care includes self-management education, smoking cessation, lifestyle modifications, vaccination, and short-acting bronchodilators. Self-management education involves inhaler device training, breathing technique, early recognition of acute exacerbations and writing action plans. As the disease progresses, other care measures are added. These measures include the addition of long-acting inhaler therapies, pulmonary rehabilitation, oral therapies, oxygen and lung transplantation.

Meibomian glands at the eyelid secrete lipids that prevent evaporation of the aqueous tear film. The pathogenesis of obstructive MGD is incompletely understood to date. Herein, we aim to investigate the pathogenesis of obstructive MGD using murine and human samples with various forms of ocular surface inflammation. METHOD: The presence of Neutrophil extracellular Traps (NETs) was detected with immunofluorescence analysis of ocular surface discharge and biopsy samples from patients with blepharitis. Tear fluid from patients with MGD and blepharitis were evaluated for the presence of inflammatory mediators using bead based immunoassay. Murine model of allergic eye disease (AED) was performed to investigate the role of NETs in MG occlusion. RESULTS: we show that the ocular discharge from patients with blepharitis contains aggregated neutrophil extracellular traps (aggNETs). Furthermore, the ducts of human Meibomian glands affected by blepharitis were largely congested by aggNETs. Tear fluid from patients with MGD showed elevated neutrophil chemoattractants (C5a, IL6, IL8 and IL18). C5a and IL8 correlated with the degree of deficiency of tear fluid. In the murine model of allergic eye disease (AED), aggNETs accumulated in the MG leading to occlusion of their ducts and the retrograde pent-up of the fluid followed by acinar atrophy. Constraining aggNET formation by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of peptidyl arginine deiminase type 4 (PADI4) effectively reduced MG damage.

Challenge studies suggested that the lethal dose of Delta was higher than Alpha or Beta strains. To characterize the differences in the Delta strains pathogenesis, a time-course experiment was performed to evaluate the overall host response to Alpha or Delta variant challenge. qRT-PCR analysis of Alpha- or Delta- challenged mice revealed no significant difference between viral RNA burden in the lung, nasal wash or brain. However, histopathological analysis revealed high lung tissue inflammation and cell infiltration following Delta- but not Alpha-challenge at day 6. Additionally, pro-inflammatory cytokines were highest at day 6 in Delta-challenged mice suggesting enhanced pneumonia. Total RNA-sequencing analysis of lungs comparing infected to uninfected mice revealed that Alpha-challenged mice have more total genes differentially activated, conversely, Delta-challenged mice have a higher magnitude of differential gene expression. Delta-challenged mice have increased interferon-dependent gene expression and IFN-{gamma} production compared to Alpha. Analysis of TCR clonotypes suggested that Delta challenged mice have increased T-cell infiltration compared to Alpha challenged. Our data suggest that Delta has evolved to engage interferon responses in a manner that may enhance pathogenesis. The in vivo and in silico observations of this study underscore the need to conduct experiments with VOC strains to best model COVID-19 when evaluating therapeutics and vaccines. ImportanceThe Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 is known to be more transmissible and cause severe disease in human hosts due to mutations in its genome that are divergent from previous variants of concern (VOC). Our study evaluates the pathogenesis of Delta in the K18-hACE2 mouse model compared to the Alpha VOC. We observed that relative to Alpha, Delta challenge results in enhanced inflammation and tissue damage with stronger antiviral responses. These observations provide insight into Deltas unique pathogenesis.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant induces enhanced pathology and inflammatory responses in K18-hACE2 mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Initial cases of COVID-19 trace back to the end of 2019 which has laid foundations for the extensive spread of the disease risking lives worldwide. In response to the global coronavirus pandemic, early diagnosis of the disease is vital to prevent the virus from being spread to a larger population. Because of the unavailability of precise diagnostic toolkits, there arises a crying need to find efficient techniques that can be implemented for faster disease prediction while ensuring the accuracy of the prediction. Artificial intelligence (AI)Cbased solutions have the potential to help diagnose COVID-19 pandemic in an effective way. Automated image analysis with AI techniques can support clinical decision-making, improve workflow efficiency, and allow accurate and fast diagnosis of infection in a large number of patients. In the present study, existing convolutional neural network (CNN) models such as ResNeXt, Channel Boosted CNN, DenseNet, AlexNet, and VGG 16 were repurposed to assist in identifying the presence of COVID-19 before they reach mass scale. The dataset used in the study comprises of computed tomography (CT) images taken from 275 healthy individuals and 195 COVID-19 samples collected from 216 affected individuals. The proposed AI-based approach using deep learning models classifies COVID-19 affected cases by analyzing CT images and provides rapid detection of COVID-19 in a shorter time span. Ensemble classifier employed in this study proved to predict the presence of infection with a greater accuracy of 90.67% compared to the other similar works in the literature.","output":"Deep convolutional neural networkCbased image classification for COVID-19 diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has changed almost all aspects of our lives, and the field of childhood disability is no exception. METHODS This article is based on an invited lecture by the first author at a conference-the eHealth Summit (\\"Pediatric Rehabilitation in a Digital Space\\")-organized by the other authors and their colleagues in May 2020. RESULTS The first author offers his own experiences and perspectives, supplemented by comments and observations contributed by many of the 9000+ attendees at this talk, as curated by the second and third authors. The basic messages are that while life for families of children with developmental disabilities, and for service providers who work with them, is significantly altered, many important lessons are being learned. CONCLUSIONS The comments from participants support the currency of the ideas that were presented, and encourage childhood disability professionals to reflect on what we are learning, so that we can seize the opportunities they afford to do things differently-and we believe better-moving forward. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Ideas generated by colleagues and parents suggest that there may be alternatives to \\"business as usual\\" in childhood disability services after the COVID pandemic is over. People are recognizing opportunities, and benefits, to offering services virtually, including being able to see children in their natural environments, saving parents time, money and hassles to attend clinics in person, and perhaps increasing the availability of services. Many issues remain to be investigated systematically, including, among others, what services (assessments and interventions) require hands-on connections, what payment structures can accommodate new models of services, how professionals can work together in a virtual world, and what families will want. Regardless of the final answers to these issues, we believe that we should not simply \\"go back to normal\\"; rather, we should expand the range, nature and locations of our services for children with developmental disabilities and their families.","output":"Let's not go back to 'normal'! lessons from COVID-19 for professionals working in childhood disability."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We verified the analytical performance of the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay on the m2000 system and compared its clinical performance to the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time PCR Diagnostic Panel and the ThermoFisher TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 kit.

For drugs that are not clinically significant transporter substrates, it is expected that drugCdrug interactions would not result in any changes in volume of distribution. METHODS: An evaluation of this hypothesis proceeded via an extensive analysis of published intravenous metabolic drugCdrug interactions, based on clinically recommended index substrates and inhibitors of major cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. RESULTS: Seventy-two metabolic drug interaction studies were identified where volume of distribution at steady-state (V(ss)) values were available for the CYP index substrates caffeine (CYP1A2), metoprolol (CYP2D6), midazolam (CYP3A4), theophylline (CYP1A2), and tolbutamide (CYP2C9). Changes in exposure (area under the curve) up to 5.1-fold were observed; however, ratios of V(ss) changes have a range of 0.70C1.26, with one outlier displaying a V(ss) ratio of 0.57. DISCUSSION: These results support the widely held founding tenant of pharmacokinetics that clearance and V(ss) are independent parameters. Knowledge that V(ss) is unchanged in metabolic drugCdrug interactions can be helpful in discriminating changes in clearance from changes in bioavailability (F) when only oral dosing data are available, as we have recently demonstrated. As V(ss) remains unchanged for intravenous metabolic drugCdrug interactions, following oral dosing changes in V(ss)/F will reflect changes in F alone. This estimation of F change can subsequently be utilized to assess changes in clearance alone from calculations of apparent clearance. Utilization of this simple methodology for orally dosed drugs will have a significant impact on how drugCdrug interactions are interpreted from drug development and regulatory perspectives.","output":"Volume of Distribution is Unaffected by Metabolic DrugCDrug Interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the experience of prone ventilation in selected patients treated with helmet non-invasive ventilation (NIV) continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for acute respiratory failure in COVID-19 pneumonia.

We aimed to compare the explanatory performance of the adjusted morbidity group (GMA) index in predicting relevant healthcare outcomes with that of other quantitative measures of multimorbidity. METHODS The performance of multimorbidity measures was retrospectively assessed on anonymized records of the entire adult population of Catalonia (North-East Spain). Five quantitative measures of multimorbidity were added to a baseline model based on age, gender, and socioeconomic status: the Charlson index score, the count of chronic diseases according to three different proposals (i.e., the QOF, HCUP, and Karolinska institute), and the multimorbidity index score of the GMA tool. Outcomes included all-cause death, total and non-scheduled hospitalization, primary care and ER visits, medication use, admission to a skilled nursing facility for intermediate care, and high expenditure (time frame 2017). The analysis was performed on 10 subpopulations: all adults (i.e., aged > 17 years), people aged > 64 years, people aged > 64 years and institutionalized in a nursing home for long-term care, and people with specific diagnoses (e.g., ischemic heart disease, cirrhosis, dementia, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The explanatory performance was assessed using the area under the receiving operating curves (AUC-ROC) (main analysis) and three additional statistics (secondary analysis). RESULTS The adult population included 6,224,316 individuals. The addition of any of the multimorbidity measures to the baseline model increased the explanatory performance for all outcomes and subpopulations. All measurements performed better in the general adult population. The GMA index had higher performance and consistency across subpopulations than the rest of multimorbidity measures. The Charlson index stood out on explaining mortality, whereas measures based on exhaustive definitions of chronic diagnostic (e.g., HCUP and GMA) performed better than those using predefined lists of diagnostics (e.g., QOF or the Karolinska proposal). CONCLUSIONS The addition of multimorbidity measures to models for explaining healthcare outcomes increase the performance. The GMA index has high performance in explaining relevant healthcare outcomes and may be useful for clinical practice, resource planning, and public health research.","output":"Performance of quantitative measures of multimorbidity: a population-based retrospective analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Public health officials need tools to assist with anticipating the healthcare resources required to confront the SARS-COV-2 pandemic.

METHODS: The tool uses a SEIR compartmental model to project the pandemics local spread. Users input case counts, healthcare resources, and select intervention strategies to evaluate. Outputs include the number of infections and deaths with and without intervention, and the demand for hospital and critical care beds and ventilators relative to existing capacity. We illustrate the tool using data from three regions of Chile. RESULTS: Our scenarios indicate a surge in COVID-19 patients could overwhelm Chilean hospitals by June, peaking in July or August at 6 to 50 times the current supply of beds and ventilators. A lockdown strategy or combination of case isolation, home quarantine, social distancing of individuals >70 years, and telework interventions may keep treatment demand below capacity.

ASF continued to spread in wild boar in the EU, it entered Germany in September 2020, while Belgium became free from ASF in October 2020. No ASF outbreaks in domestic pigs nor cases in wild boar have been reported in Greece since February 2020. In the Baltic States, overall, there has been a declining trend in proportions of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\\\\positive samples from wild boar carcasses in the last few years. In the other countries, the proportions of PCR\\\\positive wild boar carcasses remained high, indicating continuing spread of the disease. A systematic literature review revealed that the risk factors most frequently significantly associated with ASF in domestic pigs were pig density, low levels of biosecurity and socio\\\\economic factors. For wild boar, most significant risk factors were related to habitat, socio\\\\economic factors and wild boar management. The effectiveness of different control options in the so\\\\named white zones, areas where wild boar densities have been drastically reduced to avoid further spread of ASF after a new introduction, was assessed with a stochastic model. Important findings were that establishing a white zone is much more challenging when the area of ASF incursion is adjacent to an area where limited control measures are in place. Very stringent wild boar population reduction measures in the white zone are key to success. The white zone needs to be far enough away from the affected core area so that the population can be reduced in time before the disease arrives and the timing of this will depend on the wild boar density and the required population reduction target in the white zone. Finally, establishing a proactive white zone along the demarcation line of an affected area requires higher culling efforts, but has a higher chance of success to stop the spread of the disease than establishing reactive white zones after the disease has already entered in the area.","output":"Epidemiological analyses of African swine fever in the European Union: (September 2020 to August 2021)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heparan sulfate (HS) is a cell surface polysaccharide recently identified as a co-receptor with the ACE2 protein for recognition of the S1 spike protein on SARS-CoV2 virus, revealing an attractive new target for therapeutic intervention. Clinically-used heparins demonstrate relevant inhibitory activity, but world supplies are limited, necessitating a synthetic solution. The HS mimetic pixatimod is synthetic drug candidate for cancer with immunomodulatory and heparanase-inhibiting properties. Here we show that pixatimod binds directly to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (S1-RBD), altering its conformation and destabilizing its structure. Molecular modelling identified a binding site overlapping with the ACE2 receptor site. Consistent with this, pixatimod inhibits binding of S1-RBD to ACE2-expressing cells and displays a direct mechanism of action by inhibiting binding of S1-RBD to human ACE2. Assays with four different clinical isolates of live SARS-CoV-2 virus show that pixatimod potently inhibits infection of Vero cells at doses well within its safe therapeutic dose range. This demonstration of potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity establishes that synthetic HS mimetics can target the HS-Spike protein-ACE2 axis. Together with other known activities of pixatimod our data provides a strong rationale for its further investigation as a potential multimodal therapeutic to address the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Synthetic Heparan Sulfate Mimetic Pixatimod (PG545) Potently Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 By Disrupting The Spike-ACE2 interaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loneliness is a common social phenomenon across countries with negative effects in health.

Predictive factors for the technical failure of AA formation and local tumor progression (LTP) were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS The technical success rate of AA formation was 81.8% (296/362). The amount of fluid was higher when the tumor was located in the left lobe of the liver than when it was located in the right lobe (median 950 ml versus 700 ml, p < 0.001).

An effective response to these threats requires rapid and accurate diagnostic tests that can identify causative pathogens at the point of care (POC). Such tests could eliminate diagnostic uncertainties, facilitating patient triaging, minimizing the empiric use of antimicrobial drugs, and enabling targeted treatments. Current standard methods, however, often fail to meet the needs of rapid diagnosis in POC settings. Culture-based assays entail long processing times and require specialized laboratory infrastructure; nucleic acid (NA) tests are often limited to centralized hospitals due to assay complexity and high costs. Here we discuss two new POC tests developed in our groups to enable the rapid diagnosis of infection. The first is nanoPCR that takes advantages of core-shell magnetoplasmonic nanoparticles (MPNs): (i) Au shell significantly accelerates thermocycling via volumetric, plasmonic light-to-heat conversion and (ii) a magnetic core enables sensitive in situ fluorescent detection via magnetic clearing. By adopting a Ferris wheel module, the system expedites multisamples in parallel with a minimal setup. When applied to COVID-19 diagnosis, nanoPCR detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA down to 3.2 copy/L within 17 min. In particular, nanoPCR diagnostics accurately identified COVID-19 cases in clinical samples (n = 150), validating its clinical applicability. The second is a polarization anisotropy diagnostic (PAD) system that exploits the principle of fluorescence polarization (FP) as a detection modality. Fluorescent probes were designed to alter their molecular weight upon recognizing target NAs. This event modulates the probes' tumbling rate (Brownian motion), which leads to changes in FP. The approach is robust against environmental noise and benefits from the ratiometric nature of the signal readout. We applied PAD to detect clinically relevant HAI bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus). The PAD assay demonstrated detection sensitivity down to the single bacterium level and determined both drug resistance and virulence status. In summary, these new tests have the potential to become powerful tools for rapid diagnosis in the infectious disease space. They do not require highly skilled personnel or labor-intensive analyses, and the assays are quick and cost-effective.

Excess death estimates capture deaths both directly and indirectly caused by COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To estimate U.S. excess deaths by racial/ethnic group. DESIGN: Surveillance study. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: All decedents. MEASUREMENTS: Excess deaths and excess deaths per 100 000 persons from March to December 2020 were estimated by race/ethnicity, sex, age group, and cause of death, using provisional death certificate data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. Census Bureau population estimates. RESULTS: An estimated 2.88 million deaths occurred between March and December 2020. Compared with the number of expected deaths based on 2019 data, 477 200 excess deaths occurred during this period, with 74% attributed to COVID-19. Age-standardized excess deaths per 100 000 persons among Black, American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), and Latino males and females were more than double those in White and Asian males and females. NonCCOVID-19 excess deaths also disproportionately affected Black, AI/AN, and Latino persons. Compared with White males and females, nonCCOVID-19 excess deaths per 100 000 persons were 2 to 4 times higher in Black, AI/AN, and Latino males and females, including deaths due to diabetes, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and Alzheimer disease. Excess deaths in 2020 resulted in substantial widening of racial/ethnic disparities in all-cause mortality from 2019 to 2020. LIMITATIONS: Completeness and availability of provisional CDC data; no estimates of precision around results. CONCLUSION: There were profound racial/ethnic disparities in excess deaths in the United States in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in rapid increases in racial/ethnic disparities in all-cause mortality between 2019 and 2020.

We and others have been developing drug-loaded nanoparticles that home to the sites of infection and inflammation via engineered tropism for neutrophils, the first-responder leukocytes in bacterial infections. Here, we examined how a member of a broad class of neutrophil-tropic nanoparticles affects neutrophil behavior, specifically questioning whether the nanoparticles attenuate an important function, bacterial phagocytosis. We found these nanoparticles actually augment phagocytosis of non-opsonized bacteria, increasing it by ~50%. We showed this augmentation of phagocytosis is likely co-opting an evolved response, as opsonized bacteria also augment phagocytosis of non-opsonized bacteria. Enhancing phagocytosis of non-opsonized bacteria may prove particularly beneficial in two clinical situations: in hypocomplementemic patients (meaning low levels of the main bacterial opsonins, complement proteins, seen in conditions such as neonatal sepsis and liver failure) or for bacteria that are largely resistant to complement opsonization (e.g., Neisseria). Additionally, we observe that; a) prior treatment with bacteria augments neutrophil uptake of neutrophil-tropic nanoparticles; b) neutrophil-tropic nanoparticles colocalize with bacteria inside of neutrophils. The observation that neutrophil-tropic nanoparticles enhance neutrophil phagocytosis and localize with bacteria inside neutrophils suggests that these nanoparticles will serve as useful carriers for drugs to ameliorate bacterial diseases.","output":"Nanoparticle-induced augmentation of neutrophils phagocytosis of bacteria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Complicated gastric lymphatic drainage potentially undermines the utility of sentinel node (SN) biopsy in patients with gastric cancer. Encouraged by several favorable single-institution reports, we conducted a multicenter, single-arm, phase II study of SN mapping that used a standardized dual tracer endoscopic injection technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with previously untreated cT1 or cT2 gastric adenocarcinomas < 4 cm in gross diameter were eligible for inclusion in this study. SN mapping was performed by using a standardized dual tracer endoscopic injection technique. Following biopsy of the identified SNs, mandatory comprehensive D2 or modified D2 gastrectomy was performed according to current Japanese Gastric Cancer Association guidelines. RESULTS Among 433 patients who gave preoperative consent, 397 were deemed eligible on the basis of surgical findings. SN biopsy was performed in all patients, and the SN detection rate was 97.5% (387 of 397). Of 57 patients with lymph node metastasis by conventional hematoxylin and eosin staining, 93% (53 of 57) had positive SNs, and the accuracy of nodal evaluation for metastasis was 99% (383 of 387). Only four false-negative SN biopsies were observed, and pathologic analysis revealed that three of those biopsies were pT2 or tumors > 4 cm. We observed no serious adverse effects related to endoscopic tracer injection or the SN mapping procedure.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (nCOV-2019) has created mass panic in China due to its highly contagious by contact and aerosols and lack of effective treatment. However, the emotion status of migraineurs stayed unclear during the nCOV-2019 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: To understand psychological distress of migraineurs by comparing with common population and identify potential high-risk factors of severe psychological distress among migraine patients. METHOD: We enrolled the migraineurs treated at the department of Neurology of West China Hospital and healthy controls with age- and sex-matched to migraineurs. Data on clinicodemographics and psychological distress in the month of February 2020 (during in the nCOV-2019 outbreak in China) were collected. We used the Kessler 6-item (K-6) scale to assess psychological distress. Potential risk factors of severe psychological distress were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: The 144 migraineurs and 150 controls were included in the study. Migraineurs showed significantly higher K-6 scores than controls (P < 0.001). Migraine attack frequency in previous 30 days and time spent paying attention to outbreak showed significant in multivariate logistic regression with respective odds ratios of 2.225 (95%CI 1.361-3.628, P = 0.001) and 1.589 (95% 1.117-2.26, P = 0.01).

While socioeconomic factors were suggested to contribute to this trend, they arguably do not explain the range of the differences observed, allowing for possible genetic implications. Almost concurrently, the analysis of a cohort in Chinese COVID-19 patients proposed an association between the severity of the disease and the presence of the minor allele of rs12252 of the Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) gene. This SNP, together with rs34481144, are the two most studied polymorphisms of IFITM3 and have been associated in the past with increased severity in Influenza, Dengue, Ebola, and HIV viruses. IFITM3 is an immune effector protein that is pivotal for the restriction of viral replication, but also for the regulation of cytokine production. Following up to these two developments in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the present study investigates a possible association between the differences in mortality of ethnic groups in England and the combined haplotypes of rs12252 and rs34481144. The respective allele frequencies were collected for 26 populations from 1000 Genomes Project and subgroups were pooled wherever possible to create correspondences with ethnic groups in England. A significant correlation (r=0.9687, p= 0.0003) was observed between the reported Standardized Mortality Ratios and the frequency of the combined haplotype of both reference alleles, suggesting that the combination of reference alleles of the specific SNPs may be implicated in more severe outcomes of COVID-19.

To prevent this, an antibiotic-free strategy would be highly desirable. Magnetic nanoparticle (MNP)-mediated hyperthermia-induced antimicrobial therapy is an attractive option as it is considered safe for human use. Given that iron and zinc are critical for bacterial virulence, we evaluated the response of multiple pathogenic bacteria to these elements. Treatment with 1 mM iron and zinc precursors resulted in the intracellular biosynthesis of MNPs in multiple Gram-positive and Gram-negative disease-causing bacteria. The superparamagnetic nanoparticles in the treated bacteria/biofilms, generated heat upon exposure to an alternating magnetic field (AMF), which resulted in an increase in the temperature (5-6 C) of the milieu with a subsequent decrease in bacterial viability. Furthermore, we observed for the first time that virulent bacteria derived from infected samples harbour MNPs, suggesting that the bacteria had biosynthesised the MNPs using the metal ions acquired from the host. AMF treatment of the bacterial isolates from the infected specimens resulted in a strong reduction in viability (3-4 logs) as compared to vancomycin/ciprofloxacin treatment.

Understanding factors that promote minorities in research helps address this participation gap. Minorities often face representation disparities, including health education, socioeconomic status, and race. Compared to other races in the USA, over 50% of African Americans (AA) over age 65 face obstacles towards achieving basic health literacy skills. This study aims to investigate differences in beliefs regarding research and health literacy between White and AA participants. METHODS: This cross-sectional study compared 46 AA vs. 60 White healthy older adults (n = 106; age = 73.97  10.6 years). Participants were assessed once with the Participant Attitudes and Beliefs towards Research Questionnaire (PABRQ) and two validated health literacy measures, the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) and the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy for Adults (S-TOFHLA). RESULTS: Controlling for age, sex, and education, AA performed significantly worse on REALM. Compared to White participants, AA more likely believed that researchers were motivated to perform studies to increase their general knowledge. Participants with lower health literacy scores more likely believed that scientists were motivated to conduct research to minimize treatment expenses. About 83C85% of participants reported not being familiar with the informed consent process, 90C95% had positive attitudes towards research involvement, and 38C52% believed researchers performed to promote their own careers.

The current pandemic will end only after a safe, effective vaccine becomes available and protective herd immunity has been achieved through vaccination. The key parameter to gauge protective immunity is neutralizing antibody levels. Thus, reliable serology testing is essential to diagnose whether an individual has been previously infected, as a large proportion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections is asymptomatic. For both naturally infected and vaccinated individuals, it is critical to monitor their neutralizing antibody titers over time. This is because, when neutralizing antibody levels wane below a threshold which remains to be determined, they become vulnerable to reinfection. Due to the importance of serology testing, academia and industry have developed different platforms for serological diagnosis, many of which have achieved the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA). Here we summarize the status of COVID-19 serology testing, discuss challenges, and provide future directions for improvement.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 serology testing: Progress and challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The agencies of the government of the United States of America, such as the Food and Drug Administration or the Environmental Protection Agency, intervene in American society through the collection, processing, and diffusion of information.

Whilst phylogenetic methods can help identify mutations that may be important for evolutionary processes such as adaptation to a new host, these can be enhanced by positioning candidate mutations to known functional sites on protein structures. Over the past two decades, three zoonotic betacoronaviruses have significantly impacted human public health: SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, whilst two other betacoronaviruses, HKU1 and OC43, have circulated endemically in the human population for over 100 years. In this study, we use a comparative approach to prospectively search for potentially evolutionarily-relevant mutations within the Orf1ab and S genes across betacoronavirus species that have demonstrated sustained human-to-human transmission (HKU1, OC43, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2). We used a combination of molecular evolution methods to identify 30 sites that display evidence of homoplasy and/or stepwise evolution, that may be suggestive of adaptation across emerging and endemic betacoronaviruses. Of these, seven sites also display evidence of being selectively relevant. Drawing upon known protein structure data, we find that four of the identified mutations [18121 (exonuclease/27), 21623 (spike/21), 21635 (spike/25) and 23948 (spike/796), in SARS-CoV-2 genome coordinates] are proximal to regions of known functionality.

Anti-spike monoclonal antibodies, including bamlanivimab, have demonstrated reduction in hospitalization rates in clinical trials, yet real-world evidence is lacking. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study across a single healthcare system of non-hospitalized patients, age 18 years or older, with documented positive SARS-CoV-2 testing, risk factors for severe COVID-19, and referrals for bamlanivimab via emergency use authorization. Cases were defined as patients who received bamlanivimab; contemporary controls had a referral order placed but did not receive bamlanivimab. The primary outcome was 30-day hospitalization rate from initial positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Descriptive statistics, including Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U test, were performed. Multivariable logistic regression was used for adjusted analysis to evaluate independent associations with 30-day hospitalization. RESULTS: Between November 20, 2020 and January 19, 2021, 218 patients received bamlanivimab (cases) and 185 were referred but did not receive drug (controls). Thirty-day hospitalization rate was significantly lower among patients who received bamlanivimab (7.3% v 20.0%, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21-0.64, p<0.001), and the number needed to treat was 8. On logistic regression, odds of hospitalization were increased in patients not receiving bamlanivimab and with a higher number of pre-specified comorbidities (OR 4.19 CI: 1.31-2.16, p<0.001; OR 1.68, CI: 2.12-8.30, p<0.001, respectively).

A brief intervention involving a computer game as an imagery-competing task has shown promising results for reducing the number of intrusive memories of traumaone of the core clinical symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. To date, the intervention has only been delivered face-to-face. To be tested and implemented on a wider scale, digital adaptation for remote delivery is crucial. An important first step is to develop digitalized intervention materials in a systematic way based on feedback from clinicians, researchers, and students in preparation for pilot testing with target users. OBJECTIVE: The first aim of this study is to obtain and analyze qualitative feedback on digital intervention materials, namely two animated videos and two quizzes that explain the target clinical symptoms and provide intervention instructions. The second aim is to refine the digitalized materials based on this feedback. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with 12 participants who had delivered or had knowledge of the intervention when delivered face-to-face. We obtained in-depth feedback on the perceived feasibility of using the digitalized materials and suggestions for improvements. Interviews were assessed using qualitative content analysis, and suggested improvements were evaluated for implementation using a systematic method of prioritization. RESULTS: A total of three overarching themes were identified from the data. First, participants were highly positive about the potential benefits of using these digital materials for remote delivery, reporting that the videos effectively conveyed key concepts of the symptom and its treatment. Second, some modifications to the materials were suggested for improving clarity. On the basis of this feedback, we made nine specific changes. Finally, participants raised some key challenges for remote delivery, mainly in overcoming the lack of real-time communication during the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians, researchers, and clinical psychology students were overall confident in the use of digitalized materials to remotely deliver a brief intervention to reduce intrusive memories of trauma. Guided by participant feedback, we identified and implemented changes to refine the intervention materials.

Unfortunately, longitudinal studies related to overparenting were severely lacking, particularly on its impacts on early adolescents. Moreover, studies examining the mediational pathways through which overparenting is associated with adolescent anxiety are scant. This study examined the mediating role of parent-child conflict (father-child and mother-child) in the relationship between overparenting (paternal and maternal) and adolescent anxiety over time. Method: Based on a three-wave longitudinal data of 1074 Chinese early adolescents in Hong Kong, the relationships among paternal and maternal overparenting, father- and mother-child conflict, and adolescent anxiety were assessed. Results: Mother-child conflict mediated the relationship between maternal overparenting and adolescent anxiety over time. Besides, a reverse association of prior adolescent anxiety with subsequent maternal overparenting via mother-child conflict was also identified. In addition, adolescent gender and family intactness did not moderate the relationships among overparenting, parent-child conflict, and adolescent anxiety.

Smoking cessation reduces subsequent cardiovascular events and mortality. Smoking is a real chronic disorder characterized by the development of an addiction status mainly due to nicotine. This condition makes the smokers generally unable to quit smoking without help. Different strategies are available to treat smoking dependence that include both non-pharmacological (behavioral counselling) and pharmacological therapies. Currently, it is well accepted that smoking cessation drugs are effective and safe in real-world settings. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, bupropion and cytisine are the main pharmacological strategies available for smoking cessation. Their efficacy and safety have been proved even in patients with chronic cardiovascular disease. Each of these drugs has peculiar characteristics and the clinician should customize the smoking cessation strategy based on currently available scientific evidence and patient's preference, paying particular attention to those patients having specific cardiovascular and psychiatric comorbidities.

Existing quarantine policies led to large-scale lock-downs because of the slow tracking of the infection paths, and indeed we see new waves of the disease. This can be solved by contact tracing combined with efficient testing policies. Since the number of daily tests is limited, it is crucial to exploit them efficiently to improve the outcome of contact tracing (technological or human-based epidemiological investigations). We develop a controlled testing framework to achieve this goal. The key is to test individuals with high probability of being infected to identify them before symptoms appear. These probabilities are updated based on contact tracing and test results. We demonstrate that the proposed method could reduce the quarantine and morbidity rates compared to existing methods by up to a 50%. The results clearly demonstrate the necessity of accelerating the epidemiological investigations by using technological contact tracing. Furthermore, proper use of the testing capacity using the proposed controlled testing methodology leads to significantly improved results under both small and large testing capacities.

Four hundred and sixty two and 507 adult participants aged 18 years and above responded to the first and second survey respectively, with >70% being males RESULTS: more than 98% of respondents reported wearing face masks. A five-point adherence score was constituted by scoring observance to key preventive measures (mask use, physical distancing, hand hygiene, coughing hygiene and avoiding to touch ones face). We observed that the mean adherence scores were fairly stable over time, respectively 4.08 and 4.03 during the first and second survey (p=0.439).

However, little is known about use of social media platforms by pulmonary and critical care medicine fellowship programs. Objective: We identify and characterize pulmonary and critical care fellowship programs using Twitter and Instagram, as well as the posting behaviors of their social media accounts. Methods: We identified all adult and pediatric pulmonary, critical care medicine (CCM), and combined pulmonary and critical care medicine (PCCM) programs in the United States using the Electronic Residency Application Service. We searched for Twitter profiles for each program between January 1, 2018, and September 30, 2018. Tweets and Twitter interactions were classified into the following three types: social, clinical, or medical education (MedEd) related. We collected data about content enhancements of tweets, including the use of pictures, graphics interchange format or videos, hashtags, links, and tagging other accounts. The types of tweets, content enhancement characteristics, and measures of engagement were analyzed for association with number of followers. Results: We assessed 341 programs, including 163 PCCM, 36 adult CCM, 20 adult pulmonary, 67 pediatric CCM, and 55 pediatric pulmonary programs. Thirty-three (10%) programs had Twitter accounts. Of 1,903 tweets by 33 of the 341 programs with Twitter accounts, 476 (25%) were MedEd related, 733 (39%) were clinical, and 694 (36%) were social. The median rate of tweets per month was 1.65 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.4C6.65), with 55% programs tweeting more than monthly.

The effect of BMI on platelet traits measured by Sysmex XN-1000 was explored in 33388 UK blood donors from the INTERVAL study. Linear regression was used for observational analyses between BMI and platelet characteristics. Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to estimate a causal effect with BMI proxied by a genetic risk score. Follow-up analysis explored the relevance of platelet characteristics on whole blood platelet aggregation in a pre-operative cardiac cohort (COPTIC) using linear regression. Observationally, higher BMI was positively associated with greater plateletcrit (PCT), platelet count (PLT), immature platelet count (IPC) and side fluorescence (SFL, a measure of mRNA content used to derive IPC). MR provided causal estimates for a positive effect of BMI on both SFL and IPC (IPC 0.06 SDs higher per SD higher BMI, 95% CI 0.006 to 0.12, P=0.03), but there was no strong evidence for a causal effect of BMI on PCT or PLT. The COPTIC study provided observational evidence for a positive association between IPC and whole blood platelet aggregation induced by adrenaline, TRAP-6 and ADP.

The cumulative incidence of death through day 28 was 10.7% in the emtricitabine/tenofovir + colchicine + rosuvastatin arm, 14.4% in the colchicine + rosuvastatin arm, 13.8% in the emtricitabine/tenofovir arm, and 17.4% in the standard of care arm, with adjusted risk differences (aRD) against the standard treatment of -0.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.17 to 0.04), aRD -0.03 (95%CI: -0.11 to 0.05) and aRD: -0.05 (95%CI: -0.15 to 0.05), respectively. Need for invasive mechanical ventilation was lower in the emtricitabine/tenofovir + colchicine + rosuvastatin arm compared to the standard treatment arm, aRD: -0.06 (95%CI: -0.11 to -0,01), but no differences were found between the other comparisons. SAE occurred in 3 patients distributed in the 3 treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS Among patients hospitalized with moderate and severe SARS Covid-19, the use of the emtricitabine/tenofovir + colchicine + rosuvastatin combination emerges as a treatment alternative.","output":"Effectiveness of Rosuvastatin plus Colchicine, Emtricitabine/Tenofovir and a combination of them in Hospitalized Patients with SARS Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A brief query was fielded to Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities across the United States to provide an initial assessment of recreation therapy (RT) and creative arts therapy (CAT) telehealth utilization.

Multinomial and logistic regression analyses were used to determine the factors that influenced avoidance and hesitancy. In total, 34% of participants stated that their child required healthcare during the pandemic, of whom 22% decided against seeking healthcare. Parents who reported being much more hesitant about accessing healthcare were more likely to report mild-moderate (Relative Risk Ratio (RRR) = 2.31, CI: 1.54-3.47) and severe-extremely severe stress (RRR: 3.37, CI: 1.81-6.27). Parents who understood government advice to mean avoiding health services were more likely to be hesitant to attend (RRR: 1.71, CI; 1.10-2.67). These effects held when restrictions were beginning to be lifted. Higher levels of stress were associated with a parent believing that the government advice meant that they should not attend health services (OR: 1.66, CI: 1.14-2.41).

Confidence in COVID-19 vaccines produced in China and preference for domestically-made or foreign-made vaccines was also investigated. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional, self-administered online survey was conducted on 1C19 May 2020. The health belief model (HBM) was used as a theoretical framework for understanding COVID-19 vaccination intent and WTP. RESULTS: A total of 3,541 complete responses were received. The majority reported a probably yes intent (54.6%), followed by a definite yes intent (28.7%). The perception that vaccination decreases the chances of getting COVID-19 under the perceived benefit construct (OR = 3.14, 95% CI 2.05C4.83) and not being concerned about the efficacy of new COVID-19 vaccines under the perceived barriers construct (OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.31C2.09) were found to have the highest significant odds of a definite intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) of WTP for COVID-19 vaccine was CNY200/US$28 (IQR CNY100C500/USD$14C72). The highest marginal WTP for the vaccine was influenced by socio-economic factors. The majority were confident (48.7%) and completely confident (46.1%) in domestically-made COVID-19 vaccine. 64.2% reported a preference for a domestically-made over foreign-made COVID-19 vaccine.

The main aim of the study was to assess the safety of this approach, through the risk of developing severe neonatal infection. Material and Methods: Prospective observational study from April 2020 to February 2021 on the approach and neonatal follow-up of infants born to mothers with COVID-19 at the time of delivery in a hospital with advanced neonatal care, where rooming in and breastfeeding were promoted whenever possible. We collected data during hospital admission and over the phone during the neonatal period. Results: We included 77 infants born to mothers with COVID-19 (3.8% of newborns born during the time of study), median gestational age 39 weeks + 5 days and median birth weight 3270 g;9% were born premature (versus 12% born premature among newborns born during the time of study). Rooming-in took place in all of them although 4% were briefly admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit;88% were discharged home up to day three, 97% were breastfed at the time of discharge and 90% were still breastfed by the end of the neonatal period. We completed neonatal follow-up of 63 newborns, eight of them developed COVID-associated symptoms, three with need of medical evaluation;40% had no medical assessment after being discharged. Out of 77, 5% of infants were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (total of four, one mild, three asymptomatic), with no significant differences during hospital stay or follow-up. Discussion: Neonatal infection was uncommon and mild, and there was no increase in prematurity. Rooming-in and breastfeeding were safe and should be promoted whenever clinically possible.

The EUA allows for COVID-19 mAb infusion to occur up to 10 days from symptom onset and due to logistics, mAb treatment typically occurs later in this 10 day window. Efficacy of early versus late mAb treatment is unknown METHODS: In this single center, retrospective case-control study, we performed a risk factor analysis of patients with mild COVID-19 infection treated with mAb on the composite outcome of subsequent evaluation in the Emergency Department (ED) or inpatient admission December 2020 through May 2021. Multivariate analysis of variables found to be significant in univariate analysis was performed using STATA 15 statistical software RESULTS: Two-hundred eighty-eight patients who received mAb treatment were included in analysis. The mean age was 58.6 years and 59.7% were female, 64.9% white, and 27.1% African American. Following mAb infusion, 31 (10.8%) had disease progression resulting in an ED encounter or inpatient admission. Patients who received early (days 1-5 of symptoms) mAb infusion were less likely to have progressive disease than patients with late (days 6-12 of symptoms) infusion; (6.1% vs 13.2%; P= 0.048). Zero of 21 patients who received mAb infusion on day 1-3 of symptoms had disease progression.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought tremendous disruption to various aspects of daily life, especially for parents of young children, ages 3C5, who face isolation, disconnection, and unprecedented changes to how they engage and socialize. Fortunately, both youth and parent brains are plastic and receptive to change. Resilience research shows that factors such as engaging in acts of kindness, developing trusting relationships, and responding compassionately to the feelings of others can help lay new neural pathways and improve quality of life. Yet, little research has investigated the effects of brain healthy parental practices of kindness with pre-school aged children. The current study examines whether an interactive, parentCchild kindness curriculum can serve as a potentiator for brain health as measured by resilience and child empathy levels. During a peak of the pandemic, mother participants between the ages of 26C46 (n = 38, completion rate 75%) completed questionnaires on parental resilience levels and parent-reported child empathic pro-social behaviors before and after engaging in a 4 weeks online, self-paced, kindness curriculum. Half of the group received additional brain health education explaining the principles of neuroplasticity, empathy, perspective taking, and resiliency. Mothers in both groups showed increased resilience ( p < 0.001) and reported higher levels of empathic behavior in their child ( p < 0.001) after completing the curriculum. There was no significant difference between groups. Comparison of mean resilience levels during COVID-19 to pre-pandemic general means indicated that mothers are reporting significantly lower levels of resilience as well as decreased empathetic behaviors in their children. These results support the notion that kindness is a powerful brain health booster that can increase resilience and empathy. This research study was timely and relevant for parents in light of the myriad of stresses brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

STUDY SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This was an observational cross-sectional study involving 1012 independent, community-dwelling very old persons (507 men, 505 women; aged 85C89 years) in Kawasaki city, Japan. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the cross-sectional associations between multimorbidity and poor self-rated health (SRH) and life satisfaction using binary logistic regression. The secondary outcome was the association of subjective health with each chronic condition. RESULTS: The prevalence of multimorbidity (2 conditions) was 94.7%, and the average number of chronic conditions was 4.471.9. Multimorbidity was significantly associated with poor SRH in the adjusted model only when six or more chronic conditions were present (OR 4.80; 95% CI 1.34 to 17.11; p=0.016). Cerebrovascular disease, heart disease, respiratory disease, connective tissue disease and arthritis showed significant associations with poor SRH after multivariate adjustment. Sex-specific analysis replicated associations between multimorbidity with six or more conditions and SRH in both men and women, while the diseases with the greatest impact on SRH differed between men and women. Most conditions were not associated with low satisfaction with life scale, with the exception of arthritis (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.78, p=0.001).

During outbreaks, air samples were collected using three different active and one passive air sampling technique in rooms of infected patients. Oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) of the residents and dry surface swabs were collected. Additionally, longitudinal passive air samples were collected during a period of 4 months in common areas of the wards. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was determined using RT-qPCR, targeting the RdRp- and E-genes. OPS, samples of two active air samplers and surface swabs with Ct value []35 were tested for the presence of infectious virus by cell culture. In total, 360 air and 319 surface samples from patient rooms and common areas were collected. In rooms of 10 residents with detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in OPS, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 93 of 184 collected environmental samples (50.5%) (lowest Ct 29,5), substantially more than in the rooms of residents with negative OPS on the day of environmental sampling (n=2) (3.6%).

Based on the current information, most patients have exhibited good prognoses in terms of after-effects or sequelae and low mortality rate. Patients that became critically ill were primarily in the elderly population or had chronic underlying diseases, including diabetes and hypertension. Among all working sectors, HCWs, since they are front-line caregivers for patients with COVID-19, are considered to be in the high-risk population. Increased age and a number of comorbidity factors have been associated with increased risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19. The most frequent complications of COVID-19 reported that can cause fatality in patients were SARS, cardiac arrest, secondary infections and septic shock, in addition to acute kidney failure and liver failure. Overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing challenge, which poses a threat to global health that requires close surveillance and prompt diagnosis, in coordination with research efforts to understand this pathogen and develop effective countermeasures.","output":"Survey on COVID-19-related mortality associated with occupational infection during the first phase of the pandemic: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The antigen and antibody kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients remains unclear, and the clinical values of the serological test have not been completely elucidated.

Samples were screened for SARS-CoV-2-specific total antibodies (TAb), IgA, IgM, IgG, and antigen (Ag) using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays (CMIA). The overall seroconversion and/or four-fold increase rates of TAb, IgA, IgM, and IgG during hospitalization were 92.31%, 92.31%, 84.62%, and 92.31%, respectively. However, within a week of onset, antibodies were present in <50% of the patients. The combination of Ag and/or TAb maintained the positive rate at 81.82% during the first three days after symptom onset and quickly enhanced to 92.31% during 4C6 days after the symptom onset. The seropositive median day of Ag was two days after symptom onset. Among patients who underwent IgM and IgG seroconversion, the seroconversion median days of IgA, TAb, IgM, and IgG were 9.5 days, 10 days, 11 days, and 11.5 days after the symptom onset, respectively.

In order to understand the colonization process of limestone, we have maintained limestone blocks under optimal Lampenflora growth conditions. Moreover, some limestone blocks were painted with several pigments that were used in the prehistory (e.g., red ocher, bone char). Microorganisms and bryophyte growth were monitored during 1 year, and then, the block samples were treated using UV-C light (254 nm). Thus, obtained results were compared with in situ treatment in La Glacire cave. Results have showed dense bryophyte propagation on the several blocks. However, the growth rate was correlated with the chemical composition of the pigment. In fact, the presence of some chemical elements such as As, Cr, Ti, and Co contributed to reduce bryophyte growth. Finally, moss treatment using UV-C light has demonstrated high efficiency under in situ condition, while a fast recolonization has been observed for samples maintained in laboratory. This difference was explained by the high bryophyte density under laboratory conditions that make UV-C light penetration difficult.","output":"Factors inducing bryophyte growth on prehistoric pigments and effect of UV-C treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rhizomes of many Atractylodes species, including Atractylodes chinensis Koidzumi, Atractylodes macrocephala Koidzumi, and Atractylodes japonica Koidzumi, are collectively termed Atractylodis Rhizoma.

Understanding the level of ascertainment (the ratio of confirmed symptomatic cases to the true number of symptomatic individuals) and undetected epidemic progression is crucial to informing COVID-19 response planning, including the introduction and relaxation of control measures. Estimating case ascertainment over time allows for accurate estimates of specific outcomes such as seroprevalence, which is essential for planning control measures. Methods: Using reported data on COVID-19 cases and fatalities globally, we estimated the proportion of symptomatic cases (i.e. any person with any of fever >= to 37.5C, cough, shortness of breath, sudden onset of anosmia, ageusia or dysgeusia illness) that were reported in 210 countries and territories, given those countries had experienced more than ten deaths. We used published estimates of the case fatality ratio (CFR) as an assumed baseline. We then calculated the ratio of this baseline CFR to an estimated local delay-adjusted CFR to estimate the level of under-ascertainment in a particular location. We then fit a Bayesian Gaussian process model to estimate the temporal pattern of under-ascertainment. Results: We estimate that, during March 2020, the median percentage of symptomatic cases detected across the 84 countries which experienced more than ten deaths ranged from 2.38% (Bangladesh) to 99.6% (Chile). Across the ten countries with the highest number of total confirmed cases as of 6th July 2020, we estimated that the peak number of symptomatic cases ranged from 1.4 times (Chile) to 17.8 times (France) larger than reported. Comparing our model with national and regional seroprevalence data where available, we find that our estimates are consistent with observed values. Finally, we estimated seroprevalence for each country. Despite low case detection in some countries, our results that adjust for this still suggest that all countries have had only a small fraction of their populations infected as of July 2020. Conclusions: We found substantial under-ascertainment of symptomatic cases, particularly at the peak of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in many countries. Reported case counts will therefore likely underestimate the rate of outbreak growth initially and underestimate the decline in the later stages of an epidemic. Although there was considerable under-reporting in many locations, our estimates were consistent with emerging serological data, suggesting that the proportion of each country's population infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide is generally low.","output":"Reconstructing the global dynamics of under-ascertained COVID-19 cases and infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dawn of the 20th century saw the formative years of developments in immunology. In particular, immunochemistry, specifically pertaining to antibodies, was extensively studied. These studies laid the foundations for employing antibodies in a variety of ways. Not surprisingly, antibodies have been used for applications ranging from biomedical research to disease diagnostics and therapeutics to evaluation of immune responses during natural infection and those elicited by vaccines. Despite recent advancements in cellular immunology and the excitement of T cell therapy, use of antibodies represents a large proportion of immunotherapeutic approaches as well as clinical interventions. Polyclonal antibodies in the form of plasma or sera continue to be used to treat a number of diseases, including autoimmune disorders, cancers, and infectious diseases. Historically, antisera to toxins have been the longest serving biotherapeutics. In addition, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) have been extensively used to treat not only immunodeficiency conditions but also autoimmune disorders. Beyond the simplistic suppositions of their action, the IVIg have also unraveled the immune regulatory and homeostatic ramifications of their use. The advent of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), on the other hand, has provided a clear pathway for their development as drug molecules.

METHODS: A modified Boyden chamber was used to assess chemokine-induced migration of THP-1 monocytes. Macropinocytosis was assessed using Lucifer yellow and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) uptake using DiI-labelled oxLDL in THP-1 macrophages and human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs). IL-6, TNF- and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE2) release by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated PBMCs from RA patients and HCs was measured by ELISA. The transcriptomic profile of PNLA-treated, LPS-activated PBMCs was investigated by RNA-sequencing. RESULTS: PNLA reduced THP-1 cell migration by 55% (P < 0.001). Macropinocytosis and DiI-oxLDL uptake were reduced by 50% (P < 0.001) and 40% (P < 0.01), respectively, in THP-1 macrophages and 40% (P < 0.01) and 25% (P < 0.05), respectively, in HMDMs. PNLA reduced IL-6 and TNF- release from LPS-stimulated PBMCs from RA patients by 60% (P < 0.001) and from HCs by 50% and 35%, respectively (P < 0.01). PNLA also reduced PGE2 levels in such PBMCs from RA patients and HCs (P < 0.0001).

Some studies show that up to half of the events are diagnosed early after admission. OBJECTIVES: To study symptomatic VTE incidence in acute COVID-19 hospitalized patients and to describe timing of VTE diagnosis. METHODS: Multicenter cohort of 5966 patients hospitalized with acute COVID-19. Multicenter Registry of 844 hospitalized patients with acute COVID-19 and associated acute VTE. RESULTS: By the time of cohort data collection, 68 patients (1.14%) were still hospitalized, 19.8% had died, and 5.4% required ICU. During a median follow-up of 6 days (IQR, 4C12), 183 patients (3.07%; 95% CI, 2.64C3.55) presented a symptomatic VTE event. The cumulative incidences of VTE at 7, 14 and 21 days in wards [2.3% (95% CI, 1.9C2.7), 3.6% (95% CI, 3.0C4.3), and 4.3% (95% CI, 3.5C5.1)] were similar to the ones reported in ICU [2.2% (95% CI, 1.0C4.4), 2.9% (95% CI, 1.5C5.3), and 4.1% (95% CI, 2.2C6.8)], but at 30 and 60 days were higher in ICU [6.9% (95% CI, 4.2C10.5), and 12.8% (95% CI, 8.1C18.5)] than in wards. Eighty-eight VTE events (48%) were diagnosed early, within 48 h of admission. VTE was not associated with death (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.55C1.12). CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of symptomatic VTE in our COVID-19 cohort is consistent with that of other real-life studies recently published. Early VTE events are, along with COVID-19, the reason for admission rather than an in-hospital complication.","output":"Incidence and clinical profile of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized COVID-19 patients from Madrid region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International broadcasting, defined as the use of electronic media by one society to shape the opinion of the people and leaders of another, is an area of public diplomacy research ripe for scholarly attention (Price in Media and sovereignty: the global information revolution and its challenge to state power, MIT Press, Cambridge, 2002). The primary agent for U.S. international broadcasting is the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which operates in 62 languages in over 100 countries. While there is broad consensus in the literature that evaluation in public diplomacy is extremely difficult, USAGM has a unique challenge of assessing impact across such a broad and diverse geography of audiences and media environments. Moreover, as an independent public service media agency, USAGM is often called upon to show it is a responsible steward of resources by demonstrating the effectiveness of its programs to policymakers and key stakeholders (Metzgar in Seventy years of the Smith-Mundt Act and U.S. International broadcasting: Back to the future?

However, not all the patients were suitable for corticosteroid therapy. In this study, we aimed to propose a machine learning model to forecast the response to corticosteroid therapy in COVID-19 patients. We retrospectively collected the clinical data about 666 COVID-19 patients receiving corticosteroid therapy between January 27, 2020, and March 30, 2020, from two hospitals in China. The response to corticosteroid therapy was evaluated by hospitalization time, oxygen supply duration, and the outcomes of patients. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) was applied for feature selection. Five prediction models were applied in the training cohort and assessed in an internal and an external validation dataset, respectively. Finally, two (C reactive protein, lymphocyte percent) of 36 candidate immune/inflammatory features were finally used for model development. All five models displayed promising predictive performance. Notably, the ensemble model, PRCTC (prediction of response to corticosteroid therapy in COVID-19 patients), derived from three prediction models including Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT), Neural Network (NN), and logistic regression (LR), achieved the best performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.810 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.760C0.861) in internal validation cohort and 0.845 (95% CI 0.779C0.911) in external validation cohort to predict patients response to corticosteroid therapy.

Recent federal policies in response to the coronavirus pandemic have relaxed major barriers to conducting synchronous videoconference visits in the home. However, the efficacy and benefits of virtual visits relative to in-person visits remained unclear for burn patients. Accordingly, a clinical quality assurance database maintained during the coronavirus pandemic (3/3/2020 to 9/8/2020) for virtual and/or in-person visits at a comprehensive adult and pediatric burn center was queried for demographics, burn severity, visit quality, and distance data. A total of 143 patients were included in this study with 317 total outpatient encounters (61 virtual and 256 in-person).

METHODS We examined responses of pre-clinical medical students to the remote electronic learning in terms of quality of and satisfaction with teaching and technical support, attendance to classes, and the desire to continue electronic learning in the post-epidemic era. A survey of responses from first-year students at the Adelson School of Medicine was conducted. To optimize the reliability of the survey, a single research assistant conducted telephone interviews with each student, using a structured questionnaire concerning aspects of participation and satisfaction with teaching and with technical components of the remote electronic learning. RESULTS With 100% response rate, the students reported high satisfaction with the electronic learning regarding its quality, online interactions, instructions given, technical assistance, and availability of recording for future studies. Most of the students (68.6%) noted a preference to continue < 90% of the learning online in the post-outbreak era. A high level of overall satisfaction and a low rate of technical problems during electronic learning were significantly correlated with the desire to continue online learning (P < 0.01).

First reported in Asia, SARS quickly spread worldwide through international travelling. As of July 2003, the World Health Organization reported a total of 8,437 people afflicted with SARS with a 9.6% mortality rate. Although immunopathological damages may account for the severity of respiratory distress, little is known about how the genome-wide gene expression of the host changes under the attack of SARS-CoV. RESULTS: Based on changes in gene expression of peripheral blood, we identified 52 signature genes that accurately discriminated acute SARS patients from non-SARS controls. While a general suppression of gene expression predominated in SARS-infected blood, several genes including those involved in innate immunity, such as defensins and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, were upregulated. Instead of employing clustering methods, we ranked the severity of recovering SARS patients by generalized associate plots (GAP) according to the expression profiles of 52 signature genes. Through this method, we discovered a smooth transition pattern of severity from normal controls to acute SARS patients. The rank of SARS severity was significantly correlated with the recovery period (in days) and with the clinical pulmonary infection score. CONCLUSION: The use of the GAP approach has proved useful in analyzing the complexity and continuity of biological systems. The severity rank derived from the global expression profile of significantly regulated genes in patients may be useful for further elucidating the pathophysiology of their disease.","output":"Molecular signature of clinical severity in recovering patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the exact traveling wave solutions of the fractional model of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection for CD4 [Formula: see text] T-cells.

This network incorporates the inclusion and classification information of the LGE-MRI to maintain topological constraints of pathological areas. In the testing stage, the outputs of each segmentation network obtained with specific estimated parameters from training were fused using the majority voting technique for the final label prediction of each voxel in the LGE-MR image. The proposed method was validated by comparing its results to manual drawings by experts from 50 LGE-MR images. Importantly, compared to various deep learning-based methods participating in the EMIDEC challenge, the results of our approach have a more significant agreement with manual contouring in segmenting myocardial diseases.","output":"An Improved 3D Deep Learning-Based Segmentation of Left Ventricular Myocardial Diseases from Delayed-Enhancement MRI with Inclusion and Classification Prior Information U-Net (ICPIU-Net)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) has presented unprecedented challenges to the generic drug development, including interruptions in bioequivalence (BE) studies.

BACKGROUND Hospital design plays an important role in providing high-quality and cost-effective facilities for any healthcare system. Spain and Italy face contemporary challenges (i.e., elderly population, staff retention, and obsolete healthcare facilities) and have similar issues of life expectancy, health expenditure, hospital beds provision, and decentralized tax-financed healthcare systems. METHOD A cross-sectional, mixed-method study was used. This involved two different data collection strategies and analysis for each area of investigation: (i) education and (ii) practice. For the former, educational programs were reviewed via a web search; for the latter, an online survey of 53 architectural/engineering offices involved in hospital design was conducted. RESULTS Hospital design education is limited to 0/58 in Spanish and 2/60 courses in Italian universities, although each country offers three postgraduate courses. The practitioners' survey shows that even though their offices have a long history of healthcare design, only 48% in Spain and 60% in Italy have received specific university training.

METHODS: This cross-sectional telephone study involved Parkinsons disease patients who had at least one control examination at University Hospital Center Rijeka in 2020 and were Croatian citizens. A questionnaire was used to obtain data on the socio-demographic characteristics and the severity of motor, anxiety, depression, and non-motor symptoms. RESULTS: The final sample included 87 patients. Most patients reported subjective worsening of motor symptoms. Patients who lived alone had worse motor scores than those not living alone. The majority of patients reported worsening of anxiety symptoms. Significant worsening of anxiety symptoms was found in patients who lived alone, had a longer disease duration, and had avoided check-ups. Fewer patients had depression symptoms than motor and anxiety symptoms. Significantly higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores were observed in patients with a longer disease duration. Significant worsening of non-motor symptoms was identified in patients who lived alone, were less educated, had a longer disease duration, and had a higher Charlson comorbidity index. CONCLUSION: Patients who live alone, have longer disease duration, are less educated, avoid check-ups, and have more comorbidities are more vulnerable to the negative effects of social isolation.","output":"Effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on people with Parkinson's disease: experience from a Croatian regional center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first case of Coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) was detected in Wuhan, China, but the disease became a pandemic and health-care institutions in the Russian Federation faced confirmed cases of COVID-19 Objective To describe the possibilities of imaging techniques with a focus on multispiral computed tomography (MSCT), as well as a dynamic analysis of pathology manifestations in patients hospitalized in Clinical Hospital No 15 named after O M Filatov with a confirmed coronavirus infection Material and methods The retrospective study collected data from 300 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection from one of the largest multidisciplinary hospitals in the Russian Federation General clinical manifestations were analyzed, as well as characteristics and features of the development of changes, revealed mainly by MSCT of the chest Results Examined 300 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 Among the clinical manifestations, coughing, fever, shortness of breath prevailed Most of the changes identified in pulmonary MSCT were polysegmental and bilateral in nature of the lesion, were more likely to be localized in the peripheral departments, 235 (78%) patients had more than two lobes involved in the pathological process, 263 (87 7%) patients had focal points of pulmonary tissue compaction by ?frosted glass? type, and the combination of the above manifestations with the presence of consolidation foci and reticular changes was noted in 129 (43%) among the complications, there were more frequent: thickening of the pleura, hydrothorax, less often pneumothorax, and in rare cases, the empyema of pleura When monitoring lung MSCT in 300 patients, rapid development of positive dynamics (on average, 57 days) was noted in 95 (31 6%) patients, 40 (13 2%) patients showed multidirectional dynamics, progression (CT stage in-creases) was observed in 111 (37%) cases, in 54 (18 2%) cases there were no significant changes in the dynamics of the X-ray pat-tern Conclusions Lung MSCT plays a key role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 The appearance of specific zones of pulmonary tissue compaction in the form of a ?frosted glass?, as a manifestation of a one-sided or two-sided, mono-or polyphocal lung lesion, can with a high probability indicate a manifestation of COVID-19 with a possible rapid progression of the X-ray pattern in a short period of time","output":"Visualizing techniques for new coronavirus infection: Focus on computed tomography. experience of the city clinical hospital no. 15 named after O.M.

It is estimated that 1.5% of patients with ID will have a clinical diagnosis of ADHD. The aim of this audit was to find whether individuals with ID and ADHD, who are prescribed medication for ADHD are adequately monitored and reviewed in accordance with the ADHD medication prescription guidance by NICE and the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych). METHOD: This audit looked at ADHD medication prescription for the ID population within Greater Glasgow & Clyde NHS. This is the 6th audit cycle where electronic records (EMIS) were analysed between 28/9/19 to 09/10/20. (The 5th cycle data collection period ended on 28/9/19). We collected data on all patients aged over 18 years. An audit tool was developed to find whether the following were documented; patient demographics, physical health monitoring, symptom severity, medication dosage, side effects, need for ongoing treatment and frequency of review. 100% of patients should have all components on the ADHD audit tool documented, as per NICE/ RCPsych prescription guidance. RESULT: 32 patients were identified as being diagnosed with ADHD prescribed medication. One patient was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which meant that the required monitoring was not fully carried out. The age ranged from 18 to 56 years. 75% had mild intellectual disability, 19% had moderate and 6% had severe, with no cases of profound intellectual disability. Blood Pressure/pulse was recorded in 84% of patients. Height/weight/ BMI was recorded in 81% of patients. 97% of patients had ADHD symptom severity, medication dosage, side effects, need for ongoing treatment and frequency of review recorded. CONCLUSION: There is further scope for improvement in the monitoring and documentation of physical health observations, however there was a significant improvement compared to the previous cycle of the audit. Other aspects of monitoring and documentation appear to be recorded in almost 100% of patients. This finding emphasises the challenges of physical health monitoring and compliance in psychiatry as a whole. We need to continue to encourage awareness and education around the physical health risks to our patients, not only due to their comorbidities but also as a result of the psychotropic medications we prescribe them.","output":"Audit of ADHD medication prescription and monitoring in intellectual disability services, Greater Glasgow & Clyde"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interferon inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are a recently discovered family of cellular anti-viral proteins that restrict the replication of a number of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses.

Participants completed the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (measure of COVID-19 impact), Asthma Control Test, Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, Patient Health Questionnaire (measure of depression), Perceived Stress Scale, and items related to tobacco use. RESULTS: Asthma control improved (t = -3.326, p = 0.001) from Time 1 to 2, and e-vapor product use decreased (2104 = 6.572, p = 0.010). COVID-19 impact was positively associated with students' symptoms of anxiety, depression, and perceived stress (B = 0.201, p < 0.001; B = 0.179, p < 0.001; and B = 0.199, p = 0.001, respectively) at Time 2. These results remained significant with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Asthma control at Time 1 was negatively associated with anxiety symptoms at Time 2 (B = -0.418, p = 0.023); however, associations with perceived stress (B = -0.514, p = 0.019) and all other tobacco product use (B = -0.233, p = 0.030) did not remain significant with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction. CONCLUSIONS: As hypothesized, a higher COVID-19 impact score was associated with students endorsing more mental health symptoms.

The most common and cost-effective approach to concentrating viruses from water samples involves virus adsorption and elution (VIRADEL) procedures, followed by secondary concentration. There is a lack of consistency in how secondary concentration methods are practiced and some methods may have better recovery for particular groups of viruses. Secondary concentration methods typically involve precipitation and the most common methods employ organic flocculation (OF) by acidification at a pH of 3.5, or precipitation by polyethylene glycol (PEG) in combination with the addition of NaCl. In this study, the recovery of coliphage MS2 using the plaque assay and human adenovirus strain 41 (HAdV41) using cell-culture and qPCR assays were evaluated by OF and PEG secondary concentration of spiked samples of wastewater, surface water, and groundwater. The recovery of MS2 and HAdV41 by PEG precipitation was significantly higher than that by OF (p<0.0001) when viruses were detected by culture based methods and marginally better when HAdV41 was enumerated by qPCR (p<0.019). The recovery of HAdV41 by qPCR ranged from 75.3% to 94.4% (n=36). The mean recovery of MS2 by OF was 4.4% (0.9%-7.7%; n=14) and ranged from 57.1% to 87.9% (n=28) for the PEG methods. The poor recovery of MS2 by OF was attributed to inactivation or poor stability at acidic conditions as MS2 were not recovered in the supernatant following OF and centrifugation. The inconsistency and lack of justification for method selection in many studies calls for a systematic study to inform guidance and standardization with respect to the application of concentration methods for various water types and viral pathogens. IMPORTANCE MS2 should not be used as a process control for methods involving acidification and culture-based detection. The dense floc produced by the PEG method may have contributed to higher recoveries as the pellet was more compact and stable than the loose pellet formed by OF. Standard methods for the detection of enteric viruses and surrogates that involve acidification could be modified with PEG precipitation to uphold virus recovery and minimize inactivation.","output":"Polyethylene glycol (PEG) methods are superior to acidification for secondary concentration of Adenovirus and MS2 in water"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which first emerged in December 2019, represents an ongoing global public health emergency.

Most RTCs and RTFs happen at night. Although few countries, including Zambia, have implemented night travel bans, there is no evidence on the extent to which such policies may reduce crashes and fatalities. METHODS: We exploit the quasi-experimental set up afforded by the banning of night travel of public service vehicles in Zambia in 2016 and interrupted time series analysis to assess whether the ban had an impact on both levels and trends in RTCs and RTFs. We use annual administrative data for the period 20062020, with 10 pre-intervention and 4 post-intervention data points. In an alternative specification, we restrict the analysis to the period 20122020 so that the number of data points are the same pre-interventions and post-interventions. We also carry out robustness checks to rule out other possible explanation of the results including COVID-19. RESULTS: The night travel ban was associated with a reduction in the level of RTCs by 4131.3 (annual average RTCs before the policy=17 668) and a reduction in the annual trend in RTCs by 2485.5. These effects were significant at below 1%, and they amount to an overall reduction in RTCs by 24%. The policy was also associated with a 57.5% reduction in RTFs. In absolute terms, the trend in RTFs reduced by 477.5 (Annual average RTFs before the policy=1124.7), which is significant at below 1% level. Our results were broadly unchanged in alternative specifications. CONCLUSION: We conclude that a night travel ban may be an effective way of reducing the burden of RTCs and RTFs in Zambia and other LMICs.

Then, the virus is internalized via clathrin/dynamin mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. Similar to other viruses, ASF virion is then internalized and incorporated into the endocytic pathway. While the endosomal maturation entails luminal acidification, the decrease in pH acts on the multilayer structure of the virion dissolving the outer capsid. Upon decapsidation, the inner viral membrane is exposed to interact with the limiting membrane of the late endosome for fusion. Viral fusion is then necessary for the egress of incoming virions from endosomes into the cytoplasm, however this remains an intriguing and yet essential process for infection, specifically for the egress of viral nucleic acid into the cytoplasm for replication. ASFV proteins E248R and E199L, located at the exposed inner viral membrane, might be implicated in the fusion step. An interaction between these viral proteins and cellular endosomal proteins such as the Niemann-Pick C type 1 (NPC1) and lysosomal membrane proteins (Lamp-1 and -2) was shown. Furthermore, the silencing of these proteins impaired ASFV infection. It was also observed that NPC1 knock-out cells using CRISPR jeopardized ASFV infection and that the progression and endosomal exit of viral cores was arrested within endosomes at viral entry. These results suggest that the interactions of ASFV proteins with some endosomal proteins might be important for the membrane fusion step. In addition to this, reductions on ASFV infectivity and replication in NPC1 KO cells were accompanied by fewer and smaller viral factories. Our findings pave the way to understanding the role of proteins of the endosomal membrane in ASFV infection.","output":"New insights into the role of endosomal proteins for African swine fever virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The resilience of sub-Saharan children and youth to abuse and neglect is under-researched.

Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a prototypic form of CSS that develops in the context of rheumatic diseases, particularly systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The treatment of MAS relies heavily upon corticosteroids and cytokine inhibitors, which have proven to be lifesaving therapies in MAS, as well as in other forms of CSS.

If yes, is a randomized controlled trial to prove the hydroxychloroquine for the Covid-19 treatment, necessary, in the context of covid-19 pandemic? If No, is it the governments right to decide the hydroxychloroquine treatment for all covid-19 patients? and what should be the physicians attitudes? Finally, what are the government, physicians, and patients rights and responsibilities? The paper conclude that, since health authorities in some countries recommended this off-label use treatment, physicians are challenged by the requirement of veracity while providing care to their patients and the implications of such a requirement; they are facing the challenge of balancing this guideline and their own conviction. Furthermore, the fundamental principles of beneficence and non-maleficence, and respect for persons should underlie any reflection process to address this dilemma. In addition, in a pandemic context, the limits between the governments, practitioners and patients rights and obligations are not clear which could significantly endanger the universal ethical principles in clinical practice. It could also undermine any attempt to develop serious clinical trials to prove the considered off-label drug.","output":"Ethical issues related to the hydroxychloroquine treatment prescription for Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Papers on COVID-19 are being published at a high rate and concern many different topics. Innovative tools are needed to aid researchers to find patterns in this vast amount of literature to identify subsets of interest in an automated fashion. OBJECTIVE: We present a new online software resource with a friendly user interface that allows users to query and interact with visual representations of relationships between publications. METHODS: We publicly released an application called PLATIPUS (Publication Literature Analysis and Text Interaction Platform for User Studies) that allows researchers to interact with literature supplied by COVIDScholar via a visual analytics platform. This tool contains standard filtering capabilities based on authors, journals, high-level categories, and various research-specific details via natural language processing and dozens of customizable visualizations that dynamically update from a researcher's query. RESULTS: PLATIPUS is available online and currently links to over 100,000 publications and is still growing. This application has the potential to transform how COVID-19 researchers use public literature to enable their research.

Confirmed COVID-19 cases, patients with contact history and those with symptoms which were highly suggestive of COVID-19 were called via phone or recruited to a video or face to face appointment. Data of AIDs were obtained from their medical records, retrospectively. Laboratory and screening findings were confirmed by our national health registry website. There were 404 patients (217 female) eligible for the enrollment. During pandemic, 375 (93%) were on colchicine treatment and 48 (11.8%) were receiving biologic treatment. Twenty-four out of 404 patients were admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 suspicion. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) was identified through rhinopharyngeal swabs in seven patients, six of whom were only on colchicine treatment. Only one patient with no finding of any severe respiratory complications was hospitalized. All of seven patients recovered completely. Among patients on biologic drugs, neither a symptom nor a positive polymerase chain reaction test for COVID 19 was detected.

We propose a model for narrative medicine pedagogy that is oriented towards abolition. First, the composition of the classroom and syllabus must employ radical inclusion through recruitment of diverse voices and selection of diverse texts. After a traditional close reading is initiated, conscious expansion should take place through introduction of a text's context and current social structures. Whenever internal and external conflicts arise, active self-interrogation should be encouraged through Jos Esteban Mu?oz's 'disidentification'.We present relevant critiques of narrative medicine, case studies from workshop experiences, and close readings of selected narrative medicine texts to unmask limitations in the standard narrative medicine workshop format and illustrate the utility of our abolitionist model. The model we propose offers methods for disrupting long-standing patterns of inclusion (and exclusion) and radically transforming the structure of spaces and ideas produced within them. When new texts are added to the syllabus, they should be accompanied by hermeneutics that can adequately attend to them. Abolitionist narrative medicine pedagogy should stimulate practitioners to examine their own role in social structures that surround the text and the setting of close reading and, ultimately, to dismantle harmful structures. We offer strategies for confronting discomfort without requiring an abandonment of identity, context or content. Instead, holding complexity works towards the long-term aim of transforming practitioners to think critically about structural violence that prevents universal and equitable access to compassionate healthcare. Using this model for abolition, we hope practitioners of narrative medicine will be equipped with more dynamic tools to engage with texts and patients within and beyond the scope of the narrative medicine workshop.","output":"A model for abolitionist narrative medicine pedagogy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has given rise to COVID-19 pandemic, that is wreaking havoc worldwide Therefore, there is an urgent need to find out novel drugs to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection In this backdrop, the present study was aimed to assess potent bioactive compounds from different fungas potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Msuppro/sup) using an iin-silicoanalysis Nearly 118 bioactive compounds were extracted from iDictyophora indusiata/i, iGeassstrum triplexand iCyathus stercoreus /iand identified using HR LC/MS analysis Of which, only bergenin (iD indusiata/i), quercitrin (iG triplex/i) and dihydroartemisinin (iC stercoreus/i) were selected based on their medicinal uses, binding score and active site covered The 6LU7, a protein crystallographic structure of SARS-CoV-2 Msuppro/sup, was docked with bergenin, quercitrin and dihydroartemisinin using Autodock 4 2 and the binding energies obtained were -7 86, -10 29 and -7 20 kcal/mol, respectively Bergenin, quercitrin and dihydroartemisinin formed hydrogen bond, electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions with foremost active site amino acids THR190, GLU166, GLN189, GLY143, HIS163, HIS164, CYS145 and PHE140 Present investigation suggests that these three drugs may be used as alternative inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 Msuppro/sup However, further research is necessary to assess iin vitropotential of these drugs To the best of our knowledge, present investigation reported these three bioactive compounds of fungal origin for the first time","output":"Discovery of Fungal Metabolites Bergenin, Quercitrin and Dihydroartemisinin as Potential Inhibitors Against Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To investigate social, economic, and environmental contributors to quit or continue smoking and vaping during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Although evidence analysing immediate effects is expanding, repercussions following lockdown measures remain poorly understood. This systematic review aims to analyse biopsychosocial consequences after lockdown measures end according to short, medium, and long-term impacts. METHODS: PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched from inception to January 12, 2021. Reference lists were manually reviewed. Eligible studies analysed biopsychosocial functioning after lockdown measures secondary to recent infectious outbreaks ended. Lockdown measures were defined as quarantine, isolation, workplace or educational closures, social or physical distancing, and national or local closure of public institutions deemed non-essential. Studies exclusively researching outcomes during lockdown measures, examined infectious participants, or analysed lockdown measures not pertaining to an infectious outbreak were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed bias with a third resolving discrepancies. Data was extracted from published reports with further information requested from authors where necessary. The mixed methods appraisal tool assessed study quality, languages were restricted to English, German, Italian, and French and narrative synthesis was applied. RESULTS: Of 5149 identified studies, 40 were eligible for inclusion. Psychological distress, economic repercussions, social, biological, and behavioural ramifications were observed. Short to medium-term effects comprised reactions relating to early trauma processing whereas medium to long-term repercussions manifested in maladaptive behaviours and mental health deterioration. Increased alcohol intake, stigmatisation, and economic effects were also identified consequences. High-risk groups included health care workers, children, elderly, inpatients, those with pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses, and socially isolated individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Supporting vulnerable groups and offering education, workplace modifications, financial, and social assistance may mitigate negative repercussions. Establishing a rapid and comprehensive evidence base appraising the efficacy of such interventions and identifying areas for development is essential.

Using a targeted approach, we identified 17 plant products that are included in current and traditional cuisines as promising inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL(Pro) activity. Methanolic extracts were evaluated in vitro for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CL(Pro) activity using a quenched fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. Extracts from turmeric (Curcuma longa) rhizomes, mustard (Brassica nigra) seeds, and wall rocket (Diplotaxis erucoides subsp. erucoides) at 500 g mL(?1) displayed significant inhibition of the 3CL(Pro) activity, resulting in residual protease activities of 0.0%, 9.4%, and 14.9%, respectively.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from 2,012 undergraduate and graduate students from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who completed an online survey about how their food situation has been impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey data were collected in June and July of 2020 and the questionnaire asked about student experiences during the spring 2020 semester up to March 6 (pre-COVID-19), which was when the university went on Spring break and transitioned to remote learning thereafter, and after March 6 (during COVID-19). Changes in food consumption were assessed using questions adapted from the Nurse's Health Study COVID-19 Baseline Questionnaire. Students were asked if they moved in with family during the pandemic. We used multinomial logistic regression to assess the association between moving in with family during the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in consumption of certain types of foods. Models were adjusted for potential covariates and statistical significance was considered P < .05. RESULTS: In adjusted models, moving in with family was associated with decreased consumption of frozen prepared meals (P < .05), canned or frozen fruits (P < .05), canned or frozen vegetables (P < .05), whole grain foods (P < .05) and increased consumption of sugary drinks (P < .05), fresh fruits (P < .01), fish and seafood (P < .001), and red meat (P < .001). There were no significant associations between moving home and consumption of fast foods; alcohol; sweetened foods like candies, brownies, ice creams, muffins, and cakes; snacks like popcorn and potato chips; and fresh vegetables (not including potatoes) in the adjusted models.

A popular hypothesis states that the so-called infodemic has a substantial impact on orienting individual decisions. A competing hypothesis stresses that exposure to vast amounts of even contradictory information has little effect on personal choices. The COVID-19 pandemic offered an opportunity to investigate this relationship, analysing the interplay between COVID-19 related information circulation and the propensity of users to get vaccinated. We analyse the vaccine infodemics on Twitter and Facebook by looking at 146M contents produced by 20M accounts between 1 January 2020 and 30 April 2021. We find that vaccine-related news triggered huge interest through social media, affecting attention patterns and the modality in which information was spreading. However, we observe that such a tumultuous information landscape translated only in minimal variations in overall vaccine acceptance as measured by Facebook's daily COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (previously known as COVID-19 World Symptoms Survey) on a sample of 1.6M users. Notably, the observation period includes the European Medicines Agency (EMA) investigations over blood clots cases potentially related to vaccinations, a series of events that could have eroded trust in vaccination campaigns. We conclude the paper by investigating the numerical correlation between various infodemics indices and vaccine acceptance, observing strong compatibility with a null model. This finding supports the hypothesis that altered information consumption patterns are not a reliable predictor of collective behavioural change. Instead, wider attention on social media seems to resolve in polarisation, with the vaccine-prone and the vaccine-hesitant maintaining their positions.","output":"Lack of evidence for correlation between COVID-19 infodemic and vaccine acceptance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A series of new N-1-(?-d-ribofuranosyl) benzimidazole derivatives has been designed using in silico methods and synthesized as probable antimicrobial agents.

We report data on 72 patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing both before and after kidney transplantation and were followed for a median of 186 days (range 83, 277). Of the 25 patients with a positive antibody test at the time of transplant, 17 (68%) remained positive after transplantation. Patients were significantly more likely to have a persistently positive test if they reported a symptomatic COVID-19 infection prior to transplant (p=0.01). SARS-CoV-2 IgG index values were measured in a subset of kidney transplant recipients and compared to wait -listed dialysis patients. These assays demonstrated a more significant decline in IgG (58% versus 14% p = 0.008) in transplant recipients when compared to dialysis patients tested during the same time period. Additional analysis of the quality of the immune response measuring the binding of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD binding), the antibody neutralizing capability, and the antibody avidity demonstrated a more pronounced effect when comparing pre-transplant values to post-induction therapy/post transplant values. The attenuated IgG response seen in transplant patients compared to dialysis patients after induction therapy requires further study.

Conventional infection control recommendations include temperature surveillance as one key component of surveillance. We evaluated whether monitoring oximetry (SpO2) might improve surveillance and lead to earlier awareness of a CoVid-19 outbreak. We retrospectively analysed daily measurements of temperature and SpO2 of residents at a skilled nursing facility in mid-Atlantic United States. We benchmarked these vitals for each resident. Spikes in individual temperature of at least 0.5?C and decreases in SpO2 of both 1% and below 95% were considered significant. Results were grouped by residents CoViD-19 PCR test results in order to highlight the nursing home trends. From COVID+ residents, we observed a decrease in SpO2 levels (mean baseline 95.8%, s = 1.0, to mean SpO2 of 93.5% on the date of CoViD-19 testing, 14 days later). There was a daily downward trending of SpO2 from baseline that was discernible at least 4.8 days prior to their earliest day of temperature elevation. No similar trends were observed in the COVID- residents. The SpO2 and temperature trends of the mixed nursing home population mirrored the COVID+ cohort. Declining SpO2 in this nursing home preceded fever by several days, SpO2 thus appears to be an early indicator of an in-progress CoViD-19 outbreak. If prospectively substantiated, this might become a valuable tool in mitigating CoViD-19 spread in similar settings.

BACKGROUND: Violence against nurses is a common problem that persists worldwide. DESIGN: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study. METHODS: An online questionnaire form and the Nursing Professional Commitment Scale were used to collect the data. The study was carried out online during the COVID-19 pandemic between October-December 2020. A total of 263 nurses agreed to participate in the study. The STROBE checklist was followed for observational studies. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 8.4% of the nurses stated that they were exposed to physical violence, 57.8% to verbal violence, 0.8% to sexual violence and 61.6% to mobbing. 52.1% of the nurses stated that they thought of quitting the profession during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mean total Nursing Professional Commitment Scale score was 71.33  15.05. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that nurses' exposure to physical, verbal and sexual violence during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased compared to before the pandemic. Nurses' exposure to mobbing during the pandemic was found to increase. A statistically significant difference was found between the status of the nurses' exposure to physical violence, verbal violence, and mobbing, working hours, number of patients given care, and their thoughts of quitting the profession. It was found that the status of exposure to physical violence, thinking of quitting the profession and working hours decreased professional commitment. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: In the light of these results, it is recommended that measures to prevent violence should be addressed in a multifaceted way. In managing the pandemic process, the decisions and practices should not be left to the managers' initiative to prevent mobbing. Initiatives that will increase nurses' professional commitment during the pandemic process should be planned and implemented.","output":"Nurses' exposure to violence and their professional commitment during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of new drugs is often hindered by low solubility in water, a problem common to nearly 90% of natural and/or synthetic molecules in the discovery pipeline.

There are limited data on the risk factors that predict cardiac events in patients treated with ICIs. Therefore, we created a machine learning (ML) model to predict cardiac events in this at-risk population. METHODS: We leveraged the CancerLinQ database curated by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and applied an XGBoosted decision tree to predict cardiac events in patients taking programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) therapy. All curated data from patients with non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma, and who were prescribed PD-1/PD-L1 therapy between 2013 and 2019, were used for training, feature interpretation, and model performance evaluation. A total of 356 potential risk factors were included in the model, including elements of patient medical history, social history, vital signs, common laboratory tests, oncological history, medication history and PD-1/PD-L1-specific factors like PD-L1 tumor expression. RESULTS: Our study population consisted of 4960 patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, of whom 418 had a cardiac event. The following were key predictors of cardiac events: increased age, corticosteroids, laboratory abnormalities and medications suggestive of a history of heart disease, the extremes of weight, a lower baseline or on-treatment percentage of lymphocytes, and a higher percentage of neutrophils. The final model predicted cardiac events with an area under the curveCreceiver operating characteristic of 0.65 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.75). Using our model, we divided patients into low-risk and high-risk subgroups. At 100 days, the cumulative incidence of cardiac events was 3.3% in the low-risk group and 6.1% in the high-risk group (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: ML can be used to predict cardiac events in patients taking PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.

We highlight the epidemiological impact of barriers to adoption and the potential role of community-led coordination of support for cases and high-risk contacts in urban slums. METHODS: A compartmental model representing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in urban poor versus less socioeconomically vulnerable subpopulations was developed for Montserrado County, Liberia. Adoption of home-isolation behavior was assumed to be related to the proportion of each subpopulation residing in housing units with multiple rooms and with access to sanitation, water, and food. We evaluated the potential impact of increasing the maximum attainable proportion of adoption among urban poor following the scheduled lifting of the state of emergency. RESULTS: Without intervention, the model estimated higher overall infection burden but fewer severe cases among urban poor versus the less socioeconomically vulnerable population. With self-isolation by mildly symptomatic individuals, median reductions in cumulative infections, severe cases, and maximum daily incidence were 7.6% (IQR: 2.2%?20.9%), 7.0% (2.0%?18.5%), and 9.9% (2.5%?31.4%), respectively, in the urban poor subpopulation and 16.8% (5.5%?29.3%), 15.0% (5.0%?26.4%), and 28.1% (9.3%?47.8%) in the less socioeconomically vulnerable population. An increase in the maximum attainable percentage of behavior adoption by the urban slum subpopulation was associated with median reductions of 19.2% (10.1%?34.0%), 21.1% (13.3%?34.2%), and 26.0% (11.5%?48.9%) relative to the status quo scenario.

Exogenous interferon- reverses these effects. FP suppression of interferon may occur through inhibition of TLR3- and RIG-I virus-sensing pathways. Mice deficient in the type I interferon-/ receptor (IFNAR1(?/?)) have suppressed antimicrobial peptide and enhanced mucin responses to rhinovirus infection.

It is characterized by distinct patterns of disease progression implying a diverse host immune response. However, the immunological features and molecular mechanisms involved in Covid-19 severity remain so far poorly known. Methods: We performed an integrated immune analysis that included in-depth phenotypical profiling of immune cells, whole-blood transcriptomic and cytokine quantification on a cohort of fifty Covid19 patients with a spectrum of disease severity. All patient were tested 8 to 12 days following first symptoms and in absence of anti-inflammatory therapy. Results: A unique phenotype in severe and critically ill patients was identified. It consists in a profoundly impaired interferon (IFN) type I response characterized by a low interferon production and activity, with consequent downregulation of interferon-stimulated genes. This was associated with a persistent blood virus load and an exacerbated inflammatory response that was partially driven by the transcriptional factor NFB. It was also characterized by increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and interleukin (IL)-6 production and signaling as well as increased innate immune chemokines. Conclusion: We propose that type-I IFN deficiency in the blood is a hallmark of severe Covid-19 and could identify and define a high-risk population.

Specific support and interventions for carers may benefit both the carer, and their loved one with an ED. Individuals with co-occurring autism and EDs may present with additional needs and difficulties relating to their Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) that impact their carers. However, there is a lack of research exploring whether carers of people with ASC and EDs have specific support needs, and what kinds of support may be most beneficial for this population. METHODS: This study used a qualitative interview design, utilising peer interviews. Eleven carers participated in interviews about their experiences as a carer, and their views on existing support systems and potential improvements. As the study took place during the initial UK coronavirus lockdown, the impact of the lockdown also emerged as a topic during the interviews. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Five themes were identified: challenges associated with co-occurring Autism and EDs, a lack of existing support for carers from healthcare services, the personal impact of caring for someone with both ASC and EDs, ideas for how carers can be best supported, and the impact of the coronavirus on carers. CONCLUSIONS: Carers of loved ones with both ASC and EDs described the experience as having a significant personal impact on their lives, but also experienced a lack of support from healthcare services. There was a perception that caring for someone with both an ASC and EDs presents additional challenges compared to caring for someone with an ED only, and that this population therefore requires specialised support.

Nurses are integral members of the primary health care team and have an important role in managing obesity and administering physical activity (PA) for patients. However, research shows that nurses tend to be overweight or obese, have poor metabolic health, and do not meet PA recommendations. This is problematic because PA is linked to both physiological and psychological well-being and may also influence how nurses counsel their patients. Nursing students are the next generation of nurses; however, there is limited research examining PA (among other lifestyle factors) and metabolic health in nursing students. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this research is to examine multiple lifestyle factors (including PA, nutrition, sleep, and stress) and determine whether these factors are associated with metabolic health in full-time undergraduate nursing students. METHODS: An estimated 320 nursing students (18 years of age and older) will be assessed for their metabolic health. Metabolic status will be determined by measuring body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body fat percentage [skinfold measures (FitSystems Inc)], resting blood pressure [automated oscillatory (Omron Healthcare Inc)], and fasting blood glucose (glucometer). Lifestyle factors will also be measured, including PA and sleep [the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and 7-day accelerometry (wGT3X-BT, Actigraph LLC)], nutrition [3-day diet log (Nutritionist Pro, Axxya Systems)], and stress [the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, heart rate variability assessments, and salivary cortisol (ELISA, Eagle Biosciences)]. The association between metabolic status and PA, sleep quantity and quality, nutrition, and stress will be examined by linear regression analyses. Differences by year of study in metabolic health status, PA, sleep, nutrition, and stress will be examined by 1-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs). To determine the ability of PA, sleep, nutrition, and stress to discriminate prevalent overweight and obesity or poor metabolic status, logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves will be constructed. Statistical analyses will be performed in Stata (version 16.1, StataCorp LLC). RESULTS: Based on pilot data, we believe senior nursing students will have worse metabolic health (ie, higher BMI and WHR, increased body fat percentage, higher blood pressure, and increased fasting blood glucose) compared to first-year students. We hypothesize that poor PA participation, poor sleep quantity and quality, increased food intake, poor nutrition, and increased stress will be associated with worse metabolic health in full-time nursing students. The study received funding in February 2020. Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, work on this study has been delayed.

Here, we report the distribution, timing, duration, and connectedness of student social contacts at two university deployments and uncover cryptic transmission pathways through individuals' second-degree contacts. We then construct epidemiological models based on the contact networks generated by OO to predict the transmission pathways of hypothetical pathogens with varying reproductive numbers. Finally, we show that the granularity of OO data enables institutions to improve outbreak mitigation by proactively and strategically testing and/or vaccinating individuals based on individual social interaction levels.","output":"Analyzing the Impact of a Real-life Outbreak Simulator on Pandemic Mitigation: an Epidemiological Modeling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Phthalates are chemical esters used to enhance desirable properties of plastics, personal care, and cleaning products. Phthalates have shown ubiquitous environmental contamination due to their abundant use and propensity to leach from products to which they are added. Following exposure, phthalates are rapidly metabolized and excreted through urine. Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) sampled from Sarasota Bay, Florida, have demonstrated prevalent di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) exposure indicated by detectable urinary mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) concentrations. Widespread exposure is concerning due to evidence of endocrine disruption from human and laboratory studies. To better understand how phthalate exposure may impact dolphin health, correlations between relevant hormone levels and detectable urinary MEHP concentrations were examined. Hormone concentrations measured via blood serum samples included triiodothyronine (T3), total thyroxine (T4), and free thyroxine (FT4). Urinary MEHP concentrations were detected in 56% of sampled individuals (n = 50; mean = 8.13 ng/mL; s.d. = 15.99 ng/mL). Adult female and male FT4 was significantly correlated with urinary MEHP concentrations (adult female Kendall's tau = 0.36, p = 0.04; adult male Kendall's tau = 0.42, p = 0.02). Evidence from this study suggests DEHP exposure may be impacting thyroid hormone homeostasis. Cumulative effects of other stressors and resultant endocrine impacts are unknown.

Significant increases in volume of critically ill patients necessitated hospital administrators to redeploy faculty physicians and other staff to support other areas as a way of exercising option value. This commentary describes our experiences as 2 medical school deans and teaching professors where we recently applied the model of situational leadership during our redeployment as unit clerks on newly-created COVID patient care units at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in our local area. Our experience yielded personal feelings of accomplishment and allowed us to exercise nonlinear thinking, which we believe contributed to greater staff operational efficiency, using principles of situational leadership during these hospital redeployment initiatives. KEY TAKEAWAYS: Situational leadership is an effective management model for hospital academic leaders who are not routinely in clinical operations to initiate in emergency conditions when unprecedented working scenarios and feelings of staff uncertainty are occurring, while option value is being exercised with faculty/staff redeployment. Our experience led to increased self-actualization.

To our knowledge, no study has documented whether reopening schools in low- and middle-income countries during the pandemic was associated with increased aggregate COVID-19 incidence and mortality with appropriate counterfactuals. OBJECTIVE: To test whether reopening schools under appropriate protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased municipal-level COVID-19 cases and deaths in S?o Paulo State, Brazil. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This observational study of municipalities in S?o Paulo State, Brazil, uses a difference-in-differences analysis to examine the association between municipal decisions to reopen schools during the COVID-19 pandemic and municipal-level COVID-19 case and death rates between October and December 2020. The study compared 129 municipalities that reopened schools in 2020 with 514 that did not and excluded data for 2 municipalities that reopened schools and closed then again. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: New COVID-19 cases and deaths per 10 000 inhabitants up to 12 weeks after school reopenings and municipal-level aggregate mobility for a subset of municipalities. RESULTS: There were 8764 schools in the 129 municipalities that reopened schools compared with 9997 in the control group of 514 municipalities that did not reopen schools. The municipalities that reopened schools had a cumulative COVID-19 incidence of 20 cases per 1000 inhabitants and mortality of 0.5 deaths per 1000 inhabitants in September 2020 (the baseline period) compared with an incidence of 18 cases per 1000 inhabitants and mortality of 0.45 deaths per 1000 inhabitants during the baseline period in the comparison group. The findings indicated that there were no statistically significant differences between municipalities that authorized schools to reopen and those that did not for (1) weekly new cases (difference-in-differences, C0.03; 95% CI, C0.09 to 0.03) and (2) weekly new deaths (difference-in-differences, C0.003; 95% CI, C0.011 to 0.004) before and after October 2020. Reopening schools was not associated with higher disease activity, even in relatively vulnerable municipalities, nor aggregate mobility.

Laparoscopic techniques for major abdominal surgery are increasingly utilised to reduce surgical trauma. Intrathecal morphine is an attractive analgesic option that is gaining popularity. However, limited evidence guides its use in the setting of laparoscopic surgery. In addition, enhanced recovery after surgery pathways advocate opioid-sparing techniques. We conducted a feasibility trial to compare intrathecal morphine with non-neuraxial analgesia in laparoscopic or laparoscopic-assisted major abdominal surgery to inform the design of a future large clinical trial. This multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted at two tertiary hospitals in Australia. Fifty-one patients were randomly allocated to receive either intrathecal morphine (intervention group) or a sham subcutaneous injection of normal saline in the lumbar area (control group) immediately before the induction of general anaesthesia. Co-primary outcomes were patient recruitment and successful adherence to treatment allocation as per the study protocol. The primary endpoints of feasibility and protocol adherence were met with a 46% recruitment rate (51 of 110 eligible patients) and 96% protocol adherence. There was only one patient with failed access to the intrathecal space. For secondary endpoints, fewer patients in the intrathecal morphine group required opioids in the post-anaesthesia care unit, their postoperative pain scores at rest were lower across the four time-points measured (p = 0.007), but not dynamic pain scores (p = 0.061), and pruritus was more common following intrathecal morphine (p = 0.007). Total oral morphine equivalents until postoperative day 3 were less in the intrathecal morphine group (median (95%CI) difference 82 (-13 to 168) mg), but this reduction was not statistically significant (p = 0.10).

Our model nests the SEIR model. During a period of asymptomatic infection, testing can reveal infection that otherwise would only be revealed later when symptoms develop. Along with those displaying symptoms, such individuals are deemed known positive cases. Quarantine policy is case-dependent in that it can depend on whether a case is unknown, known positive, known negative, or recovered. Testing therefore makes possible the identification and quarantine of infected individuals and release of non-infected individuals. We fix a quarantine technology-a parameter determining the differential rate of transmission in quarantine-and compare simple testing and quarantine policies. We start with a baseline quarantine-only policy that replicates the rate at which individuals are entering quarantine in the US in March, 2020. We show that the total deaths that occur under this policy can occur under looser quarantine measures and a substantial increase in random testing of asymptomatic individuals. Testing at a higher rate in conjunction with targeted quarantine policies can (i) dampen the economic impact of the coronavirus and (ii) reduce peak symptomatic infections-relevant for hospital capacity constraints.

However there has been little focus on sub-Saharan Africa, as few African cities have air quality monitors and if they do, these data are often not publicly available. Spatial differentials of changes in PM2.5 concentrations as a result of COVID also remain largely unstudied. To address this gap, we use a serendipitous mobile air quality monitoring deployment of eight Sensirion SPS 30 sensors on motorbikes in the city of Nairobi starting on 16 March 2020, before a COVID-19 curfew was imposed on 25 March and continuing until 5 May 2020. We developed a random-forest model to estimate PM2.5 surfaces for the entire city of Nairobi before and during the COVID-19 curfew. The highest PM2.5 concentrations during both periods were observed in the poor neighborhoods of Kariobangi, Mathare, Umoja, and Dandora, located to the east of the city center. Changes in PM2.5 were heterogeneous over space. PM2.5 concentrations increased during the curfew in rapidly urbanizing, the lower-middle-class neighborhoods of Kahawa, Kasarani, and Ruaraka, likely because residents switched from LPG to biomass fuels due to loss of income. Our results indicate that COVID-19 and policies to address it may have exacerbated existing air pollution inequalities in the city of Nairobi. The quantitative results are preliminary, due to sampling limitations and measurement uncertainties, as the available data came exclusively from low-cost sensors. This research serves to highlight that spatial data that is essential for understanding structural inequalities reflected in uneven air pollution burdens and differential impacts of events like the COVID pandemic. With the help of carefully deployed low-cost sensors with improved spatial sampling and at least one reference-quality monitor for calibration, we can collect data that is critical for developing targeted interventions that address environmental injustice in the African context.","output":"Spatial variation of fine particulate matter levels in Nairobi before and during the COVID-19 curfew: implications for environmental justice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Darwinian evolution of humans from our common ancestors with nonhuman primates involved many gene-environment interactions at the population level, and the resulting human-specific genetic changes must contribute to the \\"Human Condition.\\" Recent data indicate that the biology of sialic acids (which directly involves less than 60 genes) shows more than 10 uniquely human genetic changes in comparison with our closest evolutionary relatives. Known outcomes are tissue-specific changes in abundant cell-surface glycans, changes in specificity and/or expression of multiple proteins that recognize these glycans, and novel pathogen regimes. Specific events include Alu-mediated inactivation of the CMAH gene, resulting in loss of synthesis of the Sia N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and increase in expression of the precursor N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac); increased expression of alpha2-6-linked Sias (likely because of changed expression of ST6GALI); and multiple changes in SIGLEC genes encoding Sia-recognizing Ig-like lectins (Siglecs). The last includes binding specificity changes (in Siglecs -5, -7, -9, -11, and -12); expression pattern changes (in Siglecs -1, -5, -6, and -11); gene conversion (SIGLEC11); and deletion or pseudogenization (SIGLEC13, SIGLEC14, and SIGLEC16).

A conceptual framework that embraces evidence use typologies and relates findings to the organisational process of action generation informs and structures the research. Between March and September 2020, we conducted in-depth interviews with mathematical modellers (evidence producers) and employees at global health organisations, who are involved in decision-making processes (evidence consumers). We found that commissioned epidemiological and economic evidence is used to track progress and provides a measure of success, both in terms of health outcomes and the organisations mission. Global health organisations predominantly use this evidence to demonstrate accountability and solicit funding from external partners. We find common understanding and awareness across consumers and producers about the purposes and uses of these commissioned pieces of work and how they are distinct from more academic explorative research outputs. Conceptual evidence use best describes this process. Evidence is slowly integrated into organisational processes and is one of many influences on global health organisations actions. Relationships developed over time and trust guide the process, which may lead to quite a concentrated cluster of those producing and commissioning models.

METHODS AND RESULTS The heterotrophic bacterial strain in symbiotic association with intertidal macroalga H. valentiae was isolated to homogeneity in a culture-dependent method and screened for bioactivities by spot-over-lawn assay. The bacterial organic extract was purified and characterized by extensive chromatographic and spectroscopic methods, respectively, and was assessed for antibacterial activities with disc diffusion and microtube dilution methods. The macrocyclic polyketide compounds exhibited wide-spectrum of anti-infective potential against clinically significant vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREfs), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumonia with minimum inhibitory concentration of about 1-3 g mL-1 , insomuch as the antibiotics chloramphenicol and ampicillin were active at  6.25 g mL-1 . The studied compounds unveiled Fe3+ chelating activity, which designated that their prospective anti-infective activities against the pathogens could be due to their siderophore mechanism of action. In support of that, the bacterium exhibited siderophore production on bioassay involving the cast upon culture agar plate, and the presence of siderophore biosynthetic gene (1000 bp) (MF 981936). In silico molecular modeling with penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a) coded by mecA genes of MRSA (docking score 11.68-12.69 kcal mol-1 ) verified their in vitro antibacterial activities.

We aimed to study outcomes and impact on disease management for point-of-care (POC) IUS in IBD patients. METHODS Two patient cohorts undergoing POC IUS (January 2016 - July 2018 and October 2019 - December 2019) were included retrospectively. Disease management after IUS was analysed and IUS outcomes were compared with symptoms, biomarkers and additional imaging within 8 weeks from IUS. To study differences in use of IUS over time, cohorts were compared. RESULTS In total, 345 examinations (280 in Crohn's disease (CD)/65 in Ulcerative Colitis (UC)) were performed. Present inflammation on IUS was comparable between symptomatic and asymptomatic CD (67.6% vs 60.5%; p=0.291). In 60%, IUS had impact on disease management with change in medication in 47.8%. Additional endoscopy/MRI was planned after 32.8% examinations showing good correlation with IUS in 86.3% (=0.70, p<0.0001) and 80.0% (=0.75, p<0.0001) of cases, respectively. Fecal calprotectin was higher in active versus inactive disease on IUS (664 g/g vs 79 g/g; p<0.001). Over the years IUS was performed more frequently to monitor treatment response and the use of MRI was reduced within the cohort. CONCLUSIONS POC IUS affects clinical decision making and could detect pre-clinical relapse in CD patients with potential to reduce additional endoscopy or MRI. In addition, the paradigm expands towards monitoring treatment and close follow-up for IUS. Based on our results we propose a POC IUS algorithm for follow-up of IBD patients.","output":"Point-of-care intestinal ultrasound in IBD patients: disease management and diagnostic yield in a real-world cohort and proposal of a point-of-care algorithm."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization stated on 11 March 2020 that a coronavirus illness had been discovered in Wuhan, China in December 2019.

SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Informal caregivers of palliative in-patients. METHODS: The primary outcome was depression; secondary outcomes were anxiety, subjective distress and minor mental disorders, positive and negative affect, satisfaction with life, quality of life and direct health care costs. General linear mixed models allow several measurements per participant and change over time. Reasons for declining the intervention were investigated by Rosenstocks Health Belief Model. RESULTS: Overall inclusion rate was 41.0%.

AIM: The purpose of this work was to investigate intestinal and peripheral expression of FGL2 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), mainly ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohns disease (CD). METHODS: FGL2 expression in mucosal biopsies from three groups (UC group (n = 61), CD group (n = 54), and controls group (n = 35)) was detected by immunohistochemistry. Concentrations of FGL2 in plasma from 50 UC patients, 45 CD patients, and 30 controls were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Western blot of FGL2 protein and real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR of FGL2 mRNA expression by peripheral mononuclear cells was performed. Correlations of FGL2 expression with disease type, activity, and location, and with measured laboratory data, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), were examined. RESULTS: Intestinal and peripheral FGL2 protein data showed that FGL2 expression was significantly up-regulated in both UC and CD patients compared with controls (P < 0.001). Expression of FGL2 was higher in UC and CD patients with active disease than in those with inactive disease (P < 0.001). Moreover, FGL2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in patients with active disease than in those with inactive disease (P < 0.050). Expression of FGL2 protein was correlated with disease activity indices, CRP levels, and ESR levels. CONCLUSION: Expression of FGL2 was up-regulated in IBD patients with active disease.

Polyclonal neutralizing antibodies offers many advantages such as providing immediate immunity, consequently blunting an early pro-inflammatory pathogenic endogenous antibody response and lack of drug-drug interactions. By providing immediate immunity and inhibiting entry into cells, neutralizing antibody treatment is of interest for patient with COVID-19-induced moderate pneumonia. Convalescent plasma to treat infected patients is therefore a relevant therapeutic option currently under assessment (CORIMUNO-PLASM NCT04324047). However, the difficulties of collecting plasma on the long term are not adapted to a broad use across all populations. New polyclonal humanized anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies (XAV-19) developed by Xenothera and administered intravenous. XAV-19 is a heterologous swine glyco-humanized polyclonal antibody (GH-pAb) raised against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, blocking infection of ACE-2-positive human cells with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have been performed in preclinical models including primates. A first human study with another fully representative GH-pAb from Xenothera is ongoing in recipients of a kidney graft. These studies indicated that 5 consecutive administrations of GH-pAbs can be safely performed in humans. The objectives of this 2-step phase 2 randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled study are to define the safety and the optimal XAV-19 dose to administrate to patients with SARS-CoV-2 induced moderate pneumonia, and to assess the clinical benefits of a selected dose of XAV-19 in this population. DISCUSSION: This study will determine the clinical benefits of XAV-19 when administered to patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced moderate pneumonia. As a prerequisite, a first step of the study will define the safety and the dose of XAV-19 to be used. Such treatment might become a new therapeutic option to provide an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients (possibly in combination with anti-viral and immunotherapies). Further studies could later evaluate such passive immunotherapy as a potential post-exposure prophylaxis.

During this period, only one operating room was available for elective cancer surgeries and another for emergency surgeries. Moreover, the number of beds for surgical patients had to be reduced to provide beds and personnel for the new COVID-19 wards. AIM: To compare 2 different period (from March 9 to April 9 2019 and from March 9 to April 9 2020), searching differences in terms of number and type of interventions in emergency surgery of a main University Hospital in Ferrara, a city in Emilia Romagna region, North of Italy. METHODS: This retrospective study was carried out at the General Surgery Department of SantAnna University Hospital in Ferrara, Italy. We examined the number of emergency surgeries performed and patient outcomes during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy and subsequent total lockdown. We then drew a comparison with the number of surgeries performed and their outcomes during the same period in 2019. The study examined all adult patients who underwent emergency surgery from March 9 to April 9, 2019 (n = 46), and those who underwent surgery during the first month of the lockdown, from March 9 to April 9, 2020 (n = 27). Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification scores and types of surgery. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients underwent emergency surgery at SantAnna University Hospital in Ferrara during the first month of the lockdown. This represents a 41.3% reduction in the number of patients who were hospitalized and underwent emergency surgery compared to the same period in 2019. The complication rate during the pandemic period was substantially higher than it was during the analogous period in 2019: 15 out of 27 cases from March 9 to April 9, 2020 (55) vs 17 out of 46 cases from March 9 to April 9, 2019 (36.9).

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Two hospitals within an acute NHS Trust in London, UK. PARTICIPANTS: All patients admitted to medical wards between 2 March and 3 May 2020. OUTCOMES: Main outcomes were diagnosis of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and mortality during hospital admission. For the diagnostic risk score, we report discrimination, calibration and diagnostic accuracy of the model and simplified risk score and internal validation. RESULTS: 4008 patients were admitted between 2 March and 3 May 2020. 1792 patients (44.8%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 1391 were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive and 283 had only negative RT-PCRs. Compared with a clinical reference standard, sensitivity of RT-PCR in hospital patients was 83.1% (95% CI 81.2%-84.8%). Broadly, patients with false-negative RT-PCR COVID-19 and those confirmed by positive PCR had similar demographic and clinical characteristics but lower risk of intensive care unit admission and lower in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.27-0.61). A simple diagnostic risk score comprising of age, sex, ethnicity, cough, fever or shortness of breath, National Early Warning Score 2, C reactive protein and chest radiograph appearance had moderate discrimination (area under the receiver-operator curve 0.83, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.85), good calibration and was internally validated. CONCLUSION: RT-PCR-negative COVID-19 is common and is associated with lower mortality despite similar presentation.

This study aimed at evaluating this hypothesis along with differences in practices patterns across geographic regions in the U.S. The trends seen in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) for RSV and influenza infections were also compared across geographic regions. METHODS: 769,913 PICU episodes from the VPS database (myvps.org) from 2014-2020 were used to study the yearly occurrence of admissions of patients < 18 years by unit-year due to RSV and Influenza in U.S. The geographic regions according to U.S. Census definition were Mid-West (MW), Northeast (NE), South (S), and West (W). Both RSV and Influenza were defined by ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. For each of these diagnoses and geographic regions, least-squares linear fits from 2014 to 2019 were used to investigate the increase of numbers of cases per unit-year. We also investigated utilization per geographic region by estimating the percent of the top-most prevalent ventilation procedures used during the time period. Pearson correlation comparison with Fisher's Z-transformation was used to investigate significance between the slopes of these fits. RESULTS: The number of cases of RSV and influenza per unit increased from 2014 to 2019. For RSV, the fastest growing rate corresponded to MW (8.4 cases per unit-year), followed by S (5.1 cases per unit-year), NE (4.7 cases per unit-year), and W (4.3 cases per unit-year). MW was different from all other regions (p< 0.001), while NE, S, and W were not different between themselves (p >0.05). All regions showed an abrupt reduction in cases per unit from 2019 to 2020. However, the trends observed for Influenza were not significantly different. Utilization of Conventional Mechanical Ventilation was not significantly different across regions but NE had higher Humidified High Flow (HFNC) utilization compared to all other regions (p< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: 1. In the period 2014 to 2019 there was an increase in RSV admissions to PICUs, but not influenza. 2. During the COVID-19 period a large drop in PICU admissions was found in RSV cases. 3. HFNC showed higher significant utilization in the Northeast.","output":"Progression of rsv and influenza pediatric icu admissions by geographic regions in the u.s"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Article calls for the incorporation of antisubordination into separation-of-powers analysis. Scholars analyzing separation-of-powers toolsthe laws and norms that divide power among government actorsconsider a long list of values ranging from protecting liberty to promoting efficiency. Absent from this list are questions of equity: questions of racism, sexism, and classism. This Article problematizes this omission and begins to rectify it. For the first time, this Article applies critical race and feminist theorists subordination questionare marginalized groups disproportionately burdened?to three important separation-of-powers tools: legislative appropriations, executive conditions, and constitutional entrenchment. Doing so uncovers that each tool entails subordination by creating generalized benefits at the expense of marginalized groups. The Article develops this skewed distribution of harms by building on novel case studies tracing harm to Native peoples to the use of appropriations to empower Congress, harm to residents of Puerto Rico to the use of executive conditions to empower the President, and disparate coronavirus harms to Black communities to the use of non-entrenchment to empower the future and disempower the dead hand of the past. The Articles descriptive insight that separation-of-powers tools can and do entail subordination motivates its call for the incorporation of antisubordination into both institutional and doctrinal separation-of-powers analysis. The antisubordination movements rights-focused approach has stagnated. By shifting attention to other political actors, the separation of powers offers a desirable, upstream means through which to pursue the goal of antisubordination. Moreover, considering antisubordination in separation of powers analysis is consistent with the aspiration for neutral principles, has a basis in history, and advances already established separation-of-powers values including liberty and accountability.Incorporating antisubordination into the separation of powers is also achievable. The Article specifies interventions for institutional analysis, doctrinal analysis, and the agenda of separation of powers theory. For institutional analysis, two new steps are needed. First, when allocating power brings particularized costs, explore their distribution. The subordination question (who pays?) should be as familiar to separation of powers analysis as the legal process question (who decides?). This question might be used to interrogate particular separation-of-powers tools, categories of such tools, or overarching doctrinal and conceptual approaches. Second, consider not just whether a separation-of-powers tool is cost-justified but also whether it might be replaced with alternatives whose harms are fairly distributed. Widespread harm can be a feature rather than a bug. It is better, all else being equal, that everyone be hurt to protect liberty or avoid tyranny than only the nations marginalized. These questions are also relevant for doctrinal analysis, where antisubordinations most determinative role in the limited space in which courts consider separation of powers values may be as a counterweight to the use of historical gloss. This is because antisubordination requires a new, creative agenda for the separation of powers that focuses not on evaluating existing arrangements or the relative power of the branches but instead on developing alternative arrangements that maintain the branches power without imposing skewed costs. The Article illustrates these interventions with novel prescriptions for ongoing legal controversies about the debt ceiling, foreign affairs, legislative standing, and government shutdowns.","output":"Subordination and Separation of Powers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: There is a prolonged RT PCR positivity seen in COVID-19 infected patients up to 2 to 3 months. It is assumed that this virus is usually non-infective but there are hardly any study on the reactivation of this virus within the respiratory tract. We aim to investigate the presence of viral particles inside Extracellular vesicles (EV) and its role in underlying liver disease patients. Methods: SARS CoV2 nasal and throat swab RT-PCR positive n=78 {n=24(66.6%) chronic liver disease (CLD); n=52 (81.3%) non liver disease} n=5 RT PCR negative subjects (HC) were studied. SARS CoV2 patients were also followed up for day (d) 7, 14 and 28. Nasal swab [collected in viral transport media (VTM)] and plasma samples were investigated at each time point. Extracellular vesicles were isolated using differential ultracentrifugation. SARS CoV2 RNA was measured using qRT-PCR by Altona Real Star kit. Cellular origin of EV was confirmed using epithelial cells (Epcam+ CK19+ CDh1+), endothelial cells (CD31+CD45-), and hepatocytes (ASGPR+) surface markers by Flow cytometry. Results: The COVID19 patients {Mean age 54{+/-}23 years; 41 males} were having severity between moderate to severe. In patients with cirrhosis, the most common aetiology of liver disease was alcohol (MELD 22{+/-}8). In baseline RT-PCR positive patients, SARS-CoV2 RNA inside the EV was present in 64/74 (82%) patients with comparable viral load between VTM and EV (mean 1/CT 0.033{+/-}0.005 vs. 1/CT 0.029{+/-}0.014, p=ns). On follow-up at day 7, of the 24 patients negative for COVID19, 10 (41%) had persistence of virus in the EV (1/CT 0.028{+/-}0.004) and on day 14, 14 of 40 (35%) negative RT-PCR had EVs with SARS CoV2 RNA (1/CT 0.028{+/-}0.06). The mean viral load decreased at day7 and day14 in nasal swab from baseline (p=0.001) but not in EV. SARS-CoV2 RNA otherwise undetectable in plasma, was found to be positive in EV in 12.5% of COVID19 positive patients. Interestingly, significantly prolonged and high viral load was found in EV at day 14 in CLD COVID19 patients compared to COVID19 alone (p=0.002). The high cellular injury was seen in CLD COVID19 infected patients with significant high levels of EV associated with endothelial cells and hepatocytes than COVID19 alone (p=0.004; 0.001). Conclusion: Identification of SARS-CoV2 RNA in EV, in RT-PCR negative patients indicates persistence of infection for and likely recurrence of the infection. It is suggestive of another route of transmission as EV harbour SARS CoV2 RNA. EV associated RNA may determine the ongoing inflammation and clinical course of subjects with undetectable SARS-CoV2 virus and this may also have relevance in management of chronic liver disease patients.","output":"Prolonged Detection of SARS CoV2 RNA in Extracellular Vesicles in Nasal Swab RT-PCR Negative Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on doctors is a significant concern. Due to the emergence of multiple pandemic waves, longitudinal data on the impact of COVID-19 are vital to ensure an adequate psychological care response. The primary aim was to assess the prevalence and degree of psychological distress and trauma in frontline doctors during the acceleration, peak and deceleration of the COVID-19 first wave. Personal and professional factors associated with psychological distress are also reported. DESIGN: A prospective online three-part longitudinal survey. SETTING: Acute hospitals in the UK and Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: Frontline doctors working in emergency medicine, anaesthetics and intensive care medicine during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Psychological distress and trauma measured using the General Health Questionnaire-12 and the Impact of Events-Revised. RESULTS: The initial acceleration survey distributed across networks generated a sample of 5440 doctors. Peak and deceleration response rates from the original sample were 71.6% (n=3896) and 56.6% (n=3079), respectively. Prevalence of psychological distress was 44.7% (n=1334) during the acceleration, 36.9% (n=1098) at peak and 31.5% (n=918) at the deceleration phase. The prevalence of trauma was 23.7% (n=647) at peak and 17.7% (n=484) at deceleration. The prevalence of probable post-traumatic stress disorder was 12.6% (n=343) at peak and 10.1% (n=276) at deceleration. Worry of family infection due to clinical work was the factor most strongly associated with both distress (R(2)=0.06) and trauma (R(2)=0.10).

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION A systematic review and cumulative analysis of comparative studies reporting both oncologic and perioperative outcomes of LNU and ONU was performed through a comprehensive search of the Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library electronic databases. All analyses were performed using the Review Manager (RevMan) v.5 (Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark) and Meta-analysis In eXcel (MIX) 2.0 Pro (BiostatXL) software packages. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Twenty-one eligible studies (1235 cases and 3093 controls) were identified. A significantly higher proportion of pTa/Tis was observed in LNU compared to ONU (27.52% vs 22.59%; p = 0.047), but there were no significant differences in other stages and pathologic grades (all p>0.05). For patients who underwent LNU, the 5-yr cancer-specific survival (CSS) rate was significantly higher, at 9% (p = 0.03), compared to those who underwent ONU, while the overall recurrence rate and bladder recurrence rate were notably lower, at 15% (p = 0.01) and 17% (p = 0.02), respectively. However, there were no statistically significant differences in 2-yr CSS, 5-yr recurrence-free survival (RFS), 5-yr overall survival (OS), 2-yr OS, and metastasis rates between LNU and ONU (all p>0.05). Moreover, there were no significant differences between LNU and ONU in terms of intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, and perioperative mortality (all p>0.05). The results of our study were mainly limited by the retrospective design of most of the individual studies included as well as selection biases based on different management of regional lymph nodes and pathologic characteristics. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that LNU offers reliable perioperative safety and comparable oncologic efficacy when compared to ONU. Given that some limitations cannot be overcome, well-designed prospective trials are needed to confirm our findings.","output":"Laparoscopic versus open nephroureterectomy for the treatment of upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma: a systematic review and cumulative analysis of comparative studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aims The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affects populations, societies and lives for more than two years. Long-term sequelae of COVID-19, collectively termed the post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, are rapidly emerging across the globe. Here, we investigated whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen persistence underlies the post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. Methods We performed an endoscopy study with 46 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients 219 days (range: 94-257) after a confirmed COVID-19 infection. SARS-CoV-2 antigen persistence was assessed in the small and large intestine by qPCR of four viral transcripts, immunofluorescence of viral nucleocapsid and virus cultivation from biopsy tissue. Post-acute COVID-19 was assessed by a standardized questionnaire, and a systemic SARS-CoV-2 immune response was evaluated by flow-cytometry and ELISA at endoscopy. IBD activity was evaluated by clinical, biochemical and endoscopic means. Results We report expression of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the gut mucosa 7 months after mild acute COVID-19 in 32 of 46 patients with IBD. Viral nucleocapsid protein persisted in 24 of 46 patients in gut epithelium and CD8+ T cells. Expression of SARS-CoV-2 antigens was not detectable in stool and viral antigen persistence was unrelated to severity of acute COVID-19, immunosuppressive therapy and gut inflammation. We were unable to culture SARS-CoV-2 from gut tissue of patients with viral antigen persistence. Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 were reported from the majority of patients with viral antigen persistence, but not from patients without viral antigen persistence. Conclusion Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 antigen persistence in infected tissues serves as a basis for post-acute COVID-19. The concept that viral antigen persistence instigates immune perturbation and post-acute COVID-19 requires validation in controlled clinical trials.","output":"Post-acute COVID-19 is characterized by gut viral antigen persistence in inflammatory bowel diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sars Cov-2 has emerged as a global threat worldwide.

Short-term regulation of coronary blood flow in response to metabolic stimuli is achieved via adjustment of vascular diameter in different segments of the microvasculature in conjunction with mechanical forces eliciting myogenic and flow-mediated vasodilation. In contrast, chronic adjustments in flow regulation also involve microvascular structural modifications, termed remodeling. Vascular remodeling encompasses changes in microvascular diameter and/or density being largely modulated by mechanical forces acting on the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells. Whereas in recent years, substantial knowledge has been gathered regarding the molecular mechanisms controlling microvascular tone and how these are altered in various diseases, the structural adaptations in response to pathologic situations are less well understood. In this article, we review the factors involved in coronary microvascular functional and structural alterations in obstructive and non-obstructive coronary artery disease and the molecular mechanisms involved therein with a focus on mechanobiology. Cardiovascular risk factors including metabolic dysregulation, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and aging have been shown to induce microvascular (endothelial) dysfunction and vascular remodeling. Additionally, alterations in biomechanical forces produced by a coronary artery stenosis are associated with microvascular functional and structural alterations. Future studies should be directed at further unraveling the mechanisms underlying the coronary microvascular functional and structural alterations in disease; a deeper understanding of these mechanisms is critical for the identification of potential new targets for the treatment of ischemic heart disease.","output":"Mechanobiology of Microvascular Function and Structure in Health and Disease: Focus on the Coronary Circulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). At the time of conducting this study, it had recorded over 1.6 million cases while more than 105,000 have died due to it, with these figures rising on a daily basis across the globe. The burden of this highly contagious respiratory disease is that it presents itself in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patterns in those already infected, thereby leading to an exponential rise in the number of contractions of the disease and fatalities. It is therefore crucial to expedite the process of early detection and diagnosis of the disease across the world. The case-based reasoning (CBR) model is an effective paradigm that allows for the utilization of casesspecific knowledge previously experienced, concrete problem situations or specific patient cases for solving new cases. This study therefore aims to leverage the very rich database of cases of COVID-19 to solve new cases. The approach adopted in this study employs the use of an improved CBR model for state-of-the-art reasoning task in classification of suspected cases of Covid19. The CBR model leverages on a novel feature selection and semantic-based mathematical model proposed in this study for case similarity computation. An initial population of the archive was achieved with 68 cases obtained from the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM) repository. Results obtained revealed that the proposed approach in this study successfully classified suspected cases into their categories at an accuracy of 97.10%. The study found that the proposed model can support physicians to easily diagnose suspected cases of Covid19 base on their medical records without subjecting the specimen to laboratory test.

However, the relationship between the severity of the patient's organ damage and the survival benefit of PMX treatment is not clear. METHODS: We analyzed the efficacy of PMX on adult sepsis patients using the propensity score matching method and the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) national inpatient database from April 2018 to March 2020. We stratified the patients into five categories based on their baseline Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and compared the mortality between PMX-treated and non-treated groups in each category. We also compared continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF)-, ventilator- and noradrenaline-free days between the groups. RESULTS: Of 44,177 patients included in the study, 2191 received PMX. After 1:1 propensity score matching, we created matched cohorts of 2033 pairs. PMX significantly improved the survival of the patients in the SOFA score categories of 7C9 and 10C12. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the survival rate in SOFA score categories of 0C6, 13C15, and 16C24. In analyzing organ support-free days, PMX was also beneficial in the 7C9 and 10C12 SOFA categories compared to other categories. CONCLUSION: Analysis of a large-scale Japanese inpatient database found a significant association between PMX efficacy and baseline SOFA score. This result indicates higher efficacy in patients with medium SOFA scores in the range of 7C12. The result provides a promising hypothesis for selecting appropriate patients for PMX and should be validated in future RCTs.

The main challenge is the lack of labeled training data needed to train convolutional neural networks. To overcome this issue, we propose to leverage Deep Transfer Learning architecture pre-trained on ImageNet dataset and trained Fine-Tuning on a dataset prepared by collecting normal, COVID-19, and other chest pneumonia X-ray images from different available databases. We take the weights of the layers of each network already pre-trained to our model and we only train the last layers of the network on our collected COVID-19 image dataset.

Though clinical guidelines and expert opinions agree on large volume resuscitation, debate remains on the optimal fluid type. The most commonly used fluids are Lactated Ringer's (LR) and Normal Saline (NS), but the studies published to date comparing LR vs NS yield conflicting results. We aimed to identify and quantitatively synthesize existing high quality data of the topic of fluid type or acute pancreatitis resuscitation. METHODS: In collaboration with the study team, an information specialist performed a comprehensive literature review to identify reports addressing type of fluid resuscitation. Studies were screened using the Covidence system by two independent reviewers in order to identify Randomized controlled trials comparing LR versus NS. The main outcome was the development of moderately severe or severe pancreatitis and additional outcomes included local complications, ICU admission, and length of stay. Pooled odds ratios were estimated using the random effects model and standardized mean difference to compare continuous variables. RESULTS: We reviewed 7964 abstracts and 57 full text documents. Four randomized controlled trials were identified and included in our meta-analyses. There were a total of 122 patients resuscitated with LR versus 126 with NS. Patients resuscitated with LR were less likely to develop moderately severe/severe pancreatitis (OR 0.49; 95 % CI 0.25-0.97). There was no difference in development of SIRS at 24 or 48 h or development of organ failure between the two groups. Patients resuscitated with LR were less likely to require ICU admission (OR 0.33; 95 % CI 0.13-0.81) and local complications (OR 0.42; 95 % CI 0.2-0.88). While there was a trend towards shorter hospitalizations for LR (SMD -0.18, 99 % CI -0.44-0.07), it was not statistically significant.

In response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the innate immune response is the first line of defense, triggering multiple signaling pathways to produce interferons, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and initiating the adaptive immune response against the virus. Unsurprisingly, the virus has developed strategies to evade detection, which can result in delayed, excessive activation of the innate immune system. The response elicited by the host depends on multiple factors, including health status, age, and sex. An overactive innate immune response can lead to a cytokine storm, inflammation, and vascular disruption, leading to the vast array of symptoms exhibited by COVID-19 patients.

Besides the epidemiological and social interaction components, it also models people's short and long-distance movements as part of a transportation model. These features, together with the capacity to simulate scenarios with millions of individuals and apply different contention and mitigation measures, gives EpiGraph the potential to reproduce the COVID-19 evolution and study medium-term effects of the virus when applying mitigation methods. EpiGraph, obtains closely aligned infected and death curves related to the first wave in the Madrid metropolitan area, achieving similar seroprevalence values. We also show that selective lockdown for people over 60 would reduce the number of deaths.

The present study investigated whether reminders that highlight self-identity would be effective in changing intention and behaviour related to the COVID-19 outbreak, and hypothesized that those who read reminders highlighting self-identity (Don't be a spreader) would change IP intention and behaviour better than those who read Don't spread or no reminder. We conducted a two-wave survey of the same participants with a one-week interval, during which we assigned one of three reminder conditions to the participants: Don't spread (spreading condition), Don't be a spreader (spreader condition) and no reminder (control condition).

The aim of this study was to examine the associations of numbers of comorbidities with critical type and death of COVID-19. Methods: : This was a single-centered retrospective study among patients with COVID-19. All patients with COVID-19 enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance. Six different kinds of noncommunicable chronic diseases were included in this study. The logistic regression model was used to estimate the fixed effect of numbers of comorbidities on critical type or death, adjusting for potential confounders. Results: : In total, 475 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in our study, included 234 females and 241 males. Hypertension was the most frequent type (162 [34.1%] of 475 patients). Patients with two or more comorbidities have higher risk of critical type (OR 3.072, 95% CI [1.581, 5.970], p=0.001) and death (OR 5.538, 95% CI [1.577, 19.451], p=0.008) compared to patients without comorbidities.

STUDY DESIGN: We used electronic health record data from an urban safety\\\\net healthcare system on appointments, patient's diagnoses, demographics, location of care, and provider type. Data included outpatient mental health service use for the periods before (pre\\\\period = MarchCJune 2019) and after (post\\\\period = MarchCJune 2020) the introduction of telepsychiatry. Outcomes consisted of outpatient mental health service use and no\\\\show visits, which were operationalized as both dichotomous and count variables. We estimated multivariable linear probability regression models (dichotomous outcome) and negative binomial regression models (count outcome). The primary term of interest was an interaction between race/ethnicity (White [referent], Black, Latino, and Asian) and time indicator (1 = post\\\\period, MarchCJune 2019; and 0 = pre\\\\period, MarchCJune 2020) that yielded the difference in service use between White patients and racial/ethnic minority patients. In secondary analysis, the term of interest was an interaction between language of service preference (English [referent], Spanish, Portuguese, and Haitian Creole) and time indicator. We used predictive margins methods to estimate predicted probabilities, predicted means, interpret interactions in nonlinear models, and estimate within group differences. All regression models adjusted for a rich set of covariates. POPULATION STUDIED: Analytic sample consisted of adults between the ages of 18C64 that received mental health services from the safety\\\\net healthcare system under study between March 2019 and June 2020 (n = 254,995). We further classified our population by race/ethnicity (White, Black, Latino, and Asian) and language of service preference (English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Haitian Creole). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In adjusted results, between pre\\\\ and post\\\\periods, all racial/ethnic and linguistic groups had significant within\\\\group increases in access to and use of outpatient mental health care (all p < 0.05). Relative to White patients, Asian patients had a significant decrease in having any outpatient mental health visit (?1.1%, p < 0.05) and Latinos had a significant increase in the number of outpatient mental health visits per 1000 patients (+469.7, p < 0.05). Relative to English\\\\speaking patients, Portuguese speaking patients had a significant increase in any outpatient mental health visits (+0.5%, p < 0.05). Within\\\\group no\\\\show rates increased significantly for White and Asian patients, but mean number of no\\\\show visits per 1000 patients decreased significantly for all racial/ethnic groups (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Telepsychiatry provides patients a means to initiate or continue their treatment regimen while socially distancing and quarantining. This mode of mental health care also removes many of the traditional barriers to care (e.g. child care and transportation) experienced by racial/ethnic minority groups. However, disparities still remain and may have been exacerbated by the introduction of new technological barriers to care. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY OR PRACTICE: Clinicians and hospital administrators should consider the impact of digital literacy and the digital divide in the continued use of telepsychiatry.

Demographic and clinical data were compared between patients with benign/malignant disease, clear cell/nonclear cell renal cell carcinoma and high/low grade tumors. Tumor complexity was quantified by R.E.N.A.L. (radius, exophytic/endophytic, nearness of tumor to collecting system or sinus, anterior/posterior, hilar and location relative to polar lines) nephrometry score and described as low--4 to 6, intermediate--7 to 9 or high--10 or greater. Logistic regression analyses were performed to test the association between tumor and patient characteristics, and high grade renal cell carcinoma. Subanalyses were done for patients with renal tumors 4 cm or less. RESULTS High grade renal cell carcinoma was larger and more likely to develop in men. Patients with malignant tumors and with clear cell histology were more likely to have intermediate or high complexity tumors. Increasing tumor complexity independently predicted malignancy, high grade malignancy and clear cell histology on multivariate regression analysis (each p <0.05). Male gender was independently associated with malignancy and high grade renal cell carcinoma. When considering tumors 4 cm or less, tumor complexity predicted malignancy but not tumor grade.

HPV decontamination was effective against bacterial spores (6 log(10) reduction of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores) on FFRs and viruses (> 4 log(10) reduction of various types of viruses) on inanimate surfaces, and no degradation of respirator materials and fit has been reported. 70% or higher ethanol decontamination showed high efficacy in inactivation of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces (> 3.9 log(10) reduction) but it was lower on FFRs which filtration efficiency was also decreased. UVGI method had good biocidal efficacy on FFRs (> 3 log(10) reduction of H1N1 virus) combined with inexpensive, readily available equipment; however, it was more time-consuming to ensure sufficient reduction in SARS-CoV-2. MGS treatment also provided good viral decontamination on FFRs (> 4 log(10) reduction of H1N1 virus) along with less time-intensive process and readily available equipment while inconsistent disinfection on the treated surfaces and deterioration of nose cushion of FFRs were observed. HPGP was a good virucidal system (> 6 log(10) reduction of Vesicular stomatitis virus) but filtration efficiency after decontamination was inconsistent.

However, knowledge on the relationship between long-term maintained healthy dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, and the risk of SARS-2-Cov infection is still sparse. We longitudinally assessed this association in a well-known Mediterranean cohort. METHODS: We assessed 9677 participants from the SUN Project, a prospective cohort of middle-aged university graduates in Spain. We inquired about a positive result in a COVID-19 diagnostic test during the months of February to December 2020. After excluding health professionals (HP), 5194 participants were included in the statistical analyses (mean age: 52.6, SD: 12.4; 55.2% women). Food habits were assessed at baseline using a previously validated semiquantitative 136-item food frequency questionnaire. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet (cumulative average of 2 repeated measurements separated 10 years apart) was assessed using the 0-to-9 Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). We used multivariable logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for incident COVID-19 according to the MDS. RESULTS: Among 5194 non-HP participants, 122 reported to have received a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on a specific diagnostic test. Participants with intermediate adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MDS 4 & <7) had a significantly lower odds of developing COVID-19 (multivariable-adjusted OR = 0.50, 95% CI, 0.34C0.73), and those with the highest adherence (MDS  7) exhibited the lowest risk (multivariable-adjusted OR = 0.36, 0.16C0.84, p for trend < 0.001) as compared with participants with MDS 3. This inverse association remained robust within subgroups and in sensitivity analyses. Notwithstanding, no significant associations were observed for health professionals (p for interaction = 0.06).

There is a contrast between French Guiana, where the incidence of this disease is the highest in the world, and other countries where this disease is practically non-existent. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent findings are essentially in French Guiana where a unique strain MST17 has been identified; it is probably more virulent than those usually found with a particularly marked pulmonary tropism, a mysterious animal reservoir, a geographical distribution that raises questions. SUMMARY: Q fever is a bacterial zoonosis due to Coxiella burnetii that has been reported worldwide. On the Guiana Shield, a region mostly covered by Amazonian forest, which encompasses the Venezuelan State of Bolivar, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and the Brazilian State of Amap, the situation is very heterogeneous. While French Guiana is the region reporting the highest incidence of this disease in the world, with a single infecting clone (MST 117) and a unique epidemiological cycle, it has hardly ever been reported in other countries in the region. This absence of cases raises many questions and is probably due to massive under-diagnosis.

However, chemotherapy has limited therapeutic effects in bladder cancer. One of the reasons of this resistance to chemotherapy is that higher levels of glutathione in invasive bladder cancer cells. We have fabricated nanoparticles that respond to high concentrations of glutathione and near-infrared laser irradiation in order to increase the drug accumulation at the tumor sites and combine chemotherapy with photothermal therapy to overcome the challenges of bladder cancer treatment. METHODS The DOX&IR780@PEG-PCL-SS NPs were prepared by co-precipitation method. We investigated the tumor targeting capability of NPs in vitro and in vivo. The orthotopic bladder cancer model in C57BL/6 mice was established for in vivo study and the photothermal effects and therapeutic efficacy of NPs were evaluated. RESULTS The DOX&IR780@PEG-PCL-SS NPs were synthesized using internal cross-linking strategy to increase the stability of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles can be ingested by tumor cells in a short time. The DOX&IR780@PEG-PCL-SS NPs have dual sensitivity to high levels of glutathione in bladder cancer cells and near-infrared laser irradiation. Glutathione triggers chemical structural changes of nanoparticles and preliminarily releases drugs, Near-infrared laser irradiation can promote the complete release of the drugs from the nanoparticles and induce a photothermal effect, leading to destroying the tumor cells. Given the excellent tumor-targeting ability and negligible toxicity to normal tissue, DOX&IR780@PEG-PCL-SS NPs can greatly increase the concentration of the anti-cancer drugs in tumor cells. The mice treated with DOX&IR780@PEG-PCL-SS NPs have a significant reduction in tumor volume. The DOX&IR780@PEG-PCL-SS NPs can be tracked by in vivo imaging system and have good tumor targeting ability, to facilitate our assessment during the experiment. CONCLUSION A nanoparticle delivery system with dual sensitivity to glutathione and near-infrared laser irradiation was developed for delivering IR780 and DOX. Chemo-photothermal synergistic therapy of both primary bladder cancer and their metastases was achieved using this advanced delivery system.","output":"Internal cross-linked polymeric nanoparticles with dual sensitivity for combination therapy of muscle-invasive bladder cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic, known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is an infectious respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus first identified in patients from Wuhan, China. Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 spread swiftly around world and infected more than 25 million people and caused more than 800,000 deaths in 188 countries. Chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD appear to be a risk factor for COVID-19; however, their prevalence remains controversial. In fact, studies in China reported lower rates of chronic respiratory conditions in patients with COVID-19 than in the general population, while the trend is reversed in the United States and Europe. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms of a possible interaction between COVID-19 and chronic respiratory diseases remain unknown, some observations can help to resolve them. Indeed, physiological changes, immune response, or medication used against SARS-CoV-2 may have greater impact on patients with chronic respiratory conditions, already debilitated by chronic inflammation, dyspnea, and the use of immunosuppressant drugs like corticosteroids. In this review, we discuss the importance and the impact of COVID-19 on asthmatics and COPD patients, the possible available treatments, and patient management during the pandemic.","output":"Are patients with asthma and COPD preferred targets of COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The current state of thoracoscopic technology allows less invasive surgical procedures and requires fewer ports and incisions. Totally video-assisted thoracic surgery with a single port has emerged as the least invasive thoracoscopic approach. However, uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery brings about considerable difficulties, necessitating the development of skillful techniques as well as specific surgical devices. In such situations as dense pleural adhesion and anatomical abnormality, it may be more burdensome, necessitating the conversion to conventional multiportal video-assisted thoracic surgery or even to thoracotomy. To troubleshoot these situations, we herein propose the use of additional technique which could support to sustain the confident operative field for uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery. This procedure also provides the same cosmetic outcomes as uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery. CASE PRESENTATION A previously healthy, 77-year-old female was referred to our hospital, with a lung adenocarcinoma measuring 28 mm in the right upper lobe. Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was planned to resect the tumor. During operation, we found the incomplete interlobar fissure between the upper and the middle lobe and the abnormal lobulation of the upper lobe. Therefore, the modified marionette technique was introduced to make the procedure safer and easier. This technique proposed herein consists of employing the untethered gripping forceps to retract the lung, not requiring additional traumatic trocars. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient \`was discharged in 1 week after a modified uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery for the right upper lobectomy. CONCLUSIONS The modified marionette technique produced sufficient operative views to attain uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery safely in this case, rendering operative conversion unnecessary.","output":"Modified marionette technique for uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery: a case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted teaching in medical schools across the world.

In community live chatting, developers are likely to post issues they encountered (e.g., setup issues and compile issues), and other developers respond with possible solutions. Therefore, community live chats contain rich sets of information for reported issues and their corresponding solutions, which can be quite useful for knowledge sharing and future reuse if extracted and restored in time. However, it remains challenging to accurately mine such knowledge due to the noisy nature of interleaved dialogs in live chat data. In this paper, we first formulate the problem of issue-solution pair extraction from developer live chat data, and propose an automated approach, named ISPY, based on natural language processing and deep learning techniques with customized enhancements, to address the problem. Specifically, ISPY automates three tasks: 1) Disentangle live chat logs, employing a feedforward neural network to disentangle a conversation history into separate dialogs automatically; 2) Detect dialogs discussing issues, using a novel convolutional neural network (CNN), which consists of a BERT-based utterance embedding layer, a context-aware dialog embedding layer, and an output layer; 3) Extract appropriate utterances and combine them as corresponding solutions, based on the same CNN structure but with different feeding inputs. To evaluate ISPY, we compare it with six baselines, utilizing a dataset with 750 dialogs including 171 issue-solution pairs and evaluate ISPY from eight open source communities. The results show that, for issue-detection, our approach achieves the F1 of 76%, and outperforms all baselines by 30%.

However, currently, there is a lack of systematic study and quantitative information of the aerosol generation during these instruments, which is crucial for offering risk assessment and the corresponding mitigation strategies for the reopening of these activities. Collaborating with 15 musicians from the Minnesota Orchestra, we conduct a systematic study of the aerosol generation from a large variety of wind instruments under different music dynamic levels and articulation patterns. We find that the aerosol concentration from different brass and woodwinds exhibits two orders of magnitude variation. Accordingly, we categorize the instruments into low (tuba), intermediate (bassoon, piccolo, flute, bass clarinet, French horn, and clarinet) and high risk (trumpet, bass trombone, and oboe) levels based on a comparison of their aerosol generation with those from normal breathing and speaking. In addition, we observe that the aerosol generation can be affected by the changing dynamic level, articulation pattern, the normal respiratory behaviors of individuals, and even the usage of some special techniques during the instrument play. However, such effects vary substantially for different types of instrument, depending on specific breathing techniques as well as the tube structure and inlet design of the instrument.

However, it is gradually being phased out from clinical use against malaria due to emergence of CQ-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains. Besides low cost and tolerability, ongoing research has revealed interesting biochemical properties of CQ that have inspired its repurposing/repositioning in the management of various infectious/noninfectious diseases. Consequently, several novel compounds and compositions based on its scaffold have been studied and patented. Areas covered: In this review, patents describing CQ and its derivatives/compositions over the last 5 years are analyzed.

Expert opinion: Repurposing efforts have dominantly focused on racemic CQ with no studies exploring the effect of the (R) and (S) enantiomers, which might potentially have additional benefits in other diseases. Additionally, evaluating other similarly acting antimalarials in clinical use and structural analogs could help maximize the intrinsic value of the 4-aminoquinolines. With regard to cancer therapy, successful repurposing of CQ-containing compounds will require linking the mode of action of these antimalarials with the signaling pathways that drive cancer cell proliferation to facilitate the development of a 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline that can be used as a synergistic partner in anticancer combination chemotherapy.","output":"Chloroquine-containing compounds: a patent review (2010 C 2014)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background: The highest incidence rate of covid-19 in Iran was reported from Shahroud County.

Meiotic commitment ensures the irreversible continuation of meiosis, even upon withdrawal of the meiosis-inducing signals. A loss of meiotic commitment can cause highly abnormal polyploid cells and can ultimately lead to germ cell tumors. Despite the importance of meiotic commitment, only a few genes involved in commitment are known. In this study, we have discovered six new regulators of meiotic commitment in budding yeast: the Bcy1 protein involved in nutrient sensing, the meiosis-specific kinase Ime2, Polo kinase Cdc5, RNA-binding protein Pes4, and the 14-3-3 proteins Bmh1 and Bmh2. Decreased levels of these proteins cause a failure to establish or maintain meiotic commitment. Importantly, we found that Bmh1 and Bmh2 are involved in multiple processes throughout meiosis and in meiotic commitment. First, cells depleted of both Bmh1 and Bmh2 trigger the pachytene checkpoint, likely due to a role in DNA double-strand break repair. Second, Bmh1 interacts directly with the middle meiosis transcription factor Ndt80, and both Bmh1 and Bmh2 maintain Ndt80 levels. Third, Bmh1 and Bmh2 bind to Cdc5 and enhance its kinase activity. Finally, Bmh1 binds to Pes4, which regulates the timing of the translation of several mRNAs in meiosis II and is required to maintain meiotic commitment. Our results demonstrate that meiotic commitment is actively maintained throughout meiosis, with the 14-3-3 proteins and Polo kinase serving as key regulators of this developmental program.","output":"Identification of 14-3-3 proteins, Polo kinase, and RNA-binding protein Pes4 as key regulators of meiotic commitment in budding yeast"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen La pandemia actual por SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) afecta con mayor incidencia y gravedad a las personas mayores en todo el mundo.

This work aims to highlight the evidence about the measures to be implemented through current and future guidelines. The need to prepare for action by implementing international protocols stand out. There is a trend towards biopsychosocial care of elderly people in all settings where they are, adapting care and personalizing decisions on hospital admissions, palliative care, among other criteria, to years adjusted to quality of life, as well as alternatives for monitoring and treatment of COVID-19 pathology and others existing in this population group. Measures to reduce the transmission of the virus through hygiene and social distancing are necessary, attending to biopsychosocial health of the elderly isolated. Intersectoral communication is proposed as innovative alternatives, and the use of technological tools, accompanied by adequate digital health literacy. Future lines focus on guaranteeing social and health rights, equating the social and health system at the same level, and achieving real coordination. A new framework of person-centered care could be a great ally to achieve integrated care for the elderly, guided by an increase in resources bound to funding longevity research projects.","output":"PERSONAS MAYORES, DEPENDENCIA Y VULNERABILIDAD EN LA PANDEMIA POR CORONAVIRUS: EMERGENCIA DE UNA INTEGRACIN SOCIAL Y SANITARIA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Midline laparotomy closure carries a significant risk of incisional hernia. This study examines the behavior of two new suture materials, an elastic material, polyurethane (PUe), and a barbed polydioxanone (PDXb) suture thread in a rabbit model of midline incision closure. METHODS Three 2-cm midline incisions were made in 68 New Zealand White rabbits. The incisions were closed by running suture using four 3/0 threads: polypropylene (PP) (Surgipro?, Covidien), PUe (Assuplus?, Assut Europe), PDX (Assufil?, Assut Europe) or PDXb (Filbloc?, Assut Europe). Animals in each suture group were euthanized 3 weeks and 6 months after surgery. Histological sections of the tissue-embedded sutures were subjected to morphological, collagen expression, macrophage response and uniaxial tensiometry studies. RESULTS No signs of wound dehiscence or complications were observed. At 3 weeks, all sutures were surrounded by connective tissue composed mainly of collagen III. PUe showed greater collagen I expression than the other sutures. All sutures elicited a macrophage response that diminished from 3 weeks to 6 months (p < 0.001). This response was similar for the non-reabsorbable sutures (PP and PUe) yet PDXb showed a significantly greater response than the other reabsorbable suture (PDX) at 3 weeks (p < 0.01). At this early time point, the tensile strength of PUe was similar to that of control intact tissue (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION Three weeks after surgery, PUe revealed more collagen I deposition than the remaining materials and this translated to a similar biomechanical behavior to linea alba, that could avoid the appearance of short term dehiscences and thus reduce the incidence of incisional hernia. PDXb provides no additional advantages in their behavior regarding PDX suture.","output":"New suture materials for midline laparotomy closure: an experimental study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A general dynamical cluster identification framework including both modeling and computation is developed.

To solve the above problems, based on complex network theory, the paper uses the identified hazards and the relationship between hazards to construct the propagation network of tailings dam failure risk (PNTDFR). The traditional analysis methods of network centrality usually focus on one aspect of the information of the network, while it cannot take into account to absorb the advantages of different methods, resulting in the difference between identified key nodes and real key hazards. To find the key hazards of tailing dam failure, based on the characteristics of multi-stage propagation of failure risk, the paper proposes a multi-stage collaborative hazard remediation method (MCHRM) to determine the importance of hazard nodes by absorbing the advantages of different centrality methods under different hazard remediation (deletion) ratios. The paper applies the above methods to Feij?o Dam I. It can be found that when the priority remediation range is increased to 45%, the key hazards obtained by the MCHRM will cover all the causes of accidents proposed by the Dam I failure investigation expert group. Besides, the paper compares the monitoring data, daily inspection results and safety evaluation information of key hazards with the Grading standards of hazard indicators, and obtains the formation process of the Dam I failure and 30 key hazards in trigger state.","output":"Propagation network of tailings dam failure risk and the identification of key hazards"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Document: To contain the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), roughly 20 states and the District of Columbia continue to operate under so-called 'stay-at-home' orders closing nonessential businesses and limiting the circumstances in which individuals can leave their residences In other states, some counties and cities remain subject to similar orders These directives fall within the traditional police powers of state and local governments to protect the health and safety of their citizens But stay-at-home orders also implicate federal interests, raising questions about the balance between federal and state power if federal authorities disagree with the content or duration of specific state or local mandates Besides these federalism issues, disputes over the proper response to COVID-19 raise separation-of-powers questions about the President's authority to override stay-at-home orders This Legal Sidebar responds to certain frequently asked questions concerning the federal government's power to lift or modify such orders COVID-19 (Disease);Federal-state controversies;Quarantine--Law and legislation","output":"Federal Authority to Lift or Modify State and Local COVID-19 'Stay-At-Home' Orders: Frequently Asked Questions [May 15, 2020]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patient care often refers to the broad spectrum of care, prevention, and treatment that a provider delivers, while the point of a differential diagnosis is to make a distinction between 2 or more conditions that share similar signs or symptoms.

The COVID-19 response has forced many of these basic medical values aside, like providing differential diagnosis or practicing bedside manner through social interaction, while physicians struggle to continue care for patients. As a result, newly formed hospital and clinical policies may have dangerously traded everyday diagnosis and treatment of patients for the pandemic and quarantine recommendations. This type of assumptive medicine is based on a singular differential that can be detrimental to patients, who are more likely affected with more common illnesses, like bronchitis or pneumonia-or perhaps, even more threatening illnesses, like a pulmonary embolism, COPD exacerbation, congestive heart failure and even lung cancer.

To gain adequate visualization of relevant structures, surgical assistants often assume awkward positioning with inadequate stability of handheld retractors. Additionally, the lead surgeon is typically the only member of the surgical team who can adequately visualize the procedure being performed. To that end, devices have been manufactured with aims of optimizing both visualization and workspace while reducing the need of handheld retractors during vaginal surgery. This video presents one of those retractors: a reusable, self-retaining, vaginal Magrina-Bookwalter, with details to help achieve the optimal visualization and workspace with its use. METHODS: A narrated video provides a brief history, components and proper assembly of the retractor with stepwise application of components demonstrated during a vaginal hysterectomy.

It has already caused thousands of causalities and infected several millions worldwide. Any technological tool that can be provided to healthcare practitioners to save time, effort, and possibly lives has crucial importance. The main tools practitioners currently use to diagnose Covid-19 are Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Computed Tomography (CT), which require significant time, resources and acknowledged experts. X-ray imaging is a common and easily accessible tool that has great potential for Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel approach for Covid-19 recognition from chest X-ray images. Despite the importance of the problem, recent studies in this domain produced not so satisfactory results due to the limited datasets available for training. Recall that Deep Learning techniques can generally provide state-of-the-art performance in many classification tasks when trained properly over large datasets, such data scarcity can be a crucial obstacle when using them for Covid-19 detection. Alternative approaches such as representation-based classification (collaborative or sparse representation) might provide satisfactory performance with limited size datasets, but they generally fall short in performance or speed compared to Machine Learning methods. To address this deficiency, Convolution Support Estimation Network (CSEN) has recently been proposed as a bridge between model-based and Deep Learning approaches by providing a non-iterative real-time mapping from query sample to ideally sparse representation coefficient' support, which is critical information for class decision in representation based techniques.","output":"Convolutional Sparse Support Estimator Based Covid-19 Recognition from X-ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditional selfish routing literature quantifies inefficiency in transportation systems with single-attribute costs using price-of-anarchy (PoA), and provides various technical approaches (e.g. marginal cost pricing) to improve PoA of the overall network. Unfortunately, practical transportation systems have dynamic, multi-attribute costs and the state-of-the-art technical approaches proposed in the literature are infeasible for practical deployment. In this paper, we offer a paradigm shift to selfish routing via characterizing idiosyncratic, multi-attribute costs at boundedly-rational travelers, as well as improving network efficiency using strategic information design. Specifically, we model the interaction between the system and travelers as a Stackelberg game, where travelers adopt multi-attribute logit responses. We model the strategic information design as an optimization problem, and develop a novel approximate algorithm to steer Logit Response travelers towards social welfare using strategic Information design (in short, LoRI). We demonstrate the performance of LoRI on a Wheatstone network with multi-modal route choices at the travelers. In our simulation experiments, we find that LoRI outperforms SSSP in terms of system utility, especially when there is a motive mismatch between the two systems and improves social welfare. For instance, we find that LoRI persuades a traveler towards a socially optimal route for 66.66% of the time on average, when compared to SSSP, when the system has 0.3 weight on carbon emissions.

Although the issue has prompted a surge in research on the subject in recent years, no singular solution has yet been identified that is capable of maintaining the quality of wine made from smoke-affected grapes. In this review, we summarize the main research on smoke taint, the key discoveries, as well as the prevailing uncertainties. We also examine methods for mitigating smoke taint in the vineyard, in the winery, and post production. We assess the effectiveness of remediation methods (proposed and actual) based on available research. Our findings are in agreement with previous studies, suggesting that the most viable remedies for smoke taint are still the commercially available activated carbon fining and reverse osmosis treatments, but that the quality of the final treated wines is fundamentally dependent on the initial severity of the taint. In this review, suggestions for future studies are introduced for improving our understanding of methods that have thus far only been preliminarily investigated. We select regions that have already been subjected to severe wildfires, and therefore subjected to smoke taint (particularly Australia and California) as a case study to inform other wine-producing countries that will likely be impacted in the future and suggest specific data collection and policy implementation actions that should be taken, even in countries that have not yet been impacted by smoke taint. Ultimately, we streamline the available information on the topic of smoke taint, apply it to a global perspective that considers the various stakeholders involved, and provide a launching point for further research on the topic.","output":"Techniques for Mitigating the Effects of Smoke Taint While Maintaining Quality in Wine Production: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed gaps in our understanding of safe, effective and efficient means of disinfecting high use public spaces.

Ankle maximum dorsiflexion angle significantly decreased by flexing the hip from 150 to 90 (P < 0.001; mean difference 17.7  2.5), but no effect of the head position was observed (P > 0.05). Maximal passive torque and shear elastic modulus were higher with the hip flexed at 90 (P < 0.001). During submaximal ROM, no effects of the head and hip positioning (P > 0.05) were found for both torque and shear elastic modulus at a given common ankle angle among conditions. Shifts in maximal ankle angle due to hip angle manipulation are not related neither to changes in passive torque nor tension of the gastrocnemius.

In parallel, healthcare professionals ameliorate the short-term impact of burnout by prioritizing some tasks over others. The phenomenon of employee silence can help us understand the evolution of how culture is molded toward the prioritization of some tasks over others, and how this contributes to burnout. Silence in healthcare has been associated with concealing errors, reduced patient safety, and covering up errors made by others. Conversely, there is evidence that in organizations where employees are encouraged to speak up about concerns, and where concerns are responded to appropriately, better patient outcomes such as improved patient safety and patient experience occur. Interventions to promote speaking-up in healthcare have not been successful and are rooted in a professional culture that does not promote speaking out. In this paper, we review the evidence that exists within healthcare to argue why healthcare education should be interested in employee silence, and how silence is a key factor in understanding how burnout develops and impacts quality of care. The following key questions have been addressed; how employee silence evolves during medical education, how is silence maintained after graduation, and how can leadership style contribute to silence in healthcare.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, 261 wastewater samples from six communities of the province of Crdoba, Argentina were analyzed. From mid-May 2020 to the end of August 2021, raw sewage samples were collected from the central network pipe that enters into the Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP) in Crdoba city and five communities in the Punilla Valley. SARS-CoV-2 was concentrated by using the polyethylene glycol-6000 precipitation method. Viral genomes were extracted from concentrated samples, and N- and E-SARS-CoV-2 genes were detected by using real time RT-PCR. Wastewater samples that resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 genome detection were subjected to viral variants of concern (VOCs) identification by real time RT-PCR. Overall, just by using the identification of the N gene or E gene, the rates of viral genome detection were 43.4% (86/198) and 51.5% (102/198) respectively, and by using both methodologies (positivity criterion: detection of N and / or E gene), the detection rate was 71.2% (141/198). Thereby, the optimal strategy to study the SARS-CoV-2 genome in wastewater would be the use of the combined detection of both genes.

Accurate outcome prognostication could facilitate hospital resource allocation. We develop and validate predictive models for each outcome using retrospective electronic health record data for COVID-19 patients treated between March 2 and May 6, 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For each outcome, we trained 3 classes of prediction models using clinical data for a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2)-positive patients (n = 2256). Cross-validation was used to select the best-performing models per the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic and precision-recall curves. Models were validated using a held-out cohort (n = 855). We measured each model's calibration and evaluated feature importances to interpret model output. RESULTS: The predictive performance for our selected models on the held-out cohort was as follows: area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve-MV 0.743 (95% CI, 0.682-0.812), RRT 0.847 (95% CI, 0.772-0.936), readmission 0.871 (95% CI, 0.830-0.917); area under the precision-recall curve-MV 0.137 (95% CI, 0.047-0.175), RRT 0.325 (95% CI, 0.117-0.497), readmission 0.504 (95% CI, 0.388-0.604).

At the same time, it has seriously impacted the daily activities in all the fields of urology. Objective To better understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical, academic, and scientific activities as well as on the quality of life of urologists from the main centers in Europe. Design, setting, and participants We conducted a survey using a 37-item questionnaire. The survey included three main sections: clinical practice, academic/scientific activities, and personal/social quality of life. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis A descriptive analysis was performed using the collected data. Results and limitations A total of 107 representatives affiliated to different centers from 22 countries completed the survey. Clinical activities were affected in 54.2% of the centers, and 85.0% of the elective surgeries were cancelled. Of the urological departments, 64.5% were still performing minimally invasive surgery for malignant disease. In 33.6% of the hospitals, dedicated and specially equipped operating theaters for COVID-19Cpositive patients were not available. According to 72.9% of participants, COVID-19 had a substantial negative impact on academic activities, and 82.3% of the respondents agreed that their quality of life has been affected negatively by the pandemic. Finally, 92.5% of the participants believe that the pandemic will have a moderate to severe impact on the health system of their countries. Conclusions Data collected in this survey provide insight into changes brought about in clinical and academic settings amid COVID-19. Along with shortages such as bed occupancy and personal protective equipment, it highlights negative impacts on academic and scientific activities, including the personal and social life of urologists. Patient summary It is essential to understand the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on clinical, academic, and scientific urological activities, as well as on related personal and social issues. As situations similar to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may recur, we must be prepared to react quickly and effectively. It is important that urology departments look after the well-being of their patients, while protecting their staff and continuing with academic/research activities.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Clinical and Academic Urological Practice: A Survey from European Association of Urology Section of Uro-technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"National public health institutes (NPHIs)-science-based governmental agencies typically part of, or closely aligned with, ministries of health-have played a critical part in many countries' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through listening sessions with NPHI leadership, we captured the experiences of NPHIs in Africa. Our research was further supplemented by a review of the literature. To address issues related to COVID-19, NPHIs in Africa developed a variety of innovative approaches, such as working with the private sector to procure and manage vital supplies and address key information needs. Creative uses of technology, including virtual training and messaging from drones, contributed to sharing information and battling misinformation. Positive impacts of the pandemic response include increased laboratory capacity in many countries, modernized surveillance systems, and strengthened public-private partnerships; much of this enhanced capacity is expected to persist beyond the pandemic. However, several challenges remain, including the lack of staff trained in areas like bioinformatics (essential for genomic analysis) and the need for sustained relationships and data sharing between NPHIs and agencies not traditionally considered public health (eg, those related to border crossings), as well as the impact of the pandemic on prevention and control of non-COVID-19 conditions-both infectious and noncommunicable. Participants in the listening sessions also highlighted concerns about inequities in access to, and quality of, the public health services and clinical care with resultant disproportionate impact of the pandemic on certain populations. COVID-19 responses and challenges highlight the need for continued investment to strengthen NPHIs and public health infrastructure to address longstanding deficiencies and ensure preparedness for the next public health crisis.","output":"African National Public Health Institutes Responses to COVID-19: Innovations, Systems Changes, and Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After its introduction in 1992, the balanced scorecard (BSC) has attracted considerable interest from both scholars and practitioners. This is evidenced by the increasing number of publications addressing BSC and the large number of professional events devoted to it.

This study aims to contribute towards filling this significant gap through studying 106 top-ranked journal articles on BSC, of which 37 belong to the hospitality and tourism industry. In so doing, the study highlights the research focus that has been placed so far on BSC and examines its trends and the relationships amongst its perspectives. It also provides valuable input to identify gaps currently impeding BSC development in the hospitality and tourism industry, recommends future research opportunities intended to improve understanding and practice of BSC along with building up on emerging research topics like sustainable tourism and new tourism management.","output":"Balanced scorecard in the hospitality and tourism industry: Past, present and future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China, was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Anisodamine hydrobromide injection (AHI), the main ingredient of which is anisodamine, is a listed drug for improving microcirculation in China. Anisodamine can improve the condition of patients with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Protein-protein interactions obtained from the String databases were used to construct the protein interaction network (PIN) of AHI using Cytoscape. The crucial targets of AHI PIN were screened by calculating three topological parameters. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were performed. The intersection between the AHI component proteins and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) coexpression proteins was analyzed. We further investigated our predictions of crucial targets by performing molecular docking studies with anisodamine. Results: The PIN of AHI, including 172 nodes and 1454 interactions, was constructed. A total of 54 crucial targets were obtained based on topological feature calculations. The results of Gene Ontology showed that AHI could regulate cell death, cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, and immune system processes. KEGG disease pathways were mainly enriched in viral infections, cancer, and immune system diseases. Between AHI targets and ACE2 coexpression proteins, 26 common proteins were obtained. The results of molecular docking showed that anisodamine bound well to all the crucial targets. Conclusion: The network pharmacological strategy integrated molecular docking to explore the mechanism of action of AHI against COVID-19. It provides protein targets associated with COVID-19 that may be further tested as therapeutic targets of anisodamine.","output":"Network Pharmacology Integrated Molecular Docking Reveals the Mechanism of Anisodamine Hydrobromide Injection against Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Decellularized nerve extracellular matrix (NECM) composited with chitosan are moldable materials suitable for spinal cord repair. But the rapid biodegradation of the materials may interrupt neural tissue reconstruction in vivo. To improve the stability of the materials, the materials produced by NECM and chitosan hydrogels were crosslinked by genipine, glutaraldehyde or ultraviolet ray. Physicochemical property, degradation and biocompatibility of materials crosslinked by genipin, glutaraldehyde or ultraviolet ray were evaluated. The scaffold crosslinked by genipin possessed a porous structure, and the porosity ratio was 89.07 + 4.90%, the average diameter of pore was 85.32 + 5.34 m. The crosslinked degree of the scaffold crosslinked by genipin and glutaraldehyde was 75.13  4.87%, 71.25  5.06% respectively; Uncrosslinked scaffold disintegrated when immerged in distilled water while the scaffold crosslinked by genipin and glutaraldehyde group retained their integrity. The scaffold crosslinked by genipin has better water absorption, water retention and anti-enzymatic hydrolysis ability than the other three groups. Cell cytotoxicity showed that the cytotoxicity of scaffold crosslinked by genipin was lower than that crosslinked by glutaraldehyde. The histocompatibility of scaffold crosslinked by genipin was also better than glutaraldehyde group. More cells grew well in the scaffold crosslinked by genipin when co-cultured with L929 cells.

By way of exploring and operationalizing disease forecasting, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has hosted FluSight since the 2013/14 flu season, an annual flu forecasting challenge. Since FluSights onset, forecasters have developed and improved forecasting models in an effort to provide more timely, reliable, and accurate information about the likely progression of the outbreak. While improving the predictive performance of these forecasting models is often the primary objective, it is also important for a forecasting model to run quickly, facilitating further model development and improvement while providing flexibility when deployed in a real-time setting. In this vein I introduce Inferno, a fast and accurate flu forecasting model inspired by Dante, the top performing model in the 2018/19 FluSight challenge. When pseudoprospectively compared to all models that participated in FluSight 2018/19, Inferno would have placed 2nd in the national and regional challenge as well as the state challenge, behind only Dante. Inferno, however, runs in minutes and is trivially parallelizable, while Dante takes hours to run, representing a significant operational improvement with minimal impact to performance.

A total of 185 WWTPs inflow samples were collected over the period consisting of both the first wave (mid-March to June) and the second wave (July to November). Concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (N1 and N2 assays) were quantified in these wastewaters as well as those of Human adenoviruses (HAdV) and JC polyomavirus (JCPyV), as indicators of human faecal contamination. SARS-CoV-2 N gene daily loads strongly correlated with the number of cases diagnosed one week after sampling i.e. wastewater levels were a good predictor of cases to be diagnosed in the immediate future. The conditions present at small WWTPs relative to larger WWTPs influence the ability to follow the pandemic. Small WWTPs (<24,000 inhabitants) had lower median loads of SARS-CoV-2 despite similar incidence of infection within the municipalities served by the different WWTP (but not lower loads of HAdV and JCPyV).

As both infections are deemed to share similarities at presentation, it would be useful to distinguish COVID-19 from dengue in the context of co-epidemics. Hence, we performed a retrospective cohort study to identify predictors of both infections. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: All the subjects suspected of COVID-19 between March 23 and May 10, 2020, were screened for COVID-19 within the testing center of the University hospital of Saint-Pierre, Reunion island. The screening consisted in a questionnaire surveyed in face-to-face, a nasopharyngeal swab specimen for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain-reaction and a rapid diagnostic orientation test for dengue. Factors independently associated with COVID-19 or with dengue were sought using multinomial logistic regression models, taking other febrile illnesses (OFIs) as controls. Adjusted Odds ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95%CI) were assessed. Over a two-month study period, we diagnosed 80 COVID-19, 61 non-severe dengue and 872 OFIs cases eligible to multivariate analysis. Among these, we identified delayed presentation (>3 days) since symptom onset (Odds ratio 1.91, 95% confidence interval 1.07-3.39), contact with a COVID-19 positive case (OR 3.81, 95%CI 2.21-6.55) and anosmia (OR 7.80, 95%CI 4.20-14.49) as independent predictors of COVID-19, body ache (OR 6.17, 95%CI 2.69-14.14), headache (OR 5.03, 95%CI 1.88-13.44) and retro-orbital pain (OR 5.55, 95%CI 2.51-12.28) as independent predictors of dengue, while smoking was less likely observed with COVID-19 (OR 0.27, 95%CI 0.09-0.79) and upper respiratory tract infection symptoms were associated with OFIs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although prone to potential biases, these data suggest that non-severe dengue may be more symptomatic than COVID-19 in a co-epidemic setting with higher dengue attack rates. At clinical presentation, nine basic clinical and epidemiological indicators may help to distinguish COVID-19 or dengue from each other and other febrile illnesses.","output":"Distinguishing non severe cases of dengue from COVID-19 in the context of co-epidemics: A cohort study in a SARS-CoV-2 testing center on Reunion island"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recommendation systems play an important role in e-commerce turnover by presenting personalized recommendations. Due to the vast amount of marketing content online, users are less susceptible to these suggestions. In addition to the accuracy of a recommendation, its presentation, layout, and other visual aspects can improve its effectiveness. This study evaluates the visual aspects of recommender interfaces. Vertical and horizontal recommendation layouts are tested, along with different visual intensity levels of item presentation, and conclusions obtained with a number of popular machine learning methods are discussed. Results from the implicit feedback study of the effectiveness of recommending interfaces for four major e-commerce websites are presented. Two different methods of observing user behavior were used, i.e., eye-tracking and document object model (DOM) implicit event tracking in the browser, which allowed collecting a large amount of data related to user activity and physical parameters of recommending interfaces. Results have been analyzed in order to compare the reliability and applicability of both methods. Observations made with eye tracking and event tracking led to similar results regarding recommendation interface evaluation. In general, vertical interfaces showed higher effectiveness compared to horizontal ones, with the first and second positions working best, and the worse performance of horizontal interfaces probably being connected with banner blindness.

As history would have it, economic cooperation within the CA region was previ-ously limited, and investments in Central Asia were mainly concentrated in the mining sector of the economy. Demographic and economic trends in the region have led to an expansion of the internal market;most Central Asian states have implemented wide-ranging reforms, which have improved the overall investment climate;and the CA states have stepped up the development of multilateral trade and economic relations, laying the groundwork for broader coopera-tion. The article also covers recent problems related to the economic situation in the re-gion. For example, the current situation as-sociated with COVID-19 has had an impact on economic relations between the CA coun-tries. In the view of international experts, this crisis has not provided any new reasons for integration in the region. The quarantine measures taken in various Central Asian countries have had a negative effect on their foreign trade and thus on intra-regional trade and economic cooperation in general. The authors also examine other prob-lems, such as those caused by the CA coun-tries economic dependence on other coun-tries, namely their dependence on imports from outside the region. These problems also affect the prospects of economic cooperation in Central Asia. All countries, including those rich in natural resources, want to produce and ex-port finished goods with high value added. The production of high value added products and services enables a country to earn more revenue and reduce its dependence on primary commodity exports. The Central Asian countries are no exception. But for many reasons their finished products are of-ten insufficiently competitive in countries outside the region. Despite the existence of economic problems connected with the need to im-prove the economic aspects of cooperation, there is a clear trend towards diversification of the economy of the CA countries caused by a desire to develop various specializa-tions. These include agricultural processing, production of consumer goods for the popu-lation, development of the service sector, and other areas. Thus, the choice of a new model for the development of multilateral relations and the emerging trend towards economic growth in the region have made it possible to lay the foundation for long-term cooperation among the Central Asian states. ? 2021, CA and C Press AB.

It develops an intellectual history of the norm development of digital sovereignty, roughly following Finnemore and Sikkinks three stages model. The first phase of norm emergence lasts from the 1990s and the Patriot Act in 2001 to Russias laws on internet control in 2012. During this phase of the USs largely uncontested digital hegemony, China is the prime norm entrepreneur of digital sovereignty, promoting Ȩ (lit. network sovereignty). The second phase of norm cascade begins with the Snowden revelations in 2013. This phase is characterized by an increasingly multipolar order. During this phase, the EU adopts a notion of digital sovereignty with a focus on economic aspects. And Russias notion of ӧ֧֧ߧߧ ڧߧ֧ߧ֧ (lit. sovereign internet) is becoming increasingly radicalized. In Russia and France, illiberal accounts of digital sovereignty are supported by Carl Schmitts geopolitical theories. From 2016 to 2020, the US and the EU undergo a phase of norm universalization. Triggered by Russias interference with the US general election and Brexit in 2016, these countries and regions become aware that their political systems are vulnerable to manipulation. The COVID-crisis initiates the fourth and last stage of the norm development cycle, the stage of internalization. Processes of digital sovereignty are increasingly implemented, respectively they emerge in a bottom-up manner, with civil society playing an increasingly important role. However, this turn also makes clear that digital sovereignty in liberal societies is strongly characterized, respectively limited by the power of the private sector and restrictions on governmental power, such as federalism.","output":"The COVID-Crisis as Catalyst for the Norm Development of Digital Sovereignty.

Described using the Wilkins modification of the Gartland Classification system, current practice guidelines give moderate evidence for closed reduction and percutaneous pinning of type 2 and 3 injuries, but little evidence exists regarding the appropriate surgical setting for fixation. The goal of this study was to evaluate the perioperative complication profile of type 3 fractures with maintained metaphyseal contact and determine their suitability for outpatient surgery. METHODS Skeletally immature patients with type 2 and 3 SCH fractures treated at a single, Level-1 trauma institution from March 2019 to January 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 1126 subjects were identified. Open, concomitant injuries, incomplete physical examination, initial neurovascular compromise, flexion-type fractures, ecchymosis, skin compromise, and those managed nonoperatively were excluded. Type 3 fractures were categorized as either \\"3M\\" versus type \\"3\\" (\\"M\\" denoting metaphyseal bony contact). Demographic data, neurovascular changes, and postoperative complications were collected. Categorical variables were evaluated using 2 or Fisher exact tests, and continuous variables analyzed using analysis of variance, with significance defined as a P-value <0.05. RESULTS A total of 485 patients (189 type 2, 164 type 3M, 132 type 3) met inclusion criteria. Sex and length of stay did not differ among groups. The incidence of neurovascular change between initial presentation and surgical fixation was significantly greater for type 3 fractures compared with other groups (P=0.02). No child in the 3M group had preoperative neurovascular examination changes, compared with 3 patients with type 3 injuries. When directly compared with the 3M group, type 3 fractures had a higher incidence of neurovascular examination changes that trended towards significance (P=0.08). There was no difference in postoperative complication rate between groups (P=0.61). CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate that Gartland type 3 SCH fractures lacking metaphyseal bony contact, compared with types 3M and 2, are more likely to experience neurovascular examination changes between initial presentation and definitive surgical fixation. Type 3M fractures clinically behaved like type 2 injuries and, accordingly, could be considered for treatment on an outpatient basis.

Structured sampling was used to recruit walking pilgrims. A questionnaire asked about respiratory symptoms, risk, and preventive factors, including hygiene-related resources of toilet facilities. The commonest symptom reported by the 1842 participants (63.3% male, 36.7% female) was cough (25.6%). Eating in mawkibs (rest areas) with indoor kitchens and drinking only packaged water were associated with lower risk of cough (AOR = 0.72, CI = 0.56C0.94; AOR = 0.60; CI = 0.45C0.78, p < 0.05).

This inherent feature often leads to altered virulence, infectivity and transmissibility as well as antigenic shift to escape host immunity, which might compromise the efficacy of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Therefore, we aimed at genome-wide analyses of circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses for the emergence of novel co-existing mutations and trace their spatial distribution within India. Comprehensive analysis of whole genome sequences of 441 Indian SARS-CoV-2 strains revealed the occurrence of 33 different mutations, 21 being distinctive to India. Emergence of novel mutations were observed in S glycoprotein (7/33), NSP3 (6/33), RdRp/NSP12 (4/33), NSP2 (2/33) and N (2/33). Non-synonymous mutations were found to be 3.4 times more prevalent than synonymous mutations. We classified the Indian isolates into 22 groups based on the co-existing mutations. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that representative strain of each group divided themselves into various sub-clades within their respective clades, based on the presence of unique co-existing mutations. India was dominated by A2a clade (55.60%) followed by A3 (37.38%) and B (7%), but exhibited heterogeneous distribution among various geographical regions. The A2a clade mostly predominated in East India, Western India and Central India, whereas A3 clade prevailed in South and North India.

METHODS: Participants enrolled in the Progression of Diabetic Complications (PREDICT) cohort study in Melbourne, Australia (n=489 with a baseline assessment pre-2020) were invited to complete a phone/online follow-up assessment in mid-2020 (i.e. amidst COVID-19 lockdown restrictions). Repeated assessments that were compared with pre-COVID-19 baseline levels included anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), depressive symptoms (PHQ-8), diabetes distress (PAID), physical activity/sedentary behaviour, alcohol consumption, and diabetes self-management behaviours. Additional once-off measures at follow-up included COVID-19-specific worry, quality of life (QoL), and healthcare appointment changes (telehealth engagement and appointment cancellations/avoidance). RESULTS: Among 470 respondents (96%; aged 669 years, 69% men), at least 'moderate' worry about COVID-19 infection was reported by 31%, and 29-73% reported negative impacts on QoL dimensions (greatest for: leisure activities, feelings about the future, emotional wellbeing). Younger participants reported more negative impacts (P<0.05). Overall, anxiety/depressive symptoms were similar at follow-up compared with pre-COVID-19, but diabetes distress reduced (P<0.001). Worse trajectories of anxiety/depressive symptoms were observed among those who reported COVID-19-specific worry, or negative QoL impacts (P<0.05).

Patients clinical course and outcomes, including in-hospital mortality, were compared on the basis of the results of COVID-19 status (positive or negative). The cohort included 1533 patients admitted with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), of whom 86 had confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, during the study period. COVID-19-positive patients were older and non-White and had more co-morbidities. Furthermore, inflammatory markers and N-terminal-proB-type-natriuretic peptide were higher in COVID-19-positive AMI patients. Only 20.0% (17) of COVID-19-positive patients underwent coronary angiography. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in AMI patients with concomitant COVID-19-positive status (27.9%) than in patients without COVID-19 during the same period (3.7%; p<0.001).

Materials and Methods: All patients were classified according to Dumontiers radiological classification and compared with the surgical findings. Based on this analysis, a new classification and treatment are proposed. Results: From 1995 to 2018, 40 patients with radiocarpal fracture dislocation underwent surgery. Thirty-six were males and four were females. The mean age was twenty-four years (range: 18-45). Three dislocations were volar dislocations and 37 were displaced dorsally. Initially, 8 (20%) patients were classified as group I, 29 (72.5%) as group II, and 3 (7.5%) remained unclassified. The main variations occurred in group II. Seven fractures were stable after radial styloid fixation and 6 remained unstable. Sixteen fractures presented articular fragments or an interposed capsule, which prevented anatomical reduction using conservative maneuvers. Conclusion: Based in our intraoperative observations and surgical results, we believe that a more detailed classification should be adopted.

In the context of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the ability to deliver timely and efficacious care must be balanced with the risk of infectious exposure to the clinical team. Furthermore, rapid and effective stroke care remains paramount to achieve maximal functional recovery for those needing admission and to triage care appropriately for those who may be presenting with neurological symptoms but have an alternative diagnosis. METHODS: Available resources, COVID-19-specific infection prevention and control recommendations, and expert consensus were used to identify clinical screening criteria for patients and provide the required nuanced considerations for the healthcare team, thereby modifying the conventional code stroke processes to achieve a protected designation. RESULTS: A protected code stroke algorithm was developed. Features specific to prenotification and clinical status of the patient were used to define precode screening. These include primary infectious symptoms, clinical, and examination features. A focused framework was then developed with regard to a protected code stroke. We outline the specifics of personal protective equipment use and considerations thereof including aspects of crisis resource management impacting team role designation and human performance factors during a protected code stroke. CONCLUSIONS: We introduce the concept of a protected code stroke during a pandemic, as in the case of COVID-19, and provide a framework for key considerations including screening, personal protective equipment, and crisis resource management.

Preparedness and reorganization ahead of the wave to increase ICU surge capacity may be associated with favorable outcome. The purpose of this study was to report our experience in terms of ICU organization and anticipation, as well as reporting patient characteristics, treatment, and outcomes. Design: A prospective observational study. Setting: The division of intensive care at the Geneva University Hospitals (Geneva, Switzerland). Patients: All consecutive adult patients with acute respiratory failure due to coronavirus disease 2019 admitted in the ICU between March 9, 2020, and May 19, 2020, were enrolled. Patients' demographic data, comorbidities, laboratory values, treatments, and clinical outcomes were collected. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: The ICU was reorganized into cells of six to eight patients under the care of three physicians and five nurses. Its capacity increased from 30 to 110 beds, fully equipped and staffed, transforming the surgical intermediate care unit, the postoperative care facility, and operating theaters into ICUs. Surge capacity has always exceeded the number of patients hospitalized. Among 129 critically ill patients with severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, 96% required invasive mechanical ventilation. A total of 105 patients (81%) were discharged alive and 24 died, corresponding to a mortality of 19%. Patients who died were significantly older, with higher severity scores at admission, had higher levels of d-dimers, plasma creatinine, high-sensitive troponin T, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin, and required more frequent prone sessions. Conclusions: A rapid increase in ICU bed capacity, including adequate equipment and staffing, allowed for a large number of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients to be taken care of within a short period of time. Anticipation and preparedness ahead of the wave may account for the low mortality observed in our center.

METHODS: The interventional study was conducted in a teaching hospital in Malaysia. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants from surgical, intensive care, and other units. Thirty-six health professionals in the experimental and forty in the control group completed the study. All subjects participated in an interactive lecture and demonstrated four IPSS on HAIC i.e. (i) taking blood specimen (ii) bedsore dressing (iii) collecting sputum for acid-fast bacilli and (iv) intermittent bladder catheterization. Each team consisted of a doctor and a nurse. A self-administered questionnaire on KAP on HAIC was completed by respondents during the pre-, immediately and, post-intervention. An independent t-test was conducted to measure the significance between the experimental and control group. RESULTS: The mean scores for KAP among the experimental group increased following the intervention. Significant differences in scores were seen between the two groups post-intervention (p < 0.05). Overall, using the four procedures as surrogates, the interprofessional learning approach in HAIC intervention showed improvement among the participants in the experimental group following structured instructions. The IPSS approach in HAIC clearly shows its relevance in improving learning outcomes.

Accumulated evidence suggests that aquaculture pathogens can facilitate the horizontal transfer of plasmid-mediated ARGs. However, the role of Edwardsiella piscicida (E. piscicida) in ARG dissemination is still not fully understood. In addition, the potential impact of triclosan (TCS) on the spread of ARGs mediated by E. piscicida is still unknown, so a mating model system was established to investigate the transfer process of ARGs. The results showed that E. piscicida disseminated ARGs on RP4 by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Furthermore, TCS exposure promoted this process. The conjugative transfer frequencies were enhanced approximately 1.2C1.4-fold by TCS at concentrations from 2 to 20 g/L, when compared with the control. TCS promoted the HGT of ARGs by stimulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, increasing cell membrane permeability, and altering expressions of conjugative transferCassociated genes. Together, the results suggested that aquaculture pathogens spread ARGs and that the emerging contaminant TCS enhanced the transfer of ARGs between bacteria.

The outcome in different inborn errors of immunity (IEI) is still a matter of debate. In this retrospective study, we describe the experience of the of the Italian Primary Immunodeficiencies Network (IPINet). Sixteen reference centers for adult or pediatric IEI were involved. One hundred fourteen patients were enrolled including 35 pediatric and 79 adult patients. Median age was 32 years, and male-to-female ratio was 1.5:1. The most common IEI were 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in children (26%) and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) in adults (65%). Ninety-one patients did not require hospital admission, and among these, 33 were asymptomatic. Hospitalization rate was 20.17%. Older age (p 0.004) and chronic lung disease (p 0.0008) represented risk factors for hospitalization. Hospitalized patients mainly included adults suffering from humoral immunodeficiencies requiring immunoglobulin replacement therapy and as expected had lower B cell counts compared to non-hospitalized patients. Infection fatality rate in the whole cohort was 3.5%. Seroconversion was observed is 86.6% of the patients evaluated and in 83.3% of CVID patients. 16.85% of the patients reported long-lasting COVID symptoms. All but one patient with prolonged symptoms were under IgRT. The fatality rate observed in IEI was slightly similar to the general population. The age of the patients who did not survive was lower compared to the general population, and the age stratified mortality in the 50C60 age range considerable exceeded the mortality from 50 to 60 age group of the Italian population (14.3 vs 0.6%; p < 0.0001). We hypothesize that this is due to the fact that comorbidities in IEI patients are very common and usually appear early in life.

METHODS: Between 18 January 2020 and 20 May 2020, 110 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 108 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients were retrospectively recruited from three hospitals based on the inclusion criteria. Manual segmentation of pneumonia lesions on CT scans was performed by four radiologists. The latest version of Pyradiomics was used for feature extraction. Four classifiers (linear classifier, k-nearest neighbour, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [LASSO], and random forest) were used to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. Comparison of the performance of the classifiers and radiologists was evaluated by ROC curve and Kappa score. RESULTS: We manually segmented 16,053 CT slices, comprising 32,625 pneumonia lesions, from the CT scans of all patients. Using Pyradiomics, 120 radiomic features were extracted from each image. The key radiomic features screened by different classifiers varied and lead to significant differences in classification accuracy. The LASSO achieved the best performance (sensitivity: 72.2%, specificity: 75.1%, and AUC: 0.81) on the external validation dataset and attained excellent agreement (Kappa score: 0.89) with radiologists (average sensitivity: 75.6%, specificity: 78.2%, and AUC: 0.81).

Seaweeds are a rich source of essential nutrients and bioactive substances, including polysaccharides and trace elements. Seaweeds also have prebiotic properties that help birds perform better and could be utilised instead of antibiotics. Only a few studies have examined the effect of brown seaweed (Sargassum siliquastrum) supplementation on bird performance, but to our knowledge, there have been no studies regarding the effect of S. siliquastrum supplementation on the birds cecal fermentation and microbial populations. Hence, this research aimed to evaluate the impact of S. siliquastrum supplementation on performance, cecal fermentation, and microbial populations, as well as on the immunological response in Japanese quails. The results indicated that the studied S. siliquastrum supplement improved the performance, cecal fermentation, microbial populations, intestinal morphology, and immunological response in Japanese quails. Hence, this research implies that a dietary S. siliquastrum supplement for quails could be a viable feed additive alternative. ABSTRACT: This study aimed to investigate the dietary effects of Sargassum siliquastrum on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, cecal fermentation, microbial populations, antioxidant status, immune response, and intestine histomorphology of Japanese quails. A total of 450 Japanese quails, aged 7 days, weighing 27.35  0.23 g, were randomly distributed to three dietary groups in a 42-day feeding experiment. Five replicates were prepared per group, with each replicate consisting of 30 chicks in a cage. The three dietary groups consisted of a basal diet (0% supplementation, which was the control) and diets supplemented with 1% and 2% of S. siliquastrum. The results showed that the S. siliquastrum-supplemented groups and the control group had similar final body weight (FBW), average body gain (ADG), and average feed intake (ADFI). However, the S. siliquastrum-supplemented groups had a better feed conversion ratio (FCR), as well as a lower mortality rate, compared to the control group. S. siliquastrum supplementation improved the nutrient digestibility of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), and crude fiber (CF) (p < 0.05). The S. siliquastrum-supplemented groups exhibited the heaviest empty intestine and cecum weights, as well as the longest intestinal and cecal length. Furthermore, the total volatile fatty acid (VFA) and the propionic acid concentrations increased significantly in quails fed S. siliquastrum-supplemented diets (p < 0.05), although the concentration of NH(3)-N decreased (p < 0.05). The dietary inclusion of S. siliquastrum had a beneficial effect on cecal microbial populations, where the Lactobacillus sp. counts increased, and the E. coli and Clostridium perfringens counts decreased. The histopathological examination of the duodenum confirmed that S. siliquastrum dietary supplementation enhanced the height and width of the villi. Quails fed S. siliquastrum-supplemented diet exhibited the highest total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase activities, but the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance was decreased (p < 0.05). Serum IgA, IgG, and IgM concentrations increased considerably (p < 0.05) in S. siliquastrum-supplemented groups. In conclusion, S. siliquastrum supplementation in the diet of Japanese quail can provide beneficial effects on performance, cecal fermentation, beneficial bacteria populations, and the immune response, and could be considered as an alternative feed additive in poultry production.","output":"The Effect of Sargassum siliquastrum Supplementation on Growth Performance, Cecal Fermentation, Intestine Histomorphology, and Immune Response of Japanese Quails"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When the COVID-19 pandemic began, in early 2020, lockdowns limited the options for physical intimacy and many resorted to technology-mediated forms of intimacy such as sexting.

We further examined an interaction of COVID-19-related social isolation and privacy concerns on willingness to engage in sexting. We conducted online surveys with 494 young adults (Study 1) and with a quota-based sample of 437 adults (Study 2) in Austria. In both studies, negative binomial regressions revealed a positive effect of COVID-19-related social isolation on willingness to engage in sexting. Privacy concerns hindered young adults in Study 1 from engaging in sexting but not relatively older adults in Study 2. However, in neither study did privacy concerns moderate the effect of COVID-19-related social isolation on willingness to engage in sexting: Even individuals with high privacy concerns were more willing to sext under conditions of social isolation, suggesting that the need for intimacy outweighed the need for privacy protection.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of colonic ESD in a porcine model using a novel endoscopic surgical platform, the Anubiscope (Karl Storz, Tttlingen, Germany), equipped with two working channels for surgical instruments with four degrees of freedom offering surgical triangulation. METHODS Nine ESDs were performed by a surgeon without any ESD experience in three swine, at 25, 15, and 10 cm above the anal verge with the Anubiscope. Sixteen ESDs were performed by an experienced endoscopist in five swine using conventional endoscopic instruments. Major ESD steps included the following for both groups: scoring the area, submucosal injection of glycerol, precut, and submucosal dissection. Outcomes measured were as follows: dissection time and speed, specimen size, en bloc dissection, and complications. RESULTS No perforations occurred in the Anubis group, while there were eight perforations (50 %) in the conventional group (p = 0.02). Complete and en bloc dissections were achieved in all cases in the Anubis group. Mean dissection time for completed cases was statistically significantly shorter in the Anubis group (32.3  16.1 vs. 55.87  7.66 min; p = 0.0019). Mean specimen size was higher in the conventional group (1321  230 vs. 927.77  229.96 mm(2); p = 0.003), but mean dissection speed was similar (35.95  18.93 vs. 23.98  5.02 mm(2)/min in the Anubis and conventional groups, respectively; p = 0.1).

PURPOSE: To explore the effect of this lockdown on data transmitted by remote monitoring (RM) of implantable cardioverter and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators (ICDs/CRT-Ds). METHODS: RM daily transmissions from ICDs and CRT-Ds were analyzed and compared in two consecutive 1-month frames pre- and post-lockdown: Period I (7 FebruaryC7 March 2020) and Period II (8 MarchC7 April 2020). RESULTS: The study cohort included 180 patients (81.1% male, 63.3% ICDs and 36.7% CRT-Ds) with a median age of 70 (interquartile range 62-78) years. The median value of physical activity provided by accelerometric sensors showed a significant reduction between Period I and II (13.1% [8.2-18.1%] versus 9.4% [6.3-13.8%], p < 0.001]. Eighty-nine percent of patients decreased their activity, for 43.3% the relative reduction was 25%. The mean heart rate decreased significantly (69.2 [63.8-75.6] bpm vs 67.9 [62.7- 75.3] bpm, p < 0.001), but with greater reduction (3 beats/minute) in patients aged < 70 years. Resting heart rate and thoracic impedance showed minor variations. No differences were observed in device pacing percentages and arrhythmias.

However, finite data volumes lead to uncertainty over parameter estimates, which in turn gives rise to mis-estimation risk of financial liabilities. Mis-estimation risk can be assessed on a run-off basis by valuing the liabilities with alternative parameter vectors consistent with the covariance matrix. This run-off approach is especially suitable for tasks like pricing portfolio transactions, such as bulk annuities, longevity swaps or reinsurance treaties. However, a run-off approach does not fully meet the requirements of regulatory regimes that view capital requirements through the prism of a finite horizon, such as Solvency IIs one-year approach. This paper presents a methodology for viewing mis-estimation risk over a fixed time frame, and results are given for a specimen portfolio. As expected, we find that time-limited mis-estimation capital requirements increase as the horizon is lengthened or the discount rate is reduced. However, we find that much of the so-called mis-estimation risk in a one-year value-at-risk assessment can actually be driven by idiosyncratic variation, rather than parameter uncertainty. This counter-intuitive result stems from trying to view a long-term risk through a short-term window. As a result, value-at-risk mis-estimation reserves are strongly correlated with idiosyncratic risk. We also find that parsimonious models tend to produce lower mis-estimation risk than less-parsimonious ones.","output":"A value-at-risk approach to mis-estimation risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effects of mental health interventions among people hospitalized with COVID-19.

Hence, their presence can have significant impacts on the properties of devices. Although it is well accepted that the properties of defects are determined by their unique atomic environments, the precise knowledge of such relationships is far from clear for most oxides because of the complexity of defects and difficulties in characterization. Here, we fabricate a 36.8 SrRuO3 grain boundary of which the transport measurements show a spin-valve magnetoresistance. We identify its atomic arrangement, including oxygen, using scanning transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy. Based on the as-obtained atomic structure, the density functional theory calculations suggest that the spin-valve magnetoresistance occurs because of dramatically reduced magnetic moments at the boundary. The ability to manipulate magnetic properties at the nanometer scale via defect control allows new strategies to design magnetic/electronic devices with low-dimensional magnetic order.","output":"Atomic origin of spin-valve magnetoresistance at the SrRuO3 grain boundary"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused disruptions to healthcare systems and endangered the control and prevention of tuberculosis (TB). We investigated the nationwide effects of COVID-19 on the national Public-Private Mix (PPM) TB control project in Korea, using monitoring indicators from the Korean PPM monitoring database. METHODS: The Korean PPM monitoring database includes data from patients registered at PPM hospitals throughout the country. Data of six monitoring indicators for active TB cases updated between July 2019 and June 2020 were collected. The data of each cohort throughout the country and in Daegu-Gyeongbuk, Seoul Metropolitan Area, and Jeonnam-Jeonbuk were collated to provide nationwide data. The data were compared using the (2) test for trend to evaluate quarterly trends of each monitoring indicator at the national level and in the prespecified regions. RESULTS: Test coverages of sputum smear (P = 0.622) and culture (P = 0.815), drug susceptibility test (P = 0.750), and adherence rate to initial standard treatment (P = 0.901) at the national level were not significantly different during the study period. The rate of loss to follow-up among TB cases at the national level was not significantly different (P = 0.088); however, the treatment success rate among the smear-positive drug-susceptible pulmonary TB cohort at the national level significantly decreased, from 90.6% to 84.1% (P < 0.001). Treatment success rate in the Seoul metropolitan area also significantly decreased during the study period, from 89.4% to 84.5% (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that initial TB management during the COVID-19 pandemic was properly administered under the PPM project in Korea. However, our study cannot confirm or conclude a decreased treatment success rate after the COVID-19 pandemic due to limited data.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on the National PPM Tuberculosis Control Project in Korea: the Korean PPM Monitoring Database between July 2019 and June 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The demographics, angiographic findings, and in-hospital outcomes of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) C positive patients undergoing an invasive strategy for suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are not well defined COVID-19Cpositive ACS patients may have different etiology and outcomes Patient presentation times from small sample published data appear longer Methods: Anonymized data on 234 patients in 81 global centers are presented from this prospective registry for the period March 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020 As of submission date, a further 84 patients have been submitted All were required to be COVID-19Cpositive (or have a high index of clinical suspicion, i e , clinical status plus chest x ray/computed tomography scan findings) and to undergo coronary angiography for suspected ACS Results: Results are shown in Tables 1C3 and compared with National United Kingdom British Cardiovascular Intervention Society/Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project databases of nonCCOVID-19 ACS patients where available and appropriate Major findings were: significantly higher proportion of COVID-19Cpositive patients had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and renal dysfunction In the ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) subgroup, symptom-to-door time was &gt;double and door-to-balloon increased by median 20 minutes Mortality was quadruple and in-patient stay double in this group Similarly, mortality was significantly higher in non-STEMI COVID-19Cpositive cohort and in-patient stay also double The high mortality may be due to the high incidence of cardiogenic shock (13 4% vs 5%), with its 67% mortality [Formula presented] Conclusion: These novel data indicate that COVID-19Cpositive ACS patients present later, have higher incidence of cardiogenic shock, and much higher mortality, which are likely to be inter-related In-patient stay is prolonged compared to nonCCOVID-19 ACS Categories: CORONARY: Acute Coronary Syndromes","output":"TCT CONNECT-215 Demographics and In-Hospital Outcomes of COVID-19 Patients Undergoing an Invasive Strategy for Acute Coronary Syndrome: The Global Multi-Centre Prospective COVID-ACS Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early risk assessments and interventions for metabolic syndrome (MetS) are limited because of a lack of effective biomarkers.

Vulnerable nursing home residents are at high risk for adverse outcomes, but improved understanding is needed to identify risk factors for mortality among nursing home residents. Objective To identify risk factors for 30-day all-cause mortality among US nursing home residents with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study was conducted at 351 US nursing homes among 5256 nursing home residents with COVID-19-related symptoms who had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing between March 16 and September 15, 2020. Exposures Resident-level characteristics, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, symptoms, chronic conditions, and physical and cognitive function. Main Outcomes and Measures Death due to any cause within 30 days of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Results The study included 5256 nursing home residents (3185 women [61%]; median age, 79 years [interquartile range, 69-88 years]; and 3741 White residents [71%], 909 Black residents [17%], and 586 individuals of other races/ethnicities [11%]) with COVID-19. Compared with residents aged 75 to 79 years, the odds of death were 1.46 (95% CI, 1.14-1.86) times higher for residents aged 80 to 84 years, 1.59 (95% CI, 1.25-2.03) times higher for residents aged 85 to 89 years, and 2.14 (95% CI, 1.70-2.69) times higher for residents aged 90 years or older. Women had lower risk for 30-day mortality than men (odds ratio [OR], 0.69 [95% CI, 0.60-0.80]). Two comorbidities were associated with mortality: diabetes (OR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.05-1.40]) and chronic kidney disease (OR, 1.33 [95%, 1.11-1.61]). Fever (OR, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.41-1.96]), shortness of breath (OR, 2.52 [95% CI, 2.00-3.16]), tachycardia (OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.04-1.64]), and hypoxia (OR, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.68-2.50]) were also associated with increased risk of 30-day mortality. Compared with cognitively intact residents, the odds of death among residents with moderate cognitive impairment were 2.09 (95% CI, 1.68-2.59) times higher, and the odds of death among residents with severe cognitive impairment were 2.79 (95% CI, 2.14-3.66) times higher. Compared with residents with no or limited impairment in physical function, the odds of death among residents with moderate impairment were 1.49 (95% CI, 1.18-1.88) times higher, and the odds of death among residents with severe impairment were 1.64 (95% CI, 1.30-2.08) times higher. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study of US nursing home residents with COVID-19, increased age, male sex, and impaired cognitive and physical function were independently associated with mortality.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether spirituality plays an important role in the well-being of US plastic surgeons and residents, and whether spirituality is viewed as an important component of patient care. METHODS: An anonymous and voluntary email survey was distributed to 3375 members of ASPS during the months of April through June of 2020. The survey distribution included 2230 active members of ASPS and 1149 resident members, all who practice or train within the United States. The survey consisted of 18 multiple-choice questions with answer choices based on a descriptive five-point Likert scale and ranking by priority. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using StataCorp 2019 software. RESULTS: A total of 431 completed surveys were received for a response rate of 12.7%. The majority of participants (70%) reported that personal spiritual beliefs and faith contribute positively to emotional well-being. In total, 65% agreed or strongly agreed that their spiritual beliefs provide a healthy framework for handling conflict, suffering, and loss. More than half (51%) reported that as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic, their spiritual beliefs and practices have provided increased support and guidance. CONCLUSIONS: Spirituality is an important component of maintaining wellness for plastic surgeons, and spirituality is recognized by plastic surgeons as an important aspect of the healing process for patients.

The simulations reveal the efficient blocking of ACE2 by caffeine and nicotine in the exposure to the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have selected the two most important active sites of ACE2-S protein, i.e., 6LZG and 6VW1, which are critically responsible in the interaction of S protein to the receptor and thus, we investigated their interaction with nicotine and caffeine through MD simulations. Caffeine and nicotine are interesting structures for interactions because of their similar structure to the candidate antiviral drugs. Our results reveal that caffeine or nicotine in a specific molar ratio to 6LZG shows a very strong interaction and indicate that caffeine is more efficient in the interaction with 6LZG and further blocking of this site against S protein binding. Further, we investigated the interaction of ACE2 receptor- S protein with nicotine or caffeine when mixed with candidate or approved antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 therapy. Our MD simulations suggest that the combination of caffeine with ribavirin shows a stronger interaction with 6VW1, while in case of favipiravir+nicotine, 6LZG shows potent efficacy of these interaction, proposing the potent efficacy of these combinations for blocking ACE2 receptor against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"In silico Investigation on the Inhibiting Role of Nicotine/Caffeine by Blocking the S Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Versus ACE2 Receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose As of December 21, 2020, a total of 77,670,400 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been confirmed worldwide, 53,825,243 cases have been cured and 1,693,253 cases have died.

Secondary outcome measures were tumor conference volume, operative volume, and outpatient patient procedure and clinic volumes. SETTING: This single-center study was conducted at a tertiary care academic hospital in a large metropolitan area. METHODS: The study included a consecutive sample of adult subjects who were presented at a head and neck interdepartmental tumor conference during the study period. Patients were compared to historical controls based on review of operative data, outpatient procedures, and clinic volumes. RESULTS: In total, 117 patients were presented during the review period in 2020, compared to 69 in 2019. There was an 8.4% treatment modification rate among cases presented at the tumor conference. There was a 61.3% (347 from 898) reduction in outpatient clinic visits and a 63.4% (84 from 230) reduction in procedural volume compared to the prior year.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Among adult volunteers, do either cloth masks or surgical masks impair oxygenation or ventilation either at rest or during physical activity? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: With IRB approval and informed consent, we measured heart rate (HR), transcutaneous carbon dioxide (CO(2)) tension and oxygen levels (SpO(2)) at the conclusion of six 10-minute phases: sitting quietly and walking briskly without a mask, sitting quietly and walking briskly while wearing a cloth mask, and sitting quietly and walking briskly while wearing a surgical mask. Brisk walking required at least a 10bpm increase in heart rate. Occurrences of hypoxemia (decrease in SpO(2) of 3% from baseline to a value of 94%) and hypercarbia (increase in CO(2) tension of 5 mmHg from baseline to a value of 46 mmHg) in individual subjects were collected. Wilcoxon signed-rank was used for pairwise comparisons among values for the whole cohort (e.g. walking without a mask versus walking with a cloth mask). RESULTS: Among 50 adult volunteers (median age 33 years; 32% with a co-morbidity), there were no episodes of hypoxemia or hypercarbia (0%; 95% confidence interval 0C1.9%).

Since then, a new quality movement has emerged, with the development of numerous interventions aimed at improving quality, with a focus on accessibility, safety and effectiveness of care. Further gains in equity and timeliness have proven even more challenging. The challenge: With the emergence of \\"service-oriented\\" systems, complexity science, the challenges of climate change, the growth of social media and the internet and the new reality of COVID-19, the original domains proposed by the IOM invite reflection on their relevance and possibility for improvement. The possible solution: In this paper, we propose a revised model of quality that is built on never-ending learning and includes new domains, such as Ecology and Transparency, which reflect the changing worldview of healthcare. We also introduce the concept of person- or \\"kin-centred care\\" to emphasise the shared humanity of people involved in the interdependent work. The change of Person Centred Care to Kin Centred Care introduces a broader concept of the person and ensures that Person Centred Care is included in every domain of quality rather than as a separate domain. The concentration on the technological aspects of quality is an example of the problem in the past. This is a more expansive view of what \\"person-centredness\\" began. The delivery of health and healthcare requires people working in differing roles, with explicit attention to the lived realities of the people in the roles of professional and patient. The new model will provide a construct that may make the attainment of equity in healthcare more possible with a focus on kindness for all.","output":"A multidimensional quality model: an opportunity for patients, their kin, healthcare providers and professionals to coproduce health."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Au dcours d'un pisode aigu de COVID-19 symptomatique, plus de 30 % des patients adultes ont encore des sympt?mes  1-2 mois et 10  15 %  6-8 mois.

As a result of an acute symptomatic COVID-19 episode, more than 30% of adult patients still have symptoms at 1-2 months and 10-15% at 6-8 months. These may be persistent symptoms or new symptoms. If the most common are severe fatigue, dyspnea and neurocognitive signs, many other organs may be affected.

The lack of virological documentation (PCR could not be made at the initial episode and/or serology is negative) does not exclude this diagnosis. The origin of these symptoms is not yet clear: a viral persistence has been demonstrated in some cases, an inflammatory response including excessive mastocyte activation, a defect of innate or adaptive immunity are hypotheses being explored. Genetic and hormonal factors may be associated. Patient management must be initiated at the first point of care. Based on a thorough analysis of the symptoms, diagnoses will be made which leads to a multidisciplinary management where symptomatic treatments and rehabilitation are important.

The purpose of this review is to consider such issues in greater detail. After examining the operating principles of pulse oximetry, we describe the available devices and the potential uses of oximetry at high altitude. We then consider the pitfalls of pulse oximetry in this environment and provide recommendations about how to deal with these issues. Device users should recognize that oxygen saturation changes rapidly in response to small changes in oxygen tensions at high altitude and that device accuracy declines with arterial oxygen saturations of less than 80%. The normal oxygen saturation at a given elevation may not be known with certainty and should be viewed as a range of values, rather than a specific number. For these reasons, clinical decisions should not be based on small differences in saturation over time or among individuals. Effort should also be made to minimize factors that cause measurement errors, including cold extremities, excess ambient light, and ill-fitting oximeter probes. Attention to these and other issues will help the users of these devices to apply them in appropriate situations and to minimize erroneous clinical decisions.","output":"Pulse oximetry at high altitude."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In fighting against common threats to human survival and well-being, be they from natural disaster or human conflict, peoples commitment to taking collective action matters and can make a huge or even decisive difference.

Although the coronaviruses are traditionally classed into 3 groups, with SARS-CoV forming a 4th group, the phylogenetic position and origins of SARS-CoV remain a matter of some controversy. Thus, we conducted extensive phylogenetic analyses of the genes common to all coronavirus groups, using the Neighbor-joining, Maximum-likelihood, and Bayesian methods. Our data evidenced largely identical topology for all of the obtained phylogenetic trees, thus supporting the hypothesis that the relationship existing between SARS-CoV and group 2 coronavirus is a monophyletic one. Additional comparative genomic studies, including sequence similarity and protein secondary structure analyses, suggested that SARS-CoV may bear a closer relationship with group 2 than with the other coronavirus groups. Although our data strongly suggest that group 2 coronaviruses are most closely related with SARS-CoV, further and more detailed analyses may provide us with an increased amount of information regarding the origins and evolution of the coronaviruses, most notably SARS-CoV.","output":"Close relationship between SARS-coronavirus and group 2 coronavirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The postoperative pain after percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) can be managed by many peripheral blocks techniques (e.g., paravertebral and quadrates lumborum block), and local anesthesia infiltration.

Methods: Eligible subjects after exclusion of COVID-19 patients, with renal stones less than 2 cm undergoing PCNL surgery under general anesthesia. Exclusion criteria were: 21<years of age or > 60 years of age;bleeding disorders;allergies to local anesthetics;psychiatric patients;and American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) physical status III and IV. Eighty patients were randomly allocated to 2 equal groups. In the Quadratus group, participant received 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.25% in the fascial plane between the quadratus lumborum and Psoas muscle;and in the peritubal group, patients received 10 mL of bupivacaine 0.25% around the nephrostomy tube at 6 and 12 oclock positions (total 20 mL). The quadratus lumborum block and peritubal infiltration were performed by the primary investigator and the urologist, respectively. All patients received standard postoperative analgesia (paracetamol, ketorolac, and morphine via patient-controlled analgesia. Both patients and Data collecting staff were blinded to study group. Primary outcome was the visual analogue score at rest and on coughing or movement at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours. Secondary outcomes were 24 hours total morphine consumption, 1 st use of morphine pump, incidence of side effects (pruritis and nausea and vomiting) and patient satisfaction. Results: Data were analyzed from 78 patients (39 patients in each group). The mean resting VAS score in quadratus group at 6 and 12 hours was (3), while the mean VAS in peritubal group was (5) and (6) at 6 and 12 hours, respectively. Dynamic VAS score in peritubal group at 6 hours was (mean 6) with p <0.0001 when compared to resting value.

This perception is now gradually changing, especially with ICRP Publication 138, which addressed the ethical foundation of the system of radiological protection. It identified values which have guided the Commission's recommendations over the decades, but have not always been made explicit. Four core values are discussed (beneficence/non-maleficence, prudence, justice, dignity) as well as three procedural values (accountability, transparency, inclusivity). The latter are considered critical to the practical implementation of the system of radiological protection. Here we are exploring empathy as a procedural values complementing the three identified in ICRP Publication 138. Empathy can be defined as the \\"capability (or disposition) to immerse oneself in and to reflect upon the experiences, perspectives and contexts of others\\". It is often understood as a skill that one either has or has not, but research has shown it can be taught and therefore can be required as an attitude of those working in health care, education, design, and technology. We suggest it is an essential prerequisite to the assessment and management of any radiological situation and the health problems accruing from it. The concerns of people affected, their needs and wishes need to be taken seriously from the very beginning of any decision-making process. Even if they are considered unfounded and exaggerated, the insights they provide will be valuable for the understanding of the overall situation.

The aim of this feasibility randomised controlled trial is to (1) characterise the physical function, cardiovascular health and the health and well-being of older adults with mild frailty with/without diabetes treated with insulin, (2) to understand the feasibility and acceptability of a 4-week resistance exercise training programme in improving these parameters for those with diabetes and (3) to test the feasibility of recruiting and randomising the diabetic participant group to a trial of resistance training. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Thirty adults aged 60 years with insulin-treated diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2), and 30 without, all with mild frailty (3C4 on the Rockwood Frailty Scale) will be recruited. All will complete blood, cardiovascular and physical function testing. Only the diabetic group will then proceed into the trial itself. They will be randomised 1:1 to a 4-week semisupervised resistance training programme, designed to increase muscle mass and strength, or to usual care, defined as their regular physical activity, for 4 weeks. This group will then repeat testing. Primary outcomes include recruitment rate, attrition rate, intervention fidelity and acceptability, and adherence to the training programme. A subset of participants will be interviewed before and after the training programme to understand experiences of resistance training, impact on health and living with diabetes (where relevant) as they have aged. Analyses will include descriptive statistics and qualitative thematic analysis.

The enormous work done in this field is particularly due to the broad versatility and variety of these sensing devices. From optical to electrical systems, from label-dependent to label-free approaches, from single to multi-analyte and array formats, this wide range of possibilities makes the research field very diversified and competitive. New challenges and requirements for an ideal detector suitable for nucleic acid analysis include high sensitivity and high specificity protocol that can be completed in a relatively short time offering at the same time low detection limit. Moreover, systems that can be miniaturized and automated present a significant advantage over conventional technology, especially if detection is needed in the field. Electrical system technology for nucleic acid-based detection is an enabling mode for making miniaturized to micro- and nanometer scale bio-monitoring devices via the fusion of modern micro- and nanofabrication technology and molecular biotechnology. The electrical biosensors that rely on the conversion of the Watson-Crick base-pair recognition event into a useful electrical signal are advancing rapidly, and recently are receiving much attention as a valuable tool for microbial pathogen detection. Pathogens may pose a serious threat to humans, animal and plants, thus their detection and analysis is a significant element of public health. Although different conventional methods for detection of pathogenic microorganisms and their toxins exist and are currently being applied, improvements of molecular-based detection methodologies have changed these traditional detection techniques and introduced a new era of rapid, miniaturized and automated electrical chip detection technologies into pathogen identification sector.

Three trans-membrane non-structural proteins, nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6, are understood to be membrane anchors of the coronavirus replication complex. Nsp4 is localized to the ER membrane when expressed alone but is recruited into the replication complex in infected cells. It is revealed to contain four trans-membrane regions and its N- and C-termini are exposed to the cytosol. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have determined the crystal structures of the C-terminal hydrophilic domain of nsp4 (nsp4C) from MHV strain A59 and a C425S site-directed mutant. The highly conserved 89 amino acid region from T408 to Q496 is shown to possess a new fold. The wild-type (WT) structure features two monomers linked by a Cys425-Cys425 disulfide bond in one asymmetric unit. The monomers are arranged with their N- and C-termini in opposite orientations to form an open conformation. Mutation of Cys425 to Ser did not affect the monomer structure, although the mutant dimer adopts strikingly different conformations by crystal packing, with the cross-linked C-termini and parallel N-termini of two monomers forming a closed conformation. The WT nsp4C exists as a dimer in solution and can dissociate easily into monomers in a reducing environment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: As nsp4C is exposed in the reducing cytosol, the monomer of nsp4C should be physiological. This structure may serve as a basis for further functional studies of nsp4.","output":"Crystal Structure of the C-Terminal Cytoplasmic Domain of Non-Structural Protein 4 from Mouse Hepatitis Virus A59"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

Because of a prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time (aPTT), a relationship with anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) has been proposed, but results are controversial. Functional assays for aPL (i.e., lupus anticoagulant) can be influenced by concomitant anticoagulation and/or high levels of C reactive protein. The presence of anti-cardiolipin (aCL), anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (anti-{beta}2GPI and anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT) antibodies was not investigated systematically. Epitope specificity of anti-{beta}2GPI antibodies was not reported. Aim. To evaluate the prevalence and the clinical association of aPL in a large cohort of COVID-19 patients, and to characterize the epitope specificity of anti-{beta}2GPI antibodies. Methods. ELISA and chemiluminescence assays were used to test 122 sera of patients suffering from severe COVID-19. Of them, 16 displayed major thrombotic events. Results. Anti-{beta}2GPI IgG/IgA/IgM were the most frequent in 15.6/6.6/9.0% of patients, while aCL IgG/IgM were detected in 5.7/6.6% by ELISA. Comparable values were found by chemiluminescence. aPS/PT IgG/IgM were detectable in 2.5 and 9.8% by ELISA. No association between thrombosis and aPL was found.

The purpose of this paper is to present strategies of how a local health department operationalized equity in various stages of COVID-19 response and apply these methods to future public health emergencies to better serve vulnerable communities.","output":"Local Government Approaches to Combating COVID-19 Inequities: A Durham County Department of Public Health Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: SARS CoV19 infection can predispose to many autoimmune and neurological conditions, thymomatous myasthenia gravis being one of them. The rarity of these case poses therapeutic dilemmas about their further management. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 61 year old gentleman who had covid19 infection 2 months back, presented with new onset myasthenia gravis and an anterior mediastinal mass. He was diagnosed as a case of anti acetyl choline receptor antibody positive thymomatous myasthenia gravis. The patient was posted for video assisted thoracoscopic excision of thymoma. The procedure was uneventful and patient was discharged with improvement in myasthenic symptoms. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of WHO Type A Spindle cell thymoma. DISCUSSION: SARS CoV19 infection is associated with an array of autoimmune disorders due to various proposed phenomenon including molecular mimicry and loss of immune tolerance. Post infectious thymomatous myasthenia gravis is extremely uncommon, and can be managed with open, minimally invasive or robotic approach. CONCLUSION: This is the first documented case of post covid19 infection thymomatous myasthenia gravis to the best of our knowledge, managed with minimally invasive thoracoscopic surgery. Further research is required for documentation of the natural history of the disease and therapeutic outcomes.","output":"Management of thymomatous myasthenia gravis - Case report of a rare Covid19 infection sequelae"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper presents the theoretical considerations on the role of endocrine and metabolic alterations accompanying Covid-19 infection. These alterations may be presumed on the basis of the following two observations. Firstly, the virus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the Covid-19 infection uses an important renin-angiotensin system element - angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - as a receptor protein for the entry into target cells and, in consequence, disturbs the function of the main (circulating) renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and of the local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) localized in different tissues and organs. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 leads to the down-regulation of this enzyme and, in the aftermath, to the excess of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Thus, in the later stage of Covid-19 infection, the beneficial effects of ACI and ARB could be presumed. It is hypothesized that the local RAS dysregulation in the adipose tissue is the main cause of the negative role of obesity as a risk factor of severe outcome of the Covid-19 infection. Secondly, the outcome of Covid-19 strongly depends on the age of a patient. The age-related hormonal deficiencies, especially that of melatonin and dehydroepiandrosterone may contribute to morbidity/mortality in older people. The usefulness of melatonin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor 1 blockers (the latter only in later phases of the infection) as adjuvant drugs is probable but needs careful clinical trials.","output":"Endocrine and metabolic aspects of Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In todays fast-paced world of rapid technological change, software development teams need to constantly revise their work practices. Not surprisingly, regular reflection on how to become more effective is perceived as one of the most important principles of Agile Software Development. Nevertheless, running an effective and enjoyable retrospective meeting is still a challenge in real environments. As reported by several studies, the Sprint Retrospective is an agile practice most likely to be implemented improperly or sacrificed when teams perform under pressure to deliver. To facilitate the implementation of the practice, some agile coaches have proposed to set up retrospective meetings in the form of retrospective games. However, there has been little research-based evidence to support the positive effects of retrospective games. Our aim is to investigate whether the adoption of retrospective games can improve retrospective meetings in general and lead to positive societal outcomes. In this paper, we report on an Action Research project in which we implemented six retrospective games in six Scrum teams that had experienced common retrospective problems. The received feedback indicates that the approach helped the teams to mitigate many of the accidental difficulties pertaining to the Sprint Retrospective, such as lack of structure, dullness, too many complaints, or unequal participation and made the meetings more productive to some degree. Moreover, depending on their individual preferences, different participants perceived different games as having a positive impact on their communication, motivation-and-involvement, and/or creativity, even though there were others, less numerous, who had an opposite view. The advantages and disadvantages of each game as well as eight lessons learned are presented in the paper.","output":"Game-based Sprint retrospectives: multiple action research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated morbidity, mortality, and economic disruption has reignited interest in simple protective and preventive measures.

Recognizing those patients who will need stronger clinical efforts could effectively help doctors anticipate the eventual need for intensification of care (IoC) and choose the best treatment in order to avoid worse outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS We enrolled 501 patients, consecutively admitted to our two COVID hospitals, and collected their clinical, anamnestic and laboratory data on admission. The aim of this retrospective study was to identify those data that are strictly associated with COVID-19 outcomes (IoC and in-hospital death) and that could somehow be intended as predictors of these outcomes. This allowed us to provide a \\"sketch\\" of the patient who undergoes, more often than others, an intensification of care and/or in-hospital death. RESULTS Males were found to have a double risk of needing an IoC (OR=2.11) and a significant role was played by both the PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission (OR=0.99) and serum LDH (OR=1.01). The main predictors of in-hospital death were age (OR=1.08) and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission (OR=0.99). CONCLUSIONS Male patients with high serum LDH on admission are those who undergo more often an intensification of care among COVID-19 inpatients.

As part of the essential processes for both of these applications, the two strands of double-stranded DNA are sequentially cleaved by a single catalytic site of Cas12a, but the mechanistic details that govern the generation of complete breaks in double-stranded DNA remain to be elucidated. Here, using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, we identified two conformational intermediates that form consecutively following the initial cleavage of the nontarget strand. Specifically, these two intermediates are the result of further unwinding of the target DNA in the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM)Cdistal region and the subsequent binding of the target strand to the catalytic site. Notably, the PAM-distal DNA unwound conformation was stabilized by Mg(2+) ions, thereby significantly promoting the binding and cleavage of the target strand. These findings enabled us to propose a Mg(2+)-dependent kinetic model for the mechanism whereby Cas12a achieves cleavage of the target DNA, highlighting the presence of conformational rearrangements for the complete cleavage of the double-stranded DNA target.","output":"Mg(2+)-dependent conformational rearrangements of CRISPR-Cas12a R-loop complex are mandatory for complete double-stranded DNA cleavage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) endorsed clinical frailty scale (CFS) to help with decision-making. However, this recommendation lacks an evidence basis and is controversial. This meta-analysis aims to quantify the dose-response relationship between CFS and mortality in COVID-19 patients, with a goal of supplementing the evidence of its use. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from several electronic databases up until 8 September 2020. We searched for studies investigating COVID-19 patients and reported both (1) CFS and its distribution (2) CFS and its association with mortality. The outcome of interest was mortality, defined as clinically validated death or non-survivor. The odds ratio (ORs) will be reported per 1% increase in CFS. The potential for a non-linear relationship based on ORs of each quantitative CFS was examined using restricted cubic splines with a three-knots model. RESULTS: There were a total of 3817 patients from seven studies. Mean age was 80.3 (SD 8.2), and 53% (48C58%) were males. The pooled prevalence for CFS 1C3 was 34% (32C36%), CFS 4C6 was 42% (40C45%), and CFS 7C9 was 23% (21C25%).

Two surveys were administered on 3/26/2020 and 3/30/2020, respectively, to document immediate changes and challenges in clinical practice. METHOD Two surveys were administered between 3/26/2020 and 3/30/2020, via SurveyMonkey and Google Forms, asking clinicians questions pertaining to practice issues during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Quantitative responses from the second survey were stratified by clinical setting (Medical Hospital vs. Private Practice) prior to analysis. Qualitative, free-response items were coded by the authors to better understand immediate changes in practice and other concerns. RESULTS 266 neuropsychologists completed Survey 1 and 230 completed Survey 2. Results suggest that practices immediately moved towards remote service provision. A meaningful proportion of clinicians and their staff were immediately affected economically by the pandemic, with clinicians in private practice differentially affected. Furthermore, a small but significant minority of respondents faced ethical dilemmas related to service provision and expressed concerns with initial communication from their employment organizations. Respondents requested clear best-practice guidelines from neuropsychological practice organizations. CONCLUSIONS It is clear that field of neuropsychology has drastically shifted clinical practices in response to COVID-19 and is likely to continue to evolve.

Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) face unique challenges in accessing limited adolescent medicine specialty care resources, which contributes to delayed or forgone care. e-Consultations between general pediatricians and adolescent medicine specialists may alleviate these barriers to care. However, the optimal application of this model in adolescent medicine requires careful attention to the nuances of AYA care. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to qualitatively analyze feedback obtained during the iterative development of an e-consultation system for communication between general pediatricians and adolescent medicine specialists tailored to the specific health care needs of AYAs. METHODS: We conducted an iterative user-centered design and evaluation process in two phases. In the first phase, we created a static e-consultation prototype and storyboards and evaluated them with target users (general pediatricians and adolescent medicine specialists). In the second phase, we incorporated feedback to develop a functional prototype within the electronic health record and again evaluated this with general pediatricians and adolescent medicine specialists. In each phase, general pediatricians and adolescent medicine specialists provided think-aloud feedback during the use of the prototypes and semistructured exit interviews, which was qualitatively analyzed to identify perspectives related to the usefulness and usability of the e-consultation system. RESULTS: Both general pediatricians (n=12) and adolescent medicine specialists (n=12) perceived the usefulness of e-consultations for AYA patients, with more varied perceptions of potential usefulness for generalist and adolescent medicine clinicians. General pediatricians and adolescent medicine specialists discussed ways to maximize the usability of e-consultations for AYAs, primarily by improving efficiency (eg, reducing documentation, emphasizing critical information, using autopopulated data fields, and balancing specificity and efficiency through text prompts) and reducing the potential for errors (eg, prompting a review of autopopulated data fields, requiring physician contact information, and prompting explicit discussion of patient communication and confidentiality expectations). Through iterative design, patient history documentation was streamlined, whereas documentation of communication and confidentiality expectations were enhanced. CONCLUSIONS: Through an iterative user-centered design process, we identified user perspectives to guide the refinement of an e-consultation system based on general pediatrician and adolescent medicine specialist feedback on usefulness and usability related to the care of AYAs. Qualitative analysis of this feedback revealed both opportunities and risks related to confidentiality, communication, and the use of tailored documentation prompts that should be considered in the development and use of e-consultations with AYAs.","output":"Optimizing e-Consultations to Adolescent Medicine Specialists: Qualitative Synthesis of Feedback From User-Centered Design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to reveal how the pandemic process affected the number of ED visits and the reasons for application.

METHODS: We compared 981 patients from the UK Biobank dataset who had a severe reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection before 27 April 2020 to a similar number of age-matched patients drawn for the general UK Biobank population. For each patient, we built a profile of 88 numbers characterizing the chromosomal-scale length variability of their germ line DNA. Each number represented one quarter of the 22 autosomes. We used the machine learning algorithm XGBoost to build a classifier that could predict whether a person would have a severe reaction to COVID-19 based only on their 88-number classification. RESULTS: We found that the XGBoost classifier could differentiate between the two classes at a significant level (p = 2  10(?11)) as measured against a randomized control and (p = 3  10(?14)) as measured against the expected value of a random guessing algorithm (AUC = 0.5).

Unfortunately, this bias seems to be maintained in the COVID-19 epidemic: most current guidelines for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy apply the same standard criteria as for the general population. This pandemic is an opportunity to begin redressing this historic gender bias against pregnant women, and to achieve this, we recommend two actions that are easy to implement, and would have a large impact.

However, a direct relationship between these circulating factors and brain-specific ischemic injury remains to be fully defined. METHODS An unbiased screen in a nonhuman primate model of stroke was used to find out the most responsive circulating biomarker flowing ischemic stroke. Then this phenomenon was checked in human beings and mice. Finally, we observed the temporospatial responsive characteristics of this biomarker after ischemic brain injury in mice to evaluate the direct relationship between this circulating factor and central nervous system-specific ischemic injury. RESULTS In a nonhuman primate model, an unbiased screen revealed CCL2 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 2) as a major response factor in plasma after stroke. In mouse models of focal cerebral ischemia, plasma levels of CCL2 showed a transient response, that is, rapidly elevated by 2 to 3 hours postischemia but then renormalized back to baseline levels by 24 hours. However, a different CCL2 temporal profile was observed in whole brain homogenate, cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated brain microvessels, with a progressive increase over 24 hours, demonstrating a mismatch between brain versus plasma responses. In contrast to the lack of correlation with central nervous system responses, 2 peripheral compartments showed transient profiles that matched circulating plasma signatures. CCL2 protein in lymph nodes and adipose tissue was significantly increased at 2 hours and renormalized by 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS These findings may provide a cautionary tale for biomarker pursuits in plasma. Besides a direct central nervous system response, peripheral organs may also contribute to blood signatures in complex and indirect ways.","output":"CCL2 (C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2) Biomarker Responses in Central Versus Peripheral Compartments After Focal Cerebral Ischemia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Under the COVID-19 global pandemic, China has weakened the large-scale spread of the epidemic through lockdown and other measures. At the same time, with the recovery of social production activities, China has become the only country which achieves positive growth in 2020 in the major economies. It entered the post pandemic period. These measures improved the local environmental quality. However, whether this improvement can be sustained is also a problem that needs to be solved. So, this study investigated the changes of five air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and CO) in the nine cities most severely affected by the pandemic in China during the lockdown and post pandemic period. We emphasized that when analyzing the changes of environmental quality during the epidemic, we must consider not only the impact of the day and short-term changesbut also the cumulative lag effect and sustainable development. Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, it is found that the concentration of pollutants decreased significantly during the lockdown compared to the situation before the epidemic. PM10 and NO2 are falling most, which downs 39% and 46% respectively. During the lockdown period, the pollutant concentrations response to the pandemic has a lag of 3-7 days. More specifically, in the cities related to single pollutants, the impact on the pollutant shows a significant correlation when the measures are delayed for seven days. In the cities that are related to multiple pollutants, the correlation is usually highest in 3-5 days. This means that the impact of policy measures on the environment lasted for 3-5 days. Besides, Wuhan, Jingmen and Jingzhou have seen the most obvious improvement. However, this improvement did not last. In the post pandemic period, the pollutants rebounded, the growth rates of PM10 and NO2 reached 44% and 87% in September. When compared with the changes of pollutants concentration in the same period from 2017 to 2019, the decline rate has also been significantly slower, even higher than the average concentration of previous years. The research not only contributes to China's economic \\"green recovery\\" plan during the post epidemic period, but also provides references for environmental governance during economic recovery in other countries.","output":"How do pollutants change post-pandemic?

Previous studies reveal that a molecular analysis of PLpro indicates the catalytic activity of viral PLpro and its interactions with ubiquitin. METHODS By using sequence comparisons, molecular models and protein-protein interaction maps, PLpro was compared in the three recorded fatal CoV epidemics, which involved SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. RESULTS The pairwise sequence comparison of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro indicated similarity percentages of 82.59% and 30.06% with SARS-CoV PLpro and MERS-CoV PLpro , respectively. In comparison with SARS-CoV PLpro , in SARS-CoV-2, the PLpro had a conserved catalytic triad of C111, H278 and D293, with a slightly lower number of polar interface residues and of hydrogen bonds, a higher number of buried interface sizes and a lower number of residues that interact with ubiquitin and PLpro . These features might contribute to a similar or slightly lower level of deubiquitinating activity in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro . It was, however, a much higher level compared to MERS-CoV, which contained amino acid mutations and a low number of polar interfaces. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and SARS-CoV PLpro showed almost the same catalytic site profiles, interface area compositions and polarities, suggesting a general similarity in deubiquitination activity. Compared with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 had a higher potential for binding interactions with ubiquitin.

There is currently no commercially available vaccine or efficacious therapeutic for any filovirus. In this study, PMO conjugated to arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide (P-PMO) and nonconjugated PMO were assayed for the ability to inhibit EBOV infection in cell culture and in a mouse model of lethal EBOV infection. A 22-mer P-PMO designed to base pair with the translation start site region of EBOV VP35 positive-sense RNA generated sequence-specific and time- and dose-dependent inhibition of EBOV amplification in cell culture. The same oligomer provided complete protection to mice when administered before or after an otherwise lethal infection of EBOV. A corresponding nonconjugated PMO, as well as nonconjugated truncated versions of 16 and 19 base residues, provided length-dependent protection to mice when administered prophylactically.

In addition to our early clinical proof of concept (POC) data, we also present non-clinical POC from a mouse model of CRS and ARDS that informed the design of the reported clinical study. Methods. 13 patients, who were hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia and abnormally elevated serum inflammatory biomarkers markers []3 months prior to the identification of the first confirmed U.S case of the Omicron variant, were treated with IV RJX (daily x 7 days) plus SOC. Non-clinical POC study examined the ability of RJX plus dexamethasone (DEX) to improve the survival outcome in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Galactosamine (GalN) mouse model of fatal cytokine release syndrome (CRS), sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Findings. In the Phase 1 clinical study, none of the 13 patients developed a treatment-related DLT, SAE, or Grade 3-5 AEs. Nine (9) of the 12 evaluable patients, including 3 patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, showed rapid clinical recovery. In the non-clinical POC study in LPS-GalN challenged mice, the combination of RJX plus DEX was more effective than RJX alone or DEX alone, reversed the CRS as well as inflammatory tissue damage in the lungs and liver, and improved the survival outcome.

Since 8 March 2020, the Italian government ordered a nationwide lockdown with unavoidable social isolation. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) represent the most physically and emotionally involved category. The aim of this study is to assess the social distress among HCPs in Italy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this online, totally anonymous survey, 24 multiple choice questions were posed to medical staff employed in the Italian Healthcare System during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collection was performed from 30 March to 24 April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 600 HCPs completed the questionnaire. The majority of respondents expressed the fear of being at higher risk of contagion than the general population (83.3%) and the weighty concern of infecting their families (72.5%). An insufficient supply of personal protective equipment (PPE; P = 0.0003) and inadequate training about procedures to follow (P = 0.0092) were seen to significantly coincide with these worries. More than two-thirds declared a change in family organisation, which showed a significant correlation with the concern of infecting their relatives (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first Italian survey on social distress among HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The unavailability of PPE, screening procedures and adequate training strongly affected HCPs' emotional status. Although there was a predominance of oncologists (especially from the North of Italy), which impairs the generalisation of our findings, this survey underlined the social impact that this health emergency has had on HCPs.","output":"Social distress among medical oncologists and other healthcare professionals during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the final week of winter quarter, the University of California, Irvine announced all exams would be online and the following quarter would be delivered remotely This necessitated a course-wide common final with over 2000 students scheduled to be moved online For the following quarter, the move to remote instruction included three different general chemistry courses, seven sections, 1968 students, and six different instructors A professor of teaching, who had previously designed and instructed online courses, was dedicated to assist with course design, technical issues, and course policy consistency Instructors chose a degree of support and autonomy that fit their interests, goals, and time constraints Using previously designed course materials and a dedicated support system allowed for the implementation of best practices even under intense time pressure Technical solutions to proctored exams and course content accountability were used Though student perceptions varied, given the constraints due to the global pandemic as well as social unrest, the implementation was largely considered a success","output":"Implementation of an Emergency Multisection Online General Chemistry Curriculum in Response to COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Telogen Effluvium (TE) in a post-Covid-19 patient causes excessive shedding of hair.

To protect public health, we designed and fabricated electrospun nanofibrous air filters that hold promise for applications in personal protective equipment (PPE) and the indoor environment. Due to ultrafine nanofibers (300 nm), the electrospun air filters had a much smaller pore size in comparison to the surgical mask and cloth masks (a couple of micrometers versus tens to hundreds of micrometers). A coronavirus strain served as a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate and was used to generate aerosols for filtration efficiency tests, which can better represent SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to other agents used for aerosol generation in previous studies. The electrospun air filters showed excellent performance by capturing up to 99.9% of coronavirus aerosols, which outperformed many commercial face masks. In addition, we observed that the same electrospun air filter or face mask removed NaCl aerosols equivalently or less effectively in comparison to the coronavirus aerosols when both aerosols were generated from the same system.

In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in close collaboration with state, local, and territorial health departments, began a 5-year initiative to establish population-based motherCbaby linked longitudinal surveillance, the Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Network (SET-NET). OBJECTIVES: The objective of this report is to describe an expanded surveillance approach that leverages and modernizes existing surveillance systems to address the impact of emerging health threats during pregnancy on pregnant women and their infants. METHODS: MotherCbaby pairs are identified through prospective identification during pregnancy and/or identification of an infant with retrospective linking to maternal information. All data are obtained from existing data sources (e.g., electronic medical records, vital statistics, laboratory reports, and health department investigations and case reporting). RESULTS: Variables were selected for inclusion to address key surveillance questions proposed by CDC and health department subject matter experts. General variables include maternal demographics and health history, pregnancy and infant outcomes, maternal and infant laboratory results, and child health outcomes up to the second birthday. Exposure-specific modular variables are included for hepatitis C, syphilis, and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The system is structured into four relational datasets (maternal, pregnancy outcomes and birth, infant/child follow-up, and laboratory testing). DISCUSSION: SET-NET provides a population-based motherCbaby linked longitudinal surveillance approach and has already demonstrated rapid adaptation to COVID-19. This innovative approach leverages existing data sources and rapidly collects data and informs clinical guidance and practice. These data can help to reduce exposure risk and adverse outcomes among pregnant women and their infants, direct public health action, and strengthen public health systems.","output":"A Preparedness Model for MotherCBaby Linked Longitudinal Surveillance for Emerging Threats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The impact of underlying comorbidities on the clinical presentation, management and outcomes in patients with ARDS is poorly understood and deserves further investigation. OBJECTIVES: We examined these issue in patients with ARDS enrolled in the Large observational study to UNderstand the Global impact of Severe Acute respiratory FailurE (LUNG SAFE) study. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of the patient cohort enrolled in the LUNG SAFE study, our primary objective was to determine the frequency, and impact of comorbidities on the management and ICU survival of patients with ARDS. Secondary outcomes relating to comorbidities included their impact on ventilatory management, the development of organ failures, and on end-of-life care. RESULTS: Of 2813 patients in the study population, 1692 (60%) had 1 or more comorbidities, of whom 631 (22.4%) had chronic respiratory impairment, 290 (10.3%) had congestive heart failure, 286 (10.2%) had chronic renal failure, 112 (4%) had chronic liver failure, 584 (20.8%) had immune incompetence, and 613 (21.8%) had diabetes. Multiple comorbidities were frequently present, with 423 (25%) having 2 and 182 (11%) having at least 3 or more comorbidities. The use of invasive ventilation (1379 versus 998, 82 versus 89%), neuromuscular blockade (301 versus 249, 18 versus 22%), prone positioning (97 versus 104, 6 versus 9%) and ECMO (32 versus 46, 2 versus 4%) were each significantly reduced in patients with comorbidities as compared to patients with no comorbidity (1692 versus 1121, 60 versus 40%). ICU mortality increased from 27% (n = 303) in patients with no comorbidity to 39% (n = 661) in patients with any comorbidity. Congestive heart failure, chronic liver failure and immune incompetence were each independently associated with increased ICU mortality. Chronic liver failure and immune incompetence were independently associated with more decisions to limitation of life supporting measures. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with ARDS have significant comorbidities, they receive less aggressive care, and have worse outcomes.

A major family of NAD(+) consumers in mammalian cells are poly-ADP-ribose-polymerases (PARPs). PARPs comprise a family of 17 enzymes in humans, 16 of which catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD(+) to macromolecular targets (namely, proteins, but also DNA and RNA). Because PARPs and the NAD(+) biosynthetic enzymes are subcellularly localized, an emerging concept is that the activity of PARPs and other NAD(+) consumers are regulated in a compartmentalized manner. In this review, I discuss NAD(+) metabolism, how different subcellular pools of NAD(+) are established and regulated, and how free NAD(+) levels can control signaling by PARPs and redox metabolism.","output":"Interplay between compartmentalized NAD(+) synthesis and consumption: a focus on the PARP family"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As novel SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, it is critical that their potential to cause severe disease and evade vaccine-induced immunity is rapidly assessed in humans and studied in animal models. In early January 2021, a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant designated B.1.429 comprising 2 lineages, B.1.427 and B.1.429, was originally detected in California (CA) and it was shown to have enhanced infectivity in vitro and decreased antibody neutralization by plasma from convalescent patients and vaccine recipients. Here we examine the virulence, transmissibility, and susceptibility to pre-existing immunity for B 1.427 and B 1.429 in the Syrian hamster model. We find that both variants exhibit enhanced virulence as measured by increased body weight loss compared to hamsters infected with ancestral B.1 (614G), with B.1.429 causing the most marked body weight loss among the 3 variants. Faster dissemination from airways to parenchyma and more severe lung pathology at both early and late stages were also observed with B.1.429 infections relative to B.1. (614G) and B.1.427 infections. In addition, subgenomic viral RNA (sgRNA) levels were highest in oral swabs of hamsters infected with B.1.429, however sgRNA levels in lungs were similar in all three variants. This demonstrates that B.1.429 replicates to higher levels than ancestral B.1 (614G) or B.1.427 in the oropharynx but not in the lungs. In multi-virus in-vivo competition experiments, we found that B.1.

We did not observe significant differences in airborne transmission efficiency among the B.1.427, B.1.429 and ancestral B.1 (614G) and WA-1 variants in hamsters.

Unfortunately, collateral flow varies widely in patients for reasons that remain unclear. Studies in mice have shown that the number and diameter of cerebral collaterals vary widely due primarily to polymorphisms in genes, e.g., Rabep2, involved in their formation during development. However, understanding how variation in collateral abundance affects stroke progression has been hampered by lack of a method to reversibly ligate the distal middle cerebral artery (MCAO) in mice. Here we present a method and examine infarct volume 24 h after transient (tMCAO, 90 min) versus permanent occlusion (pMCAO) in mice with good versus poor collaterals. Wildtype C57BL/6 mice (have abundant collaterals) sustained small infarctions following tMCAO that increased 2.1-fold after pMCAO, reflecting significant penumbra present at 90 min. Mutant C57BL/6 mice lacking Rabep2 (have reduced collaterals) sustained a 4-fold increase in infarct volume over WT following tMCAO and a smaller additional increase (0.4-fold) after pMCAO, reflecting reduced penumbra. Wildtype BALB/cBy (have a deficient Rabep2 variant and poor collaterals) had large infarctions following tMCAO that increased less (0.6-fold) than the above wildtype C57BL/6 mice following pMCAO. Mutant BALB/cBy mice (have deficient Rabep2 replaced with the C57BL/6 variant thus increased collaterals) sustained smaller infarctions after tMCAO. However, unlike C57BL/6 versus Rabep2 mice, penumbra was not increased since infarct volume increased only 0.3-fold following pMCAO. These findings present a murine model of tMCAO and demonstrate that neuroprotective mechanisms, in addition to collaterals, also vary with genetic background and affect the evolution of stroke.","output":"Transient versus Permanent MCA Occlusion in Mice Genetically Modified to Have Good versus Poor Collaterals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by draconian measures and far too many important unknowns, such as the true mortality risk, the role of children as transmitters and the development and duration of immunity in the population. More than a year into the pandemic much has been learned and insights into this novel type of pandemic and options for control are shaping up. Using a historical lens, we review what we know and still do not know about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A pandemic caused by a member of the coronavirus family is a new situation following more than a century of influenza A pandemics. However, recent pandemic threats such as outbreaks of the related and novel deadly coronavirus SARS in 2003 and of MERS since 2012 had put coronaviruses on WHOs blueprint list of priority diseases. Like pandemic influenza, SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible (R0 ~ 2.5). Furthermore, it can fly under the radar due to a broad clinical spectrum where asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infected persons also transmit the virus-including children. COVID-19 is far more deadly than seasonal influenza; initial data from China suggested a case fatality rate of 2.3%-which would have been on par with the deadly 1918 Spanish influenza. But, while the Spanish influenza killed young, otherwise healthy adults, it is the elderly who are at extreme risk of dying of COVID-19. We review available seroepidemiological evidence of infection rates and compute infection fatality rates (IFR) for Denmark (0.5%), Spain (0.85%), and Iceland (0.3%). We also deduce that population age structure is key. SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by superspreading, so that ~10% of infected individuals yield 80% of new infections. This phenomenon turns out to be an Achilles heel of the virus that may explain our ability to effectively mitigate outbreaks so far. How will this pandemic come to an end? Herd immunity has not been achieved in Europe due to intense mitigation by non-pharmaceutical interventions; for example, only ~8% of Danes were infected across the 1st and 2nd wave. Luckily, we now have several safe and effective vaccines. Global vaccine control of the pandemic depends in great measure on our ability to keep up with current and future immune escape variants of the virus. We should thus be prepared for a race between vaccine updates and mutations of the virus. A permanent reopening of society highly depends on winning that race.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic: key considerations for the epidemic and its control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the feasibility of laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) in mid and lower rectal cancers following neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT). BACKGROUND The laparoscopic approach for colon cancer has been widely accepted. A few studies have shown that there are advantages of laparoscopic over open TME surgery for rectal cancer. However, the role of laparoscopy has not been clearly defined specifically in cases following nCRT. METHODS All patients with rectal cancer who underwent nCRT were identified; no operations for rectal carcinoma were performed laparoscopically between 1997 and 2005. The laparoscopic cases were matched to open cases based on gender, procedure, age, and body mass index (BMI). The medical records were reviewed and short-term outcome was compared between these two groups. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 15 software. RESULTS Between 2002 and 2008, 64 patients were identified, including 32 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery and 32 who had a laparotomy. There was no difference between the two groups based on gender, procedure, age, BMI or American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification. The procedures performed within each group included 8 abdominoperineal resections and 24 anterior resections, which included 20 colonic J-pouch-anal anastomoses and 4 straight coloanal anastomoses. In the laparoscopic group, 12 patients underwent totally laparoscopic operations, 12 were either laparoscopic-assisted or hand-assisted procedures, and 8 were converted to laparotomy. The reasons for conversion included bleeding, splenic injury, and difficult anatomy. There were no differences in comorbidities, tumor location, tumor size, tumor stage or radiation dose between the two groups. Operative time was longer in the laparoscopic group (267 + or - 76 versus 205 + or - 49 min, p < 0.001). Operative blood loss, complication rate, and mortality rate were all similar between the two groups. However, the laparoscopic group benefited from shorter length of stay (6.1 + or - 2.4 versus 7.6 + or - 2.3 days, p = 0.012), earlier first bowel movement (1.9 + or - 1 versus 3.3 + or - 2.4 days, p = 0.006), and shorter time to regular diet (3.9 + or - 2.1 versus 5.8 + or - 2.5 days, p = 0.003). There was no difference in lymph node harvest (both positive node harvest and total lymph node harvest), distal margin or radial margin. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, laparoscopic TME for mid and lower rectal cancer is feasible and safe. Patients benefit from the short-term advantages of laparoscopy, including shorter length of hospital stay, time to tolerating a regular diet, and time to first bowel movement or stoma function. Although there were no short-term differences in oncologic parameters, the long-term oncologic outcome requires further investigation.","output":"Short-term outcomes of laparoscopic total mesorectal excision following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kidney disease is an epidemic that affects more than 600 million people worldwide.

Distillers can be used in diets as an effective source of protein and can reduce risk of acidosis by reducing the highly fermentable carbohydrate of starch. However, the price and availability of distillers grains are variable based on droughts, energy prices, and other factors. When inclusion of distillers grains in diets becomes uneconomical or is not possible, diets may decrease in crude protein and increase in starch-altering rumen fermentation parameters and feeding behavior. The effect of distillers grains on cattle growth performance and carcass traits has been studied extensively, but little is known about how distillers inclusion affects feeding behavior. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to determine the effect of low inclusion levels of DDG on feeding behavior in heifers consuming a high-moisture corn-based diet in the finishing phase. This study demonstrated that low inclusion levels of distillers grains has little effect on growth performance, but can alter feeding behavior and reduce variability in feeding behavior traits. ABSTRACT: The objective was to determine the effect of low inclusion levels of dried distillers grains (DDG) on feeding behavior in heifers consuming a high-moisture corn-based diet in the finishing phase. Simmental  Angus heifers (N = 90; 323  50 kg) were fed for 180 d. Heifers were blocked by initial body weight (BW) into two groups, stratified by sire, and assigned to 15 pens with six heifers each. Pens were randomly assigned to one of three dietary treatments: 0% DDG inclusion (0DG), 7% DDG inclusion (7DG), or 14% DDG inclusion (14DG). Treatments did not affect (p > 0.59) BW, average daily gain, and gain:feed. Although there was a treatment  time effect (p = 0.05) for dry matter intake (DMI), with 0DG having greater DMI during the last 70 d, no differences in overall DMI were detected. Treatment affected (p < 0.01) bunk visit duration and head down duration, with 7DG and 14DG having less minutes per day. Bunk visit frequency (p = 0.02) was less variable for heifers fed 14DG and DMI tended (p = 0.08) to be less variable for both distillers treatments. While dietary inclusion of DDG has minimal effects on overall heifer performance, low levels of DDG inclusion can affect feeding behavior and intake variation.","output":"Investigating the Effects of Distillers Grains on Heifer Feeding Behavior in the Finishing Phase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to analyze the contribution of the National School Feeding Program (PNAE), in the fight against hunger and food insecurity (FI) and to propose a set of strategies to guarantee that students will continue to receive food during the COVID-19 pandemic Diagnosis of FI and hunger in Brazil was carried out, analyzing the weakening of Food and Nutritional Security Policies, considering the historical evolution of PNAE and its current situation, and from this analysis, a set of proposals were drawn up, assessing their impacts on the PNAEs budget We present the following strategies for the period of school closures: distribution of meals for students, maintaining, if possible, the universal character of the policy or benefiting students from families eligible to receive Emergency Aid due to COVID-19;expand the amount transferred by the PNAE to municipalities with a low and very low Human Development Index (HDI) and;maintenance and incentive to purchase food from family farming When schools re-open, we suggest the following strategies: FI survey among students;maintenance of the equity of the policy by expanding the transfer amount to municipalities with low and very low HDI, and;attendance of students from families in FI during the vacations ? 2020, Fundacao Getulio Vargas All rights reserved","output":"National school feeding program: Strategies to overcome food insecurities during and after the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anxiety associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and home confinement has been associated with adverse health behaviors, such as unhealthy eating, smoking, and drinking.

Larger proportions of people with toddlers reported reduced overall productivity (63% v 32%; P = 0.008), and reduced productivity in writing manuscripts (50% v 17%; P = 0.023) and data analysis (63% v 23%; P = 0.002). People with primary school children more frequently reported reduced productivity in writing manuscripts (42% v 16%; P = 0.026) and generating new ideas (43% v 19%; P = 0.030). On a positive note, the presence of children in the home was not associated with changes in mental health during the pandemic. In contrast to established researchers, early career researchers frequently reported reduced productivity while working at home. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are probably applicable to scientists in other countries. They may help improve work-from-home policies by removing the stigma associated with pyjama wearing during work and by providing support for working parents and early career researchers.","output":"Scientists in pyjamas: characterising the working arrangements and productivity of Australian medical researchers during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cities are currently the primary source of climate change.

In addition to mechanical barriers and a variety of innate defense factors, mucosal immunoglobulins (Igs) provide protection by two complementary mechanisms: specific antibody activity and innate, Ig glycan-mediated binding, both of which serve to contain the mucosal microbiota in its physiological niche. Thus, the interaction of bacterial ligands with IgA glycans constitutes a discrete mechanism that is independent of antibody specificity and operates primarily in the intestinal tract. This mucosal site is by far the most heavily colonized with an enormously diverse bacterial population, as well as the most abundant production site for antibodies, predominantly of the IgA isotype, in the entire immune system. In embodying both adaptive and innate immune mechanisms within a single molecule, S-IgA maintains comprehensive protection of mucosal surfaces with economy of structure and function.","output":"Specific antibody activity, glycan heterogeneity and polyreactivity contribute to the protective activity of S-IgA at mucosal surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To develop a comprehensive diagnostic system for mucormycosis from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, consisting of own-designed real-time PCR assays, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical staining. METHODS We designed 11 primers and probes for specific real-time PCR assays based on genome sequences, and validated the specificity by Aspergillus, Fusarium, Scedosporium, Lomentospora, Cryptococcus and Candida species. FFPE tissues from forty-four mouse model infected by above fungi were collected and extracted DNA by laser capture microdissection (LCM) and direct extraction methods for real-time PCR assays. In addition, seventeen clinical specimens histopathologically proven for mucormycosis were included for specific detection with the new diagnostic system. RESULTS The real-time PCR assays allowed detection of a minimum of 10 CFU/ml equivalent gDNA of each species. No cross-reaction with gDNA among species was noted. From mouse model specimens, the sensitivity of real-time PCR in samples extracted with LCM vs. direct extraction method was 100% vs. 91.43% at Mucorales level and 80% vs. 45.71% at species level, respectively. The specificity was 100%. From clinical samples, LCM combined with real-time PCR can test 88.24% (15/17) of Mucorales. Sensitivities of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemical staining (IHC) were 70.59% and 41.18%, respectively. Combined LCM-RT-PCR, FISH and IHC yielded positive results in all samples. CONCLUSIONS The combination diagnostic system we developed is a culture-independent and robust method which enables rapid species identification from FFPE tissues for timely diagnosis of mucormycosis.","output":"The use of combined PCR, fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining to diagnose mucormycosis from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the comparative effectiveness of the different endovascular treatments in patients with failing autogenous arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) with outflow vein stenosis.

Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effectiveness of plain balloon angioplasty (PBA), cutting balloon angioplasty (CtBA) and drug coated balloon angioplasty (DCBA) in autogenous AVFs vein stenoses were performed; studies on central vein stenoses were excluded. The main outcome measures were failure rates at 6-months and 1-year. RESULTS: Eleven RCTs were included reporting a total of 814 patients and 395 out of them underwent PBA. Network meta-analysis showed that DCBA at 6-months was significantly more effective than PBA [Odds ratio (OR): 0.39, Confidence Intervals (CI):0.18-0.81] and ranked as the best treatment option, but without having statistically significant difference when compared with CtBA (OR: 0.65, CI: 0.20-2.12).

Currently, to our knowledge, there is no effective pharmacologic prophylaxis for individuals at risk. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital-based HCWs with exposure to patients with COVID-19 using a pre-exposure prophylaxis strategy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 With Hydroxychloroquine Study) was conducted at 2 tertiary urban hospitals, with enrollment from April 9, 2020, to July 14, 2020; follow-up ended August 4, 2020. The trial randomized 132 full-time, hospital-based HCWs (physicians, nurses, certified nursing assistants, emergency technicians, and respiratory therapists), of whom 125 were initially asymptomatic and had negative results for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab. The trial was terminated early for futility before reaching a planned enrollment of 200 participants. Interventions: Hydroxychloroquine, 600 mg, daily, or size-matched placebo taken orally for 8 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by a nasopharyngeal swab during the 8 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects, treatment discontinuation, presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, frequency of QTc prolongation, and clinical outcomes for SARS-CoV-2-positive participants. Results: Of the 132 randomized participants (median age, 33 years [range, 20-66 years]; 91 women [69%]), 125 (94.7%) were evaluable for the primary outcome. There was no significant difference in infection rates in participants randomized to receive hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo (4 of 64 [6.3%] vs 4 of 61 [6.6%]; P > .99). Mild adverse events were more common in participants taking hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo (45% vs 26%; P = .04); rates of treatment discontinuation were similar in both arms (19% vs 16%; P = .81). The median change in QTc (baseline to 4-week evaluation) did not differ between arms (hydroxychloroquine: 4 milliseconds; 95% CI, -9 to 17; vs placebo: 3 milliseconds; 95% CI, -5 to 11; P = .98). Of the 8 participants with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 (6.4%), 6 developed viral symptoms; none required hospitalization, and all clinically recovered. Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, although limited by early termination, there was no clinical benefit of hydroxychloroquine administered daily for 8 weeks as pre-exposure prophylaxis in hospital-based HCWs exposed to patients with COVID-19.

The support they provided, and any role changes, during the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown. Aims: To understand volunteer deployment and activities within palliative care services, and to identify what may affect any changes in volunteer service provision, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Multi-national online survey disseminated via key stakeholders to specialist palliative care services, completed by lead clinicians. Data collected on volunteer roles, deployment, and changes in volunteer engagement. Analysis included descriptive statistics, a multivariable logistic regression, and analysis of free-text comments using a content analysis approach. Results: 458 respondents: 277 UK, 85 rest of Europe, and 95 rest of the world. 68.5% indicated volunteer use pre-COVID-19. These were across a number of roles (from 458): direct patient/family facing support (58.7%), indirect support (e.g. driving) (52.0%), back office (48.5%) and fundraising (45.6%). 11% had volunteers with COVID-19. Of those responding to a question on change in volunteer deployment (328 of 458) most (256/328, 78%) indicated less or much less use of volunteers. Less use of volunteers was associated with being an in-patient hospice, (OR=0.15, 95%CI = 0.07-0.3 p<.001). This reduction in volunteers was felt to protect potentially vulnerable volunteers and with policy changes preventing volunteers from supporting services. However, adapting was also seen where new roles were created, or existing roles pivoted to provide virtual support. Discussion and conclusion: Volunteers were mostly prevented from supporting many forms of palliative care, particularly in in-patient hospices, which may have quality and safety implications given their previously central roles. Volunteer re-deployment plans are needed that take a more considered approach, using volunteers more flexibly to enhance care while ensuring safe working practices.

Such information is key for the industry to develop resilience against future pandemics and other natural disasters. Document and critical discourse analysis was used in gathering and analysing data. The findings show that most sporting events were either cancelled or postponed during the peak of the pandemic because of COVID-19 containment measures across the world, such as travel bans and port closures. Many sports governing bodies were also bankrupted and left in financial distress. Individual athletes lost income as their salaries were reduced or completely cut. Sponsors, betting firms, broadcasters and others in the sports value chain also incurred huge losses during this period. Among the key events affected were the 2020 Olympics, football leagues, golf, cricket, marathons, rugby and tennis. As such, there was a need for bailout packages and seeking alternatives for the sports industry to recover from the shock.

An oxaliplatin-resistant cell line was constructed to evaluate the effect of LDB1 in drug sensitivity of CRC cells. Results: Our current research confirmed that LDB1 was upregulated in CRC tumor tissues, and its elevation predicted a poor prognosis for CRC patients. LDB1 was also found positively correlated with CCNA1, BCL2 and BCLW, but negatively correlated with the pro-apoptotic signals (BID, BAX and BAK). Silence of LDB1 significantly inhibited CRC cell growth in vitro, and CRC cells with low expression of LDB1 had a lower tumorigenesis rate in tumor-bearing nude mice. Our experiments also showed that LDB1 silence enhanced the anti-tumor activity of oxaliplatin in CRC cells. The expression of LDB1 was also found increased in oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cell lines, and silence of LDB1 partly restored the antitumor effect of oxaliplatin in an oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cell line.

The disease is characterized by increased dyspnoea, sputum volume and sputum purulence; the most commonly associated pathogens are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae express virulence determinants that directly and indirectly impair mucociliary clearance and incite other consequences that are permissive to microbial persistence. Regarding the use of antibiotics, there is currently a lack of large-scale clinical trials that are sufficiently powerful to provide good evidence-based information. Nonetheless, antimicrobial chemotherapy has repeatedly been shown to confer benefit in patients with moderately severe features of AECB. Simple clinical criteria can be used to identify patients in whom there is a higher likelihood of treatment failure or mortality during AECB. These include significant cardiopulmonary co-morbidity, frequent exacerbations, advanced decline in lung function, malnutrition or other generalized debility, advanced age (> 70 years) and concurrent treatment with corticosteroids. In such patients, an aggressive antimicrobial approach to AECB may be warranted in order to prevent clinical failure or representation.

For the prevention and treatment of COVID19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, T cell responses are important in mediating recovery and immune-protection. The identification of immunogenic epitopes that can elicit a meaningful T cell response can be elusive. Traditionally, this has been achieved using sophisticated in silico methods to predict putative epitopes; however, our previous studies find that immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 peptides defined by such in silico methods often fail to elicit T cell responses recognizing SARS-CoV-2. We postulated that immunogenic epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 are best defined by directly analyzing peptides eluted from the peptide-MHC complex and then validating immunogenicity empirically by determining if such peptides can elicit T cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2 antigen-expressing cells. Using a tandem mass spectrometry approach, we identified epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 derived not only from structural but also non-structural genes in regions highly conserved among SARS-CoV-2 strains including recently recognized variants. We report here, for the first time, several novel SARS-CoV-2 epitopes from membrane glycol-protein (MGP) and non-structure protein-13 (NSP13) defined by mass-spectrometric analysis of MHC-eluted peptides, provide empiric evidence for their immunogenicity to induce T cell response. Significance Statement Current state of the art uses putative epitope peptides based on in silico prediction algorithms to evaluate the T cell response among COVID-19 patients. However, none of these peptides have been tested for immunogenicity, i.e. the ability to elicit a T cell response capable of recognizing endogenously presented peptide. In this study, we used MHC immune-precipitation, acid elution and tandem mass spectrometry to define the SARS-CoV-2 immunopeptidome for membrane glycol-protein and the non-structural protein.

OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to demonstrate the relationship between essential blood proteins and the major SARS-CoV-2 proteins by network pharmacology bioinformatics analysis. METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis was used to establish eight differentially expressed gene hubs in leukemia through differential gene screening, proteinCprotein interaction network analysis, and gene enrichment analysis. Molecular docking analysis was also conducted to dock the two up-regulated proteins with the spike glycoprotein in leukemia and the critical protease enzyme (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We identified two up-regulated genes (PTPRC and BCL6) among the eight differentially expressed genes. The PTPRC and BCL6 also docked perfectly with the main SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: This study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to affect with the blood in patients with chronic leukemia. Therefore, patients with chronic leukemia require greater medical attention and precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods Nitazoxanide is a mild uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, which is modulating the ATP production in cells. ATP is an essential component of viral replication, and we have evaluated the effect of tizoxanide (TIZ), the active circulating metabolite of NTZ, on ATP in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and in MDCK cells infected with influenza A and B viruses. Results TIZ decreased cellular ATP in a dose-dependent manner in MDCK cells and in MDCK cells infected with influenza A and B viruses. Maximum inhibition of ATP in influenza infected or uninfected MDCK cells reached up to 45% after 6 and 24 hours of exposure to 100M TIZ. The decrease in cellular ATP did not affect cell viability and was reversible after eliminating TIZ from the culture. Conclusion The concentrations of TIZ required to decrease cellular ATP levels were similar to those reported to inhibit replication of influenza A and B viruses in our laboratory. A decrease in ATP triggers activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, which is known to suppress the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

In spite of recent crystallographic structures, little is known about the molecular changes induced by the temperature.

Furthermore, both the closed down and open up conformational states, which affect the accessibility of receptor binding domain, have been considered. Our results suggest that the spike homotrimer undergoes drastic changes in the topology of the hydrogen bonding interactions and important changes on the secondary structure of the receptor binding domain (RBD), while electrostatic interactions (i.e. salt bridges) are mainly preserved.

Surprisingly, mitochondrial respiratory capacity was increased in PBMCs from rats with IDA compared to the controls. In contrast, mitochondrial respiration remained unaffected in livers from IDA rats. Of note, citrate synthase activity indicated an increased mitochondrial density in PBMCs, whereas it remained unchanged in the liver, partly explaining the different responses of mitochondrial respiration in PBMCs and the liver.

It explored the social, emotional, and financial impact of caring for an adolescent with SCD on their caregivers. STUDY DESIGN: A mixed-method study in a major tertiary care hospital in Bahrain was conducted between June and August 2019. Cross-sectional questionnaires and thematic analyzed interviews were performed with 101 and 18 Bahraini caregivers of adolescents with SCD (aged 10C18 years), respectively. RESULTS: Lack of parking lots (52.5%) and traffic jams (27%) were identified as the most common challenges in seeking hospital care for adolescents with SCD. These difficulties, including prolonged waiting in the emergency room, discouraged more than half of the caregivers who preferred to seek care from smaller healthcare centers. Most caregivers reported receiving a high degree of support from their families, who emotionally encouraged them to facilitate patient care (73.3%). Therefore, their relationships with their friends, colleagues, and relatives were not significantly affected. Catastrophic health expenditure occurred in 14.8% of caregivers. Qualitative themes that emerged were A) the intricacy of caring for adolescents with SCD, B) dissatisfaction with hospital facilities, and C) insufficient healthcare services, wherein caregivers reported adolescents experiences with services during hospital visits. Subthemes for the intricacy of caring for adolescents with SCD were 1) the psychological tragedy, summarizing the initial caregivers feelings after the confirmed diagnosis, 2) caregiving hardships that described the caregivers emotional and health burden while accepting and adjusting to the disease, and 3) the cost of care on families, which highlights the financial burden of the disease on families. CONCLUSION: The caregivers of adolescents with SCD experienced several overwhelming challenges, including problems in accessing healthcare and receiving medical services, in addition to influences on the emotional, financial, and social aspects of their lives.","output":"Caregivers experience of seeking care for adolescents with sickle cell disease in a tertiary care hospital in Bahrain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for the most threatening pandemic in modern history.

Here, we compared renal tissue oximetry (rSrO?) with conventional diagnostic criteria cystatin C and creatinine concentration in children undergoing pLTx. MATERIAL AND METHODS rSrO? was measured intraoperatively in children undergoing pLTx over the left kidney, and was statistically compared with pre- and postoperative serum creatinine and cystatin C concentrations. RESULTS rSrO? was affected by hemoglobin concentration, bilirubin concentration, and FiO?. Statistical analysis demonstrated that rSrO? was significantly reduced in children with preoperative pathologic increased cystatin C concentrations compared to children without (63.74.3 vs. 53.44.9, p<0.05). We did not detect a significant difference in rSrO? between children who developed postoperative renal impairment, either determined by increased postoperative cystatin C concentration, creatinine concentration, or the pRIFLE criteria. Intraoperative increase or decrease in rSrO? did not predict the development of postoperative kidney injury.

We tested the possibility that qualitative differences in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody-mediated innate immune functions contribute to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity. We found that anti-S1 and anti-RBD antibodies from hospitalized COVID-19 patients elicited higher ADCD but lower ADCP compared to antibodies from nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients.

As a result, in North America and elsewhere, older adults have been strongly advised to shelter in place. Older adults also represent the fastest growing segment of licensed drivers. OBJECTIVE: We examined the change in injuries and fatalities sustained by younger and older drivers and pedestrians during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that adults ages 80 years and over would have a proportionally larger reduction than the other drivers and pedestrians. METHODS: Using a cohort design, we compared the proportion of drivers and pedestrians involved in injuries and fatalities attributable to individuals aged 80 years and over, as recorded in the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (Canada) database, between the 30 days prior to shelter-in-place related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent 30 days. By way of comparison, we conducted a similar comparison for younger age cohorts (16-24 years, 25-34 years, 35-54 years, 55-64 years, and 65-79 years). RESULTS: Drivers aged 80 years and over represented 21 per 1000 injuries and fatalities in the 30 days prior to March 17, 2020 (95 % CI: 15-29), and 8 per 1000 injuries and fatalities in the 30 days beginning on that date (95 % CI: 2-20), a 64.7 % reduction (exp (?) post 0.353, 95 % CI 0.105-0.892). Drivers in the 35-54 year age range underwent a significant but smaller reduction of 22.9 %; no significant changes were seen for drivers in other age groups, or for pedestrians of any age. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The physical distancing measures that aimed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 resulted in a marked reduction in driver injuries and fatalities in the oldest old, illustrating the impact of physical distancing recommendations in this population. The excess mortality burden faced by the oldest adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, by direct exposure to the virus, may be indirectly mitigated by the reduction in road-related deaths in this cohort.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on motor vehicle injuries and fatalities in older adults in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Although the respiratory and immune systems are the major targets of SARS-CoV-2, increasing evidence revealed that kidney injury was not rare in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods: : In this retrospective single center cohort study, laboratory confirmedCOVID-19inpatients with severe type were enrolled. Demographic, clinicaland laboratory data were collected. Association ofserum creatinine (SCr)with 28-days mortality in severe COVID-19 patients was analyzed. Results: : 18.79% (48/304) patients died during the first 28-days of hospitalization.Non-survivors had a significantly higher SCr levels than survivors (109.27mol/L vs. 69.99mol/L, P <0.001). The 28-days mortality in high SCr group (>76mol/L) was significantly higher than that in low SCr group (31.7% vs. 7.5%, P <0.001). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the independent risk factors of 28-days outcome included age(OR: 2.95, 95%CI: 1.08-8.05), WBC (OR: 6.09, 95%CI: 2.27-6.39), lymphopenia (OR: 3.49, 95%CI: 1.55-7.92), IL-6 (OR: 4.44, 95%CI: 1.64-11.99) and SCr (OR: 2.69, 95%CI: 1.18-6.11).

The COVID-19 Evidence Accelerator convened by the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA, in collaboration with Friends of Cancer Research, assembled experts from the health systems research, regulatory science, data science, and epidemiology to participate in a large parallel analysis of different data sets to further explore the effectiveness of these treatments. METHODS: Electronic health record (EHR) and claims data were extracted from seven separate databases. Parallel analyses were undertaken on data extracted from each source. Each analysis examined time to mortality in hospitalized patients treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and the two in combination as compared to patients not treated with either drug. Cox proportional hazards models were used, and propensity score methods were undertaken to adjust for confounding. Frequencies of adverse events in each treatment group were also examined. RESULTS: Neither hydroxychloroquine nor azithromycin, alone or in combination, were significantly associated with time to mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. No treatment groups appeared to have an elevated risk of adverse events. CONCLUSION: Administration of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and their combination appeared to have no effect on time to mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

METHODS Materials (1 cm2) were implanted subcutaneously into 6-week-old Wistar rats (4 materials per animal, n=6/material per time point) for 2, 5, 7, 14 and 28 days. Histologic processing was carried out after resin infiltration, observing classical histopathology and pathologic indexing. Materials comprised 6 tissue-based grafts covering both experimental and commercial porcine decellularised dermal and small intestinal submucosal materials. RESULTS Subcutaneous delivery of biologics demonstrated material-specific inflammatory/host responses. Controlled variations of the PermacolTM manufacturing process showed sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was the most proinflammatory decellularisation reagent, and HMDI cross-linking had no effect on host response. All materials remained recoverable after 28 days, although SurgisisTM had partially resorbed.

In older patients with cancer, quality of life is important because anti-cancer treatment may influence their quality of life. In order to assess the aspects of quality of life that matter most to older patients with cancer, we interviewed 63 patients. We used both open-ended questions and asked them to select the most important items from a predefined list: cognition, contact with family or with community, independence, staying in your own home, helping others, having enough energy, emotional well-being, life satisfaction, religion and leisure activities. Physical functioning, social functioning, physical health and cognition are important components of quality of life. In conclusion, maintaining cognition and independence, staying in ones own home, and maintaining contact with family and community appear to be the most important aspects of quality of life for older patients with cancer. These aspects should be included when making a shared treatment decision. ABSTRACT: The treatment of cancer can have a significant impact on quality of life in older patients and this needs to be taken into account in decision making. However, quality of life can consist of many different components with varying importance between individuals. We set out to assess how older patients with cancer define quality of life and the components that are most significant to them. This was a single-centre, qualitative interview study. Patients aged 70 years or older with cancer were asked to answer open-ended questions: What makes life worthwhile? What does quality of life mean to you? What could affect your quality of life? Subsequently, they were asked to choose the five most important determinants of quality of life from a predefined list: cognition, contact with family or with community, independence, staying in your own home, helping others, having enough energy, emotional well-being, life satisfaction, religion and leisure activities. Afterwards, answers to the open-ended questions were independently categorized by two authors. The proportion of patients mentioning each category in the open-ended questions were compared to the predefined questions. Overall, 63 patients (median age 76 years) were included. When asked, What makes life worthwhile?, patients identified social functioning (86%) most frequently. Moreover, to define quality of life, patients most frequently mentioned categories in the domains of physical functioning (70%) and physical health (48%). Maintaining cognition was mentioned in 17% of the open-ended questions and it was the most commonly chosen option from the list of determinants (72% of respondents). In conclusion, physical functioning, social functioning, physical health and cognition are important components in quality of life. When discussing treatment options, the impact of treatment on these aspects should be taken into consideration.","output":"What Defines Quality of Life for Older Patients Diagnosed with Cancer?

The microscopic architecture of the prostate glands forms the basis for prognostic grading by pathologists. Interpretation of these convoluted 3D glandular structures via visual inspection of a limited number of 2D histology sections is often unreliable, which contributes to the under- and over-treatment of patients. To improve risk assessment and treatment decisions, we have developed a workflow for non-destructive 3D pathology and computational analysis of whole prostate biopsies labeled with a rapid and inexpensive fluorescent analog of standard H&E staining. This analysis is based on interpretable glandular features and is facilitated by the development of image-translation-assisted segmentation in 3D (ITAS3D).

This study aimed to investigate the characterization of metastable rutin-ethanolate and its solubility and oral bioavailability. In this research, a soluble rutin/CH3CH2OH solvate (Form ) was prepared by solvent crystallization. High-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatograph, and 1H-NMR showed that Form  was formed by rutin and ethanol in a molar ratio of 1:1. The changes of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 1H-NMR spectrum and the density functional theory (DFT) calculation predicted hydrogen bond formation between 4'-O of rutin and -OH of ethanol. The results of morphology, solid state CP/MAS 13C-NMR, X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed that Form  is a novel polymorph that differs from Form  (rutin trihydrate). Form  can be stored for a long time under sealed and dry conditions at 40C but would gradually transform into Form  under humid conditions. Although Form  is a new metastable polymorph relative to Form , Form  has better solubility and faster dissolution rate. Moreover, the bioavailability of Form  was 2.04 times higher than that of Form .

The occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 has been reported to be as high as 43%. This is comparable to AKI in other forms of pneumonia requiring hospitalization, as well as in non-infectious conditions like cardiac surgery. The impact of AKI on COVID-19 outcomes is difficult to assess at present but, similar to other forms of sepsis, AKI is strongly associated with hospital mortality. Indeed, mortality is reported to be very low in COVID-19 patients without AKI. Given that AKI contributes to fluid and acid-base imbalances, compromises immune response and may impair resolution of inflammation, it seems likely that AKI contributes to mortality in these patients. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of AKI in COVID-19 are thought to be multifactorial including systemic immune and inflammatory responses induced by viral infection, systemic tissue hypoxia, reduced renal perfusion, endothelial damage and direct epithelial infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. Mitochondria play a central role in the metabolic deregulation in the adaptive response to the systemic inflammation and are also found to be vital in response to both direct viral damage and tissue reperfusion. These stress conditions are associated with increased glycolysis and reduced fatty acid oxidation. Thus, there is a strong rationale to target AKI for therapy in COVID-19. Furthermore, many approaches that have been developed for other etiologies of AKI such as sepsis, inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion, have relevance in the treatment of COVID-19 AKI and could be rapidly pivoted to this new disease.","output":"Targeting acute kidney injury in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kasus COVID-19 di Indonesia semakin meningkat dan masyarakat wajib mematuhi protokol kesehatan untuk mencegah penularan COVID-19 di Era New Normal seperti menggunakan Hand Sanitizer.

IL-1 and IL-1 are powerful apical cytokines that instigate multiple downstream processes to affect both innate and adaptive immunity. Multiple studies show that IL-1 is typically activated in macrophages after inflammasome sensing of infection or danger, leading to caspase-1 processing of IL-1 and its release. However, many alternative mechanisms activate IL-1 and IL-1 in atypical cell types, and IL-1 function is also important for homeostatic processes that maintain a physiological state. This review focuses on the less studied, yet arguably more interesting biology of IL-1. We detail the production by, and effects of IL-1 on specific innate and adaptive immune cells, report how IL-1 is required for barrier function at multiple sites, and discuss how perturbation of IL-1 pathways can drive disease. Thus, although IL-1 is primarily studied for driving inflammation after release from macrophages, it is clear that it has a multifaceted role that extends far beyond this, with various unconventional effects of IL-1 vital for health. However, much is still unknown, and a detailed understanding of cell-type and context-dependent actions of IL-1 is required to truly understand this enigmatic cytokine, and safely deploy therapeutics for the betterment of human health.","output":"Alternative Pathways of IL-1 Activation, and Its Role in Health and Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mitochondria are classically termed as powerhouse of a mammalian cell.

ELSO recommends modest driving pressures and PEEP (i.e., lung rest) during ECMO to minimize ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) and improve mortality. However, even lower driving pressures (DP) may improve inflammatory and lung injury biomarker profiles, and possibly improve mortality. The focus of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and impact of very-low DP in patients with ARDS on ECMO. Methods: Patients on ECMO due to ARDS from coronavirus disease 2019 had their DP decreased from 10 to 1-5 cmH2O for two hours, as tolerated. The other ventilator settings were unchanged and were consistent with ELSO guidelines;positive end-expiratory pressure (10-15 cmH2O) and a respiratory rate 10 breaths per minute. During the low DP protocol, the transpulmonary pressure was monitored with esophageal manometry. Plasma (for IL6 and sRAGE) and urine were collected before and after the protocol. Results: Thirty patients were enrolled and ultimately 21 patients underwent the low DP protocol. Seventeen were male, aged 51  9 years, median BMI of 31.7 kg/m2 (IQR 27.4-35.2), with a median SOFA score of 10 (IQR 8-12) at ICU admission. There were no complications during the low DP protocol (1-5 cm H2O). The protocol was performed a median of 16 (IQR 13.5-20) hours after ECMO initiation. Average ECMO days were 21 (IQR 12.5-41) with a survival to hospital discharge of 43% (9/21). Baseline average tidal volume (TV) was 3.42.6 ml/kg of predicted body weight (PBW), during the low DP protocol the TV decreased to 2.73.2 ml/kg of PDW. Two groups were noted-those who had spontaneous breaths vs. those who did not (see Figure 1). Ten patients during the low DP protocol continued to have unchanged TV, 5.22.8 to 5.42.7 ml/kg of PBW due to spontaneous breathing found on esophageal manometry. Eleven patients had no spontaneous breaths and TV decreased from 1.760.57 to 0.20.38 ml/kg of PBW during the low DP protocol. The spontaneous vs. nonspontaneous breathing groups has a statistically different TV before, during, and after the low DP protocol (p&lt;0.001). Conclusions: Very-low DP is feasible in patients on ECMO support which may decrease VILI. However, in the absence of neuromuscular blockade patients might spontaneously breathe with the same transpulmonary pressure. Thus, whether low DP offers any advantage in spontaneous breathing vs. non-spontaneous breathing requires further study.

Peripheral blood neutrophils were isolated and stimulated in vitro with phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA) as a marker for activation and reactivity of the neutrophils. After isolation, both the viability and CD11b expression were analyzed by flow cytometry. Both NETosis by neutrophil elastase-DNA complex system and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were evaluated by ELISA. The specific antibodies against MPO and citrullination of Histone-H1 were used for investigating NETosis by immunofluorescence microscopy. The neutrophil elastase-DNA complexes produced during NETosis and MPO activity of neutrophil extracts were affected by OP supplementation. Furthermore, results from immunofluorescence analysis of NETosis depicted a similar result found by ELISA showing a higher expression of MPO and citrullination of Histone-H1 in OP than the CON neutrophils. In addition, all data showed that the OP diet resulted in a better response of neutrophils to PMA stimulation than the CON diet, which did not support the neutrophils' responses to PMA stimulation.

FAP is of special interest because it is expressed exclusively in activated, pathogenic fibroblasts and has been proposed as a target for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell ablation therapy. It has been shown previously that fibroblasts from patients with hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy express FAP, while fibroblasts from non-failing hearts did not. The aim of the project was to examine FAP expression in other human cardiac diseases by obtaining heart samples from patients who suffered diseases characterized by cardiac fibrosis so that we could determine which cardiac diseases might be amenable to FAP CAR T therapy. In addition, we sought to characterize an in vitro model of FAP expression to aid in the ability to assess the effectiveness of engineered T cells to kill FAP-expressing cells. Heart tissue from patients diagnosed with various cardiac disorders, including idiopathic giant cell myocarditis, COVID-19, and sarcoidosis were stained for FAP expression and compared to non-failing, control hearts. The results showed significant FAP expression in all cardiac specimens with interstitial fibrosis compared to non-failing hearts.

Dengue virus is a member of the Flaviviridae family, and human infection can be caused by any of the four antigenically distinct serotypes (DENV 1C4). The infection has become recognized as the most important and prevalent arboviral disease in humans, endemic in almost 100 countries worldwide. Nearly 3 billion people live in areas with transmission risk. Autochthonous transmission of the virus in previously disease-free areas, increased incidence in endemic areas, and epidemic resurgence in controlled regions could increase the risk of contracting more severe forms of the disease, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Symptomatic dengue virus infection can present with a wide range of clinical manifestations, from mild fever to life-threatening DSS. Thoracic complications may manifest as pleural effusion, pneumonitis, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and hemorrhage/hemoptysis. No vaccine is currently available and no specific treatment for dengue fever exists, but prevention and prompt management of complications in patients with DHF can help reduce mortality.

Perceptions of these guidelines were assessed as part of the dissemination process with community-based organizations in 2019. METHODS: Fifteen dissemination workshops were held with community-based organization representatives and a range of stakeholders. Discussions were held with workshop attendees (n = 281) to obtain qualitative feedback on the guidelines and workshop. Six follow-up focus groups (n = 28) were conducted to obtain additional feedback on the guidelines and their dissemination. Discussions and focus groups were thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Participants recognized the importance of the guidelines for the health and development of young South African children. Participants' perceptions of the guidelines were consistently positive. The participants acknowledged the alignment of the guidelines with other South African programs and initiatives, and that they addressed gaps. Screen time and sleep were identified as the behaviors needing particular attention among young South African children. The negative impact of COVID-19 on young children's movement behaviors was acknowledged, especially regarding screen time.

Previous interventions have failed to produce changes in adherence, address patient preferences or include theoretically informed and evidence-based components. Therefore, we iteratively developed a patient-centred, evidence-based, small-group, videoconference intervention to improve adherence and symptom management as well as reduce distress for patients taking AET after breast cancer (Symptom-Targeted Randomised Intervention for Distress and Adherence to Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy, STRIDE). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The current study is a non-blinded, randomised, controlled, feasibility trial of STRIDE compared with a medication monitoring control group. The primary objective is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of STRIDE, while secondary objectives are to assess changes in objective and subjective adherence, symptom distress and satisfaction with AET. Patients will be recruited from the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in Boston, Massachusetts. The total number of patients accrued will be 75, with 60 patients completing the study. All patients will store their AET in an electronic pill bottle for objective adherence monitoring. Patients randomly assigned to the STRIDE intervention will receive 6 weekly 1-hour sessions, in small groups of two, delivered via videoconferencing by a trained mental health professional. Patients assigned to the control group will store their medication in the electronic pill bottle and receive follow-up oncology care as usual.

The association of inflammatory biomarkers with outcomes and impact of changes in immunosuppression on biomarker levels are unknown. METHODS: We investigated factors associated with a composite of AKI, ICU admission, or death, and whether immunosuppression changes correlated with changes in inflammatory biomarkers and outcomes in kidney transplant recipients with a positive SARS-CoV2 PCR. RESULTS: Of 59 patients, 50% had eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Patients who discontinued calcineurin-inhibitors (CNI) had higher peak hsCRP than those who maintained the same dose, median (IQR) 344 (145-374) vs. 41 (22-116) mg/L, p=0.03. 73% were hospitalized, 22% had ICU admissions, and 20% died. 56% had AKI, of which 35% required dialysis. All with AKI but without pulmonary manifestations recovered to 10% of baseline creatinine. Factors associated with the composite outcome were eGFR<60, OR (95% CI)=5.833 (1.880-18.099), p=0.002, hsCRP, OR=1.011 per unit increase (1.002-1.021), p=0.019, WBC, OR=1.173 per unit increase (1.006-1.368), p=0.041, and having CNI decreased or discontinued, OR=4.286 (1.353-13.572), p=0.013. eGFR<60, OR=11.176 (1.581-79.001), p=0.016, and peak hsCRP, OR =1.010 per unit increase (1.000-1.020), p=0.049 remained associated with the composite in the multivariable model.

Neurotrauma/traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause activation of glial cells, neurons, and neuroimmune cells in the brain to release neuroinflammatory mediators. Neurotrauma leads to immediate primary brain damage (direct damage), neuroinflammatory responses, neuroinflammation, and late secondary brain damage (indirect) through neuroinflammatory mechanism. Secondary brain damage leads to chronic inflammation and the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, there are no effective and specific therapeutic options to treat these brain damages or neurodegenerative diseases.

Recent reports suggest that luteolin suppresses systemic and neuroinflammatory responses in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Studies have shown that luteolin exhibits neuroprotective effects through various mechanisms, including suppressing immune cell activation, such as mast cells, and inflammatory mediators released from these cells. In addition, luteolin can suppress neuroinflammatory response, activation of microglia and astrocytes, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and the severity of neuroinflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and TBI pathogenesis.

We tested the hypothesis that persons receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) who self-identify as from racial/ethnic minority groups would experience more disruptions in access to harm reduction services than persons identifying as non-Hispanic White, even when controlling for severity of opioid use and sociodemographics (e.g., education, income, biological sex, age). METHODS: Analyses used data from a cluster randomized trial that had enrolled 188 patients, all of whom had provided baseline data on sociodemographics and severity of opioid use, across eight opioid treatment programs. Data collectors re-contacted participants between May and June 2020 and 133 (71% response rate) agreed to complete a survey about access to harm reduction services. RESULTS: Twenty-six respondents (20%) identified as from racial/ethnic minority groups (predominantly Black, Hispanic, and/or biracial).

Hardware developments have introduced directional leads to stimulate specific brain targets and sensing electrodes to determine optimal settings via feedback from local field potentials. In addition, variable-frequency stimulation and asynchronous high-frequency pulse trains have introduced new programming paradigms to efficiently desynchronize pathological neural circuitry and regulate dysfunctional brain networks not responsive to conventional settings. Overall, these innovations have provided clinicians with more anatomically accurate programming and closed-looped feedback to identify optimal strategies for neuromodulation. Simultaneously, software developments have simplified programming algorithms, introduced platforms for DBS remote management via telemedicine, and tools for estimating the volume of tissue activated within and outside the DBS targets. Finally, the surgical accuracy has improved thanks to intraoperative magnetic resonance or computerized tomography guidance, network-based imaging for DBS planning and targeting, and robotic-assisted surgery for ultra-accurate, millimetric lead placement. These technological and imaging advances have collectively optimized DBS outcomes and allowed asleep DBS procedures. Still, the short- and long-term outcomes of different implantable devices, surgical techniques, and asleep vs. awake procedures remain to be clarified.

Safe and effective therapies are urgently needed. METHODS: Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19 (TICO), is a global multi-arm, multi-stage (MAMS) platform master protocol, which facilitates the rapid evaluation of the safety and efficacy of candidate anti-viral therapeutic agents for adults hospitalized with COVID-19. The protocol design allows multiple therapeutic agents to be evaluated in an efficient and scientifically rigorous manner, with efficiencies delivered by the MAMS design, and began by studying neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. TICO employs an agile and robust approach to futility and safety evaluation at 300 patients enrolled (Stage 1), with subsequent expansion to full sample size and an expanded target population (Stage 2) if the agent shows an acceptable safety profile and evidence of efficacy. Two ordinal outcomes applied early (Day 5) determine the efficacy signals of the investigational agents(s) and progression to Stage 2. These ordinal outcomes assess both respiratory and other organ failure events, recognizing the broad range of COVID-19 morbidity. In Stage 2, overall efficacy is assessed using the primary outcome of time to sustained recovery assessed over 90 days. This approach to early futility assessment using an early intermediate outcome and a primary endpoint out to 90 days allows the study team to make rapid decisions on safety and potential efficacy of novel agents while ultimately focusing on patient-centered, longer-term outcomes. The implementation of TICO across a global network allows for continued enrollment despite variations in geographic epidemiology. STUDY STATUS: The TICO master protocol moved from conception to first patient enrolled in approximately 9 weeks, a testament to the expedited regulatory and ethics review, coupled with flexible and responsive study operations. The first agent to be tested using this protocol, LY-CoV-555, enrolled N=326 participants before undergoing Stage 1 futility and safety assessment. Two additional agents will enter the study in November 2020, with other agents planned. CONCLUSION: The TICO MAMS platform trial has been implemented efficiently across a global network of sites and several trial networks. It will generate results rapidly for multiple novel neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and other therapeutics agents.","output":"Design and implementation of the multi-arm, multi-stage Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19 (TICO) platform master protocol: An Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) initiative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information on the interactive effects of methylprednisolone, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV), and assisted mechanical ventilation (AMV) on diaphragm function is sparse.

Toward restraining rumor outbreak in OSN, one of the effective containment measures is to block influential users to minimize the spread of rumors. However, most of previous efforts ignore the imbalance between the cost and effect of rumor suppression. To fill this gap, from the perspective of public opinion crisis, a dynamic rumor spread model called PISIR model is established, which takes into account the overall popularity and individual tendency of rumors. Based on this model, two rumor blocking algorithms considering outbreak threshold and user experience, called 1-Hop and 2-Hop RBOTUE algorithms, are proposed, respectively. In the algorithms, a hyperbolic discount effect-based user experience mode is introduced as the constraint to ensure the user experience in OSN, then the blocking strategy is implemented on the selected subset of nodes to keep the rumor spread scale always below the outbreak warning line. The experimental results in two synthetic networks and four real OSNs indicate that both 1-Hop and 2-Hop RBOTUE algorithms have lower rumor infection rate and require less number of blocked nodes, which means that proposed algorithms can achieve better blocking performance with less restraining cost of rumors in mainstream social networks, and the two algorithms also have different adaptability for different OSNs.

ZBP1 sensing of the Z-RNA produced during influenza virus infection induces cell death in the form of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis (PANoptosis). PANoptosis is a coordinated cell death pathway that is driven through a multiprotein complex called the PANoptosome and enables crosstalk and co-regulation among these processes. During influenza virus infection, a key step in PANoptosis and PANoptosome assembly is the formation of the ZBP1-NLRP3 inflammasome. When Z-RNA is sensed, ZBP1 recruits RIPK3 and caspase-8 to activate the ZBP1-NLRP3 inflammasome. Several other host factors have been found to be important for ZBP1-NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, including molecules involved in the type I interferon signaling pathway and caspase-6. Additionally, influenza viral proteins, such as M2, NS1, and PB1-F2, have also been shown to regulate the ZBP1-NLRP3 inflammasome.

In this study, we explored the utility of diverse HIV-1 envelope (Env) immunogens in a sequential immunization scheme as a solution to this task. This exploration stemmed from the rationale that gp145, a membrane-bound truncation form of HIV Env, may facilitate the focusing of induced antibody response on neutralizing epitopes when sequentially combined with the soluble gp140 form as immunogens in a prime-boost mode. We first showed that gp140 DNA prime-gp145 Tiantan vaccinia (TV) boost likely represents a general format for inducing potent nAb response in mice. However, when examined in rhesus macaque, this modality showed little effectiveness. To improve the efficacy, we extended the original modality by adding a strong protein boost, namely native-like SOSIP.664 trimer displayed on ferritin-based nanoparticle (NP), which was generated by a newly developed click approach. The resulting three-immunization regimen succeeded in eliciting tier-2 nAb response with substantial breadth when implemented in rhesus macaque over a short 8-week schedule. Importantly, the elicited nAb response was able to effectively contain viremia upon a heterologous SHIV challenge.

Influenza A viruses (IAVs) harbor a segmented (-)ssRNA genome. During their replication IAVs produce numerous RNA transcripts and simultaneously impair cellular transcription and translation. The viral mRNAs hold several molecular patterns which can elicit NMD and in turn would lead to their degradation. This, in consequence, may mitigate viral propagation. Thus, we examined if a knockdown or a pharmacological inhibition of NMD key components may influence IAV replication. Additionally, we performed similar experiments with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), another (-)ssRNA virus, but with a non-segmented genome. Although it seemed that a knockdown of up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1), the central NMD factor, slightly increased viral mRNA and protein levels, no significant alteration of viral replication could be observed, implying that the NMD machinery may not have restricting capacities against (-)ssRNA viruses.

The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated widespread changes in delivery of cancer care, including rapid adoption of telemedicine-based care. We aimed to evaluate the impact of telemedicine on patients, clinicians, and care delivery at the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) Sarcoma Unit during the pandemic. METHODS: Data were extracted from patient records for all planned outpatient appointments at the RMH Sarcoma Unit from March 23 to April 24, 2020. Patients and clinicians completed separate questionnaires to understand their experiences. RESULTS: Of 379 planned face-to-face appointments, 283 (75%) were converted to telemedicine. Face-to-face appointments remained for patients who needed urgent start of therapy or performance status assessment. Patients lived on average > 1.5 hours from RMH. Patient satisfaction (n = 108) with telemedicine was high (mean, 9/10), and only 48% (n = 52/108) would not want to hear bad news using telemedicine. Clinicians found telemedicine efficient, with no associated increased workload, compared with face-to-face appointments. Clinicians indicated lack of physical examination did not often affect care provision when using telemedicine. Most clinicians (n = 17; 94%) believed telemedicine use was practice changing; congruently, 80% (n = 86/108) of patients desired some telemedicine as part of their future care, citing reduced cost and travel time.

Significant clinical presentations of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms and pneumonia. In a minority of patients, extrapulmonary organs (central nervous system, eyes, heart, and gut) are affected, with detection of viral RNA in bodily secretions (stool, tears, and saliva). Infection of such extrapulmonary organs may serve as a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, representing a potential source of viral shedding after the cessation of respiratory symptoms in recovered patients or in asymptomatic individuals. It is extremely important to understand this phenomenon, as individuals with intermittent virus shedding could be falsely identified as reinfected and may benefit from ongoing antiviral treatment. The potential of SARS-CoV-2 infection to rapidly disseminate and infect extrapulmonary organs is likely mediated through the nonstructural and accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which act as ligands for host cells, and through evasion of host immune responses. The focus of this perspective is the extrapulmonary tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and the potential implications of their involvement for disease pathogenesis and the development of medical countermeasures.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Shedding from Asymptomatic Patients: Contribution of Potential Extrapulmonary Tissue Reservoirs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: In the midst of the COVID-19 epidemic and the estimation that the vast majority of the population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, a comprehensive risk mitigation strategy to identify asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers is key to providing safe clinical care during fertility treatment The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of a combined triage protocol and molecular testing for active SARS-CoV-2 viral infection for both patients and staff from a multi-site IVF network Design: Prospective study Materials and Methods: A symptomatic triage was performed whereby all patients were contacted by phone for the presence of COVID-19 symptoms or if they had been in contact with someone suspected or confirmed to be positive for the virus Only patients determined to be at low risk for COVID-19 were allowed to enter the clinic for fertility treatment Both patients and staff were required, upon arrival at the clinic, to wear a mask, complete a symptom-based questionnaire, record body temperature, and keep a safe social distance of more than 6 feet at all times Any individual recording a fever over 100 4OF and/or two or more symptoms was instructed to stay/return home for self-quarantine Specimen collection for viral screening involved an anterior nare sampling method and storage in a FDA approved viral transport medium Viral RNA was isolated using the MagMAX?

METHODS: Psychiatry clerkship OSCE scores from 321 students who completed their psychiatry clerkship in 2016 and 2017 were compared. Specific performance measures included communication skills as determined by the Essential Elements of Communication, gathering a history, documenting a history and mental status exam, defending a differential diagnosis, and proposing a treatment plan. Results were calculated using repeated two-way analysis of variance between students receiving no simulation and traditional repeated simulation training (TRS) as compared to students receiving no simulation and repeated simulation utilizing the Kolb cycle (KRS). RESULTS: Students who received KRS performed significantly better in three of the five components of the clerkship OSCE as compared to students who received TRS. Specifically, students who received KRS performed better on gathering a history (+ 14.1%, p < 0.001), documenting a history (+ 13.4%, p < 0.001), and developing a treatment plan (+ 16.7%, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in communication skills or in developing and defending a differential diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatry clerkship students engaged in repeated simulations explicitly integrated with the Kolb cycle demonstrate improved clinical skills as measured by OSCE performance. Integration of the Kolb cycle in designing simulation experiences should be carefully considered and may serve as a model for individualized coaching in programs of assessment.","output":"Experiential Learning Cycles as an Effective Means for Teaching Psychiatric Clinical Skills via Repeated Simulation in the Psychiatry Clerkship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With widespread smartphone ownership, mobile health apps (mHealth) can expand access to evidence-based interventions for mental health conditions, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Research to evaluate new features and capabilities in these apps is critical but lags behind app development. The initial release of PTSD Coach, a free self-management app developed by the US Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense, was found to have a positive public health impact. However, major stakeholder-driven updates to the app have yet to be evaluated. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize the reach, use, and potential impact of PTSD Coach Version 3.1 in the general public. As part of characterizing use, we investigated the use of specific app features, which extended previous work on PTSD Coach. METHODS: We examined the naturalistic use of PTSD Coach during a 1-year observation period between April 20, 2020, and April 19, 2021, using anonymous in-app event data to generate summary metrics for users. RESULTS: During the observation period, PTSD Coach was broadly disseminated to the public, reaching approximately 150,000 total users and 20,000 users per month. On average, users used the app 3 times across 3 separate days for 18 minutes in total, with steep drop-offs in use over time; a subset of users, however, demonstrated high or sustained engagement. More than half of users (79,099/128,691, 61.46%) accessed one or more main content areas of the app (ie, Manage Symptoms, Track Progress, Learn, or Get Support). Among content areas, features under Manage Symptoms (including coping tools) were accessed most frequently, by over 40% of users (53,314/128,691, 41.43% to 56,971/128,691, 44.27%, depending on the feature). Users who provided initial distress ratings (56,971/128,691, 44.27%) reported relatively high momentary distress (mean 6.03, SD 2.52, on a scale of 0-10), and the use of a coping tool modestly improved momentary distress (mean ?1.38, SD 1.70). Among users who completed at least one PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) assessment (17,589/128,691, 13.67%), PTSD symptoms were largely above the clinical threshold (mean 49.80, SD 16.36). Among users who completed at least two PCL-5 assessments (4989/128,691, 3.88%), PTSD symptoms decreased from the first to last assessment (mean ?4.35, SD 15.29), with approximately one-third (1585/4989, 31.77%) of these users experiencing clinically significant improvements. CONCLUSIONS: PTSD Coach continues to fulfill its mission as a public health resource. Version 3.1 compares favorably with version 1 on most metrics related to reach, use, and potential impact. Although benefits appear modest on an individual basis, the app provides these benefits to a large population. For mHealth apps to reach their full potential in supporting trauma recovery, future research should aim to understand the utility of individual app features and identify strategies to maximize overall effectiveness and engagement.","output":"PTSD Coach Version 3.1: A Closer Look at the Reach, Use, and Potential Impact of This Updated Mobile Health App in the General Public"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New York City (NYC) has emerged as one of the epicenters of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

OBJECTIVES: To separate the effects of RSV LRTI and an atopic diathesis on subsequent recurrent wheezing, we examined the protective effect of previous palivizumab administration against subsequent recurrent wheeze in infants with and without a family history of atopy. METHODS: A prospective multicenter, matched, double cohort study was conducted in 27 centers in Europe and Canada. The rates of physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing in premature infants <36 weeks gestation who had received palivizumab in the first year of life were compared to those of gestational ageCmatched controls. RESULTS: The relative protective effect of palivizumab on physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing through the ages of 2 to 5 years was 68% in those with no family history of asthma (odds ratio, 0.32; (95% CI, 0.14-0.75; N = 146 palivizumab-treated, 171 untreated) and 80% in those with no family history of atopy or food allergies (odds ratio, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.07-0.59; N = 101 palivizumab-treated, 100 untreated). In contrast, there was no effect of palivizumab on subsequent recurrent wheezing in the 90 children with a family history of atopy or food allergies compared to 130 untreated infants with atopic families. CONCLUSION: Respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in nonatopic children decreases by 80% the relative risk of recurrent wheezing but does not have any effect in infants with an atopic family history.

We and others have taken advantage of replication-competent ASLVs and exploited genetic selection strategies to force the ASLVs to naturally evolve and acquire envelope glycoprotein mutations to escape the pressure on virus entry and still yield a functional replicating virus. This approach allows for the simultaneous selection of multiple mutations in multiple functional domains of the envelope glycoprotein that may be required to yield a functional virus.

An experimental study evaluates the effectiveness of 75% alcohol in killing bacteria on surfaces. METHODS Surface swab sampling was conducted on ventilator systems and patient bedside equipment for detection of bacterial contamination. Surfaces of ventilator systems, such as faceplates, Y-pieces, and water traps, were swab sampled at 0.5, 8, and 24 hours after initial disinfection using a solution containing 0.5% sodium hypochlorite and pasteurization. The 75% alcohol aerosol was sprayed on the surfaces of faceplates, Y-pieces, and water traps on ventilator systems at 24 hours after initial disinfection, and then bacterial levels on the surfaces were evaluated. RESULTS Detection rates of Staphylococcus aureus were measured on the handrails of mechanical ventilators (64.7%), Y-pieces of breathing circuits (86.7%), and resuscitators (60.0%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified on the surfaces of Y-pieces (6.7%) and water traps (13.3%) of breathing circuits, and also on suction systems (6.7%) and resuscitators (13.3%). The positive rate for total bacterial count was clearly increased on the surfaces of faceplates, Y-pieces, and water traps at 8 hour following disinfection by 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution and pasteurization.

METHODS: This is a retrospective study design. Hospital admission and occupancy data for isolation beds was collected from Tan Tock Seng hospital for the period 14(th )March 2003 to 31(st )May 2003. The main outcome measure was daily number of isolation beds occupied by SARS patients. Among the covariates considered were daily number of people screened, daily number of people admitted (including observation, suspect and probable cases) and days from the most recent significant event discovery. We utilized the following strategy for the analysis. Firstly, we split the outbreak data into two. Data from 14(th )March to 21(st )April 2003 was used for model development. We used structural ARIMA models in an attempt to model the number of beds occupied. Estimation is via the maximum likelihood method using the Kalman filter. For the ARIMA model parameters, we considered the simplest parsimonious lowest order model. RESULTS: We found that the ARIMA (1,0,3) model was able to describe and predict the number of beds occupied during the SARS outbreak well. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the training set and validation set were 5.7% and 8.6% respectively, which we found was reasonable for use in the hospital setting. Furthermore, the model also provided three-day forecasts of the number of beds required. Total number of admissions and probable cases admitted on the previous day were also found to be independent prognostic factors of bed occupancy.

Enrolled patients were issued an FDA-approved biophysiologic monitoring device, digital tablet for video teleconferencing, and an in-home Wi-Fi/Mobile Data hub following nursing-led training prior to departing the medical facility. The provided equipment was capable of continuous, near-real time monitoring of SpO2, heart rate, respiration rate, surface/axillary temperature, and mobility data;intermittent data was also collected via a linked automatic blood pressure cuff and portable spirometer. Patients were monitored 24 hours, 7 days per week during their enrollment by dedicated tele-health nursing staff and received serial automated prompts to perform blood pressure assessments and spirometry using the included equipment. Initial and final pulse oximetry and spirometric data was reviewed, consisting of forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio. Patients were disenrolled from the program in the following circumstances: the patient was readmitted to the hospital, the patient chose to disenroll themselves, or the supervising physician determined the patient to be stable for  72 hours. RESULTS: Forty patients enrolled in the pilot program. Twenty-seven of these patients completed initial and final spirometry and pulse oximetry prior to program discharge. Total days of enrollment were on average 31  25 days. Initial pulse oximetric data returned with a mean of 95  1.6%. Of note, 13 of the 27 patients required supplemental oxygen following hospital discharge. Initial spirometric data for these individuals returned with mean values for FVC (L) of 1.77  0.82, FEV1(L) of 1.22  0.47, and FEV1/FVC of 75  20%. Prior to program disenrollment, mean pulse oximetry was measured at 97  1.9% with only 2 of the 27 patients continuing to require oxygen. Final spirometric data returned with mean values for FVC (L) of 2.61  1.16, FEV1(L) of 1.89  0.72, and FEV1/FVC of 78  19%. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluated early and late home-tested spirometry and pulse oximetry in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia discharged from the hospital to a CRPM pilot program. Nearly half of the patients (48%) required supplemental oxygen at the time of discharge with only 7.4% requiring oxygen once discharged from the pilot program. Spirometric data indicated an increase of 47.5% in FVC, an increase of 55% for FEV1, an increase of 4.1% in FEV1/FVC between initial and final testing. Correlation with in-lab spirometry testing and percent predicted values will aid in determining the accuracy of the deficits identified on home testing. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study provides insight into the rate of lung function recovery in hospitalized COVID-19 pneumonia patients, and introduces a novel method to closely monitor recovering patients on an outpatient-basis.

With the unfolding of COVID-19 pandemic, the interest in this condition has resurfaced as excessive tiredness, a major complaint of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, often lingers for a long time, resulting in disability, and poor life quality. In a previous article, we hypothesized that COVID-19-upregulated angiotensin II triggered premature endothelial cell senescence, disrupting the intestinal and blood brain barriers. Here, we hypothesize further that post-viral sequelae, including myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, are promoted by the gut microbes or toxin translocation from the gastrointestinal tract into other tissues, including the brain. This model is supported by the SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host proteins and bacterial lipopolysaccharide.

The agents responsible for these infections can be viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi. Among the viruses most frequently responsible for congenital infections are Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Herpes simplex 1C2, Herpes virus 6, Varicella zoster. Moreover Hepatitis B and C virus, HIV, Parvovirus B19 and non-polio Enteroviruses when contracted during pregnancy may involve the fetus or newborn at birth. Recently, new viruses have emerged, SARS-Cov-2 and Zika virus, of which we do not yet fully know the characteristics and pathogenic power when contracted during pregnancy. Viral infections in pregnancy can damage the fetus (spontaneous abortion, fetal death, intrauterine growth retardation) or the newborn (congenital anomalies, organ diseases with sequelae of different severity). Some risk factors specifically influence the incidence of transmission to the fetus: the timing of the infection in pregnancy, the order of the infection, primary or reinfection or chronic, the duration of membrane rupture, type of delivery, socio-economic conditions and breastfeeding. Frequently infected neonates, symptomatic at birth, have worse outcomes than asymptomatic. Many asymptomatic babies develop long term neurosensory outcomes. The way in which the virus interacts with the maternal immune system, the maternal-fetal interface and the placenta explain these results and also the differences that are observed from time to time in the fetal?neonatal outcomes of maternal infections. The maternal immune system undergoes functional adaptation during pregnancy, once thought as physiological immunosuppression. This adaptation, crucial for generating a balance between maternal immunity and fetus, is necessary to promote and support the pregnancy itself and the growth of the fetus. When this adaptation is upset by the viral infection, the balance is broken, and the infection can spread and lead to the adverse outcomes previously described. In this review we will describe the main viral harmful infections in pregnancy and the potential mechanisms of the damages on the fetus and newborn.","output":"Pregnancy and viral infections: Mechanisms of fetal damage, diagnosis and prevention of neonatal adverse outcomes from cytomegalovirus to SARS-CoV-2 and Zika virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aim to test four one-step RT real-time mastermix options for use in SARS-CoV2 real-time PCR, with three primer/probe assays targeting the N gene.

METHODS: Point seroprevalence study of nursing homes to describe the demography and characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive residents and staff. RESULTS: Clinical information and blood samples were available for 9,332 residents (mean age 86.7  8.1 years, 76.4% women) and 10,614 staff (mean age 45.6  11.5, 86.2% women). Up to 84.4% of residents had frailty, 84.9% co-morbidity and 69.3% cognitive impairment; 65.2% of workers were health-aides. COVID-19 seroprevalence was 55.4% (95% CI, 54.4-56.4) for older adults and 31.5% (30.6-32.4) for staff. In multivariable analysis frailty of residents was related with seropositivity (OR: 1.19, p = 0.02). In the case of staff, age > 50 years (2.10, p < 0.001), obesity (1.19, p = 0.01), being a health-aide (1.94, p < 0.001), working in a center with high seroprevalence in residents (3.49, p < 0.001), and contact with external cases of COVID-19 (1.52, p < 0.001) were factors associated with seropositivity. Past symptoms of COVID-19 were good predictors of seropositivity for residents (5.41, p < 0.001) and staff (2.52, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Level of dependency influences risk of COVID-19 among residents. Individual and work factors, and contacts outside the nursing home are associated with COVID-19 exposure in staff members.

Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is emerging as a modality to improve prognosis by augmenting perfusion to vital end-organs by utilizing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during conventional CPR and stabilizing the patient for interventions aimed at reversing the aetiology of the arrest. Implementing this emergent procedure requires a substantial investment in resources, and even the most successful ECPR programs may nonetheless burden healthcare systems, clinicians, patients, and their families with unsalvageable patients supported by extracorporeal devices. Non-randomized and observational studies have repeatedly shown an association between ECPR and improved survival, versus conventional CPR, for in-hospital cardiac arrest in select patient populations. Recently, randomized controlled trials suggest benefit for ECPR over standard resuscitation, as well as the feasibility of performing such trials, in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest within highly coordinated healthcare delivery systems. Application of these data to clinical practice should be done cautiously, with outcomes likely to vary by the setting and system within which ECPR is initiated. ECPR introduces important ethical challenges, including whether it should be considered an extension of CPR, at what point it becomes sustained organ replacement therapy, and how to approach patients unable to recover or be bridged to heart replacement therapy.

We focus on clinical trials, i.e., research studies conducted on humans to evaluate medical treatments. Clinical trials are a relatively under-explored application in machine learning for healthcare, in part due to complex ethical, legal, and regulatory requirements and high costs. Our aim is to provide a multi-disciplinary assessment of how fairness for machine learning fits into the context of clinical trials research and practice. We start by reviewing the current ethical considerations and guidelines for clinical trials and examine their relationship with common definitions of fairness in machine learning. We examine potential sources of unfairness in clinical trials, providing concrete examples, and discuss the role machine learning might play in either mitigating potential biases or exacerbating them when applied without care. Particular focus is given to adaptive clinical trials, which may employ machine learning.

METHODS This randomized controlled study at a tertiary academic medical center involved 40 patients (age 65 years, ASA PS II/III) scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia. Patients were randomized to sugammadex or neostigmine for reversal of moderate NMB with rocuronium. The primary outcome was recovery time from NMB after surgery to a train-of-four (TOF) ratio 0.9 measured at the adductor pollicis (TOF-Watch? SX). Secondary outcomes included hemodynamic change after administration of reversal agent (heart rate, blood pressure, dysrhythmia), time to extubation, pain medication requirement, time to first ambulation, and length of postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and total hospital stay. RESULTS Sugammadex (42.2 min) compared with neostigmine reversal (26.317.5 min) was on average 22 min faster (95% CI 14.1-30.5; P0.001) with less variability (range 2-11 min vs 5-72 min). The groups significantly differed in time for tracheal extubation, response to verbal commands (open eyes, squeeze hand, lift head), and operating room exit. However, they had similar PACU stay, time to first ambulation, total hospital stay, postoperative pain, and opioid use. Sugammadex had less hemodynamic variability than neostigmine. No patient developed treatment-emergent dysrhythmias. CONCLUSION Sugammadex reversal significantly hastened NMB recovery compared with neostigmine reversal in geriatric patients.

We also performed a literature search for previously published cases and present a summary of the clinical, laboratory and radiological features of this condition. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old immunocompetent Caucasian woman was admitted to our hospital with an acute febrile respiratory illness associated with a rash. Her blood tests were non-specifically abnormal, and tests for bacterial pathogens were negative. Her condition rapidly deteriorated while she was in our hospital and required mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. A multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay performed on respiratory specimens to detect respiratory viruses was negative for influenza but positive for adenovirus DNA. The patient recovered on supportive treatment, and antibiotics were stopped after 5 days. CONCLUSIONS: Community-acquired adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adult civilians presents as a non-specific acute febrile respiratory illness followed by the abrupt onset of respiratory failure, often requiring mechanical ventilation. Its laboratory and radiological features are typical of viral infections but also are non-specific. Novel multiplex real-time RT-PCR testing for respiratory viruses enabled us to rapidly make the diagnosis in this case.

Many in-person didactics and examinations were canceled or rescheduled, including the ABS-CE. The study aims to evaluate Virtual MOEs (V-MOEs) feasibility as a potential alternative to in-person MOEs in residency programs. METHODS: Twenty-five participants C 16 general surgery residents (7 females, 9 males) and 9 faculty C in the inaugural Department of Surgery Virtual Mock Oral Examination completed an anonymous, voluntary online survey via Microsoft Forms. Faculty were given 24 questions, and residents 28, with 9 questions common between both residents and faculty. Participants were asked about the accessibility to virtual examination rooms, V-MOE effectiveness, resident's preparation for the exam, resident's stress, diversity and number of clinical scenarios, and possible future implementation of, and barriers to, V-MOEs. RESULTS: All participants have participated in IP-MOEs in the past. All faculty were very satisfied or satisfied with IP-MOE, compared to 93.8% of residents. All participants were very satisfied or satisfied with the orientation and instructions before V-MOE. Only 66.6% of faculty, compared to all residents, were satisfied with time allocation for sessions. While 88.9% of faculty felt the V-MOE was less stressful on residents, only 68.8% of residents felt so. Additionally, 87.5% of residents said they prepared for the V-MOE similarly to the IP-MOE. As a future platform, only 22.2% of faculty compared to 43.8% of residents preferred V-MOE over the IP-MOE. Both faculty (88.9%), and residents (81.3%) preferred immediate feedback at the end of sessions. All faculty recommend collaboration with other programs to enhance the resident's preparation. Time constraints, lack of experience with the format, and availability were the top three barriers. CONCLUSIONS: V-MOE is feasible, accessible, and a potential alternative for IP-MOEs at a program level for ABS-CE preparation. Given the time constraints and costs associated with IP-MOEs, it is an opportunity to collaborate with other residency programs.

Healthcare workers, on the front lines of the epidemic, are facing major and potentially traumatic stressful events, overwhelming their ability to cope and their resources. OBJECTIVE The objective of this article will be to show how the use of the URG-EMDR protocol in a telemental health setting has proven to be feasible and effective in the treatment of a group of healthcare professionals working in nursing homes or hospital services that were highly mobilized during the acute phase of COVID-19. METHOD 17 participants, registered nurses (N = 7) and licensed practical nurses (N = 10), were remotely treated using the URG-EMDR protocol in a single session. The assessment focused on anxiety and depressive symptoms (HAD scale) and the level of perceived disturbance (SUD). An additional evaluation of the satisfaction with the remote psychotherapy intervention was conducted. RESULTS As the URG-EMDR protocol has already proven itself during emergency interventions, it is interesting to note that its remote use in the treatment of healthcare providers caring for COVID-19 patients allows for an improvement in the emotional state and a decrease in perceived disturbance, in a single session. This result is maintained 1 week after the intervention, despite the continued professional activities of the participants and the continuity of the event. Moreover, the remote therapy setting was judged satisfactory by the patients, even if it required adjustments and certain recommendations for practice.

It provides guidance for the development of safe and effective MERS-CoV vaccines. EXPERT OPINION: Although many MERS-CoV vaccines have been developed, most remain at the preclinical stage. Some vaccines demonstrate immunogenicity and efficacy in animal models, while others have potential adverse effects or low efficacy against high-dose or divergent virus strains. Novel strategies are needed to design safe and effective MERS vaccines to induce broad-spectrum immune responses and improve protective efficacy against multiple strains of MERS-CoV and MERS-like coronaviruses with pandemic potential.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to report the impact of COVID-19 on spine surgery fellow education and readiness for practice. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: COVID-19 has emerged as one of the most devastating global health crises of our time. To minimize transmission risk and to ensure availability of health resources, many hospitals have cancelled elective surgeries. There may be unintended consequences of this decision on the education and preparedness of current surgical trainees. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidimensional survey was created and distributed to all current AO Spine fellows and fellowship directors across the United States and Canada. RESULTS: Forty-five spine surgery fellows and 25 fellowship directors completed the survey. 62.2% of fellows reported >50% decrease in overall case volume since cancellation of elective surgeries. Mean hours worked per week decreased by 56.2%. Fellows reported completing a mean of 188.464.8 cases before the COVID-19 crisis and 84.1% expect at least an 11%C25% reduction in case volume compared with previous spine fellows. In all, 95.5% of fellows did not expect COVID-19 to impact their ability to complete fellowship. Only 2 directors were concerned about their fellows successfully completing fellowship; however, 32% of directors reported hearing concerns regarding preparedness from their fellows and 25% of fellows were concerned about job opportunities. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has universally impacted work hours and case volume for spine surgery fellows set to complete fellowship in the middle of 2020. Nevertheless, spine surgery fellows generally feel ready to enter practice and are supported by the confidence of their fellowship directors. The survey highlights a number of opportunities for improvement and innovation in the future training of spine surgeons.

We describe a general framework for considering the readiness of AI for PV, followed by some examples of the application of AI to ICSR processing and evaluation in industry and FDA. We conclude that AI can usefully be applied to some aspects of ICSR processing and evaluation, but the performance of current AI algorithms requires a human-in-the-loop to ensure good quality. We identify outstanding scientific and policy issues to be addressed before the full potential of AI can be exploited for ICSR processing and evaluation, including approaches to quality assurance of human-in-the-loop AI systems, large-scale, publicly available training datasets, a well-defined and computable cognitive framework, a formal sociotechnical framework for applying AI to PV, and development of best practices for applying AI to PV.

As we uncover the links between host genomics and infectious disease, a number of ethical, legal, and social issues need to be considered when using that information in clinical practice or workforce decisions. We conducted a survey of the clinical staff at 10 federally funded Regional Ebola and Other Special Pathogen Treatment Centers to understand their views regarding the ethical, legal, and social issues related to host genomics and the administrative and clinical functions of high-level isolation units. Respondents overwhelmingly agreed that genomics could provide valuable information to identify patients and employees at higher risk for poor outcomes from highly infectious diseases. However, there was considerable disagreement about whether such data should inform the allocation of scarce resources or determine treatment decisions. While most respondents supported a confidential employer-based genomic testing system to inform individual employees about risk, respondents disagreed about whether such information should be used in staffing models. Respondents who thought genomic information would be valuable for patient treatment were more willing to undergo genetic testing for staffing purposes. Most respondents felt they would benefit from additional training to better interpret results from genetic testing.

Under pathological conditions, the extensive release of ATP induces sustained P2X7 receptor activation, culminating in induction of proinflammatory pathways with inflammasome assembly and cytokine release. These inflammatory conditions, whether occurring peripherally or in the central nervous system (CNS), increase blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability. Besides its well-known involvement in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, the P2X7 receptor may induce BBB disruption and chemotaxis of peripheral immune cells to the CNS, resulting in brain parenchyma infiltration. For instance, despite common effects on cytokine release, P2X7 receptor signaling is also associated with metalloproteinase secretion and activation, as well as migration and differentiation of T lymphocytes, monocytes and dendritic cells. Here we highlight that peripheral immune cells mediate the pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinsons and Alzheimers disease, mainly through T lymphocyte, neutrophil and monocyte infiltration. We propose that P2X7 receptor activation contributes to neurodegenerative disease progression beyond its known effects on the CNS.

This study aimed to explore the experiences of nurses caring for people with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 in Hong Kong. DESIGN: A qualitative study was conducted using individual, semistructured interviews. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim for thematic analysis. SETTING: Participants were recruited from acute hospitals and a public health department in Hong Kong from June 2020 to August 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A purposive sample of registered nurses (N=39) caring for people with COVID-19 in Hong Kong were recruited. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the nurses had a masters degree and over a third had 6C10 years of nursing experience. Around 40% of the nurses cared for people with COVID-19 in isolation wards and a quarter performed COVID-19-related work for 31-40 hours/week. Most (90%) had training in COVID-19 and three-quarters had experience of working in infection control teams. Six key themes emerged: confronting resource shortages; changes in usual nursing responsibilities and care modes; maintaining physical and mental health; need for effective and timely responses from relevant local authorities; role of the community in public health protection and management; and advanced pandemic preparedness. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that nurses possessed resilience, self-care and adaptability when confronting resource shortages, changing nursing protocols, and physical and mental health threats during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hence, the inhibition of membrane protein synthesis at the ER is an attractive strategy for reducing the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and other obligate viral pathogens. Using an in vitro system, we demonstrate that the small molecule inhibitor ipomoeassin F (Ipom-F) potently blocks the Sec61-mediated ER membrane translocation/insertion of three therapeutic protein targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection; the viral spike and ORF8 proteins together with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the host cell plasma membrane receptor.

Currently, there is no effective cure or treatment for the standard care of patients. A variety of ME/CFS symptoms can be linked to the vital life functions of the brainstem, the lower extension of the brain best known as the hub relaying information back and forth between the cerebral cortex and various parts of the body. Objective/Methods: Over the past decade, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies have emerged to understand ME/CFS with interesting findings, but there has lacked a synthesized evaluation of what has been found thus far regarding the involvement of the brainstem. We conducted this study to review and evaluate the recent MRI findings via a literature search of the MEDLINE database, from which 11 studies met the eligibility criteria. Findings: Data showed that MRI studies frequently reported structural changes in the white and gray matter. Abnormalities of the functional connectivity within the brainstem and with other brain regions have also been found. The studies have suggested possible mechanisms including astrocyte dysfunction, cerebral perfusion impairment, impaired nerve conduction, and neuroinflammation involving the brainstem, which may at least partially explain a substantial portion of the ME/CFS symptoms and their heterogeneous presentations in individual patients.

After cardiopulmonary bypass was terminated, brisk bleeding started from high in the posterior left ventricular wall, typical of a type III defect. We undertook external repair, placing a plug of Teflon felt into the cavity of the rupture and sandwiching it into place with pledgeted mattress and figure-of-8 sutures. The space occupied by the plug decreased the distance needed to obliterate the defect and thereby reduced the tension on the sutures necessary to achieve hemostasis. This simple technique enabled closure of the defect and avoided collateral tears that would have compromised an otherwise successful repair.

Over 450 000 infections are seen in the United States with similar incidence seen in the rest of the developed world. The majority of infections seen are mild-moderate with fulminant disease and mortality being rare complications seen in the elderly and in those with comorbidities. The most common complication of CDI is recurrent infection with rates as high as 60% after three or more infections. A dilemma in the management of primary and recurrent CDI is testing due to the high sensitivity of the nucleic acid amplification tests such as the polymerase chain reaction, which leads to clinical false positives if patients are not chosen carefully (with symptoms) before testing. A newer testing regimen involving a 2-step strategy is emerging using glutamate dehydrogenase as a screening strategy followed by enzyme immunoassay for the C. difficile toxin. Microbiota restoration therapies are the cornerstone of management of recurrent CDI to prevent future recurrences. The most common modality of microbiota restoration is faecal microbiota transplantation, which has been tainted with heterogeneity and adverse events such as serious infectious transmission. The success rates for recurrence prevention from microbiota restoration therapies are over 90% compared with less than 50% of recurrence prevention with courses of antibiotics. This has led to development and emergence of standardized microbiota restoration therapies in capsule and enema forms. Capsule-based therapies include CP101 (positive phase II results), RBX7455 (positive phase I results), SER-109 (positive phase III results) and VE303 (ongoing phase II trial).

Adjuvant treatments are widely used in combination with CD as suitable methods of therapy. Existing augmentations have to be fabricated in advance. Here, we report a novel injectable glycerin-modified polycaprolactone (GPCL) that can adapt to the shape of the CD cavity. GPCL shows great flowability at 52.6 C. After solidification, its compressive modulus was 120 kPa at body temperature (37 C). This excellent characteristic enables the polymer to provide mechanical support in vivo. In addition, GPCL acts as a carrier of the therapeutic agent zoledronic acid (ZA), demonstrating sustained release into the CD region. ZA-loaded GPCL was injected into ONFH lesions to treat early-stage nontraumatic cases. Compared to that in the CD group, CD+ZA-loaded GPCL injection preserved bone density and increased the collagen level in the femoral head. At the interface between the GPCL and CD tunnel wall, osteogenesis was significantly promoted. In addition, morphological evaluations revealed that the femoral heads in the CD+ZA-GPCL group exhibited improved pressure resistance. These results suggest a strategy effective to preserve the bone density of the femoral head, thus decreasing the possibility of femoral head collapse.

In the second part of the paper, a CO(2) gas sensing application is explored by depositing a thin layer of functional host materiala polyhexamethylene biguanide polymeron the metasurface. The refractive index of the host material decreases due to the absorption of the CO(2) gas. As a result, the resonance wavelength of the perfect absorber performs a prominent blueshift. With the help of the proposed sensor design, based on metasurface, the CO(2) gas concentration range of 0C524 ppm was detected. A maximum sensitivity of 17.3 pm/ppm was acquired for a gas concentration of 434 ppm. The study presented in this work explores the opportunity of utilizing the metasurface perfect absorber for gas sensing applications by employing functional host materials.","output":"Carbon Dioxide Gas Sensor Based on Polyhexamethylene Biguanide Polymer Deposited on Silicon Nano-Cylinders Metasurface"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lesion of middle ear as a variant of clinical manifestation of secondary tuberculosis, according to international scientific literature, is a rare condition.

To track the emergence as well as the persistence of mutations during the early stage of the pandemic, a comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 whole proteome sequences has been performed by considering manually curated 31,389 whole genome sequences from 84 countries. Among the 7 highly recurring (percentage frequency&#8805;10%) mutations (Nsp2:T85I, Nsp6:L37F, Nsp12:P323L, Spike:D614G, ORF3a:Q57H, N protein:R203K and N protein:G204R), N protein:R203K and N protein: G204R are co-occurring (dependent) mutations. Nsp12:P323L and Spike:D614G often appear simultaneously. The highly recurring Spike:D614G, Nsp12:P323L and Nsp6:L37F as well as moderately recurring (percentage frequency between &#8805;1 and <10%) ORF3a:G251V and ORF8:L84S mutations have led to4 major clades in addition to a clade that lacks high recurring mutations. Further, the occurrence of ORF3a:Q57H&Nsp2:T85I, ORF3a:Q57H and N protein:R203K&G204R along with Nsp12:P323L&Spike:D614G has led to 3 additional sub-clades. Similarly, occurrence of Nsp6:L37F and ORF3a:G251V together has led to the emergence of a sub-clade. Nonetheless, ORF8:L84S does not occur along with ORF3a:G251V or Nsp6:L37F. Intriguingly, ORF3a:G251V and ORF8:L84S are found to occur independent of Nsp12:P323L and Spike:D614G mutations. These clades have evolved during the early stage of the pandemic and have disseminated across several countries. Further, Nsp10 is found to be highly resistant to mutations, thus, it can be exploited for drug/vaccine development and the corresponding gene sequence can be used for the diagnosis. Concisely, the study reports the SARS-CoV-2 antigens diversity across the globe during the early stage of the pandemic and facilitates the understanding of viral evolution.","output":"Global variation in SARS-CoV-2 proteome and its implication in pre-lockdown emergence and dissemination of 5 dominant SARS-CoV-2 clades"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a global issue of concern for public health, environment and socio-economic setup.

Few studies have described the evolution trend of availability of CBCS in rural and urban areas and evaluated their effectiveness. This study aims to show the availability of Chinas CBCS and further analyze the effect of the CBCS on the cognitive function of elderly people. METHODS: Longitudinal analysis was performed using data from the 2008 to 2018 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). A total of 23937 observations from 8421 elderly people were included in the study. The Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to assess cognitive function. We aggregated similar CBCS to generate three binary variable categories (daily life support, emotional comfort and entertainment services, medical support and health services) indicating the availability of CBCS (1 = yes, 0 = no). Multilevel growth models were employed to estimate the association between CBCS and cognitive function while adjusting for many demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. RESULTS: The availability of CBCS increased a lot from 2008 to 2018 in China. Although the availability of CBCS in urban areas was higher than that in rural areas in 2008, by 2018 the gap narrowed significantly. Emotional comfort and entertainment services (B = 0.331, 95% CI = 0.090 to 0.572) and medical support and health services (B = 1.041, 95% CI = 0.854 to 1.228) were significantly and positively associated with cognitive function after adjusting for the covariates. CONCLUSION: There was a significant increase in the availability of CBCS from 2008 to 2018 in China.

METHODS: A total of 269 patients who underwent CT for suspected COVID-19 were included in this retrospective analysis. COVID-19 was confirmed by reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction. Basic demographics (age and sex) and initial vital parameters (O2-saturation, respiratory rate, and body temperature) were recorded. Generalized mixed models were used to calculate the accuracy of vital parameters for detection of COVID-19 and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of CT. A clinical score based on vital parameters, age, and sex was established to estimate the pretest probability of COVID-19 and used to define low, intermediate, and high risk groups. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The sole use of vital parameters for the prediction of COVID-19 was inferior to CT. After correction for confounders, such as age and sex, CT showed a sensitivity of 0.86, specificity of 0.78, and positive predictive value of 0.36. In the subgroup analysis based on pretest probability, positive predictive value and sensitivity increased to 0.53 and 0.89 in the high-risk group, while specificity was reduced to 0.68. In the low-risk group, sensitivity and positive predictive value decreased to 0.76 and 0.33 with a specificity of 0.83. The negative predictive value remained high (0.94 and 0.97) in both groups.

The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey publishes such measurements for SARS-CoV-2 on a weekly basis based on testing enrolled households, contributing to situational awareness in the country. Here we present estimates of time-varying and static epidemiological quantities that were derived from the estimates published by ONS. Methods We used a gaussian process to model the incidence of infections and then estimated observed PCR prevalence by convolving our modelled incidence estimates with a previously published PCR detection curve describing the probability of a positive test as a function of the time since infection. We refined our incidence estimates using time-varying estimates of antibody prevalence combined with a model of antibody positivity and waning that moved individuals between compartments with or without antibodies based on estimates of new infections, vaccination, probability of seroconversion and waning. Results We produced incidence curves of infection describing the UK epidemic from late April 2020 until early 2022. We used these estimates of incidence to estimate the time-varying growth rate of infections and combined them with estimates of the generation interval to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers. Biological parameters describing seroconversion and waning, while based on a simple model, were broadly in line with plausible ranges from individual-level studies. Conclusions Beyond informing situational awareness and allowing for estimates using individual-level data, repeated cross-sectional studies make it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters from population-level models.

METHODS: Medical records were reviewed in all patients admitted with COVID-19 at University of Chicago Medical Center between March 1, 2020 and April 18, 2020. Those identified as having coinfection were compared to those without coinfection. Secondary review was performed for characteristics of the coinfection, including diagnosis, microbiology, drug resistance, and nosocomial acquisition. RESULTS: 401 patients were included in the study, the mean age was 60 years (SD-17), 29% had severe disease, and 13% died. At least one test for coinfection was performed in 99% of patients. Coinfection was identified in 15% (72/401) of patients. Coinfection was associated with older age, disease severity, and hospital complications, such as DVT/PE, AKI, and delirium. [Table 1] No symptom, non-microbiologic test, radiograph, or preexisting condition was associated with coinfection. Dyspnea, chest pain, and obesity were more common in those without coinfection. 74% received antibiotics. The most common sites for coinfection were urinary 33%, lower respiratory 26%, and blood 24%.

With dramatically increasing infection numbers, and the arrival of new variants with increased infectivity, tracking the evolution of its genome is crucial for effectively controlling the pandemic and informing vaccine platform development. Our study explores evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a representative cohort of sequences covering the entire genome in the United States, through all of 2020 and early 2021. Strikingly, we detected many accumulating Single Nucleotide Variations (SNVs) encoding amino acid changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, with a pattern indicative of RNA editing enzymes as major mutators of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We report three major variants through October of 2020. These revealed 14 key mutations that were found in various combinations among 14 distinct predominant signatures. These signatures likely represent evolutionary lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the U.S. and reveal clues to its evolution such as a mutational burst in the summer of 2020 likely leading to a homegrown new variant, and a trend towards higher mutational load among viral isolates, but with occasional mutation loss. The last quartile of 2020 revealed a concerning accumulation of mostly novel low frequency replacement mutations in the Spike protein, and a hypermutable glutamine residue near the putative furin cleavage site. Finally, the end of the year data revealed the presence of known variants of concern including B.1.1.7, which has acquired additional Spike mutations. Overall, our results suggest that predominant viral sequences are dynamically evolving over time, with periods of mutational bursts and unabated mutation accumulation. This high level of existing variation, even at low frequencies and especially in the Spike-encoding region may be become problematic when superspreader events, akin to serial Founder Events in evolution, drive these rare mutations to prominence. AUTHOR SUMMARY The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused the death of more than 2.29 million people and continues to be a severe threat internationally. Although simple measures such as social distancing, periodic lockdowns and hygiene protocols were immediately put into force, the infection rates were only temporarily minimized. When infection rates exploded again new variants of the virus began to emerge. Our study focuses on a representative set of sequences from the United States throughout 2020 and early 2021. We show that the driving force behind the variants of public health concern, is widespread infection and superspreader events. In particular, we show accumulation of mutations over time with little loss from genetic drift, including in the Spike region, which could be problematic for vaccines and therapies. This lurking accumulated genetic variation may be a superspreader event from becoming more common and lead to variants that can escape the immune protection provided by the existing vaccines.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution in the United States: High accumulation of viral mutations over time likely through serial Founder Events and mutational bursts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Telehealth has emerged as a means of improving access and reducing cost for medical oncology care; however, use by specialists prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic still remained low.

OBJECTIVE: To identify medical oncology health professionals perceptions of the barriers to and benefits of telehealth video visits. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study used interviews conducted from October 30, 2019, to March 5, 2020, of medical oncology health professionals at the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, an urban academic health system in the US with a cancer center. All medical oncology physicians, physicians assistants, and nurse practitioners at the hospital were eligible to participate. A combination of volunteer and convenience sampling was used, resulting in the participation of 29 medical oncology health professionals, including 20 physicians and 9 advanced practice professionals, in semistructured interviews. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Medical oncology health professionals perceptions of barriers to and benefits of telehealth video visits as experienced by patients receiving cancer treatment.

Respondents also largely recognized the convenience and improved access to care enabled by telehealth for patients. However, many reported concern regarding the health professionalCpatient relationship and their limited ability to comfort patients in a virtual setting. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Medical oncology health professionals shared conflicting opinions regarding the barriers to and benefits of telehealth in regard to clinical effectiveness, patient experience, access to care, and financial impact. Understanding oncologists perceptions of telehealth elucidates potential barriers that need to be further investigated or improved for telehealth expansion and continued utilization; further research is ongoing to assess current perceptions of health professionals and patients given the rapid expansion of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Medical Oncology Professionals Perceptions of Telehealth Video Visits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unprecedented scale and impact of COVID-19 pandemic, and the accompanying lockdown implemented across many countries, has exacerbated water scarcity and security globally. Many European governments have introduced policy interventions to mitigate and protect their economies. Yet, water resources, which are a potential enabler in revitalising Europes economy, have received few of such policy interventions since the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a public health emergency only in January 2020. Our scoping review of preliminary government responses of 27 European countries revealed that only 11 (40.7%) of these countries implemented at least one policy intervention that considered the water sector. These interventions were typically short-term measures involving either full cost absorption or deferment of water bills. Much attention on water governance and management processes, policies and financial investments required to augment the resilience of the water sector amid a growing scarcity of freshwater, triggered by extreme climate variation and also by COVID-19 pandemic should therefore be central to post COVID-19 recovery efforts in Europe. This paper also proposes future research directions, including a study that will harmonise water demand and consumption trends during the pandemic in Europe and an assessment on how the water sector can withstand possible external shocks in future.","output":"COVID-19 water sector responses in Europe: A scoping review of preliminary governmental interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The airway epithelium and underlying innate immune cells comprise the first line of host defense in the lung. They recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) using membrane-bound receptors, as well as cytosolic receptors such as inflammasomes. Inflammasomes activate inflammatory caspases, which in turn process and release the inflammatory cytokines IL-1? and IL-18. Additionally, inflammasomes trigger a form of lytic cell death termed pyroptosis. One of the most important inflammasomes at the host-pathogen interface is the non-canonical caspase-11 inflammasome that responds to LPS in the cytosol. Caspase-11 is important in defense against Gram-negative pathogens, and can drive inflammatory diseases such as LPS-induced sepsis. However, pathogens can employ evasive strategies to minimize or evade host caspase-11 detection. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the function of the non-canonical caspase-11 inflammasome in sensing of cytosolic LPS, and its mechanism of action with particular emphasis in the role of caspase-11 in the lung. We also explore some of the strategies pathogens use to evade caspase-11.","output":"Caspase-11 Non-canonical Inflammasomes in the Lung"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the decades-long efforts of sustainability science and related policy and action programs, humanity has not gotten closer to global sustainability.

For effective infection, the S protein is cleaved at two sites: S1/S2 and S2. The priming of the surface S protein at S1/S2 (PRRAR(685)) [the underlined basic amino acids refer to critical residues needed for the furin recognition] by furin has been shown to be important for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cells and small-animal models. In this study, for the first time we unambiguously identified by proteomics the fusion activation site S2 as KPSKR(815) (the underlined basic amino acids refer to critical residues needed for the furin recognition) and demonstrated that this cleavage was strongly enhanced by ACE2 engagement with the S protein. Novel pharmacological furin inhibitors (BOS inhibitors) effectively blocked endogenous S protein processing at both sites in HeLa cells, and SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung-derived Calu-3 cells was completely prevented by combined inhibitors of furin (BOS) and type II transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) (camostat). Quantitative analyses of cell-to-cell fusion and S protein processing revealed that ACE2 shedding by TMPRSS2 was required for TMPRSS2-mediated enhancement of fusion in the absence of S1/S2 priming. We further demonstrated that the collectrin dimerization domain of ACE2 was essential for the effect of TMPRSS2 on cell-to-cell fusion. Overall, our results indicate that furin and TMPRSS2 act synergistically in viral entry and infectivity, supporting the combination of furin and TMPRSS2 inhibitors as potent antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, has so far resulted in >6.1 million deaths worldwide. The spike protein (S) of the virus directs infection of the lungs and other tissues by binding the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. For effective infection, the S protein is cleaved at two sites: S1/S2 and S2. Cleavage at S1/S2 induces a conformational change favoring the S protein recognition by ACE2. The S2 cleavage is critical for triggering membrane fusion and virus entry into host cells. Our study highlights the complex dynamics of interaction between the S protein, ACE2, and the host proteases furin and TMPRSS2 during SARS-CoV-2 entry and suggests that the combination of a nontoxic furin inhibitor with a TMPRSS2 inhibitor significantly reduces viral entry in lung cells, as evidenced by an average synergistic 95% reduction of viral infection. This represents a powerful novel antiviral approach to reduce viral spread in individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 or future related coronaviruses.","output":"Distinctive Roles of Furin and TMPRSS2 in SARS-CoV-2 Infectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Graphical perception is the visual decoding of the quantitative and qualitative information encoded on graphs.

One of the peculiar clinical characteristics of ALS is the wide distribution in age of onset, which is probably caused by different combinations of intrinsic and exogenous factors. We investigated whether these modifying factors are converging into common pathogenic pathways leading either to an early or a late disease onset. This would imply the identification of phenotypic biomarkers, that can distinguish the two populations of ALS patients, and of relevant pathways to consider in a therapeutic intervention. Toward this aim a differential proteomic analysis was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a group of 16 ALS patients with an age of onset 55 years and a group of 16 ALS patients with an age of onset 75 years, and matched healthy controls. We identified 43 differentially expressed proteins in the two groups of patients. Gene ontology analysis revealed that there was a significant enrichment in annotations associated with protein folding and response to stress. We next validated a selected number of proteins belonging to this functional group in 85 patients and 83 age- and sex-matched healthy controls using immunoassays. The results of the validation study confirmed that there was a decreased level of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (also known as cyclophilin A), heat shock protein HSP 90-alpha, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (also known as BiP) and protein deglycase DJ-1 in PBMC of ALS patients with an early onset. Similar results were obtained in PBMC and spinal cord from two SOD1(G93A) mouse models with an early and late disease onset.

Many patients require mechanical ventilation. The goal of this study was to investigate the clinical course and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 undergoing mechanical ventilation and identify factors associated with death. Methods: Eighty-three consecutive critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation were included in this retrospective, single-center, observational study from January 31 to March 15, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and mechanical ventilation data were collected and analyzed. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality after endotracheal intubation. The secondary outcomes included the incidences of SARS-CoV-2-related cardiac, liver, and kidney injury. Results: Seventy-four out of 83 (89.2%) patients achieved oxygen saturation above 93% after intubation. Forty-nine out of 83 (59%) patients died and 34 (41%) patients survived after 28 days of observation. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of death associated with cardiac injury (odds ratio 15.60, 95% CI 4.20C74.43), liver injury (5.40, 1.46C23.56), and kidney injury (8.39, 1.63C61.41), and decreasing odds of death associated with the higher PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio before intubation (0.97, 0.95C0.99). PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio before intubation demonstrated a positive linear correlation with platelet count (r = 0.424, P = 0.001), and negative linear correlation with troponin I (r = ?0.395, P = 0.008). Conclusions: Cardiac, liver, and kidney injury may be associated with death for critically ill patients with COVID-19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation. The severity of pre-intubation hypoxia may be associated with a poorer outcome of patients with COVID-19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation.

The earliest sign of clinical response was a reduction in the length of stay when these patients were hospitalised, indicating that a reduction in the severity of crises precedes the reduction in their frequency.

To identify the molecular characteristics of the PEDV Spike (S) gene in Mexico, 116 samples of the intestine and diarrhea of piglets with clinical signs of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) were obtained. Samples were collected from 14 farms located in six states of Mexico (Jalisco, Puebla, Sonora, Veracruz, Guanajuato, and Michoacn) from 2013 to 2016. To identify PEDV, we used real-time RT-PCR to discriminate between non-INDEL and INDEL strains. We chose samples according to state and year to characterize the S gene. After amplification of the S gene, the obtained products were sequenced and assembled. The complete amino acid sequences of the spike protein were used to perform an epitope analysis, which was used to determine null mutations in regions SS2, SS6, and 2C10 compared to the sequences of G2. A phylogenetic analysis determined the circulation of G2b and INDEL strains in Mexico. However, several mutations were recorded in the collagenase equivalent (COE) region that were related to the change in polarity and charge of the amino acid residues. The PEDV strain circulating in Jalisco in 2016 has an insertion of three amino acids ((232)LGL(234)) and one change in the antigenic site of the COE region, and strains from the years 2015 and 2016 changed the index of the surface probability, which could be related to the re-emergence of disease outbreaks.","output":"Molecular characterization of the spike gene of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in Mexico, 2013C2016"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a case report of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) associated with COVID-19 treated with oral aspirin therapy.

Prions and the spectrum of functions they comprise, likely represent one of the largest paradigm shifts concerning molecular-encoded phenotypic diversity since identification of DNA as the principle molecule of heredity. The ability of prions to recruit similar proteins to alternate conformations may engender a reservoir of diversity supplementing the genetic diversity resulting from stochastic mutations of DNA and subsequent natural selection. Here we present several currently known prions and how many of their functions as well as modes of transmission are intricately linked to adaptation from an evolutionary perspective.

Measurements of NT50 are difficult to implement in large quantities. A high-throughput laboratory test is expected for determining the level of herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We analyzed samples from 168 Japanese healthcare workers who had completed two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. We analyzed immunoglobulin G (IgG) index values against spike protein (SP) using automated chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay system AIA-CL and analyzed the background factors affecting antibody titer. SP IgG index was compared with 50% neutralization titers. RESULTS: The median SP IgG index values of the subjects (mean age = 43 years; 75% female) were 0.1, 1.35, 60.80, and 97.35 before and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the first dose, respectively. At 4 and 6 weeks after the first dose, SP IgG titers were found to have positive correlation with NT50 titer (r = 0.7535 in 4 weeks; r = 0.4376 in 6 weeks). Proportions of the SP IgG index values against the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants compared with the original strain were 2.029, 0.544, 1.017, and 0.6096 respectively. Older age was associated with lower SP IgG titer index 6 weeks after the first dose. CONCLUSIONS: SP IgG index values were rised at 3 weeks after two doses of BNT162b2 vaccination and have positive correlation with NT50.

Despite being essential to slow down the COVID-19 pandemic, these containment measures are associated with an economic burden. In this work, we propose a network approach to model the implementation of a partial lockdown, breaking the society into disconnected components, or partitions. Our model is composed by two main ingredients: a multiplex network representing human contacts within different contexts, formed by a Household layer, a Work layer, and a third Social layer including generic social interactions, and a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered process that mimics the epidemic spreading. We compare different partition strategies, with a twofold aim: reducing the epidemic outbreak and minimizing the economic cost associated to the partial lockdown. We also show that the inclusion of unconstrained social interactions dramatically increases the epidemic spreading, while different kinds of restrictions on social interactions help in keeping the benefices of the network partition.","output":"Modeling partial lockdowns in multiplex networks using partition strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Staphylococcus aureus was used as an indicator to study the origin and spread of microbial aerosol in and around chicken houses. Air samples indoor, upwind (10 and 50 m), and downwind (10, 50, 100, 200, and 400 m) of four chicken houses were collected using Andersen\\\\6 stages sampler. The concentrations of S. aureus were determined for every sample site. Isolation of S. aureus from chicken feces was performed according to the standard method. The genetic relationship among the isolates was determined by profiles of PCR\\\\amplified repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP\\\\PCR) elements. The results showed that the concentrations of S. aureus indoor of four chicken houses were higher than those upwind and downwind sites (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), but there were no significant concentration differences among downwind sites (P > 0.05). The fingerprints and the phylogenetic tree indicated that a part of the S. aureus (55.6%, 10/18) isolates from indoor air had the same REP\\\\PCR fingerprints as feces isolates. Consequently, most isolates (57.1%, 20/35) from downwind 10, 50, 100, 200, even 400 m had the same REP\\\\PCR fingerprints as those from indoor or feces. These data indicated that some isolates from downwind and indoor originated from the chicken feces. However, those isolates from upwind had low similarity (similarity index 0.6C0.87) to those from indoor or feces. Therefore, the isolates upwind were not from the chicken feces or indoor. These results suggest that microbes in chicken feces can be aerosolized and spread indoor and outdoor, especially to downwind of the chicken houses. It should have an important epidemiological and public health significance. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Thus, the use of S. aureus as an indicator to study the origin and spread of airborne pathogens from chicken houses is potentially useful for enhancing public health and understanding the airborne epidemiology of this pathogen.

To overcome deleterious freeze/thaw cycles and to reduce high costs for shipping and storage, we sought to develop a procedure which enables MALDI-MS protein profiling of blood serum proteins without the need for serum freezing. METHODS Blood sera from patients/donors were divided into portions which after pre-incubation were fast frozen. Thawed aliquots were deposited on filter paper discs and air dried at room temperature. Intact serum proteins were eluted with acid-labile detergent-containing solutions and were desalted by employing a reverse-phase bead system. Purified protein solutions were screened by MALDI-MS using standardized instrument settings. RESULTS MALDI mass spectra from protein solutions which were eluted from filter paper discs and desalted showed on average 25 strong ion signals (mass range m/z 6000 to m/z 10,000) from intact serum proteins (apolipoproteins, complement proteins, transthyretin and hemoglobin) and from proteolytic processing products. Semi-quantitative analysis of three ion pairs: m/z 6433 and 6631, m/z 8205 and 8916, as well as m/z 9275 and 9422 indicated that the mass spectra from either pre-incubated fast-frozen serum or pre-incubated dried serum spot eluted serum contained the same information on protein composition. CONCLUSIONS A workflow that avoids the conventional cold-chain and yet enables to investigate intact serum proteins and/or serum proteolysis products by MALDI-MS profiling was developed. The here described protocol tremendously broadens clinical application of MALDI-MS and simultaneously allows to reduce the costs for storage and shipping of serum samples.

World Health Organization (WHO) has already updated the guidelines and advised the use of face masks in public areas essentially. This has dramatically increased the production and use of face masks in many parts of the world. Arabian Peninsula is comprised of six countries where the public perception of following WHO guidelines is high. In this study, we highlight the concerns relating to extensive use of face masks in this region, particularly in the context of (micro-)plastic pollution. We computed the number of face masks to be used in each of the countries of Arabian Peninsula for varying levels of acceptance rate and average number of daily usages. Accordingly, the amount of (micro-)plastic that could come into the terrestrial and marine environment is also reported. Saudi Arabia, being the most populated country in the region may contribute up to 32 C 235 thousand tons of (micro-)plastic which is nearly half of the amount in the whole Peninsula. On the other hand, an extremely high infection rate in Qatar (25.74%) may also lead to a significant increase of (micro-)plastic content due to high public acceptance rate and living standards. The high (micro-)plastic fraction is of significant concern because it ends up in the marine ecosystems. Further, it allows colonization of several pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungal filaments, and spores) and might serve as carriers of disease transmission finally affecting the living organisms habituating these ecosystems. It is suggested that appropriate regulations on face masks waste should be devised to avoid any unwanted consequences in the near future.","output":"Extensive use of face masks during COVID-19 pandemic: (micro-)plastic pollution and potential health concerns in the Arabian Peninsula"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virus SARS-CoV2 (beta-coronavirus) can induce severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure and multiorgan dysfunction.

This article investigates the impacts of these changes on climate change and human health (due to air pollution) as a challenge for both citizens and governments in four countries: Colombia, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal. Technical summary The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with global challenges in both energy supply and demand. Numerous articles have discussed the potential benefits of COVID-19 for our planet to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollutants. By bringing the emissions from the energy production together with the air quality indicators, this article studies the impact on climate change and human health due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the consequent changes in energy policies of governments as well as lifestyles in different societies. This study shows that in spite of having a reduction, the GHG emissions might go back to previous or higher levels if governments do not see this pandemic as an opportunity to promote the use of renewable energies, which are becoming cheaper than non-renewables. Additionally, lower energy demand and less anthropogenic activities do not necessarily result in lower GHG emissions from energy production. Our results highlight the need for revising the policies and decisions of both governments and citizens, as temporary reductions in the levels of energy demand and air pollutants can easily be counterbalanced by adverse effects, known as the 'rebound effect.'

At Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), we have integrated and systematized health-related values discussions led by oncology nurses for newly diagnosed cancer patients as part of routine comprehensive cancer care. Such conversations include not only the patients wishes for care at the end of life but also more holistic personal values, including sources of strength, concerns, hopes, and their definition of an acceptable quality of life. In addition, health care providers use a structured template to document their discussions of patient goals of care. OBJECTIVE: To provide ready access to key information about the patient as a person with individual values, goals, and preferences, we undertook the creation of the Patient Values Tab in our centers EHR to display this information in a single, central location. Here, we describe the interprofessional, interdisciplinary, iterative process and user-centered design methodology that we applied to build this novel functionality as well as our initial implementation experience and plans for evaluation. METHODS: We first convened a working group of experts from multiple departments, including medical oncology, health informatics, information systems, nursing informatics, nursing education, and supportive care, and a user experience designer. We conducted in-depth, semistructured, audiorecorded interviews of over 100 key stakeholders. The working group sought consensus on the tabs main content, homing in on high-priority areas identified by the stakeholders. The core content was mapped to various EHR data sources. We established a set of high-level design principles to guide our process. Our user experience designer then created wireframes of the tab design. The designer conducted usability testing with physicians, nurses, and other health professionals. Data validation testing was conducted. RESULTS: We have already deployed the Patient Values Tab to a pilot sample of users in the MSK Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology Service, including physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, and administrative staff. We have early evidence of the positive impact of this EHR innovation. Audit logs show increasing use. Many of the initial user comments have been enthusiastically positive, while others have provided constructive suggestions for additional tab refinements with respect to format and content. CONCLUSIONS: It is our challenge and obligation to enrich the EHR with information about the patient as a person.

Thirty semistructured telephone interviews with parents of children between 4 and 18 years. RESULTS: We found four themes relating to symptom attribution (normalising symptoms, err on the side of caution, experience of temperature, symptoms not normal for us). In general, parents were more likely to attribute symptoms to COVID-19 if a temperature was present or the symptoms were perceived as unusual for their family. Four themes relating to self-isolation (difficult to prevent contact with children, isolation would be no different to lockdown life, ability to get food and supplies, limited space).

We suggest that they can be overcome by (a) providing better guidance on what symptoms require action, (b) providing guidance as to how to prevent infection within the household and (c) by supporting families with grocery shopping through a potential second or third wave.","output":"Parental perceptions of COVID-19Clike illness in their children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Human coronaviruses (HCV) are ubiquitous pathogens which cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and possibly neurological disorders. To better understand the molecular biology of the prototype HCV-229E strain, the complete nucleotide sequence of the membrane protein (M) gene was determined from cloned cDNA. The open reading frame is preceded by a consensus transcriptional initiation sequence UCUAAACU, identical to the one found upstream of the N gene. The M gene encodes a 225-amino acid polypeptide with a molecular weight (MW) of 25,822, slightly higher than the apparent MW of 19,000C22,000 observed for the unprocessed M protein obtained after in vitro translation and immunoprecipitation. The M amino acid sequence presents a significant degree of homology (38%) with its counterpart of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). The M protein of HCV-229E is highly hydrophobic and its hydropathicity profile shows a transmembranous region composed of three major hydrophobic domains characteristic of a typical coronavirus M protein. About 10% (20 amino acids) of the HCV-229E M protein constitutes a hydrophilic and probably external portion. One N-glycosylation and three potential O-glycosylation sites are found in this exposed domain.","output":"Sequence analysis of the membrane protein gene of human coronavirus 229E"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"METHODS In acute ischemic stroke, good outcome following successful recanalization is time dependent. In patients undergoing endovascular therapy at our institution, recanalization times with the Solitaire stent were retrospectively evaluated to assess for the presence of a learning curve in achieving rapid recanalization. METHODS We reviewed patients who presented to our stroke center and achieved successful recanalization with the Solitaire stent exclusively. Time intervals were calculated (CT to angiography arrival, angiography arrival to groin puncture, groin puncture to first deployment, and deployment to recanalization) from time stamped images and angiography records. Patients were divided into three sequential groups, with overall CT to recanalization time and subdivided time intervals compared. RESULTS 83 patients were treated with the Solitaire stent from May 2009 to February 2012. Recanalization (Thrombolyis in Cerebral Infarction score 2A) occurred in 75 (90.4%) patients. CT to recanalization demonstrated significant improvement over time, which was greatest between the first 25 and the most recent 25 cases (161-94 min; p<0.01). The maximal contribution to this was from improvements in first stent deployment to recanalization time (p=0.001 between the first and third groups), with modest contributions from moving patients from CT to the angiography suite faster (p=0.02 between the first and third groups) and from groin puncture to first stent deployment (p=0.02 between the first and third groups). CONCLUSIONS There is a learning curve involved in the efficient use of the Solitaire stent in endovascular acute stroke therapy. Along with improvements in patient transfer to angiography and improved efficiency with intracranial access, mastering this device contributed significantly towards reducing recanalization times.","output":"Mechanical thrombectomy with the Solitaire stent: is there a learning curve in achieving rapid recanalization times?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The goals of this study were to determine baseline and postbariatric surgical characteristics associated with type 2 diabetes remission and if, after controlling for differences in weight loss, diabetes remission was greater after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) than laparoscopic gastric banding (LAGB). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS An observational cohort of obese participants was studied using generalized linear mixed models to examine the associations of bariatric surgery type and diabetes remission rates for up to 3 years. Of 2,458 obese participants enrolled, 1,868 (76%) had complete data to assess diabetes status at both baseline and at least one follow-up visit. Of these, 627 participants (34%) were classified with diabetes: 466 underwent RYGBP and 140 underwent LAGB. RESULTS After 3 years, 68.7% of RYGBP and 30.2% of LAGB participants were in diabetes remission. Baseline factors associated with diabetes remission included a lower weight for LAGB, greater fasting C-peptide, lower leptin-to-fat mass ratio for RYGBP, and a lower hemoglobin A1c without need for insulin for both procedures. After both procedures, greater postsurgical weight loss was associated with remission. However, even after controlling for differences in amount of weight lost, relative diabetes remission rates remained nearly twofold higher after RYGBP than LAGB. CONCLUSIONS Diabetes remission up to 3 years after RYGBP and LAGB was proportionally higher with increasing postsurgical weight loss. However, the nearly twofold greater weight loss-adjusted likelihood of diabetes remission in subjects undergoing RYGBP than LAGB suggests unique mechanisms contributing to improved glucose metabolism beyond weight loss after RYGBP.","output":"Type 2 Diabetes Remission Rates After Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass and Gastric Banding: Results of the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has been associated with stress and challenges for healthcare professionals, especially for those working in the front-line of treating COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to: 1) assess changes in well-being and perceived stress symptoms of Dutch emergency department (ED) staff in the course of the first COVID-19 wave, and 2) assess and explore stressors experienced by ED staff since the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire was administered during June-July 2020 to physicians, nurses and non-clinical staff of four EDs in the Netherlands. Well-being and stress symptoms (i.e., cognitive, emotional and physical) were scored for the periods pre, during and after the first COVID-19 wave using the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and a 10-point Likert scale. Stressors were assessed and explored by rating experiences with specific situations (i.e., frequency and intensity of distress) and in free-text narratives. Quantitative data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equations (GEE). Narratives were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: In total, 192 questionnaires were returned (39% response). Compared to pre-COVID-19, the mean WHO-5 index score (range: 0-100) decreased significantly with 14.1 points (p < 0.001) during the peak of the first wave and 3.7 points (< 0.001) after the first wave. Mean self-perceived stress symptom levels almost doubled during the peak of the first wave (&#8804;0.005). Half of the respondents reported experiencing more moral distress in the ED since the COVID-19 outbreak. High levels of distress were primarily found in situations where the staff was unable to provide or facilitate necessary emotional support to a patient or family. Analysis of 51 free-texts revealed witnessing suffering, high work pressure, fear of contamination, inability to provide comfort and support, rapidly changing protocols regarding COVID-19 care and personal protection, and shortage of protection equipment as important stressors. CONCLUSIONS: The first COVID-19 wave took its toll on ED staff. Actions to limit drop-out and illness among staff resulting from psychological distress are vital to secure acute care for (non-)COVID-19 patients during future infection waves.","output":"Holding the frontline: a cross-sectional survey of emergency department staff well-being and psychological distress in the course of the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The present study investigated whether regional anesthetic techniques, especially truncal blocks, can provide adjunct anesthesia without the additional risk of general anesthesia and neuraxial techniques for subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) implantation.

INTERVENTIONS Patients received either a combination of serratus anterior plane block and transversus thoracis plane block or surgical infiltration of local anesthetics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Perioperative analgesic medication in the fascial plane block group versus the surgical wound infiltration group, visual analog pain scale score (0-10), intraoperative vital signs, total procedure time, and length of stay in the intensive care unit were measured. Total intraoperative fentanyl requirements (g) were significantly less in the truncal block group versus the surgical infiltration group (45 [25-50] v 90 [50-100]; p = 0.026), and no patients had any adverse sequelae related to the study. Median intraoperative propofol use in the surgical infiltration group was 66.48 (47.30-73.73) g/kg/min, and 65.95 (51.86-104.86) g/kg/min for the truncal block group.

The test set consisted of 410 archived respiratory specimens, mostly nasopharyngeal swabs, including 210 that had been positive by conventional testing for a balanced selection of common respiratory viruses. Specimens yielding discrepant results were evaluated using a panel of respiratory virus PCR assays developed, characterized, and validated with clinical specimens. PLx-RVP increased the total rate of detection of viruses by 35.8%, and there was a 25.7% increase in the rate of detection of positive specimens. Reference PCR assay results corroborated the PLx-RVP result for 54 (82%) of 66 discrepancies with conventional testing. Of the 12 specimens with discrepancies between PLx-RVp and the reference PCRs, 6 were positive for rhinovirus by PLx-RVP and the presence of rhinovirus was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The remaining six specimens included five in which the PLx-RVP failed to detect parainfluenza virus and one in which the detection of influenza A virus by PLx-RVP could not be confirmed by the reference PCR. Taking the results of the reference PCR assay results into account, the sensitivities of the PLx-RVP for individual viruses ranged from 94 to 100% and the specificities ranged from 99 to 100%. We conclude that PLx-RVP is a highly accurate system for the detection of respiratory viruses and significantly improves the rate of detection of these viruses compared to that by conventional virologic testing.","output":"Comparison of the Eragen Multi-Code Respiratory Virus Panel with conventional viral testing and real-time multiplex PCR assays for detection of respiratory viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the relatively serious global epidemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection, public concerns focus on not only clinical therapeutic measures and public quarantine for this disease but also the development of vaccines.

The development of an automatic diagnostic tool, able to detect the disease in its early stage, could undoubtedly offer a great advantage to the battle against the pandemic. In this regard, most of the research efforts have been focused on the application of Deep Learning (DL) techniques to chest images, including traditional chest X-rays (CXRs) and Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Although these approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness in detecting the COVID-19 disease, they are of huge computational complexity and require large datasets for training. In addition, there may not exist a large amount of COVID-19 CXRs and CT scans available to researchers. To this end, in this paper, we propose an approach based on the evaluation of the histogram from a common class of images that is considered as the target. A suitable inter-histogram distance measures how this target histogram is far from the histogram evaluated on a test image: if this distance is greater than a threshold, the test image is labeled as anomaly, i.e., the scan belongs to a patient affected by COVID-19 disease. Extensive experimental results and comparisons with some benchmark state-of-the-art methods support the effectiveness of the developed approach, as well as demonstrate that, at least when the images of the considered datasets are homogeneous enough (i.e., a few outliers are present), it is not really needed to resort to complex-to-implement DL techniques, in order to attain an effective detection of the COVID-19 disease. Despite the simplicity of the proposed approach, all the considered metrics (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure) attain a value of 1.0 under the selected datasets, a result comparable to the corresponding state-of-the-art DNN approaches, but with a remarkable computational simplicity.","output":"A Histogram-Based Low-Complexity Approach for the Effective Detection of COVID-19 Disease from CT and X-ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Certolizumab pegol (CZP), the only Fc-free, PEGylated anti-tumor necrosis factor biologic agent.

We have used a model-based approach to explore the relative impact of alternative dosing regimens proposed in different dosing protocols for hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19. METHODS: We compared different PK exposures using Monte Carlo simulations based on a previously published population pharmacokinetic model in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, externally validated using both independent data in lupus erythematous patients and recent data in French COVID-19 patients. Clinical efficacy and safety information from COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ were used to contextualize and assess the actual clinical value of the model predictions. RESULTS: Literature and observed clinical data confirm the variability in clinical responses in COVID-19 when treated with the same fixed doses. Confounding factors were identified that should be taken into account for dose recommendation. For 80% of patients, doses higher than 800 mg day on day 1 followed by 600 mg daily on following days might not be needed for being cured. Limited adverse drug reactions have been reported so far for this dosing regimen, most often confounded by co-medications, comorbidities or underlying COVID-19 disease effects.

It may be guided by various factors such as network topology, type of propagated behavior, and the strength of network connections. In this paper, we claim that the type of social interactions is also an important ingredient of behavioral diffusion. We examine the spread of academic achievements of first-year undergraduate students through friendship and study assistance networks, applying stochastic actor-oriented modeling. We show that informal social connections transmit performance while instrumental connections do not. The results highlight the importance of friendship in educational environments and contribute to debates on the behavior spread in social networks.","output":"How academic achievement spreads: The role of distinct social networks in academic performance diffusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have shown high efficacy, but immunocompromised participants were excluded from controlled clinical trials. In this study, we compared immune responses to the BNT162b2 mRNA Coronavirus Disease 2019 vaccine in patients with solid tumors (n = 53) who were on active cytotoxic anti-cancer therapy to a control cohort of participants without cancer (n = 50). Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 67% of patients with cancer after the first immunization, followed by a threefold increase in median titers after the second dose. Similar patterns were observed for spike protein-specific serum antibodies and T cells, but the magnitude of each of these responses was diminished relative to the control cohort. In most patients with cancer, we detected spike receptor-binding domain and other S1-specific memory B cell subsets as potential predictors of anamnestic responses to additional immunizations. We therefore initiated a phase 1 trial for 20 cancer cohort participants of a third vaccine dose of BNT162b2 ( NCT04936997 ); primary outcomes were immune responses, with a secondary outcome of safety. At 1 week after a third immunization, 16 participants demonstrated a median threefold increase in neutralizing antibody responses, but no improvement was observed in T cell responses. Adverse events were mild. These results suggest that a third dose of BNT162b2 is safe, improves humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and could be immunologically beneficial for patients with cancer on active chemotherapy.","output":"Immune responses to two and three doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in adults with solid tumors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proinflammatory cytokine gene transcription must be moderated to avoid the pathological consequences of excess cytokine production. The relationships between virus infection and the mechanisms that moderate cytokine transcription are incompletely understood. We investigated the influence of Keap1 on cytokine gene induction by Sendai virus infection in mouse embryo fibroblasts. Virus infection induced Keap1 binding to the Ifnb1, Tnf, and Il6 genes. Keap1 moderated viral induction of their transcription by mechanisms that did not require Nrf2. Keap1 was required for NF-&#954;B p50 recruitment, but not for NF-&#954;B p65 or IRF3 recruitment, to these genes. Keap1 formed complexes with NF-&#954;B p50 and NF-&#954;B p65, which were visualized using bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis. These bimolecular fluorescence complementation complexes bound chromosomes in live cells, suggesting that Keap1 could bind chromatin in association with NF-&#954;B proteins. Keap1 was required for viral induction of G9a-GLP lysine methyltransferase binding and H3K9me2 modification at cytokine genes. G9a-GLP inhibitors counteracted transcription repression by Keap1 and enhanced Keap1 and NF-&#954;B recruitment to cytokine genes. The interrelationships among Keap1, NF-&#954;B, and G9a-GLP recruitment, activities, and transcriptional effects suggest that they form a feedback circuit, which moderates viral induction of cytokine transcription. Nrf2 counteracted Keap1 binding to cytokine genes and the recruitment of NF-&#954;B p50 and G9a-GLP by Keap1. Whereas Keap1 has been reported to influence cytokine expression indirectly through its functions in the cytoplasm, these findings provide evidence that Keap1 regulates cytokine transcription directly in the nucleus. Keap1 binds to cytokines genes upon virus infection and moderates their induction by recruiting NF-&#954;B p50 and G9a-GLP.","output":"Virus Infection Induces Keap1 Binding to Cytokine Genes, Which Recruits NF-B p50 and G9a-GLP and Represses Cytokine Transcription"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ultrastructure ofOryza sativa L. cells in suspension was determined as cells developed, matured and senesced at 3, 10, and 17 days, respectively, after transfer to fresh medium.

The molecular mechanisms of those biases are still poorly understood because it is difficult to isolate the contributions of DNA repair from those of DNA damage. RESULTS: Here, we develop a genome-wide assay whereby the same DNA lesion is repaired in different genomic contexts. We insert thousands of barcoded transposons carrying a reporter of DNA mismatch repair in the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells. Upon inducing a double-strand break between tandem repeats, a mismatch is generated if the break is repaired through single-strand annealing. The resolution of the mismatch showed a 60C80% bias in favor of the strand with the longest 3 flap. The location of the lesion in the genome and the type of mismatch had little influence on the bias. Instead, we observe a complete reversal of the bias when the longest 3 flap is moved to the opposite strand by changing the position of the double-strand break in the reporter. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the processing of the double-strand break has a major influence on the repair of mismatches during a single-strand annealing.

Catalpol, puerarin, salvianolic acid B, ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rb1 and ginsenoside Rd are six of main effective components, which could be partly representative of this prescription. The corona charged aerosol detector (corona CAD) is one kind of universal detectors equipped with the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The CAD has many advantages for the analysis of complex mixtures, but too few applications in traditional Chinese medicine compounds. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to establish a method for the determination of six components in Bushen Huoxue prescription, and to increase the use of the CAD in traditional Chinese medicine compounds. METHODS: HPLC-CAD analysis was performed on an Inertsil ODS-SP (4.6a?mma?a?250a?mm, 5a?m) with a mobile phase consisting of 0.5 % formic acid solution(A)-acetonitrile(B) at a flow rate of 1a?mL/min (0-7a?min, 1 % B; 7-12a?min, 1 %-12 % B; 12-22a?min, 12 %-19 % B; 22-40a?min, 19 %-28 % B; 40-43a?min, 28 %-33 % B; 43-50a?min, 33 % B; 50-65a?min, 33 %-42 % B). The column temperature maintained at 30 a??, the injection volume was 20a?L, the atomization temperature mode was LOW, the filtration constant (filter) was 3.6 and data collection rate was 10a?Hz. The methodology was examined and the linearity of regression of different functions was compared. Sixteen batches of samples were prepared and their contents were determined. RESULTS: The six compounds showed a better linearity (R2 > 0.9990) in their concentration ranges when using the linear function. The average recoveries were 99.18 %-101.30 %. Although the RSD value of puerarin and ginsenoside Rg1 was slightly out of 3 % during the average recovery investigation, all the other methodological investigations of the six components were within 3 %. The precision, stability and repeatability of the method were good. In sixteen batches of Bushen Huoxue prescription samples, the contents of six components were 0.3138 %-0.6042 % for catalpol, 0.8095 %-1.2917 % for puerarin, 0.7416 %-1.1189 % for salvianolic acid B, 0.0231 %-0.0418 % for ginsenoside Rg1, 0.0702 %-0.1724 % for ginsenoside Rb1, 0.0384 %-0.1196 % for ginsenoside Rd. CONCLUSION: In this experiment, a method for the determination of six components in Bushen Huoxue prescription based on HPLC-CAD was established with high accuracy, good repeatability and simple operation, and it can provide references for the improvement of quality standard of the Bushen Huoxue prescription.

It was approved for use in 2017 by NICE for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Considering the current risk of COVID-19, the BSR have advocated the use of short-acting drugs such as baricitinib when escalating treatment in RA. As real-world data is limited, we aimed to explore the efficacy of baricitinib in clinical practice. Methods Observational data was collected retrospectively for patients at the Dudley Group NHSFT with RA (ACR/EULAR criteria) who had received at least one dose of baricitinib prior to 1st October 2019, with a follow up period to 1st October 2020. Patients were identified from a local biologics database. Further data was identified from patients medical records including, demographics, features of RA, previous RA therapy history and disease activity scores (DAS28) at 0, 6 and 12 months. Data was input into an Excel spreadsheet with subsequent analysis conducted using SPSS Version26. Results We identified 26 RA patients (77% female) treated with baricitinib; mean age 61.6 (SD 14.6) years and median disease duration of 12.1 (IQR 5.8-18.4) years. Rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibody were positive in 73% and 65% respectively. 35% (n = 9) of patients were biologically na?ve, in whom baricitinib was chosen due to needle-phobia (n = 7), or where anti-TNF drugs were considered inappropriate (bronchiectasis, ANA positivity). Mean DAS28 (SD) scores at baseline, 6 and 12 months were 5.9(0.8), 2.8(0.9) and 2.7(1.3) respectively, with significant reduction from baseline to both 6 and 12 months (P < 0.001). A drop of  1.2 in DAS28 was recorded in 94% of patients with complete data at 6 months (n = 18, 4 missing, 4 discontinued). At 6 and 12 months, 85% and 81% of patients remained on Baricitinib. In total five patients discontinued Baricitinib due to side effects or tolerability issues. Reasons for discontinuation did not include thromboembolic events, zoster or serious infections. When comparing na?ve and non-na?ve groups, there was no significant difference in age, sex or disease duration. The number of previous biologics used by patients were 1(n = 6), 2(n = 3), 3(n = 8). Biologically naive compared to non-na?ve patients had a higher DAS28 at baseline, (Mean [SD]) (6.2[0.9] versus 5.7[0.8] NS) but lower at 6 months (2.1[1.6] versus 3.1[1.1] P = 0.023) and greater DAS improvement at 6months (-4.4[1.2] versus -2.5[0.9] P < 0.002). Conclusion We observed that up to 94% of patients responded to baricitinib with a mean DAS improvement at 6 months of -3.1, biologic na?ve patients doing best. Drug survival at 12 months was 81%.

The phylogenetic trees based on the S1, M and N genes exhibited considerably different topology and the CK/CH/LSC/99I-type isolates were the predominant IBVs based on the phylogenetic analysis of S1 gene. Results of entropy of amino acid sequences revealed that the S1 gene had the largest variation; the M gene had less variation than the N gene.

The transferability, resistance phenotypes, plasmid replicon typing properties and genetic environments of fosA- and/or fosA3-positive strains were characterized. Five E. cloacae isolates were positive for fosA and three coharbored fosA and fosA3. No fosC determinant was detected. Transconjugants of fosA3 were successfully acquired, while the acquisition of fosA transconjugants was failed. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the three fosA3-positive isolates and their transconjugants were 256 mg/L, whereas the MICs of the five fosA-positive isolates ranged from 64 mg/L to 256 mg/L. Three plasmid replicons (InCFrepB, InCL/M, and InCHI2) were identified in fosA- and fosA3-positive E. cloacae isolates.

RESULTS: TNF- and soluble cytokine receptor AH levels were significantly higher in uveitis patients (n = 45) compared with controls (n = 9). When nongranulomatous uveitis (BD and HLA-B27-associated uveitis) was compared with granulomatous uveitis (sarcoidosis and VKH disease), the levels of sCD30 and sTNFRI/TNF- and sTNFRII/TNF- ratios were significantly enhanced in granulomatous uveitis.

Results: About 10% of respondents have had experience using LAI and the current utilization rate is 2.4%. Respondents' willingness to accept LAI is generally low (only 18.1% are willing). The main reason for willingness is no need to take medication every day, while the main reasons for unwillingness are high cost, fear of injection and lack of understanding. Conclusion: Beijing community patients are not very optimistic about LAI's cognition and willingness. Medication habits play an important role in their medication selection decisions. Intervention such as educate clinicians and patients about LAI and provide free injections to patients can be imposed. The promotion of LAI still has a long way to go.","output":"Attitudes and Willingness to Accept Long-Acting Injections for Patients With Schizophrenia in Beijing: A Cross-Sectional Investigation Based on Samples From the Communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Neopterin (NP) is a biomarker for activated cellular immunity and is elevated in diseases including viral and bacterial infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. However, the clinical assessment of neopterin has not been used for these disorders because the physiological significance of measuring NP is obscure. It would be important to compare the NP profiles with those of other inflammation markers to reveal the significance of NP measurements in pathological states.Methods: Plasma NP, CRP, and IL-6 levels were measured in 46 patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 13 patients with non-COVID-19 respiratory disorders. The correlations between these markers were analyzed in the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients independently.Results: The NP levels were significantly higher in the COVID-19 patients than in the non-COVID-19 patients, while both CRP and IL-6 were not changed significantly. Among the COVID-19 patients, all three values increased with the severity of symptoms. NP levels were not correlated with CRP or IL-6 levels in COVID-19 patients but were correlated with IL-6 levels in non-COVID-19 patients. The CRP levels were correlated with those of IL-6 in both the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients.Conclusions: The elevation of NP levels was distinct from those of CRP and IL-6 in COVID-19 patients.

METHOD: We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of this policy by using a difference-in-difference approach to compare changes in volume between January 2016 and February 2020 in a treatment group of low value procedures against a control group unaffected by the EBI programme during our period of analysis but subsequently identified as candidates for disinvestment. RESULTS: We found only small differences between the treatment and control group after implementation, with reductions in volumes in the treatment group 0.10% (95% CI 0.09% to 0.11%) smaller than in the control group (equivalent to 16 low value procedures per month). During the month of implementation, reductions in volumes in the treatment group were 0.05% (95% CI 0.03% to 0.06%) smaller than in the control group (equivalent to 7 low value procedures). Using triple difference estimators, we found that reductions in volumes were 0.35% (95% CI 0.26% to 0.44%) larger in NHS hospitals than independent sector providers (equivalent to 47 low value procedures per month). We found no significant differences between clinical commissioning groups that did or did not volunteer to be part of a demonstrator community to trial EBI guidance, but found reductions in volume were 0.06% (95% CI 0.04% to 0.08%) larger in clinical commissioning groups that posted a deficit in the financial year 2018/19 before implementation (equivalent to 4 low value procedures per month). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that the EBI programme did not accelerate disinvestment for procedures under its remit during our period of analysis.

Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress levels among people across the globe. Therefore, continuous monitoring and detection of stress are necessary. The recent advances in wearable devices have allowed the monitoring of several physiological signals related to stress. Among them, wrist-worn wearable devices like smartwatches are most popular due to their convenient usage. And the photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor is the most prevalent sensor in almost all consumer-grade wrist-worn smartwatches. Therefore, this paper focuses on using a wrist-based PPG sensor that collects Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) signals to detect stress which may be applicable for consumer-grade wristwatches. Moreover, state-of-the-art works have used either classical machine learning algorithms to detect stress using hand-crafted features or have used deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which automatically extracts features. This paper proposes a novel hybrid CNN (H-CNN) classifier that uses both the hand-crafted features and the automatically extracted features by CNN to detect stress using the BVP signal. Evaluation on the benchmark WESAD dataset shows that, for 3-class classification (Baseline vs. Stress vs. Amusement), our proposed H-CNN outperforms traditional classifiers and normal CNN by 5% and 7% accuracy, and 10% and 7% macro F1 score, respectively.

Taste impairments are not life-threatening conditions, but they can cause sufficient discomfort and lead to appetite loss and changes in eating habits, with possible effects on health. Determinants of such alterations are multiple and consist of both genetic and environmental factors, including aging, exposure to chemicals, drugs, trauma, high alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, poor oral health, malnutrition, and viral upper respiratory infections including influenza.

In other word, the courses started using blended teaching model before COVID-19 outbreak and might last using other forms of distance learning throughout the pandemic. Five Point Likert Scale Questionnaires which contains 20 items were used, and the effect of the two kinds of teaching patterns was compared by evaluating the indicators of core competencies of students including professionalism, attitude towards learning, knowledge and learning skills, teamwork skills, motivation in learning, adaptability and acceptance of the courses and network environment. Setting: Our study based on a single center. Participants: Fifty fourth-year medical students receiving the 5+3 pattern courses regarding internal medicine were enrolled in the study. Exposure(s) :The teaching and learning patter started using blended teaching model before COVID-19 outbreak and might last using other forms of distance learning throughout the pandemic. Main Outcome: According to the descriptive statistical analysis of the first part of the questionnaire (question 1-16), the average score of adaptability and acceptance of the courses is 2.60 lower than 3, indicating that students are more adapted to other forms of distance learning during COVID-19 outbreak; the average score of the rest of the questions is higher than 3, indicating that blended teaching model based on 5G network is superior to other forms of distance learning. The number of male students who are inclined to the blended teaching model based on 5G network is 0.13 times as much as that of female students (95%CI:0.028~0.602, p=0.009). Results: Online forms of distance learning were accepted by the students.

One faculty member from each of 203 institutions was requested to respond and there were no duplicate participants. Seventy-nine participants (38.9%) responded and 74 responses were analyzed. Descriptive statistics were presented for all survey items. Results: Fifty-two faculty members (70.3%) belonged to universities and 22 (29.7%) taught at colleges. Thirty-eight (51.4%) answered that their institutions had affiliated teaching hospitals. More than half (52.7%) conducted hospital-based clinical practicums either entirely (n=20) or partially (n=19), whereas the rest of them (47.3%) conducted clinical practicums at school or home via online teaching. The typical teaching methods for offline or online education were case conferences, tests or quizzes, scenario studies, nursing skill practicums, (virtual) nursing simulations, and simulated patient education. Most of faculties (93.2%) supported the development of an educational platform to share educational materials and resources, such as case scenarios.

However, data are limited on how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters and spreads in a population. METHODS: We targeted testing to persons living in Iceland who were at high risk for infection (mainly those who were symptomatic, had recently traveled to high-risk countries, or had contact with infected persons). We also carried out population screening using two strategies: issuing an open invitation to 10,797 persons and sending random invitations to 2283 persons. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 643 samples. RESULTS: As of April 4, a total of 1221 of 9199 persons (13.3%) who were recruited for targeted testing had positive results for infection with SARS-CoV-2. Of those tested in the general population, 87 (0.8%) in the open-invitation screening and 13 (0.6%) in the random-population screening tested positive for the virus. In total, 6% of the population was screened. Most persons in the targeted-testing group who received positive tests early in the study had recently traveled internationally, in contrast to those who tested positive later in the study. Children under 10 years of age were less likely to receive a positive result than were persons 10 years of age or older, with percentages of 6.7% and 13.7%, respectively, for targeted testing; in the population screening, no child under 10 years of age had a positive result, as compared with 0.8% of those 10 years of age or older. Fewer females than males received positive results both in targeted testing (11.0% vs. 16.7%) and in population screening (0.6% vs. 0.9%). The haplotypes of the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses were diverse and changed over time. The percentage of infected participants that was determined through population screening remained stable for the 20-day duration of screening. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based study in Iceland, children under 10 years of age and females had a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than adolescents or adults and males. The proportion of infected persons identified through population screening did not change substantially during the screening period, which was consistent with a beneficial effect of containment efforts.

However, non-English-language science is expected to bring unique and valuable scientific information, especially in disciplines where the evidence is patchy, and for emergent issues where synthesising available evidence is an urgent challenge. Yet such contribution of non-English-language science to scientific communities and the application of science is rarely quantified. Here, we show that non-English-language studies provide crucial evidence for informing global biodiversity conservation. By screening 419,679 peer-reviewed papers in 16 languages, we identified 1,234 non-English-language studies providing evidence on the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation interventions, compared to 4,412 English-language studies identified with the same criteria. Relevant non-English-language studies are being published at an increasing rate in 6 out of the 12 languages where there were a sufficient number of relevant studies. Incorporating non-English-language studies can expand the geographical coverage (i.e., the number of 2  2 grid cells with relevant studies) of English-language evidence by 12% to 25%, especially in biodiverse regions, and taxonomic coverage (i.e., the number of species covered by the relevant studies) by 5% to 32%, although they do tend to be based on less robust study designs. Our results show that synthesising non-English-language studies is key to overcoming the widespread lack of local, context-dependent evidence and facilitating evidence-based conservation globally.

Tingkat okupansi tersebut disesuaikan dengan Peraturan Menteri Nomor 25 Tahun 2020 tentang Pengendalian Transportasi Selama Masa Mudik Idul Fitri Tahun 1441 Hijriah Dalam Rangka Pencegahan Penyebaran COVID-19 serta Surat Edaran Gugus Tugas Nomor 4 tentang Kriteria Pembatasan Perjalanan Orang dalam Rangka Percepatan Penanganan COVID-19. Penerapan protokol kesehatan pada penumpang Kereta Api berdampak pada semakin lamanya waktu boarding karena pengecekan dokumen-dokumen kelengkapan yang diperlukan seperti surat hasil rapid test maupun hasil swab. Pemeriksaan terhadap suhu badan pun juga dilakukan kepada setiap penumpang yang akan naik kereta. Tentunya hal ini menambah prosedur bagi penumpang saat akan naik kereta. Pemakaian masker dan menjaga jarak juga diterapkan selama dalam perjalanan bahkan selama perjalanan penumpang dilarang berbicara dengan penumpang lainnya. Berdasarkan permasalahan diatas maka perlunya dilakukan penelitian untuk mengetahui respon penumpang terkait dengan penerapan protokol Kesehatan selama mas pandemic COVID-19. Respon penumpang ini bisa dijadikan referensi bagi pihak operator kereta api dalam mengambil kebijakan pelayanan agar para penumpang tetap bisa merasa terlayani dengan sebaik mungkin. Hasil dari penelitian bahwa penumpang setuju dengan penerapan protocol Kesehatan yang dilakukan oleh PT. KAI meliputi :penumpang menyatakan sangat setuju dengan prosedur pemesanan tiket kereta api yang ditetapkan oleh KAI penumpang menyatakan sangat setuju dengan prosedur sebelum dan sesudah boarding serta selama perjalanan di kereta api yang ditetapkan oleh KAI penumpang menyatakan sangat setuju dengan prosedur penanganan kebersihan dan penyediaan fasilitas kebersihan di stasiun dan di kereta api yang ditetapkan oleh KAI penumpang menyatakan sangat setuju dengan persyaratan surat bebas COVID-19 yang ditetapkan oleh KAI penumpang cenderung memilih alternatif okupansi penumpang mengurangi jumlah penumpang dengan menaikkan harga tiket.","output":"Analisis respon penumpang terhadap penerapan new normal pada layanan kereta api jarak jauh di Pulau Jawa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During a pandemic, physicians can become so inundated with combating the disease that they may forget the individual patients experience In this perspective, the authors describe a case of COVID-19 from the point of view of the grief stages (or categories) described by Elizabeth Kbler-Ross, with an emphasis on utilizing skills to enhance the doctor-patient relationship even in this time of crisis","output":"COVID-19 and the doctor-patient relationship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a Stackelberg pricing problem a distinguished player, the leader, chooses prices for a set of items, and one or several other players, the followers, seeks to buy a feasible subset of the items with minimal costs.

The increasing mortality has revealed its severity. It is important to distinguish severe patients and provide appropriate treatment and care to prevent damages. Diabetes is reported to be a common comorbidity in COVID-19 patients and associated with higher mortality. We attempted to clarify the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 patients severity. AIM: To determine the role of type 2 diabetes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: To study the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19, we retrospectively collected 61 patients data from a tertiary medical center in Wuhan. All the patients were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and admitted to the center from February 13 to March 1, 2020. Patients age, sex, laboratory tests, chest computed tomography findings, capillary blood glucose (BG), and treatments were collected and analyzed. Fisher exact test was used for categorical data. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to explore the relationship between clinical characteristics and patients severity. RESULTS: In the 61 patients, the comorbidity of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart diseases were 24.6% (15 out of 61), 37.7% (23 out of 61), and 11.5% (7 out of 61), respectively. The diabetic group was related to more invasive treatments (P = 0.02) and severe status (P = 0.003). In univariate logistic regression, histories of diabetes (OR = 7.13, P = 0.003), hypertension (OR = 3.41, P = 0.039), and hepatic dysfunction (OR = 7.69, P = 0.002) were predictors of patients severity while heart disease (OR = 4.21, P = 0.083) and large lung involvement (OR = 2.70, P = 0.093) also slightly exacerbated patients conditions. In the multivariate analysis, diabetes (OR = 6.29, P = 0.016) and hepatic dysfunction (OR = 5.88, P = 0.018) were risk factors for severe patients. Diabetic patients showed elevated BG in 61.7% of preprandial tests and 33.3% of postprandial tests, revealing the limited control of glycemia in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: A history of type 2 diabetes is correlated with invasive treatments and severe status. Suboptimal glycemic control and hepatic dysfunction have negative effects on severity status and may lead to the exacerbation of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Diabetic patients with COVID-19 need more attention and better glycemic control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Finite mixture models cluster individuals into latent subgroups based on observed traits.

At present, we don't have specific medicines or vaccines against novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and our assessment of risk factors for patients with severe pneumonia was limited. In order to maximize the use of limited medical resources, we should distinguish between mild and severe patients as early as possible. Objective: To systematically review the evidence of risk factors for severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Evidence Review: We conducted a comprehensive search for primary literature in both Chinese and English electronic bibliographic data bases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, Weipu, Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database (CBM-SinoMed), MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register, and Web of science. The American agency for health research and quality (AHRQ) tool were used for assessing risk of bias. Mata-analysis was undertaken using STATA version 15.0. Results: 20 articles (N=4062 participants) were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. First in this review and meta-analysis, we found that elderly male patients with a high body mass index, high breathing rate and a combination of underlying diseases (such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were more likely to develop into critically ill patients. second, compared with ordinary patients, severe patients had more significant symptom such as fever and dyspnea. Besides, the laboratory test results of severe patients had more abnormal than non-severe patients, such as the elevated levels of white-cell counts, liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, c-reactive protein and procalcitonin, etc, while the decreased levels of lymphocytes and albumin, etc. Interpretation: This is the first systematic review investigating the risk factors for severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

Biology is a science that penetrates every aspect of human life and is one of the core majors in most agricultural colleges and universities. However, many teachers lack practical experience in the subject. To overcome this problem, in recent years, we have been trying to introduce new reforms into our teaching. This article provides some insight into the way that biology majors have been reformed, which will help educators in agricultural colleges and universities. At present, teachers implement the Industrial Innovation and Entrepreneurship Talent Cultivation (IIETC) model, but it is not clear whether this helps biology majors to master the course and improve their practical skills. In this study, the IIETC model is outlined, and the academic achievement and satisfaction of students taught under the IIETC model are assessed. A T-test is used to examine potential differences between IIETC and traditional teaching models. In-depth interviews and questionnaires were given to two groups of students who followed different teaching models as part of an exploratory study. The aim was to explore how effective IIETC is at helping biology majors master the course and improve students wellbeing. Our results show that compared with traditional teaching methods, the IIETC model has a significant positive impact on the academic performance and happiness of biology students. Students trained under the IIETC model were more active and scored more highly in their final exams. They were more likely to feel that they had achieved success and happiness through the course (P = 0.03). The outcomes of this research reveal a novel teaching reform that improved students enthusiasm for innovation and entrepreneurship during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Data sources available for the estimation of child mortality in Papua New Guinea (PNG) are limited. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to provide child mortality estimates at the sub-national level in PNG using new data from the integrated Health and Demographic Surveillance System (iHDSS). METHOD: Using direct estimation and indirect estimation methods, household vital statistics and maternal birth history data were analysed to estimate three key child health indicators: Under 5 Mortality Rate (U5MR), Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR) for the period 2014C2017. Differentials of estimates were evaluated by comparing the mean relative differences between the two methods. RESULTS: The direct estimations showed U5MR of 93, IMR of 51 and NMR of 34 per 1000 live births for all the sites in the period 2014C2017. The indirect estimations reported an U5MR of 105 and IMR of 67 per 1000 live births for all the sites in 2014. The mean relative differences in U5MR and IMR estimates between the two methods were 3 and 24 percentage points, respectively. U5MR estimates varied across the surveillance sites, with the highest level observed in Hela Province (136), and followed by Eastern Highlands (122), Madang (105), and Central (42). DISCUSSION: The indirect estimations showed higher estimates for U5MR and IMR than the direct estimations. The differentials between IMR estimates were larger than between U5MR estimates, implying the U5MR estimates are more reliable than IMR estimates. The variations in child mortality estimates between provinces highlight the impact of contextual factors on child mortality. The high U5MR estimates were likely associated with inequality in socioeconomic development, limited access to healthcare services, and a result of the measles outbreaks that occurred in the highlands region from 2014-2017. CONCLUSION: The iHDSS has provided reliable data for the direct and indirect estimations of child mortality at the sub-national level. This data source is complementary to the existing national data sources for monitoring and reporting child mortality in PNG.","output":"Estimating Child Mortality at the Sub-national Level in Papua New Guinea: Evidence From the Integrated Health and Demographic Surveillance System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to viral infection, the expression of numerous host genes, including predominantly a number of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, is usually up-regulated at both transcriptional and translational levels. It was noted that in cells infected with coronavirus, transcription and translation of some of these genes were differentially induced. Drastic induction of their expression at the transcriptional level was observed in cells infected with coronavirus. However, induction of the same genes at the translational level was usually found to be minimal to moderate. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out using SARS-CoV proteins as baits, revealing that a subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), eIF3f, may interact with the N-terminal region of the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein. This interaction was subsequently confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent staining. Meanwhile, parallel experiments confirmed that eIF3f could also interact with the S protein of another coronavirus, the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). These interactions led to the inhibition of translation of a reporter gene in both in vitro expression system and intact cells. Interestingly, IBV-infected cells stably expressing a Flag-tagged eIF3f showed much higher translation of IL-6 and IL-8, suggesting that the interaction between coronavirus S protein and eIF3f plays a functional role in controlling the expression of host genes, especially genes that are induced during coronavirus infection cycles.

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on all patients admitted to our paediatric emergency department for dog bite from January 2014 and December 2020. We compared the total mean dog bites of the years 2014C2019 and the mean number per single month with the respective 2020 data. The bites were divided between bites from family dogs and bites from stranger dogs. Continuous data were analysed using single sample t test while categorical values with chi-squared test, considering statistically significant a p value < 0.05. Results: From January 2014 to December 2019, we recorded a mean of 41  5.9 dog bites (range: 30C46) of which a mean 13  2.6 (range: 10C17) were due to family dogs (32%) and a mean of 28  2.4 (range: 25C31) were due to stranger dogs (68%); the male-to-female ratio was 3:2 and 43% of the injuries concerned the head and face, 26% the lower limbs, 25% the upper limbs, 3% the genitalia and 3% the torso. From January 2020 to December 2020, 30 children were admitted for dog bites: 22 were from family dogs (73%) and 8 from stranger dogs (27%); the male-to-female ratio was 14:11 and 72% of the injuries concerned the head and face, 16% the upper limbs, 8% the lower limbs and 4% the torso.

Our results provide evidence that the apo state of YAP adopts several compact conformations that may facilitate the formation of the YAP:TEAD complex.

In times of limited intensive care unit (ICU) resources, chest CTs became an important tool for the assessment of lung involvement and for patient triage despite uncertainties about the predictive diagnostic value. This study evaluated chest CT-based imaging parameters for their potential to predict in-hospital mortality compared to clinical scores. (2) Methods: 89 COVID-19 ICU ARDS patients requiring mechanical ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure mask ventilation were included in this single center retrospective study. AI-based lung injury assessment and measurements indicating pulmonary hypertension (PA-to-AA ratio) on admission CT, oxygenation indices, lung compliance and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores on ICU admission were assessed for their diagnostic performance to predict in-hospital mortality. (3) Results: CT severity scores and PA-to-AA ratios were not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality, whereas the SOFA score showed a significant association (p < 0.001). In ROC analysis, the SOFA score resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) for in-hospital mortality of 0.74 (95%-CI 0.63C0.85), whereas CT severity scores (0.53, 95%-CI 0.40C0.67) and PA-to-AA ratios (0.46, 95%-CI 0.34C0.58) did not yield sufficient AUCs. These results were consistent for the subgroup of more critically ill patients with moderate and severe ARDS on admission (oxygenation index <200, n = 53) with an AUC for SOFA score of 0.77 (95%-CI 0.64C0.89), compared to 0.55 (95%-CI 0.39C0.72) for CT severity scores and 0.51 (95%-CI 0.35C0.67) for PA-to-AA ratios.

A total of 6373 people visited the questionnaire online, 1115 people completed the questionnaire, and the number of valid questionnaires was 1081. Structural equation modeling was employed for data analysis. Results: Risk perception and its associated factors significantly affect the mental health of people in public health crises. Specifically, (1) distance perception of public health crises is negatively associated with depression among people, (2) affective risk perception is positively associated with depression of people in public health crises, (3) cognitive risk perception is negatively associated with depression of people in public health crises, and (4) support of prevention and control policies is negatively associated with depression of people in public health crises. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that risk perception plays an important role in affecting the mental health of people in a public health crisis. Therefore, health policies aiming to improve the psychological wellbeing of the people in a public health crisis should take risk perception into consideration.","output":"Risk Perception and Depression in Public Health Crises: Evidence from the COVID-19 Crisis in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anemia is a frequent manifestation in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and requires tight monitoring and adequate supplementary therapy.

The intra\\\\pandemic measures were compared to pre\\\\pandemic measures. METHODS: Participants were 473 emerging adults (M (age) = 23.84; 41.7% male) in an existing longitudinal study on alcohol misuse who were assessed from June 17 to July 1, 2020, during acute public health restrictions in Ontario, Canada.

RESULTS: Longitudinal analyses revealed significant decreases in heavy drinking and adverse alcohol consequences, with no moderation by sex or income loss, but with substantial heterogeneity in changes. Significant increases in continuous measures of depression and anxiety were present, both of which were moderated by sex. Females reported significantly larger increases in depression and anxiety. Income loss >50% was significantly associated with increases in depression.

Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a redox cofactor for eNOS (endothelial NO synthase) with a required role in NO generation. Using mice models and human samples, we investigated the physiological requirement for endothelial cell BH4 in uteroplacental vascular adaptation and blood pressure regulation to pregnancy. In pregnant mice, selective maternal endothelial BH4 deficiency resulting from targeted deletion of Gch1 caused progressive hypertension during pregnancy and fetal growth restriction. Maternal endothelial cell Gch1 deletion caused defective functional and structural remodeling in uterine arteries and in spiral arteries, leading to placental insufficiency. Using primary endothelial cells isolated from either normal or hypertensive pregnancies, we found that hypertensive pregnancies are associated with reduced endothelial cell BH4 levels, impaired eNOS activity, and reduced endothelial cell proliferation, mediated by reduced GTPCH (GTP cyclohydrolase 1) protein. In rescue experiments, high blood pressure and fetal growth restriction in pregnant endothelial cell Gch1 deficient mice was not rescued by oral BH4 supplementation, due to systemic oxidation of BH4 to dihydrobiopterin. However, the fully reduced folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate prevented BH4 oxidation, reduced blood pressure to normal levels, and normalized fetal growth. We identify a critical requirement for maternal endothelial cell BH4 biosynthesis in uteroplacental vascular remodeling in pregnancy. Restoration of endothelial cell BH4 with reduced folates identifies a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of pregnancy-related hypertension such as preeclampsia.","output":"Endothelial GTPCH (GTP Cyclohydrolase 1) and Tetrahydrobiopterin Regulate Gestational Blood Pressure, Uteroplacental Remodeling, and Fetal Growth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 100 million cases and caused immense burdens on governments and healthcare systems worldwide.

Ly6Clo monocyte-like cells in the kidneys upregulated Il6 and chemoattracting genes including Ccl5 and Cxcl13. The higher expression of Il6 in Ly6Clo monocyte-like cells compared with MF suggested these cells were more inflammatory than MF. However, MF in IMQ-induced lupus mice were characterized by their high expression of Cxcl13. Genes of proinflammatory cytokines in Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo monocytes were upregulated by stimulation with IMQ but only Ly6Chi monocytes upregulated IFN- genes upon stimulation with 2'3'-cyclic-GMP-AMP, an agonist of stimulator of interferon genes. Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo monocytes in IMQ-induced lupus mice had different features. Ly6Chi monocytes responded in the lymph nodes of locally stimulated sites and had a higher expression of IFN- upon stimulation, whereas Ly6Clo monocytes were induced slowly and tended to infiltrate into the kidneys. Infiltrated monocytes in the kidneys likely followed a trajectory through inflammatory monocyte-like cells to MF, which were then involved in the development of nephritis.","output":"Different Spatial and Temporal Roles of Monocytes and Monocyte-Derived Cells in the Pathogenesis of an Imiquimod Induced Lupus Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This study sought to determine the level of knowledge, practices and barriers towards the COVID-19 infection prevention strategies among University Students in Northern Jordan Design: This study adopted a descriptive quantitative design Materials and Methods: The researcher administered a survey to 501 participants, who were University Students in Northern Jordan Categorical data was then analyzed using three statistical tools of SPSS (v 25);descriptive statistics, spearman's correlation and linear regression analysis Results: Participants reported proper knowledge scores (84 4%), proper adherence to general hygiene (89 2%) hand hygiene (87 7%), and respiratory hygiene (80 8%) practices regarding COVID-19 infection prevention strategies Lack of personal protective equipment and the inconvenience of staying at home are the leading barriers to stopping the spread of COVID-19 Gender, marital status, level of education and age have a statistically significant impact (p 05) on the participants knowledge towards the overall prevention of the corona virus spread Discussions: This study reports outcomes that correlate with some previous quantitative research studies regarding level of knowledge However, level of knowledge does not consistently correlate with the practice Conclusions: The university students in Northern Jordan exhibit sufficient knowledge and reliable attitude regarding the prevention of COVID-19","output":"Knowledge, Practices, and Barriers towards COVID-19 Infection Prevention Strategies among University Students in Northern Jordan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The success of digital COVID-19 contact tracing requires a strategy that successfully addresses the digital divide-inequitable access to technology such as smartphones. Lack of access both undermines the degree of social benefit achieved by the use of tracing apps, and exacerbates existing social and health inequities because those who lack access are likely to already be disadvantaged. Recently, Singapore has introduced portable tracing wearables (with the same functionality as a contact tracing app) to address the equity gap and promote public health. We argue that governments have an ethical obligation to ensure fair access to the protective benefits of contract tracing during the pandemic and that wearables are an effective way of addressing some important equity issues. The most contentious issues about contact tracing apps have been the potential infringements of privacy and individual liberty, especially where the use of apps or other technology (such as wearables or QR codes) is required for access to certain spaces. Here we argue that wearables, as opposed to apps alone, will make a digital contact tracing mandate more practical and explain some conditions under which such a mandate would be justified. We focus on Singapore as a case study that has recently deployed contact tracing wearables nationally, but also reference debate about wearables in Australia and New Zealand. Our analysis will be relevant to counties trialling similar portable tracing wearables.","output":"Ethics of digital contact tracing wearables"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID 19 pandemic has greatly disrupted high performance sport and international competition. The aim of this study was to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world's top 10 performances in Athletics and Swimming among nondisabled and Paralympic athletes. METHODS: The results of the 10-best world performers in 66 Olympic events since 1891 and 255 Paralympic events since 2010 were collected. To quantify the performance trend, the slopes of the 4 years moving average were calculated and analyzed by time period. The distribution of performances (in % of the world record) by year was analyzed to compare the 2020 values to the ten previous years. The stability rate (athletes joining and leaving each year) since 2010 and the number of annual competitions events were also measured. RESULTS: Over the study period, such declines in performance have only been observed during the two World Wars. In 2020, the level of performances has decreased significantly, corresponding to a 6 to 10 years setback. In 2020, the number of new athletes in the 10-best was significantly higher with a lower number of organized competitions.

The research concerns indices of stock exchanges in Poland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Romania, Estonia, Croatia, and Slovenia. Methodology: The investigation covers the period from 30 SEP 2019 to 31 DEC 2020 divided into three sub-periods - pre-pandemic, pandemic shock, and pandemic stabilization. A trend analysis of the indices studied and a volatility analysis of the returns of the indices were conducted. Econometric trend models and GARCH-class models were applied. Findings: As a main finding it can be concluded that the capital markets of the post-communist economies responded to the pandemic in an analogous way, as well as that the scale and level of development of stock markets does not affect their response to the pandemic and stock market prosperity during the pandemic period. Practical Implications: The work focuses on the analysis of major stock market indices in countries with very different levels of capital market development. The course of the pandemic varies from country to country in terms of freezing the economy. As a consequence, it allows answering the fundamental question from the economic point of view: To what extent does a crisis of a non-economic nature affect the stock exchange situation in countries at the stage of capital market development? Originality/Value: The analysis of the level of capital markets development in post-communist countries has been the subject of many works, including by authors. However, the emergence of a pandemic creates a unique (hopefully) opportunity for research under extreme conditions such as the pandemic.

As of now, there is still no explicit therapeutic regimen and the use of corticosteroid is also controversial. We aimed to explore the effectiveness of corticosteroid and provide evidence for the rational use of corticosteroid in different patients with COVID-19.Methods In this multi-centered, retrospective study, we extracted the clinical data of 649 cases with COVID-19 with definite outcome (discharged or dead) from 14 hospitals in Hubei province, and evaluated the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and their association with outcomes.Results Ninety-five of 649 patients had died. Older male patients with comorbidities had an increased risk of death and more obvious abnormalities in clinical indicators. Corticosteroid, -globulin treatment and invasive ventilation were more frequently used in non-survivors. Survivors with corticosteroid treatment had a prolonged hospitalization. The median time duration for temperature restore for non-survivors after corticosteroid treatment was longer than that of both survivors. The lymphocyte count on admission was lower in the patients treated with corticosteroids compared to those without corticosteroid treatment. Lymphocyte count recovered significantly after corticosteroid treatment in survivors, but not in non-survivors.Conclusions The responses to corticosteroid treatment were different in COVID-19 patients with different outcomes. The surviving patients with relatively lower lymphocyte count were more likely to be given corticosteroids. For non-survivors, the lymphocyte count was too low and the effect of corticosteroids was poor.

The scenario is deteriorating due to lack of proper & specific target-oriented pharmacologically safe prophylactic agents or drugs, and or any effective vaccine. drug development is urgently required to back in the normalcy in the community and to combat this pandemic. PURPOSE: Thus, we have proposed two novel drug targets, Furin and TMPRSS2, as Covid-19 treatment strategy. We have highlighted this target-oriented novel drug delivery strategy, based on their pathophysiological implication on SARS-CoV-2 infection, as evident from earlier SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and influenza virus infection via host cell entry, priming, fusion, and endocytosis. STUDY DESIGN & METHODS: An earlier study suggested that Furin and TMPRSS2 knockout mice had reduced level of viral load and a lower degree of organ damage such as the lung. The present study thus highlights the promise of some selected novel and potential anti-viral Phytopharmaceutical that bind to Furin and TMPRSS2 as target. RESULT: Few of them had shown promising anti-viral response in both preclinical and clinical study with acceptable therapeutic safety-index. CONCLUSION: Hence, this strategy may limit life-threatening Covid-19 infection and its mortality rate through nano-suspension based intra-nasal or oral nebulizer spray, to treat mild to moderate SARS-COV-2 infection when Furin and TMPRSS2 receptor may initiate to express and activate for processing the virus to cause cellular infection by replication within the host cell and blocking of host-viral interaction.","output":"Phytopharmaceuticals mediated Furin and TMPRSS2 receptor blocking: can it be a potential therapeutic option for Covid-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Translational models have played an important role in the rapid development of safe and effective vaccines and therapeutic agents for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Specific perceptions of NIV stakeholders and their impact have been poorly described to date. The objectives of this study were to compare the perceptions of NIV by intensive care unit (ICU) physicians, nurses, patients, and their relatives and to explore factors associated with caregivers' willingness to administer NIV and patients' and relatives' anxiety in relation to NIV. METHODS This is a prospective, multicenter questionnaire-based study. RESULTS Three hundred and eleven ICU physicians, 752 nurses, 396 patients, and 145 relatives from 32 ICUs answered the questionnaire. Nurses generally reported more negative feelings and more frequent regrets about providing NIV (median score, 3; interquartile range, [1 to 5] vs. 1 [1 to 5]; P < 0.0001) compared to ICU physicians. Sixty-four percent of ICU physicians and only 32% of nurses reported a high level of willingness to administer NIV, which was independently associated with NIV case-volume and workload. A high NIV session-related level of anxiety was observed in 37% of patients and 45% of relatives. \\"Dyspnea during NIV,\\" \\"long NIV session,\\" and \\"the need to have someone at the bedside\\" were identified as independent risk factors of high anxiety in patients.

It achieves its compact size by operating at a nominal mobility resolution R=3 (sheath flow = 0.9 L min-1;aerosol flow = 0.3 L min-1) in place of the higher ratio of sheath flow to aerosol flow commonly used. The question addressed here is whether the lower resolution is sufficient to capture key characteristics of ambient aerosol size distributions.

The diagnostic delays, patient delays, and health-system delays were calculated and modelled using a Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS: In 266 MERS-CoV patients reported during the study period, the median diagnostic delays, patient delays, and health-system delays were 5 days (interquartile [IQR] range: 3C8 days), 4 days (IQR range: 2C7 days), and 2 days (IQR range: 1C2 days), respectively. Both patient delay (r = 0.894, P = 0.001) and health-system delay (r = 0.163, P = 0.025) were positively correlated with diagnostic delay.

Patients with impairments of personality functioning experience difficulties in self-regulation and interpersonal relations. Although personality functioning has become increasingly important in psychotherapeutic and psychiatric diagnoses and treatment planning, there is little systematic evidence on the role of personality functioning in patients with chronic and somatic diseases. This article reviews empirical studies using standardized assessments of personality functioning in patients with chronic and somatic diseases and discusses the role of personality structure in psychosomatic medicine. RESULTS Currently, there are only a limited number of studies using standardized assessments of personality functioning in patients with chronic or somatic diseases. The available evidence points to correlations of personality functioning with pain perception and the development of chronic pain. In addition, patients with lower levels of personality functioning may have difficulties in managing chronic conditions that require enduring changes in health behavior, such as in diabetes or posttransplantation therapy. CONCLUSION The review suggests a systematic link between personality functioning and health behavior in patients with chronic diseases that relate to self-regulation and coping strategies. These findings underline the importance of assessing personality functioning for diagnostics and treatment planning in psychosomatic medicine. Finally, an assessment of personality functioning could be helpful in choosing specific psychotherapeutic treatment strategies; however, more empirical studies are needed to comprehensively prove these assumptions.","output":"Assessment of personality functioning in psychosomatic medicine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The unprecedented time of COVID-19 made oncology nurse navigators (ONNs) ever more valuable to our patients Patients and family members were furloughed from jobs, unable to be with family members during oncologist appointments and hospitalizations, and worried about getting COVID-19 and possibly transmitting it to their loved one with lung cancer Prior to COVID-19, there were no monetary resources available for patients diagnosed with lung cancer in this navigator's geographic area The pandemic, however, made additional sources of funding, both local and nationally, available to lung cancer patients affected financially due to job loss, reduced hours, and housing situations Objective: Navigators play a deep role in ensuring patients are connected to financial resources during times of a pandemic like COVID-19 Methods: Thoracic ONN stayed abreast of resources available to lung cancer patients through networking opportunities This ONN participated in weekly Academy of Oncology Nurse & Patient Navigators (AONN+) Facebook Live sessions, AONN+ Facebook communications, and daily Sarah Cannon Navigation communications The ONN phoned local resources such as the American Cancer Society, SC Thrive, and the local department of aging National resources such as Cancer Support Community and CancerCare were phoned, and additional resource lists were provided by these organiza tions to assist cancer patients affected monetarily by COVID-19 The ONN reviewed eligibility criteria for grants, went over them with the patient/family member, and provided them with a phone number to call or phoned in the presence of the patient The ONN assisted 3 patients in gathering the necessary paperwork required for each grant and faxed it to the fund administrators Results: Since March 31, 2020, the thoracic ONN referred 7 patients to the LUNGevity Breathe Easier fund Three individuals chose not to apply, stating they wanted the money for others who needed it more Three received financial assistance via CancerCare, who administered the LUNGevity fund money Three patients were referred to the Team Rubicon COVID-19 emergency fund and received $500 checks to assist with food procurement during the pandemic One patient was referred to SC Thrive for rental assistance because she was 3 months behind on rent payments;this application is still pending One patient obtained discount temporary housing through a local partnership with a hotel chain due to her inability to live in her current home because of fear of possibly transmitting COVID- 19 to her sister and family Seven patients were referred to Cancer Support Community;3 patients chose not to apply, 1 received a $250 debit card, and 3 are still waiting for information on acceptance Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic provided the thoracic ONN with local and national resources to refer her patients to what normally would not be available Three patients financially affected by the pandemic each received money and assistance totaling $1000 This ONN successfully advocated and assisted patients experiencing financial difficulties during the pandemic to obtain money","output":"Navigating Lung Cancer Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Finding Financial Resources...Academy of Oncology Nurse And Patient Navigators (AONN) 11th Annual Navigation & Survivorship Conference (Virtual), November 4-8, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Utilising biomarkers for COVID-19 diagnosis, prediction of treatment response and overall prognostication have been investigated recently.

METHODS: 362 adult CHB patients and 87 healthy controls at an interval of at least 21 days after full-course vaccination (21-105 days) were enrolled. Adverse events (AEs) were collected by questionnaire. The antibody profiles at 1, 2 and 3 months were elucidated by determination of anti-spike IgG, anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, and RBD-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 blocking antibody. SARS-CoV-2 specific B cells were also analyzed. RESULTS: All AEs were mild and self-limiting, and the incidence was similar between CHB patients and controls. Seropositivity rates of three antibodies were similar between CHB patients and healthy controls at 1, 2 and 3 months, but CHB patients had lower titers of three antibodies at 1 month. Compared to healthy controls, HBeAg-positive CHB patients had higher titers of three antibodies at 3 month (all p<0.05) and a slower decline in antibody titers.

HCPs had to face multiple challenging situations that varied across the care period as well as complex emotions such as anxiety, guilt, uncertainty, fear, anger, or suffering, which required tailored answers. COVID-19 pandemic increased FCs aggressive behaviors, their distrust, and uncertainty due to visitation restrictions. HCPs had to overcome this by developing a set of strategies, including adoption of an active-listening approach, supportive communication, and explicit acknowledgement of FCs emotions.

This infectious disease has become a major public health challenge in the world. Unfortunately, to date, no specific antivirals have been proven to be effective against COVID-19, and although a few vaccines are available, the mortality rate is not decreasing but is still increasing. One therapeutic strategy has been focused on infection prevention and control measures. In this regard, the use of nutraceutical supports may play a role against some aspect of the infection, particularly the inflammatory state and the immune system function of patients, thus representing a strategy to control the worst outcomes of this pandemic. For this reason, we performed an overview including meta-analyses and systematic reviews to assess the association among melatonin, vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc supplementation and inflammatory markers using three databases, namely, MEDLINE, PubMed Central and the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews. According to the evidence available, an intake of 50,000 IU/month of vitamin D showed efficacy in CRP. An amount of 1 to 2 g per day of vitamin C demonstrated efficacy both in CRP and endothelial function, and a dosage of melatonin ranging from 5 to 25 mg /day showed good evidence of efficacy in CRP, TNF and IL6. A dose of 50 mg/day of elemental zinc supplementation showed positive results in CRP. Based on the data reported in this review, the public health system could consider whether it is possible to supplement the current limited preventive measures through targeted nutraceutical large-scale administration.","output":"Does Evidence Exist to Blunt Inflammatory Response by Nutraceutical Supplementation during COVID-19 Pandemic?

In a representative sample of U.S. adults (N = 5,010), this research tested whether COVID-19 financial hardship was associated with higher levels of depression and suicidal ideation (supported), and whether the reasoned action framework could usefully predict help-seeking intentions in this context (supported).

Here, we demonstrate that intravenous, but not subcutaneous, inoculation of BCG protects human-ACE2 transgenic mice against lethal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2) and results in reduced viral loads in non-transgenic animals infected with an  variant. The observed increase in host resistance was associated with reductions in SCV2-induced tissue pathology, inflammatory cell recruitment, and cytokine production that multivariate analysis revealed as only partially related to diminished viral load. We propose that this protection stems from BCG-induced alterations in the composition and function of the pulmonary cellular compartment that impact the innate response to the virus and ensuing immunopathology.

This protocol aims to update the first systematic review conducted by Priest et al (2013), including a meta-analysis of findings. Based on previous empirical data, it is anticipated that child and youth health will be negatively impacted by racism. Findings from this review will provide updated evidence of effect sizes across outcomes and identify moderators and mediators of relationships between racism and health. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This systematic review and meta-analysis will include studies that examine associations between experiences of racism and racial discrimination with health outcomes of children and youth aged 0-24 years. Exposure measures include self-reported or proxy reported systemic, interpersonal and intrapersonal racism. Outcome measures include general health and well-being, physical health, mental health, biological markers, healthcare utilisation and health behaviours. A comprehensive search of studies from the earliest time available to October 2020 will be conducted. A random effects meta-analysis will examine the average effect of racism on a range of health outcomes. Study-level moderation will test the difference in effect sizes with regard to various sample and exposure characteristics. This review has been registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews.

This is a lossy but computationally convenient representation of the information in the string, with many applications in high-throughput bioinformatics. In this work, we define the notion of the Spectral Burrows-Wheeler Transform (SBWT), which is a sequence of subsets of the alphabet of the string encoding the k-spectrum of the string. The SBWT is a distillation of the ideas found in the BOSS and Wheeler graph data structures. We explore multiple different approaches to index the SBWT for membership queries on the underlying k-spectrum. We identify subset rank queries as the essential subproblem, and propose four succinct index structures to solve it. One of the approaches essentially leads to the known BOSS data structure, while the other three offer attractive time-space trade-offs and support simpler query algorithms that rely only on fast rank queries. The most general approach involves a novel data structure we dub the subset wavelet tree, which we find to be of independent interest. All of the approaches are also amendable to entropy compression, which leads to good space bounds on the sizes of the data structures. Using entropy compression, we show that the SBWT can support membership queries on the k-spectrum of a single string in O(k) time and (n + k)(log  + 1/ln 2) + o((n + k)) bits of space, where n is the number of distinct substrings of length k in the input and  is the size of the alphabet. This improves from the time O(k log ) achieved by the BOSS data structure, while maintaining the same asymptotic space complexity of O(n log ), albeit with smaller constant factors. We show, via experiments on a range of genomic data sets, that the simplicity of our new indexes translates into large performance gains in practice over prior art.","output":"Succinct k-mer Set Representations Using Subset Rank Queries on the Spectral Burrows-Wheeler Transform (SBWT)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By emphasising the internal-external security nexus inherent in democratic security, the US could aspire again to lead through the example of its democracys resilience and ability to self-correct.","output":"Bidens Security Policy: Democratic Security or Democratic Exceptionalism?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-2019 is a new global health challenge which causes severe respiratory complications.

RNA/DNA of influenza A, B, parainfluenza (PI); adeno-, rhino-, RS-viruses, corona-, metapneumo- (MPV) and bocaviruses were detected in nasopharynx smears by PCR with hybridization-fluorescent detection in real time. Antibodies against influenza viruses A/H1N1/pdm09 California/07/09, epidemic reference strains of influenza viruses A/H1N1/Brisbane/59/07, A/ H3N2/Victoria/361/201 1, B/Wisconsin/1/10, against PI viruses type 1, 2, 3 were determined in paired sera by HAI. RESULTS In February-March 2013 the number of children protected by antibodies against influenza decreased, and circulation of influenza viruses A/H3N2 and A/H1N1/ pdm09 was detected. Rhinoviruses and PI viruses were determined throughout the epidemic season, bocavirus and adenoviruses--during the autumn-winter period, RS-virus and MPV--during winter-spring. Coronaviruses were not detected. The peak of virus detection was established in February when the threshold of influenza and ARI morbidity was exceeded. The main pathogens of children of the first 3 years of life are rhinoviruses, RS-virus, PI viruses and bocavirus. RS-virus infection at the debut of CAP in children younger than 3 years in 55.5% of cases is associated with the development of broncho-obstructive syndrome. Bocavirus infection in 50% of cases progresses with laryngo-tracheitis and bronchiolitis.

Several studies have reported that various mobility metrics, as well as home stay, that is, the amount of time an individual spends at home in a day, are associated with symptom severity in people with major depressive disorder (MDD). Owing to the use of small and homogeneous cohorts of participants, it is uncertain whether the findings reported in those studies generalize to a broader population of individuals with MDD symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between the overall severity of depressive symptoms, as assessed by the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and median daily home stay over the 2 weeks preceding the completion of a questionnaire in individuals with MDD. METHODS: We used questionnaire and geolocation data of 164 participants with MDD collected in the observational Remote Assessment of Disease and RelapseCMajor Depressive Disorder study. The participants were recruited from three study sites: Kings College London in the United Kingdom (109/164, 66.5%); Vrije Universiteit Medisch Centrum in Amsterdam, the Netherlands (17/164, 10.4%); and Centro de Investigacin Biomdica en Red in Barcelona, Spain (38/164, 23.2%). We used a linear regression model and a resampling technique (n=100 draws) to investigate the relationship between home stay and the overall severity of MDD symptoms. Participant age at enrollment, gender, occupational status, and geolocation data quality metrics were included in the model as additional explanatory variables. The 95% 2-sided CIs were used to evaluate the significance of model variables. RESULTS: Participant age and severity of MDD symptoms were found to be significantly related to home stay, with older (95% CI 0.161-0.325) and more severely affected individuals (95% CI 0.015-0.184) spending more time at home. The association between home stay and symptoms severity appeared to be stronger on weekdays (95% CI 0.023-0.178, median 0.098; home stay: 25th-75th percentiles 17.8-22.8, median 20.9 hours a day) than on weekends (95% CI ?0.079 to 0.149, median 0.052; home stay: 25th-75th percentiles 19.7-23.5, median 22.3 hours a day). Furthermore, we found a significant modulation of home stay by occupational status, with employment reducing home stay (employed participants: 25th-75th percentiles 16.1-22.1, median 19.7 hours a day; unemployed participants: 25th-75th percentiles 20.4-23.5, median 22.6 hours a day). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that home stay is associated with symptom severity in MDD and demonstrate the importance of accounting for confounding factors in future studies. In addition, they illustrate that passive sensing of individuals with depression is feasible and could provide clinically relevant information to monitor the course of illness in patients with MDD.","output":"The Association Between Home Stay and Symptom Severity in Major Depressive Disorder: Preliminary Findings From a Multicenter Observational Study Using Geolocation Data From Smartphones"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has rapidly spread all over the world, progressing into a pandemic.

Participants underwent a 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks gestation. Logistic regressions were performed. RESULTS Using the 1999 WHO criteria, the prevalence of GDM was higher in GUSTO (20.8%) compared to SBC (16.6%) (p = 0.046). Family history of hypertension and alcohol consumption were associated with higher odds of GDM in SBC than in GUSTO cohort while obesity was associated with higher odds of GDM in GUSTO. Using the IADPSG criteria, the prevalence of GDM was 14.3% in SBC versus 12.0% in GUSTO. A history of GDM was associated with higher odds of GDM in GUSTO than in SBC, while being overweight, alcohol consumption and family history of diabetes were associated with higher odds of GDM in SBC. CONCLUSIONS We observed several differential risk factors of GDM among ethnic Chinese women living in Shanghai and Singapore. These findings might be due to heterogeneity of GDM reflected in diagnostic criteria as well as in unmeasured genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors.","output":"Comparative epidemiology of gestational diabetes in ethnic Chinese from Shanghai birth cohort and growing up in Singapore towards healthy outcomes cohort."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background We aim to explore the effectiveness of one-dose BNT162b2 vaccination upon SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in children and young people (CYP) during Delta and Omicron variant predominance in the UK, and study its effect on COVID-19 presentation and post-vaccination symptoms. Methods In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we analysed data from 115,775 CYP aged 12-17 years, proxy-reported through the Covid Symptom Study (CSS) smartphone application. We calculated post-vaccination infection risk after one dose of BNT162b2. We described the illness profile of CYP with post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to unvaccinated CYP. Findings Between August 5, 2021 and February 14, 2022, 25,971 UK CYP aged 12-17 years received one dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. Vaccination reduced infection (reporting) risk (-80.4% and -53.7% at 14-30 days with Delta and Omicron variants respectively, and -61.5% and -63.7% after 61-90 days). The probability of remaining infection-free diverged after vaccination, and was more robust with prior infection. Vaccinated CYP who contracted SARS-CoV-2 during the Delta period had milder disease than unvaccinated CYP; however, during the Omicron period this was only evident in children aged 12-15 years, and overall disease profile was similar in both vaccinated and unvaccinated CYP. Post-vaccination local side-effects were common, systemic side-effects were uncommon, and both resolved quickly. Interpretation One dose of BNT162b2 vaccine reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least 90 days in CYP aged 12-17 years. Vaccine protection was modulated by SARS-CoV-2 variant type (lower for Omicron than Delta variant), and was enhanced by pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severity of COVID-19 presentation after vaccination is generally milder, although unvaccinated CYP also have an uncomplicated course. Overall, vaccination was well-tolerated.","output":"Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in UK school-aged children and young people decreases infection rates and reduces COVID-19 symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the global spread of Covid-19 began to overwhelm the attempts of governments to conduct manual contact-tracing, there has been much interest in using the power of mobile phones to automate the contact-tracing process through the development of exposure notification applications. The rough idea is simple: use Bluetooth or other data-exchange technologies to record contacts between users, enable users to report positive diagnoses, and alert users who have been exposed to sick users. Of course, there are many privacy concerns associated with this idea. Much of the work in this area has been concerned with designing mechanisms for tracing contacts and alerting users that do not leak additional information about users beyond the existence of exposure events. However, although designing practical protocols is of crucial importance, it is essential to realize that notifying users about exposure events may itself leak confidential information (e.g. that a particular contact has been diagnosed). Luckily, while digital contact tracing is a relatively new task, the generic problem of privacy and data disclosure has been studied for decades. Indeed, the framework of differential privacy further permits provable query privacy by adding random noise. In this article, we translate two results from statistical privacy and social recommendation algorithms to exposure notification. We thus prove some naive bounds on the degree to which accuracy must be sacrificed if exposure notification frameworks are to be made more private through the injection of noise.","output":"Privacy-accuracy trade-offs in noisy digital exposure notifications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has triggered an unprecedented global crisis, the increasing recessions in many countries and related trade uncertainties are affecting the whole wine sector, from production to distribution, sales, and consumption. While the full recovery is still uncertain, and even worse scenarios are possible if it takes longer to bring back trust and financial stability on wine markets, the crisis risks to jeopardies recent developments and sustainability in wine territories. Developing from a mixed-method participatory research process that integrates recent economic prospective with diverse experience data, we offer a critical reflection made by researchers and stakeholders supporting several socio-economic narratives and policy implications in the light of the current crisis. Distinguishing between short and long-term implications, we offer a reflection on the policy needs to alleviate the ongoing suffering of the sector. The speed and scope of the pandemic crisis underscore the need for the wine sector to become more resilient by increasing the ability to cooperate and coordinate among supply chain actors and between policy levels. The latter offers a reflection on the balance between short-term interventions and the complementarity of post-2020 CAP measures to stabilize market and future incomes.

Study participants were selected using a convenient sampling method from various higher educational institutions across 22 states in India. Data was collected using self-administered close-ended questionnaires via Google forms. The data were analysed using frequencies and percentage for descriptive purposes. A chi-square test was used to determine the association between groups, and correlation analysis was used to illustrate the significant relationship between KAP. Results: The majority, that is, 65.5% of students possess a high level of knowledge about the disease. It was noteworthy that 71.0% of them had a positive attitude towards COVID-19 and 66.7% of them exhibited desirable practices to mitigate COVID-19. Furthermore, the results showed a significant association between KAP and some of the socio-demographic variables studied. Social media emerged as a vital source of information regarding COVID-19 for the majority (81.0%) of students. Also, a strong significant positive correlation was observed between KAP variables.

HIV-self-test (HIVST) coupled with counselling and AIDS-care, including antiretroviral therapy, has the potential to achieve this. However, national programs are at varying stages of acceptance of HIVST, as discussions around its introduction spark controversy and debates. HIV-self-test, as yet, is not part of the AIDS control program in India. Against this backdrop, we explored acceptability of an HIV oral self-test (HIVOST) among truckers and young men and women. METHODS: A qualitative investigation with 41 in-depth-interviews and 15 group discussions were conducted in the district of Pune, in the western state of Maharashtra, India. These interactions were built around a prototype HIVOST kit, helped in taking the discussions forward. The software N-vivo (version 11.0) was used to manage the volumes of data generated through the aforementioned process. The study was conducted during June through December, 2019. RESULTS: While the truckers belonged to the age bracket 21C67 year, the youths were in the age group 18C24 year. Ease of doing HIVOST and fear of needle pricks were the reasons behind acceptance around HIVOST by both the study groups. Truckers felt that HIVOST would encourage one to know ones HIV status and seek help as appropriate. Accuracy of HIVOST result and disposal of the kits following use were concerns of a few. Most of the participants preferred saliva over blood as the specimen of choice. Instructions in local language reportedly would enable test-use by self. The truck drivers preferred undertaking HIVOST at the truckers-friendly Khushi clinics or in the vehicle, while youths preferred the privacy of home. Some of the young men mis-perceived the utility of HIVOST by referring to doing a test on a partner immediately prior to sexual encounter. On the other hand, a few truckers had wrong information on HIV cure. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the study communities expressed their acceptance towards HIV-self-test. The National AIDS Control Program, India would benefit by drawing upon the findings of the current investigation.

Although the lockdown is effective in such prevention, it may put the economy into a depression. Predicting the epidemic progression with government switching the lockdown on or off is critical. We propose a transfer learning approach called ALeRT-COVID using attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to predict the epidemic trends for different countries. A source model was trained on the pre-defined source countries and then transferred to each target country. The lockdown measure was introduced to our model as a predictor and the attention mechanism was utilized to learn the different contributions of the confirmed cases in the past days to the future trend. Results demonstrated that the transfer learning strategy is helpful especially for early-stage countries. By introducing the lockdown predictor and the attention mechanism, ALeRT-COVID showed a significant improvement on the prediction performance. We predicted the confirmed cases in one week when extending and easing lockdown separately. Results showed the lockdown measures is still necessary for a number of countries.

The availability of pre-infection imaging data reduces the likelihood of pre-existing risk factors being misinterpreted as disease effects. We identified significant longitudinal effects when comparing the two groups, including (1) a greater reduction in grey matter thickness and tissue contrast in the orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus; (2) greater changes in markers of tissue damage in regions that are functionally connected to the primary olfactory cortex; and (3) a greater reduction in global brain size in the SARS-CoV-2 cases.

Traditionally, its use was reserved for patients deemed unfit for surgery. However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a detrimental effect on both elective and emergency surgery. The utilisation of cholecystostomy thus increased. Unanswered questions remain over timing with respect to interval cholecystectomy. We evaluated our local practice over the preceding three years. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed of all patients who had a percutaneous cholecystostomy inserted over a three-year period (1 January 2018-1 January 2021). The primary outcome was time to cholecystectomy. Secondary outcomes were cholecystostomy-related complications, 30-day mortality, cholecystectomy-related complications and length of postoperative hospital stay. Results A total of 31 patients were identified during the period. Thirteen (42%) patients went on to have a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The median time interval from cholecystostomy to cholecystectomy was 97 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 81-140, minimum: 47 and maximum: 791). One case was complicated by small bowel perforation; this occurred after an interval of 106 days. The median length of postoperative stay was one day (IQR: 1-1, minimum: 0 and maximum: 4). Cholecystostomy-related complications were observed in four (13%) patients, whereby three became displaced and one developed blockage. Thirty-day mortality following cholecystostomy insertion was zero. Conclusions Percutaneous cholecystostomy is a safe and effective intervention for the management of acute cholecystitis.

Many institutions implemented a government-mandated restructured set of safety and administrative protocols to treat urgent orthopaedic trauma patients. The objective of this study was to compare two cohorts of patients, a COVID group and non-COVID control group, and to evaluate the effectiveness of safety measures outlined in the Rutgers Orthopaedic Trauma Patient Safety Protocol (ROTPSP). Secondary outcomes were to elucidate risk factors for complications associated with fractures and COVID-19. METHODS: Patients treated for orthopaedic traumatic injuries were retrospectively identified between March and May 2020, and compared to a series of patients from the same time period in 2018. Main outcome measures included surgical site infections (SSI), length of stay (LOS), post-operative LOS (poLOS), presentation to OR time (PORT), and length of surgery. RESULTS: After review, 349 patients (201 non-COVID, 148 COVID) undergoing 426 surgeries were included. Average LOS (11.91 days vs. 9.27 days, p = 0.04), poLOS (9.68 days vs. 7.39 days, p = 0.03), and PORT (30.56 vs. 25.59 h, p < 0.01) was significantly shorter in the COVID cohort. There were less SSI in the COVID group (5) compared to the non-COVID group (14) (p = 0.03). Overall complications were significantly lower in the COVID group. Patients receiving Cepheid tests had significantly shorter LOS and poLOS compared to patients receiving the RNA and DiaSorin tests (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01, respectively). The Cepheid test carried the best benefit-to-cost ratio, 0.10, p < 0.05. CONCLUSION: The restructuring of care protocols caused by COVID-19 did not negatively impact perioperative complication rates, PORT or LOS.

The patients, all followed at our center, were classified as symptomatic, paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic on the basis of their self-reported clinical characteristics. COVID-19 severity was rated on a 7-point ordinal scale. In addition, in the period 4th May to 3rd June 2020 SARS-CoV-2 serology testing, using the Roche SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Elecsysa??), was performed in 104/140 (74.2%) of the interviewed PwMS (50 treated with NTZ and 54 with FTY). RESULTS: 14/104 (13.4%) PwMS on NTZ or FTY had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: 8 met the criteria for asymptomatic, 3 for paucisymptomatic and 3 for symptomatic COVID-19 (COVID-19 severity score lower than 3). None of them required hospitalization or showed severe COVID-19 complications. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relatively high SARS CoV-2 seroprevalence found in this sample of PwMS, all the positive cases showed either no or only mild COVID-19 symptoms. These reassuring findings indicate a lack of COVID-19 complications in PwMS on DMTs and support the hypothesis that it is safe to maintain ongoing treatment with these drugs in the current setting.","output":"Safety of disease-modifying treatments in SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive multiple sclerosis patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid urbanization, global trade, and the exceptionally great numbers of worldwide visitors during Hajj and Umrah have all placed the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at a significant risk of introducing several vector-borne tropical diseases, such as dengue fever virus (DENV) infection. In this study we estimated DENV infection cost of illness (COI) in Saudi Arabia in the period 2013C2017, by processing national data including all declared cases recorded in referral centers in the western region, being the endemic region of the country. Using a statistically validated predictive model that was built on a representative sample of 717 laboratory-confirmed cases of DENV infection, direct costs, due to care-related expenditures, were estimated by applying the predictive equation to national data. However, indirect costs, which are due to productivity loss, were estimated using the human capital model based on gross domestic product adjusted for invalidity duration. Further, under-reporting was adjusted by using an expansion factor EF = 3. We observed highest estimated costs in 2016 with over US$168.5 Million total costs, including direct (US$29.0 Million) and indirect (US$139.5 Million) costs, for a total 4415 confirmed cases. The total DENV COI for the five years was estimated as US$551.0 Million for a total 15,369 patients (59.7%) out of 25,745 declared cases, resulting in an average cost of US$11 947.6 by patient. Depending on the year, productivity years loss costs accounted for 63.3% to 83.8% of the estimated total costs. Dengue has a substantial local economic burden that costs US$110.2 Million per year, stressing the urgent need for an effective national prevention strategy to perform considerable cost-savings besides reducing morbidity.","output":"The economic burden of dengue fever in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have previously identified methylene blue, a tricyclic phenothiazine dye approved for clinical use for the treatment of methemoglobinemia and used for other medical applications, as a small-molecule inhibitor of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and ACE2, the first critical step of the attachment and entry of this coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we show that methylene blue concentration-dependently inhibits this PPI for the spike protein of the original strain as well as for those of variants of concerns such as the D614G mutant and delta (B.1.617.2) with IC50 in the low micromolar range (1-5 M). Methylene blue also showed promiscuous activity and inhibited several other PPIs of viral proteins (e.g., HCoV-NL63 C ACE2, hepatitis C virus E C CD81) as well as others (e.g., IL-2 C IL-2R) with similar potency. This non-specificity notwithstanding, methylene blue inhibited the entry of pseudoviruses bearing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2-expressing host cells both for the original strain and the delta variant. It also blocked SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.5) virus replication in Vero E6 cells with an IC50 in the low micromolar range (1.7 M) when assayed using quantitative PCR of the viral RNA. Thus, while it seems to be a promiscuous PPI inhibitor with low micromolar activity and it has a relatively narrow therapeutic index, methylene blue inhibits entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2, including several of its mutant variants, and has potential as a possible inexpensive, broad-spectrum, orally bioactive small-molecule antiviral for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Methylene Blue Is a Nonspecific Protein-Protein Interaction Inhibitor with Potential for Repurposing as an Antiviral for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy has become an accepted procedure for the treatment of selected cases of lung cancer. The aim of this project was to establish national practical recommendations for the management of patients suitable for VATS lobectomy. METHODS The Scientific Committee of the VATS Lobectomy Group (a branch of the Italian Society of Thoracic Surgery) identified the consensus conference as an appropriate tool for a national debate. The consensus conference was organized following indications of the Italian Department of Health: a panel of experts reviewed the literature, the jury board revised the experts' reports, and the national conference discussed and voted on statements. The strength of recommendation for a statement was classified as weak, fair, or high when the total score ranged between 51% and 67%, 68% and 84%, or 85% and 100%, respectively. RESULTS Eighty-six Italian thoracic surgeons attended the 1st Italian Consensus Conference on VATS lobectomy in Giulianova, Italy, on October 29-30, 2015. Thirty-three topics were discussed: indications, surgical strategy, perioperative management, and training were the main topics. Consensus was reached on 24 statements that were consequently recommended.

To determine the cumulative incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated risk factors, we conducted a prospective clinical and serological survey in a cohort of 278 liver transplant recipients (LTRs) from Central Italy. Three different serology tests were performed every 4 months in 259 LTRs between April 2020 and April 2021: one based on raw extract of whole SARS-CoV-2 virus and two on specific viral antigens (nucleoprotein and receptor binding domain) to detect specific IgG, IgM and IgA. Hundred fifteen LTRs who reported symptoms or close contact with a SARS-CoV-2-positive subject, or had a positive serological result underwent molecular testing by standard screening procedures (RT-PCR on naso-pharyngeal swab). Thirty-one past or active SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified: 14 had positive molecular test (64% symptomatic), and 17 had positive serology only (18% symptomatic). SARS-CoV-2 infection was not statistically related to gender, age, obesity, diabetes, renal impairment, type of anti-rejection therapy or time from transplant. Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases (61.3%) were more frequent in males and in those with glomerular filtrate rate >50 ml/min. Overall, the addition of repeated serology to standard diagnostic molecular protocols increased detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection from 5.1% to 10.9%. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among our LTRs (11.2%) is comparable to the general population of Central Italy, considered a medium-impact area.

METHODS: A total of 30 231 workers were PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Information was collected on COVID-19-related symptoms, risk factors, preventive equipment, and risk perception. The crude prevalence was calculated for infection, use of protective devices, perceived risk and main concerns. Additionally, adjusted prevalence and prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated for these variables using logistic regression models with age, gender, occupation, epidemiological week and laboratory as confounding factors. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of infection was 3.2% (95% CI 3.0% to 3.4%), being higher among policemen (4.4%) and bus drivers (4.2%), but lower among emergency healthcare personnel, firefighters, food market workers and burial services (<2%). Lower excess risk was observed in workers reporting occupational contact with COVID-19 cases only (PR=1.42; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.71) compared with household exposure only (PR=2.75; 95% CI 2.32 to 3.25). Infection was more frequent in symptomatic workers (PR=1.28; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.48), although 42% of detected infections were asymptomatic. Use of facial masks (78.7%) and disinfectants (86.3%) was common and associated with lower infection prevalence (PR(masks)=0.68; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.79; PR(disinfectants)=0.75; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.91). Over 50% of workers felt being at high risk of infection and worried about infecting others, yet only 2% considered quitting their work.

METHODS From June to December 2015, 874 adult patients (age18 years) with suspected or documented community-acquired infection, with 3 diagnostic criteria for sepsis according to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2012, and within 24 hours of admission were evaluated. Serum was stored and later tested for dengue PCR assays. RESULTS A total of 126 patients had dengue PCR assays positive (2 DENV-1, 12 DENV-2, 24 DENV-3 and 88 DENV-4), and 5 of them (4%) died. We found that attending physicians suspected dengue infection on admission in 84 patients (67%), and recorded dengue infection as the final diagnosis in 96 patients (76%). Four of five fatal cases were diagnosed and treated as septic shock not due to dengue. In multivariable analysis, there was a trend showing that age60 years, hypoxemia and misdiagnosis of dengue by attending physicians were associated with 28-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS A number of adult patients who died of dengue are misdiagnosed as severe sepsis and septic shock. Diagnosis of dengue based on clinical features alone is difficult.

CONCLUSION: Under the low-incidence and low-trust environment such as Hong Kong, vaccination decisions are heavily influenced by family's decision and the perception of vaccination as socially and politically desirable. Our findings highlight the importance of a nuanced conception of interpersonal and political influence towards vaccine acceptance/hesitancy.","output":"Understanding the societal factors of vaccine acceptance and hesitancy: evidence from Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels is the cornerstone of all European climate and energy strategies. Consequently, renewable energy sources are becoming more competitive with fossil fuels. The largest source of bioenergy in the European Union is biomass-fired power plants. Therefore, the European coal phase-out strategy led to an increased use of wood biomass as a sustainable fuel, generating large amounts of wood biomass ash (WBA). In the research studies reported so far, WBA has been mainly used in cementitious composites. However, given the similarities between the chemical composition of WBA and hydraulic lime (HL), this research focused on its potential classification as a building lime. Overall, three different sources of fly WBA were considered for the preparation of binders as mixtures of WBA and coal fly ash (CFA) in different ratios. The contribution of each binder mixture on the paste and mortar properties was analyzed based on the chemical composition, setting time, volume stability, and contribution to the mortar strength (compressive and flexural). In general, it can be concluded that the studied binders can meet the criteria of EN 459-1.

But could they be wrong? The governments of China, South Korea, Hong Kong, Viet Nam, Czechia, Slovakia, Bosnia and Taiwan all recommend that the public wear masks to slow the spread of the coronavirus. In some countries, like Japan, masks arent officially recommended, but are still widely used by the public. Many countries treat masks as a strategic resource. China has ramped up production of facemasks, converting Foxconn factories that once made iPhones to make face masks. Taiwan has also ramped up the production of facemasks, prohibited their export, and implemented price controls and rationing. Its hard to see how both approaches could be right. Increasingly, advice against the use of face masks has been questioned (1) (2) (3), including by the head of Chinas CDC (4). Common sense, scientific studies, but perhaps most of all the success of countries using masks to fight the coronavirus suggest that masks may make a difference. There are fewer scientific studies available to guide decision making than we might like, and the evidence is not always clear-cut. However, decision-making in a crisis requires that decisions be made in the absence of perfect clarity. What is clear is that the exponential mathematics of pandemics mean that even if masks are of limited benefit in reducing infection rates, masks could make a large difference over time, potentially slowing the pace of the pandemic, limiting its spread, saving lives, and finally, letting countries to restart the economies that their people depend on for their livelihoods.","output":"Public Use of Masks to Control the Coronavirus Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on the whole world, taking over half a million lives and capsizing the world economy in unprecedented magnitudes.

From a clinical point of view, differentiation of the two disease entities is crucial for patient management. We therefore aim to detect clinical differences between Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and seasonal influenza patients at time of hospital admission. METHODS: In this single-center observational study, we included all consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 or influenza between November 2019 and May 2020. Data were extracted from a nationwide surveillance program and from electronic health records. COVID-19 and influenza patients were compared in terms of baseline characteristics, clinical presentation and outcome. We used recursive partitioning to generate a classification tree to discriminate COVID-19 from influenza patients. RESULTS: We included 96 COVID-19 and 96 influenza patients. Median age was 68 vs. 70 years (p = 0.90), 72% vs. 56% (p = 0.024) were males, and median Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was 1 vs. 2 (p = 0.027) in COVID-19 and influenza patients, respectively. Time from symptom onset to hospital admission was longer for COVID-19 (median 7 days, IQR 3-10) than for influenza patients (median 3 days, IQR 2-5, p < 0.001). Other variables favoring a diagnosis of COVID-19 in the classification tree were higher systolic blood pressure, lack of productive sputum, and lack of headache. The tree classified 86/192 patients (45%) into two subsets with &#8805;80% of patients having influenza or COVID-19, respectively. In-hospital mortality was higher for COVID-19 patients (16% vs. 5%, p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Discriminating COVID-19 from influenza patients based on clinical presentation is challenging.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 548 COVID-19 inpatients from Tongji Hospital from 26 January to 5 February 2020, and followed up to 3 March 2020. Epidemiological, demographic and clinical features, and inflammatory indexes were collected and compared between males and females. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was applied to identify the gendered effect on mortality of COVID-19 after adjusting for age, comorbidity, and smoking history. The multiple linear regression method was used to explore the influence of sex on inflammation reaction. RESULTS: Males had higher mortality than females did (22.2% vs 10.4%), with an hazard ratio of 1.923 (95% confidence interval, 1.181-3.130); elder age and comorbidity were significantly associated with decease of COVID-19 patients.

A previous report shows that furin, which is distributed mainly in the Golgi apparatus and cycled to the cell surface and endosomes, proteolytically activates the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein following receptor binding to mediate fusion between the viral and cellular membranes. In this study, we reexamined furin usage by MERS-CoV using a real-time PCR-based virus cell entry assay after inhibition of cellular proteases. We found that the furin inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK blocked entry of MERS-CoV harboring an S protein lacking furin cleavage sites; it even blocked entry into furin-deficient LoVo cells. In addition, dec-RVKR-CMK inhibited not only the enzymatic activity of furin but also those of cathepsin L, cathepsin B, trypsin, papain, and TMPRSS2. Furthermore, a virus cell entry assay and a cell-cell fusion assay provided no evidence that the S protein was activated by exogenous furin. Therefore, we conclude that furin does not play a role in entry of MERS-CoV into cells and that the inhibitory effect of dec-RVKR-CMK is specific for TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L rather than furin.IMPORTANCE Previous studies using the furin inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK suggest that MERS-CoV utilizes a cellular protease, furin, to activate viral glycoproteins during cell entry. However, we found that dec-RVKR-CMK inhibits not only furin but also other proteases. Furthermore, we found no evidence that MERS-CoV uses furin.

This study aimed to evaluate the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening approach for community-acquired bacterial pathogens (CABPs) at hospital admission, which could facilitate identification of bacterial co-infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Clinical data and biomaterials from 200 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from the observational cohort of the Competence Network for community-acquired pneumonia (CAPNETZ) prospectively recruited between March 17, 2020, and March 12, 2021 in 12 centers in Germany and Switzerland, were included in this study. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were analyzed on hospital admission using multiplex real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for a broad range of CABPs. RESULTS: In total of 200 patients Staphylococcus aureus (27.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (13.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.5%), Moraxella catarrhalis (2.5%), and Legionella pneumophila (1.5%) were the most frequently detected bacterial pathogens. PCR detection of bacterial pathogens correlated with purulent sputum, and showed no correlation with ICU admission, mortality, and inflammation markers. Although patients who received antimicrobial treatment were more often admitted to the ICU and had a higher mortality rate, PCR pathogen detection was not significantly related to antimicrobial treatment. CONCLUSION: General CABP screening using multiplex PCR with nasopharyngeal swabs may not facilitate prediction or identification of bacterial co-infections in the early phase of COVID-19-related hospitalization. Most patients with positive PCR results appear to be colonized rather than infected at that time, questioning the value of routine antibiotic treatment on admission in COVID-19 patients.

This review addresses the pathogenesis, transmission dynamics, diagnosis, management strategies, the pattern of the past and present events, and the possibility of future outbreaks of the endemic human coronaviruses. Several studies have described bats as presumptive natural reservoirs of coronaviruses. In essence, the identification of a diverse group of similar SARS coronaviruses in bats suggests the possibility of a future epidemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-like) coronaviruses originating from different reservoir hosts. The study also identified a lack of vaccines to prevent human coronavirus infections in humans in the past, however, the recent breakthrough in vaccine discovery and approval for emergency use for the treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is commendable. The high rates of genomic substitution and recombination due to errors in RNA replication and the potential for independent species crossing suggest the chances of an entirely new strain evolving. Therefore, rapid research efforts should be deployed for vaccination to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent a possible future outbreak. More sensitization and enlightenment on the need to adopt good personal hygiene practices, social distancing, and scientific evaluation of existing medications with promising antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 is required. In addition, intensive investigations to unravel and validate the possible reservoirs, the intermediate host, as well as insight into the ability of the virus to break the species barrier are needed to prevent future viral spillover and possible outbreaks.","output":"An Overview of the Pathogenesis, Transmission, Diagnosis, and Management of Endemic Human Coronaviruses: A Reflection on the Past and Present Episodes and Possible Future Outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospital-acquired infections are emerging major concurrent conditions during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

METHODS: The online survey was conducted in nine European countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo, Italy, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain) in 4108 participants, aged 15-82 years. The survey took place 30 to 40 days after WHO declared COVID-19 pandemic state, from April 15th to May 3rd, 2020. RESULTS: The results have shown 30 minutes longer sleeping time, 50% longer physical inactivity time, 65% longer screen time, 43% shorter walking time, 24% shorter sport time and 37% longer physical work time. Additionally, body mass gains (0.3 kg) could be explained in 20.6% with meals sizes, unhealthy food consumption, screen time and sport time. Further, respondents reported more regular meals (44%) and healthier meals with less alcohol consumption and less smoking, which have been positive outcomes of home confinement. CONCLUSION: The findings draw attention to negative changes in everyday praxis (inactivity, body mass gain) after such a short period.

The presence of brain and liver metastases correlates with shorter PFS and OS of these patients. ABSTRACT: (1) Background: BRAFi/MEKi are usually offered as a first line treatment for patients requiring rapid response; with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, large tumor burden, and with brain metastases. The efficacy of second line therapies after BRAFi/MEKI failure is now well defined. (2) Methods: Patients treated with first line target BRAFi/MEKi therapy (vemurafenib plus cobimetinib, dabrafenib plus trametinib or encorafenib plus binimetinib); and for the second line treatment immunotherapy with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) with at least one cycle of second line were analyzed for survival and prognostic biomarkers. (3) Results: There were no statistically significant differences in ORR between the treatment groups with nivolumab and pembrolizumab, as well as median progression free-survival (PSF) and overall survival (OS) since the initiation of second line therapy; on nivolumab OS was 6.6 months, and on pembrolizumab 5.0 months.

Only a few studies, mostly carried out in high-income countries, have investigated the association between the pandemic and suicide rate. We seek to investigate the changes in the monthly suicide rates during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal, compared to the pre-pandemic suicide rates. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This is a retrospective study investigating the changes in suicide rates in Nepal during the COVID-19 pandemic period (April 2020 to June 2021), compared to the pre-pandemic period (July 2017 to March 2020), adjusted for seasonality and long-term trend in the suicide rate. We performed analysis for the entire country as well as sub-sample analyses stratified by gender and provinces. A total of 24350 suicides deaths during four years of the study window were analyzed. We found an overall increase in the monthly suicide rate in Nepal with an average increase of 0.28 (CI: 0.12,0.45) suicide per 100,000 during the pandemic months. The increase in suicide rate was significant both among males (increase in rate = 0.26, CI: 0.02,0.50) and females (increase in rate = 0.30, CI: 0.18,0.43). The most striking increments in suicide rates were observed in June, July, and August 2020. The pattern of increased suicide rates faded away early on among males, but the effect was sustained for a longer duration among females. Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces had the highest increase in suicide rates associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Viral proteins such as the NS1 protein of Influenza virus A act upstream of the pathway while other viral proteins such as Theiler's virus L* protein act downstream.

Understanding the factors that influence vaccine acceptance is critical to informing public health campaigns to combat public fears and ensure broad uptake when a vaccine becomes available. Employing a conjoint experiment embedded on an online survey of almost 2,000 adult Americans, we show that the effects of seven vaccine attributes on subjects willingness to vaccinate vary significantly across subgroups. For example, vaccine efficacy was significantly more influential on vaccine acceptance among whites than among Blacks, while bringing a vaccine to market under a Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization had a stronger adverse effect on willingness to vaccinate among older Americans and women. Democrats were more sensitive to vaccine efficacy than Republicans, and both groups responded differently to various endorsements of the vaccine. We also explore whether past flu vaccination history, attitudes toward general vaccine safety, and personal contact with severe cases of Covid-19 can explain variation in group vaccination hesitancy. Many subgroups that exhibit the greatest Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy do not report significantly lower frequencies of flu vaccination. Several groups that exhibit greater Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy also report greater concerns about vaccine safety generally, but others do not. Finally, subgroup variation in reported personal contact with severe cases of Covid-19 does not strongly match subgroup variation in vaccine acceptance.","output":"Factors Influencing Covid-19 Vaccine Acceptance across Subgroups in the United States: Evidence from a Conjoint Experiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Maharashtra has reported the maximum number of COVID-19 cases in India.

Analysis has tended to focus on the demand for these products, while studies looking at the drivers behind their use generally focus on farmer behavior and interactions between veterinarians and farmers. However, the use of drugs also depends on structural factors that determine the functioning of the drug supply chain and farmers' access to the drugs. This article presents an overview of the factors that limit access to veterinary drugs in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as well as the international policy tools and arrangements that claim to improve it. METHODS: We have conducted a scoping review of the scientific and grey literature as well as the publicly-available data from both the animal health industry and international organizations. We aimed to gather information on the veterinary drugs market in SSA as well as on the international norms, recommendations, guidelines, and initiatives that impact SSA farmers' access to these drugs. FINDINGS: We highlight numerous barriers to veterinary drug access in SSA. The SSA market is highly dependent on imports, yet the region attracts little attention from the international companies capable of exporting to it. It suffers from a high level of fragmentation and weak distribution infrastructures and services, and is driven by the multiplication of private non-professional actors playing a growing role in the veterinary drug supply chain. The distribution system is increasingly dualized, with on the one hand the public sector (supported by development organizations) supplying small scale farmers in rural areas, but with limited and irregular means; and on the other side a private sector largely unregulated which supplies commercial and industrial farming systems. Different innovations have been developed at the international and regional levels to try to reduce barriers, such as homogenizing national legislations, donations, and vaccine banks. Alongside decades-old inter-state cooperation, many new forms of public-private partnerships and other hybrid forums continue to emerge, signaling the private sector's increasing influence in global governance. CONCLUSIONS: Policies on animal health would be bolstered by a better understanding of the drivers behind and the components of access to veterinary drugs in different regional and national contexts. Inequalities in drug access need to be addressed and a market-driven approach adopted in order to strengthen our understanding of what determines veterinary drug use at the farm level. Policies should balance the interests of the various stakeholders, being careful not to reinforce bias toward certain diseases deemed interesting and neglect others that could prove to be highly important for veterinary public health.","output":"Access to Veterinary Drugs in Sub-Saharan Africa: Roadblocks and Current Solutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveTo identify the key individual-level (demographics, attitudes, mobility) and contextual (Covid-19 case numbers, tiers of mobility restrictions, urban districts) determinants of adopting the NHS Covid-19 contact tracing app and continued use over-time. Design and settingA three-wave panel survey conducted in England in July 2020 (background survey), November 2020 (first measure of mobile app adoption), and March 2021 (continued use of app and new adopters) linked with official data. Primary outcomeRepeated measures of self-reported app usage. ParticipantsN = 2,500 adults living in England, representative of Englands population in terms of regional distribution, age, and gender (2011 census). ResultsWe observe initial app uptake at 41%, 95% CI [0.39,0.43], in November 2020 with a 12% dropout rate by March 2021, 95% CI [0.10,0.14]. We also found that 7% of nonusers as of wave 2 became new adopters by wave 3, 95% CI [0.05,0.08]. Initial uptake (or failure to use) of the app associated with social norms, privacy concerns, and misinformation about third-party data access, with those living in postal districts with restrictions on mobility less likely to use the app. Perceived lack of transparent evidence of effectiveness was associated with drop out of use. In addition, those who trusted the government were more likely to adopt in wave 3 as new adopters. ConclusionsSuccessful uptake of the contact tracing app should be evaluated within the wider context of the UK Governments response to the crisis. Trust in government is key to adoption of the app in wave 3 while continued use is linked to perceptions of transparent evidence.

In Hong Kong, a universal community testing programme (UCTP) was implemented at the fadeout phase of a community epidemic in July to September 2020. We described the utility of the UCTP in finding unrecognised infections, and analysed data from the UCTP and other sources to characterise transmission dynamics. METHODS: We described the characteristics of people participating in the UCTP and compared the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases detected by the UCTP versus those detected by clinical diagnosis and public health surveillance (CDPHS). We developed a Bayesian model to estimate the age-specific incidence of infection and the proportion of cases detected by CDPHS. RESULTS: 1.77 million people, 24% of the Hong Kong population, participated in the UCTP from 1 to 14 September 2020. The UCTP identified 32 new infections (1.8 per 100,000 samples tested), consisting of 29% of all local cases reported during the two-week UCTP period. Compared with the CDPHS, the UCTP detected a higher proportion of sporadic cases (62% versus 27%, p <0.01) and identified 6 (out of 18) additional clusters during that period. We estimated that 27% (95% credible interval: 22%, 34%) of all infections were detected by the CDPHS in the third wave. CONCLUSIONS: We reported empirical evidence of the utility of population-wide COVID-19 testing in detecting unrecognised infections and clusters.

We report that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a viroporin activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, the most promiscuous of known inflammasomes. Ectopically expressed ORF3a triggers IL-1 expression via NFB, thus priming the inflammasome. ORF3a also activates the NLRP3 inflammasome but not NLRP1 or NLRC4, resulting in maturation of IL-1 and cleavage/activation of Gasdermin. Notably, ORF3a activates the NLRP3 inflammasome via both ASC-dependent and -independent modes. This inflammasome activation requires efflux of potassium ions and oligomerization between the kinase NEK7 and NLRP3. Importantly, infection of epithelial cells with SARS-CoV-2 similarly activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. With the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 and select FDA-approved oral drugs able to block ORF3a-mediated inflammasome activation, as well as key ORF3a amino acid residues needed for virus release and inflammasome activation conserved in the new variants of SARS-CoV-2 isolates across continents, ORF3a and NLRP3 present prime targets for intervention.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 viroporin encoded by ORF3a triggers the NLRP3 inflammatory pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To examine the added value of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in a nursing home during an acute COVID-19 outbreak.

We sought to measure the association of esophageal temperature attenuation with radiofrequency (RF) electrode impedance, contact force, and distance from the esophagus. METHODS The retrospective study cohort included 35 patients with mean age 6410 years, of whom 74.3% were male, and 40% had persistent AF. All patients had undergone pre-procedural cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) followed by AF ablation with luminal esophageal temperature monitoring. Lesion locations were co-registered with CMR image segmentations of left atrial and esophageal anatomy. Luminal esophageal temperature, time matched RF lesion data, and ablation distance from the nearest esophageal location were collected as panel data. RESULTS Luminal esophageal temperature changes corresponding to 3667 distinct lesions, delivered with mean power 27.95.5 Watts over a mean duration of 22.210.5 seconds were analyzed. In multivariable analyses, clustered per patient, examining posterior wall lesions only, and adjusted for lesion power and duration as set by the operator, lesion distance from the esophagus (-0.003C/mm, P<0.001), and baseline impedance (-0.015C/, P<0.001) were associated with changes in luminal esophageal temperature. CONCLUSION Esophageal luminal temperature rises are associated with shorter lesion distance from esophagus and lower baseline impedance during RF lesion delivery.

Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning approaches may yield key methods to rapidly identify individuals at a high risk of COVID-19 and to understand key symptoms upon clinical manifestation and presentation. Data on such symptoms may not be accurately synthesized into patient records owing to the pressing need to treat patients in overburdened health care settings. In this scenario, clinicians may focus on documenting widely reported symptoms that indicate a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, albeit at the expense of infrequently reported symptoms. While NLP solutions can play a key role in generating clinical phenotypes of COVID-19, they are limited by the resulting limitations in data from electronic health records (EHRs). A comprehensive record of clinic visits is required-audio recordings may be the answer. A recording of clinic visits represents a more comprehensive record of patient-reported symptoms. If done at scale, a combination of data from the EHR and recordings of clinic visits can be used to power NLP and machine learning models, thus rapidly generating a clinical phenotype of COVID-19. We propose the generation of a pipeline extending from audio or video recordings of clinic visits to establish a model that factors in clinical symptoms and predict COVID-19 incidence. With vast amounts of available data, we believe that a prediction model can be rapidly developed to promote the accurate screening of individuals at a high risk of COVID-19 and to identify patient characteristics that predict a greater risk of a more severe infection. If clinical encounters are recorded and our NLP model is adequately refined, benchtop virologic findings would be better informed.

Effectiveness is defined as the probability that an anti-malarial drug will successfully treat an individual infected with malaria parasites under routine health care delivery system. Anti-malarial drug effectiveness (AmE) is influenced by drug resistance, drug quality, health system quality, and patient adherence to drug use; its influence on malaria burden varies through space and time. METHODS: This study uses data from 232 efficacy trials comprised of 86,776 infected individuals to estimate the artemisinin-based and non-artemisinin-based AmE for treating falciparum malaria between 1991 and 2019. Bayesian spatiotemporal models were fitted and used to predict effectiveness at the pixel-level (5 km  5 km). The median and interquartile ranges (IQR) of AmE are presented for all malaria-endemic countries. RESULTS: The global effectiveness of artemisinin-based drugs was 67.4% (IQR: 33.3C75.8), 70.1% (43.6C76.0) and 71.8% (46.9C76.4) for the 1991C2000, 2006C2010, and 2016C2019 periods, respectively. Countries in central Africa, a few in South America, and in the Asian region faced the challenge of lower effectiveness of artemisinin-based anti-malarials. However, improvements were seen after 2016, leaving only a few hotspots in Southeast Asia where resistance to artemisinin and partner drugs is currently problematic and in the central Africa where socio-demographic challenges limit effectiveness. The use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) with a competent partner drug and having multiple ACT as first-line treatment choice sustained high levels of effectiveness. High levels of access to healthcare, human resource capacity, education, and proximity to cities were associated with increased effectiveness. Effectiveness of non-artemisinin-based drugs was much lower than that of artemisinin-based with no improvement over time: 52.3% (17.9C74.9) for 1991C2000 and 55.5% (27.1C73.4) for 2011C2015. Overall, AmE for artemisinin-based and non-artemisinin-based drugs were, respectively, 29.6 and 36% below clinical efficacy as measured in anti-malarial drug trials. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that health system performance, drug quality and patient adherence influence the effectiveness of anti-malarials used in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further disrupted the delivery of necessary cancer and supportive care;thus, the need to support patients with cancer is unprecedented. To expand the reach and access of mind-body therapies, we developed, implemented, and evaluated a novel virtual mind-body program for patients with cancer. Methods: We rapidly developed a 7-day a week virtual mind-body program, Integrative Medicine at Home (IM@Home), for patients with cancer (ages 18 years) and deployed it on April 1 , 2020. IM@Home included mind-body group therapy classes in fitness, meditation, yoga, dance, tai chi, and music delivered using Zoom video conferencing. Classes ranged from 30-45 minutes and were led by an integrative medicine clinician. Patients had the option to register for a 1-month, 3-month, or 6-month membership to gain unlimited access to all virtual mind-body classes. Multi-method evaluation was conducted using the RE-AIM conceptual framework to guide surveys and qualitative interviews. Surveys were analyzed using descriptive statistics and interviews were analyzed using grounded theory. Results: Between April 2020 and January 2021, IM@Home registered over 32,000 class participants, with a weekly average attendance of 700-800 participants. In a 4-month postdeployment survey (n = 131), nearly all participants were satisfied with IM@Home (93.9%) and would recommend the program to friends and family (95.4%). A majority of participants also found IM@Home to be simple to use (87.0%) and said the program had a variety of classes that interested them (93.1%). Three-quarters of participants (74.8%) were taking 3 to 7 classes a week (range: 1 to 15 classes), among which the most popular classes were fitness (88.7%), chair yoga (37.1%), and tai chi (33.1%). Most participants preferred a 3- month membership (51.6%), followed by a 6- month membership (19.5%). In qualitative interviews (n = 30), participants reported IM@Home helped them to: 1) maintain structured routines and stay motivated to exercise;2) cope with COVID-19-related and cancer-related stressors;and 3) connect with their fellow cancer patient community and foster social relationships during a time of isolation. Conclusions: Virtual mind-body programming, through IM@Home, reached many patients with cancer to address their physical and psychological challenges during COVID-19. As patients with cancer experience high physical and psychological symptom burden following diagnosis, future clinical trials are needed to evaluate the specific effects of IM@Home when integrated into active treatment and survivorship care.","output":"Implementing virtual mind-body programming to support cancer patients during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an ongoing effort to improve access to state-of-the-art radiotherapy in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a joint symposium was organised by the non-governmental, non-profit organisation Medical physicists in diaspora for Africa e.V.

METHODS: Observational studies comparing characteristics, acute treatment delivery, or hospitalization outcomes between patients with stroke admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic and those admitted before the pandemic were identified by Medline, Scopus, and Embase databases search. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for all outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 46 studies including 129 491 patients. Patients admitted with stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic were found to be younger (mean difference, ?1.19 [95% CI, ?2.05 to ?0.32]; I(2)=70%) and more frequently male (odds ratio, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.01C1.22]; I(2)=54%) compared with patients admitted with stroke in the prepandemic era. Patients admitted with stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic, also, had higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores (mean difference, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.12C0.98]; I(2)=90%), higher probability for large vessel occlusion presence (odds ratio, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.07C2.48]; I(2)=49%) and higher risk for in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.05C1.52]; I(2)=55%).

So far, these advances have largely taken the form of correlations between specific aspects of inflammation (e.g. blood plasma levels of inflammatory markers, genetic mutations in immune pathways, viral or bacterial infection) with the development of neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and depression. A fundamental question remains open: why are psychiatric disorders and immune responses intertwined? To address this would require a step back from a historical mindCbody dualism that has created such a dichotomy. We propose three contributions of active inference when addressing this question: translation, unification, and simulation. To illustrate these contributions, we consider the following questions. Is there an immunological analogue of sensory attenuation? Is there a common generative model that the brain and immune system jointly optimise? Can the immune response and psychiatric illness both be explained in terms of self-organising systems responding to threatening stimuli in their external environment, whether those stimuli happen to be pathogens, predators, or people? Does false inference at an immunological level alter the message passing at a psychological level (or vice versa) through a principled exchange between the two systems?","output":"Immunoceptive inference: why are psychiatric disorders and immune responses intertwined?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The body of evidence showed that perioperative cardiac arrest and mortality trends varied globally over time particularly in low and middle-income nations. However, the survival of children after cardiac arrest and its independent predictors are still uncertain and a topic of debate. This study was designed to investigate the mortality of children after a perioperative cardiac arrest based on a systematic review of published peer-reviewed literature. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed/Medline; Science direct, CINHAL, and LILACS from December 2000 to August 2021. All observational studies reporting the rate of perioperative CA among children were included. The data were extracted with two independent authors in a customized format. The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa appraisal tool. RESULTS: A total of 397 articles were identified from different databases. Thirty-eight studies with 3.35 million participants were included. The meta-analysis revealed that the global incidence of perioperative cardiac arrest was 2.54(95% CI: 2.23 to 2.84) per 1000 anesthetics. The global incidence of perioperative mortality was 41.18 (95% CI: 35.68 to 46.68) per 1000 anesthetics. CONCLUSION: The incidence of anesthesia-related pediatric cardiac arrest and mortality is persistently high in the last twenty years in low and middle-income countries.

This study aimed to estimate the short-term impact of the temporary shutdown (from March until May- June) of the cancer screening programs invitations in Flanders (Belgium) by looking at invitation coverage, percentage of people screened after invitation and the screening interval. METHODS: Yearly invitation coverage was calculated as the number of people who received an invitation, as a proportion of the people who should have received an invitation that year. Weekly response to the invitation was calculated as the number of people who were screened within 40 days of their date of invitation, as a percentage of the people who received an invitation that week (as a proxy for willingness to screen). Weekly screening interval was calculated as the mean number of months between the current screening and the previous screening of all the people who screened that week. The two last indicators were calculated for each week in 2019 and 2020, after which the difference between that weeks value in 2020 and 2019 with 95% confidence intervals. Results of these two indicators were also analysed after stratification for gender, age and participation history. RESULTS: Invitation coverage was not impacted in the colorectal and cervical cancer screening program. In the breast cancer screening program invitation coverage went down from 97.5% (2019) to 88.7% (2020), and the backlog of invitations was largely resolved in the first six months of 2021. The willingness to screen was minimally influenced by COVID-19. The breast cancer screening program had a temporary increase in screening interval in the first months following the restart after COVID-19 related shutdown, when it was on average 2.1 months longer than in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Willingness to screen was minimally influenced by COVID-19, but there may be an influence on screening coverage because of lower invitation coverage, mainly for the for breast Cancer Screening Program. The increases in screening intervals for the three Cancer Screening Program seem reasonable and would probably not significantly increase the risk of delayed screening cancer diagnoses.

We assess whether the ensuing reduction in social contacts led to increased loneliness among older adults (60+). METHODS: Three analyses were conducted: (1) A comparison between pre-pandemic (SHARE: 2013-2017) and pandemic (May 2020) levels of loneliness (UCLA-3 scale), (2) an assessment of the cross-sectional correlation between being affected by COVID-19 restriction measures and loneliness (May 2020), and (3) a longitudinal analysis of weekly changes (March-June 2020) in loneliness (Corona panel). RESULTS: We found (1) increased loneliness in 2020 compared with previous years, (2) a moderate positive association between the number of restriction measures older adults were affected from and their loneliness, and (3) that loneliness was higher during lockdown compared to the subsequent re-opening phase, particularly among those who live alone. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence that COVID-19 restriction measures in Austria have indeed resulted in increased levels of loneliness among older adults. However, these effects seem to be short-lived, and thus no strong negative consequences for older adults mental health are expected.

To tackle this problem, this research has designed two-phase universal machine learning (ML) model to predict wheat yield (W(pred)), utilizing 27 agricultural counties data within the Agro-ecological zone. The universal model, online sequential extreme learning machines coupled with ant colony optimization (ACO-OSELM) is developed, by incorporating the significant annual yield data lagged at (t ? 1) as the models predictor to generate future yield at 6 test stations. In the first phase, ACO is adopted to search for suitable, statistically relevant data stations for model training, and the corresponding test station by virtue of a feature selection strategy. An annual wheat yield time-series input dataset is constructed utilizing data from each selected training station (1981C2013) and applied against 6 test stations (with each case modelled with 26 station data as the input) to evaluate the hybrid ACO-OSELM model. The partial autocorrelation function is implemented to deduce statistically significant lagged data, and OSELM is applied to generate W(pred).

METHODS This retrospective cohort study used the Optum Clinformatics? Data Mart database from January 2015 to December 2018. Adult patients with a diagnosis of EM, CM or TTH and at least 12 months of continuous enrollment before and after diagnosis were included. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to adjust for baseline differences among the three groups. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline, and healthcare utilization and costs during follow-up, were described and compared between the three groups. RESULTS A total of 45,849 patients were included: 8955 with CM, 31,961 with EM, and 4933 with TTH. The total all-cause annual direct medical costs of patients with CM ($17,878) were 1.38 times higher (95% CI: 1.31-1.44) than those with EM ($12,986), and 2.26 times higher (95% CI: 2.08-2.47) than those with TTH ($7902). The annual migraine/TTH-related costs of patients with CM ($1869) were 4.19 times higher (95% CI: 3.92-4.48) than those with EM ($446), and 11.90 times (95% CI: 10.59-13.52) higher than those with TTH ($157). In the adjusted analyses, for all service categories (emergency department, inpatient, outpatient, and prescriptions), the expected costs in the migraine groups were higher than in the TTH group (all p < 0.001), while controlling for covariates. Main findings were consistent in both weighted and unweighted samples, and with both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. CONCLUSION This study provides an updated assessment of healthcare utilization and expenditures for adult patients with primary headache disorders.

Inherent limitations exist with current generation endoscopic technologies, including, but not limited to, patient discomfort, endoscopist fatigue, narrow field of view and missed pathology behind colonic folds. Rapid developments in medical robotics have led to the emergence of a variety of next-generation robotically-augmented technologies that could overcome these limitations. AIM To provide a comprehensive summary of recent developments in the application of robotics in lower gastrointestinal tract endoscopy. METHODS A systematic review of the literature was performed from January 1, 2000 to the January 7, 2021 using EMBASE, MEDLINE and Cochrane databases. Studies reporting data on the use of robotic technology in ex vivo or in vivo animal and human experiments were included. In vitro studies (studies using synthetic colon models), studies evaluating non-robotic technology, robotic technology aimed at the upper gastrointestinal tract or paediatric endoscopy were excluded. System ergonomics, safety, visualisation, and diagnostic/therapeutic capabilities were assessed. RESULTS Initial literature searching identified 814 potentially eligible studies, from which 37 were deemed suitable for inclusion. Included studies were classified according to the actuation modality of the robotic device(s) as electromechanical (EM) (n = 13), pneumatic (n = 11), hydraulic (n = 1), magnetic (n = 10) and hybrid (n = 2) mechanisms. Five devices have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, however most of the technologies reviewed remain in the early phases of testing and development. Level 1 evidence is lacking at present, but early reports suggest that these technologies may be associated with improved pain and safety. The reviewed devices appear to be ergonomically capable and efficient though to date no reports have convincingly shown diagnostic or therapeutic superiority over conventional colonoscopy. CONCLUSION Significant progress in robotic colonoscopy has been made over the last couple of decades. Improvements in design together with the integration of semi-autonomous and autonomous systems over the next decade will potentially result in robotic colonoscopy becoming more commonplace.","output":"Application of robotic technologies in lower gastrointestinal tract endoscopy: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: China has the highest prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection worldwide. Universal HBV screening might enable China to reach the WHO 2030 target of 90% diagnostics, 80% treatment, and 65% HBV-related death reduction, and eventually elimination of viral hepatitis. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of implementing universal HBV screening in China and identified optimal screening strategies. METHODS: We used a Markov cohort model, inputting parameters based on data from previous studies and public databases, to assess the cost-effectiveness of four HBV serological screening strategies in China in different screening scenarios. We simulated universal screening scenarios in 15 adult age groups between 18 and 70 years, with different years of screening implementation (2021, 2026, and 2031) and compared to the status quo (ie, no universal screening); in total, we investigated 180 different screening scenarios. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between the different screening strategies and the status quo (current screening strategy). We performed probabilistic and one-way deterministic sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings. FINDINGS: With a willingness-to-pay level of three times the Chinese gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (US$30 828), all universal screening scenarios in 2021 were cost-effective compared with the status quo. The serum HBsAg/HBsAb/HBeAg/HBeAb/HBcAb (five-test) screening strategy in people aged 18C70 years was the most cost-effective strategy in 2021 (ICER $18 295/quality-adjusted life-years [QALY] gained). This strategy remained the most cost-effective, when the willingness-to-pay threshold was reduced to 2 times GDP per capita. The two-test strategy for people aged 18C70 years became more cost-effective at lower willingness-to-pay levels. The five-test strategy could prevent 346 million liver-related deaths in China over the lifetime of the cohort. It remained the most cost-effective strategy when implementation was delayed until 2026 (ICER $20 183/QALY) and 2031 (ICER $23 123/QALY). Screening young people (18C30 years) will no longer be cost-effective in delayed scenarios. INTERPRETATION: The five-test universal screening strategy in people aged 18C70 years, implemented within the next 10 years, is the optimal HBV screening strategy for China. Other screening strategies could be cost-effective alternatives, if budget is limited in rural areas. Delaying strategy implementation reduces overall cost-effectiveness. Early screening initiation will aid global efforts in achieving viral hepatitis elimination.

Multiple vaccines have demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials though real-world effectiveness of vaccines against Covid-19 mortality in clinically and demographically diverse populations has not yet been reported. Methods: We used a retrospective cohort assembled from a cross-institution comprehensive data repository. Established patients of the health care system were categorized as not immunized, partially immunized, or fully immunized against SARS-CoV-2 with an mRNA vaccine through April 4, 2021. Outcomes were Covid-19 related hospitalization and death. Results: Of the 91,134 established patients, 70.2% were not immunized, 4.5% were partially immunized and 25.4% were fully immunized. Among the fully immunized 0.7% had a Covid-19 hospitalization, whereas 3.4% among the partially immunized and 2.7% non-immunized individuals were hospitalized with Covid-19. Of the 225 deaths among Covid-19 hospitalizations, 219 (97.3%) were in the not immunized, 5 (2.2%) in the partially immunized, and 1 (0.0041%) in the fully immunized group. mRNA vaccines were 96% (95%CI: 95 - 99) effective at preventing Covid-19 related hospitalization and 98.7% (95%CI: 91.0 - 99.8) effective at preventing Covid-19 related death when participants were fully vaccinated. Partial vaccination was 77% (95%CI: 71 - 82) effective at preventing hospitalization and 64.2% (95%CI: 13.0 - 85.2) effective at preventing death. Vaccine effectiveness at preventing hospitalization was conserved across subgroups of age, race, ethnicity, Area Deprivation Index, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. Conclusions: In a large, diverse cohort in the United States, full immunization with mRNA vaccines was highly effective in the real-world scenario at preventing Covid-19 related hospitalization and death.","output":"Real World Effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines against Hospitalizations and Deaths in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a public health emergency. There is insufficient information on AMR in the context of humanitarian settings. An understanding of behavioural and institutional level factors can strengthen antimicrobial stewardship. This study used a semi-structured questionnaire to assess both knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) on antimicrobial use, resistance and stewardship, and options to improving prescribing, among prescribers at the Primary Healthcare facilities of the UNRWA Jordan field office. Responses to the KAP questions were evaluated using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behaviour (COM-B) framework and Bloom's cutoffs. For each framework component, Blooms cutoffs and interpretations were: >80% (good); 60-79% (moderate); and <60% (poor). Fourteen options to improve prescribing were each assessed using 5-point Likert scales from very unhelpful to very helpful, aggregated by helpful and very helpful and ranked as: >90%, best/most acceptable; >80-90%, as acceptable; and, 70-80% as maybe acceptable/good. The questionnaire response rate was 59% (37/63) with a completion rate of 92% (34/37). Aggregate scores for real knowledge on AMR was 97%; opportunity to improve prescribing 88%; and motivation 16% - participants did not believe that there was a connection between their prescribing and AMR or that they had a key role in helping control AMR. Good options (74% aggregate score) to improving prescribing were the availability of guidelines and resistance data. There was good knowledge of AMR and good opportunities, but poor motivation for rational prescribing or behavioral change.

Type I interferons (IFN-Is) function as the first line of host defense and thus play critical roles during virus infection by mediating the transcriptional induction of hundreds of genes. Nevertheless, overactive cytokine immune responses also cause autoimmune diseases, and thus, tight regulation of the innate immune response is needed to achieve viral clearance without causing excessive immune responses. Emerging studies have recently uncovered that the ubiquitin system, particularly deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), plays a critical role in regulating innate immune responses. In this review, we highlight recent advances on the diverse mechanisms of human DUBs implicated in IFN-I signaling. These DUBs function dynamically to calibrate host defenses against various virus infections by targeting hub proteins in the IFN-I signaling transduction pathway. We also present a future perspective on the roles of DUB-substrate interaction networks in innate antiviral activities, discuss the promises and challenges of DUB-based drug development, and identify the open questions that remain to be clarified.

This is so despite the fact that, first, Italy has ratified the vast majority of instruments dealing with serious forms of labour exploitation at the international and regional level and has adopted legislation implementing its international obligations, by creating offences which criminalize practices amounting to slavery, servitude, forced labour and exploitation of labour, and second, that the interpretation adopted by the Italian courts of the relevant concepts appears to be in line with that of international bodies. Clearly, an approach which goes beyond the criminal law and includes measures of prevention is therefore needed in order to address the phenomenon of exploitation of migrant workers at its roots. In addition to structural deficiencies in the system of labour inspections, a major factor contributing to the vulnerability of migrant workers results from Italys immigration law and policy, which has as a result that the immigration status of many migrant workers is irregular, or at least precarious. Notwithstanding the existence of (narrow) paths for legal migration and special provisions for the regularization of victims of severe labour exploitation, the current legislation remains insufficient and ineffective in combating exploitation. Whilst recent legislation adopted to deal with the Covid-19 emergency specifically provides for the regularization of irregular agricultural workers already present in Italy, it remains an ad hoc measure which does not address the underlying systemic problems and is not a substitute for an approach to immigration control which puts the right of migrant workers not to be exploited at the core of the debate.","output":"The Italian Response to Exploitation of Migrant Workers in the Agricultural Sector: Between Criminalization and Prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has rapidly spread around the world in the past few months, researchers around the world are working around the clock to closely monitor and assess the development of this pandemic In this paper, a time series regression model is built to assess the short-term progression of COVID-19 pandemic The model structure and parameters are identified using COVID-19 pandemic data released by China within the time window from 22 January to 09 April 2020 The same model structure and parameters are applied to a few other countries for day ahead forecasting, showing a good fit of the model This modeling exercise confirms that the underlying internal dynamics of this disease progression is quite similar The differences in the impact of this pandemic on different countries are largely attributed to different eternal factors ? 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"A Regression Model for Short-Term COVID-19 Pandemic Assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patient: Male, 2-month-old Final Diagnosis: Kawasaki disease Symptoms: Bleeding and peeling lips ? conjunctival injection ? erythema of the palms and soles ? erythematous (polymorphous) maculopapular rash ? fever ? nasal congestion Medication:  Clinical Procedure: Echocardiography ? electrocardiogram Specialty: Pediatrics and Neonatology OBJECTIVE: Rare disease BACKGROUND: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute inflammatory vasculitis, which occurs mostly in childhood, predominantly between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. The incidence of coronary artery abnormalities associated with KD has decreased from 25% to 4% as a result of timely diagnosis and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Infants 6 months of age are the most likely to develop prolonged fever without the other clinical criteria for KD, and diagnosis can sometimes be challenging or delayed. They are therefore at particularly high risk of developing coronary artery abnormalities. CASE REPORT: A 2-month-old male infant with no significant medical history initially presented with a history of nasal congestion, right conjunctivitis, red lips, and 1 loose stool in the pre-COVID-19 era. He was diagnosed with otitis media and was started on oral amoxicillin. By day 7 of fever, he had developed symptoms and signs and laboratory findings consistent with Kawasaki disease, which is rare in this age group. His echocardiogram showed dilated proximal left anterior descending and right coronary arteries. He was successfully treated, and his most recent echocardiogram, performed 17 months after his treatment, showed remarkable improvement in the coronary arteries. CONCLUSIONS: Kawasaki disease in children less than 6 months of age is still rare, and the presentation can sometimes make the diagnosis somewhat challenging. Increased clinical suspicion is required for recognition in the youngest patients, as they are more likely to present with few features of KD. Early diagnosis and treatment are needed to prevent or minimize the risk of significant coronary artery abnormalities.","output":"A 2-Month-Old with Kawasaki Disease with Coronary Artery Dilation in the Pre-COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Twenty fifteen marked the year of assessment for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs that achieved the greatest success were those where evidence-based practice (EBP) interventions were implemented. The ability to practice evidence-based medicine is grounded in the creation of and access to medical literature that synthesizes research findings. The role that global health literature played in the success of the MDGs demonstrates that medical libraries and librarians have a role to play in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Librarians can hold capacity-building workshops that provide instruction on how to access evidence-based literature and also train health professionals to conduct synthesis research. Research findings conducted by in-country health professionals are more likely to address issues being faced by local communities and will afford the possibility of obtaining the necessary evidence-based answers that can then be used to implement policies to resolve public health issues identified in the SDGs.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients taking clozapine will be self-isolating to reduce the risk of infection, not least because these patients are at high risk of serious illness and fatality because of high rates of diabetes, obesity and pulmonary disease and an increased risk of pneumonia. Problems may also arise because both clozapine-induced myocarditis and neutropenic sepsis share signs and symptoms with COVID-19 (fever, chest pain, dyspnoea, etc.). We recommend decreasing the frequency of physical contacts by extending the blood monitoring interval to 12 weeks in those patients taking clozapine for more than 1 year. To distinguish COVID-19 from clozapine-related physical adverse effects, we suggest an urgent antigen test alongside a full blood count. In those taking clozapine who develop COVID-19, we suggest continuing with clozapine whenever possible (even during ventilation), reducing the dose if necessary in line with blood assay results. Blood monitoring should continue but clozapine should only cease if there is a significant fall in neutrophils (COVID-19 is linked to lymphopenia but not neutropenia). To protect against the likelihood and severity of respiratory infection, we recommend the use of vitamin D in all clozapine patients.

One major challenge for critical care is to stratify and minimise the risk of multi-organ failure during the stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Epigenetic-sensitive mechanisms, including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs may lead to perturbations of the host immune-related transcriptional programmes by regulating chromatin structure and gene expression patterns. Viruses causing severe pulmonary illness can use epigenetic-regulated mechanisms during host-pathogen interaction to interfere with innate and adaptive immunity, adequacy of inflammatory response, and overall outcome of viral infections. For example, Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV and H5N1 can affect host antigen presentation through DNA methylation and histone modifications. The same mechanisms would presumably occur in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, in which tocilizumab may epigenetically reduce microvascular damage. Targeting epigenetic pathways by immune modulators (e.g. tocilizumab) or repurposed drugs (e.g. statins) may provide novel therapeutic opportunities to control viral-host interaction during critical illness.

While wearing a face mask, people tend to push their jaws forward and downward in a repetitive manner to hold their masks in the right position; these jaw motions may induce temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD). In this study, we aimed to investigate these repetitive jaw movements while wearing face masks and their effects on TMD. Patients and Methods Patients who applied with TMD signs between June 2020 and May 2021 were evaluated prospectively. A survey using a questionnaire was conducted to define patients with TMD that caused only by mask-related repetitive jaw movements. Demographic data (age and gender), mean duration of daily mask usage, mask type, and magnetic resonance imaging results were recorded. Results Prolonged daily mask usage (8 hours/day) was significantly higher in patients with mask-related habits (group a) with a rate of 40.4% ( p  0.001). Also, in this group, the disc displacement with reduction rate (54.6%) was higher compared with other groups ( p  0.010). On the contrary, patients with no underlying risk factor (group c) showed an unexpected high osteoarthritis rate ( p  0.029). Conclusions In this study, we demonstrate that correcting the position of a face mask by repetitive jaw movements can increase the occurrence of TMD. Informing individuals wearing face masks about the risk of TMD and the importance of choosing the appropriate mask size according to the face shape are important issues to be addressed in the near future.","output":"The Impact of Wearing a Face Mask during the COVID-19 Pandemic on Temporomandibular Joint: A Radiological and Questionnaire Assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Commercial wearable devices are surfacing as an appealing mechanism to detect COVID-19 and potentially other public health threats, due to their widespread use. To assess the validity of wearable devices as population health screening tools, it is essential to evaluate predictive methodologies based on wearable devices by mimicking their real-world deployment. Several points must be addressed to transition from statistically significant differences between infected and uninfected cohorts to COVID-19 inferences on individuals. We demonstrate the strengths and shortcomings of existing approaches on a cohort of 32,198 individuals who experience influenza like illness (ILI), 204 of which report testing positive for COVID-19. We show that, despite commonly made design mistakes resulting in overestimation of performance, when properly designed wearables can be effectively used as a part of the detection pipeline. For example, knowing the week of year, combined with naive randomised test set generation leads to substantial overestimation of COVID-19 classification performance at 0.73 AUROC. However, an average AUROC of only 0.55 {+/-} 0.02 would be attainable in a simulation of real-world deployment, due to the shifting prevalence of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ILI to trigger further testing. In this work we show how to train a machine learning model to differentiate ILI days from healthy days, followed by a survey to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza and unspecified ILI based on symptoms. In a forthcoming week, models can expect a sensitivity of 0.50 (0-0.74, 95% CI), while utilising the wearable device to reduce the burden of surveys by 35%. The corresponding false positive rate is 0.22 (0.02-0.47, 95% CI). In the future, serious consideration must be given to the design, evaluation, and reporting of wearable device interventions if they are to be relied upon as part of frequent COVID-19 or other public health threat testing infrastructures.","output":"Dear Watch, Should I Get a COVID-19 Test?

Here, we examine the phenotype of P protein of ABLV, which circulates as two defined lineages associated with frugivorous and insectivorous bats, providing the opportunity to compare proteins of viruses adapted to divergent bat species. We report that key functions of P protein in the antagonism of interferon/signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling and the capacity of P protein to undergo nuclear trafficking differ between lineages. Molecular mapping indicates that these differences are functionally distinct and appear to involve modulatory effects on regulatory regions or structural impact rather than changes to defined interaction sequences. This results in partial but significant phenotypic divergence, consistent with fine-tuning to host biology, and with potentially distinct properties in the virusChost interface between bat families that represent key zoonotic reservoirs.","output":"Phenotypic Divergence of P Proteins of Australian Bat Lyssavirus Lineages Circulating in Microbats and Flying Foxes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the impact of the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV services in Taiwan. METHODS: An online, cross-sectional survey was conducted among people living with HIV (PLWH), individuals at risk of HIV infection (IAR), and service prescribers between 20th October and 30th November, 2020. Representatives from patient advocacy groups were interviewed. RESULTS: In total, 66 PLWH, 104 IAR, and 32 prescribers from Taiwan completed the survey. Mild to moderate disruptions to HIV-related services (including medical consultation, HIV-related testing, and medications) were found by the survey, with IAR appearing more affected than PLWH. Nine (13.6%) PLWH and 31 (29.8%) IAR reported disruptions in hospital/clinic visits and two (3.0%) PLWH and 25 (24.0%) IAR reported decreased frequency of HIV testing. Similar observations were also made by four patient advocacy group representatives interviewed. Telehealth services were received by only limited proportions of PLWH and IAR who participated in the survey.

We set out to intentionally strategize a quality improvement framework with which to guide our departmental response. Methods: We employed a Key Drivers Diagram (KDD) model to strategically account for the numerous novel quality improvement measures implemented simultaneously in response to the pandemic. Having identified areas of interest, measurable indices were identified, and dynamic progress assessed using run charts. These were (I) protect patients and staff, (II) keep up-to-date with evolving evidence, (III) maintain communication with department, (IV) keep staff engaged, and (V) align departmental goals with institutional aims. Results: Positive trends in staff engagement were identified across participation in educational activities such as guideline development, grand round attendance, and interdepartmental meetings.

The purpose of this study was to examine the link between fast food, sugars, or soft drinks and the ongoing domestic lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. This phenomenon was studied in three different cities from three different countries (Saudi Arabia, Britain, and Turkey) from the perspective of children's parents. The study sought to address three research questions regarding children's well-being during the COVID-19 lockdown period. First, was children's nutrition affected during this period? Second, did children's weight increase? Third, were there any statistically significant differences in children's dietary patterns based on their gender and nationality? A questionnaire was administered to 330 parents of children aged four to seven years in the three targeted countries. The study found that most parents cared about their children's nutrition and prepared food at home (96.1%) during the lockdown. Sixty-three percent of parents indicated that children did not gain weight. Additionally, differences in children's nutritional systems were found between Saudi and Turkish children; the nutritional system of the Turkish children was better than that of Saudi children during the lockdown.

We offered tailored conversations by telephone in which we discussed the barriers to vaccination that the patients were facing and offered to provide relevant information and/or logistical assistance. Of the 184 patients reached by phone, 125 (68%) endorsed having already been vaccinated and 59 (32%) did not. About one third of the unvaccinated patients were willing to participate in tailored conversations (20 patients = 34% of the unvaccinated). In follow-up calls 30 days after the intervention we found that four of these 20 patients had received COVID-19 vaccination, one patient was scheduled for vaccination, 10 continued to be deciding about vaccination, four had decided against it and one could not be reached.

We conducted an updated meta-analysis of clinical trials and observational studies published till June 2020. Patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) infection were included. The drugs used in the intervention group are Chloroquine (CQ)/Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with or without Azithromycin. The primary outcome is time to achieve virological cure. Of 1040 citations, 11 studies provided data of 1215 patients. Compared to control, CQ/HCQ has no significant effect on the time to negative COVID-19 RT-PCR results, neither in clinical trials (mean difference [MD] 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] - 0.7 to 3.79; P = 0.18; n = 180), nor in observational studies (MD 1.14; 95%CI - 11.98 to 14.26; P = 0.86, n = 407). CQ/HCQ did not affect the virological cure after day 3, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28; except after day 5, as shown by a single small non-randomised trial (odds ratio [OR] 9.33; 95% CI 1.51 to 57.65; P = 0.02, n = 30). Pooled data from 2 observational studies showed a significant effect of CQ/HCQ on virological cure by after day 10 (OR 7.86; 95% CI 4.4 to 14.04, P < 0.001, n = 373) and day 14 (OR 6.37; 95% CI 3.01 to 13.48, P < 0.001, n = 407). The GRADE evidence generated was of very low-quality/certainty. To conclude, CQ/HCQ does not affect the time to virological cure compared to usual/standard of care in COVID-19 infection. Recurrent infection in a smaller number of patients was noted in the CQ/HCQ group. As the evidence generated was of very low-quality/certainty), large good quality studies are needed to confirm the present findings.","output":"Effect of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 Virological Outcomes: An Updated Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using approaches of transcriptomics and proteomics we have shown that the phenotype of Bothrops jararaca venom undergoes a significant rearrangement upon neonate to adult transition. Most regulatory processes in biology are intrinsically related to modifications of protein structure, function, and abundance.

Here we assessed the natural N-terminome of Bothrops jararaca newborn and adult venoms and explored the degree of N-terminal protein truncation in ontogenetic-based proteome variation. To this end we applied the Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS) technology to characterize venom collected in the presence of proteinase inhibitors. We identified natural N-terminal sequences in the newborn (71) and adult (84) venoms, from which only 37 were common to both. However, truncated toxins were found in higher number in the newborn (212) than in the adult (140) venom. Moreover, sequences N-terminally blocked by pyroglutamic acid were identified in the newborn (55) and adult (49) venoms. Most toxin classes identified by their natural N-terminal sequences showed a similar number of unique peptides in the newborn and adult venoms, however, those of serine proteinases and C-type lectins were more abundant in the adult venom. Truncated sequences from at least ten toxin classes were detected, however the catalytic and cysteine-rich domains of metalloproteinases were the most prone to proteolysis, mainly in the newborn venom.

This report evaluated global progress toward these targets based on data reported by WHO (1). Annual TB data routinely reported to WHO by 194 member states were used to estimate TB incidence and mortality overall and among persons with HIV infection, TB-preventive treatment (TPT) initiation, and drug-resistant TB for 2018 (1). In 2018, an estimated 10 million persons had incident TB, and 1.5 million TB-related deaths occurred, representing 2% and 5% declines from 2017, respectively. The number of persons with both incident and prevalent TB remained highest in the WHO South-East Asia and African regions. Decreases in the European region were on track to meet 2020 targets. Globally, among persons living with HIV, 862,000 incident TB cases occurred, and 1.8 million persons initiated TPT. Rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant TB occurred among 3.4% of persons with new TB and 18% among persons who were previously treated for TB (overall, among 4.8% of persons with TB). The modest decreases in the number of persons with TB and the number of TB-related deaths were consistent with recent trends, and new and substantial progress was observed in increased TPT initiation among persons living with HIV. However, to meet the global targets for 2035, more intensive efforts are needed by public health partners to decrease TB incidence and deaths and increase the number of persons receiving TB curative and preventive treatment.

If surgically explored, near infrared spectroscopy was performed at surgery and on postoperative day 1. Data were presented as means  SD and/or normalized to the internal control. Cutoff value was generated for the StO2% difference between the affected testis and control side. RESULTS Sixteen males with acute scrotum of mean duration 12 hours were enrolled. Of 11 patients with abnormal Doppler undergoing surgical exploration, mean StO2% of the affected testis at presentation and at surgery decreased from 40.09  2.66 (range 36 to 44) to 37.18  3.31 (range 32 to 42), respectively, while StO2% of the unaffected testis remained 63.09 (range 55 to 69) both at presentation (SD 4.72) and at surgery (SD 4.98). Of the 11 surgically explored, 4 had orchiectomy and 7 patients underwent surgical detorsion. At presentation and at surgical exploration of the detorsed group, the mean normalized difference between the StO2% values of the affected and unaffected sides was -16.12 and -25.9, respectively.

The clinical priorities of redirecting personnel and resources to provide the necessary beds, care, and staff to handle the initial waves of infected individuals, and the drive to develop an effective vaccine, were the most visible and rightly took precedent. However, the spread of the COVID-19 virus also led to less apparent but equally challenging impediments for healthcare professionals. Continuing professional development (CPD) for physicians and surgeons practically ceased as national societies postponed or canceled annual meetings and activities. The traditional in-person conferences were no longer viable options during a pandemic in which social distancing and minimization of contacts was the emerging norm. Like other organizations, The Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) had to first postpone and then cancel altogether the in-person 2020 Annual Meeting due to the contingencies brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the traditional hands-on (HO) courses that typically occur as part of the Annual Meeting, could not take place. SAGES had already begun to re-structure these courses in an effort to increase their effectiveness (Dort, Trickey, Paige, Schwarz, Dunkin in Surg Endosc 33(9):3062C3068, 2019; Dort et al. in Surg Endosc 32(11):4491C4497, 2018; Dort, Trickey, Schwarz, Paige in Surg Endosc 33(9):3062C3068, 2019). The cancelations brought about by COVID-19 provided an opportunity to refine and to innovate further. METHODS: In this manner, the Re-imaging Education & Learning (REAL) project crystallized, an innovative effort to leverage the latest educational concepts as well as communication and simulation-based technologies to enhance procedural adoption by converting HO courses to a virtual format. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: This manuscript describes the key components of REAL, reviewing the restructuring of the HO courses before and after the spread of COVID-19, describing the educational framework underlying it, discussing currently available technologies and materials, and evaluating the advantages of such a format.","output":"SAGES Reimagining Education & Learning (REAL) project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organization designated last year as the International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife.

We collected daily COVID-19 diagnoses and mortality data from the WHOs daily situation reports dated January 1 to December 31, 2020. We performed three time-series models [simple exponential smoothing, auto-regressive integrated moving average, and automatic forecasting time-series (Prophet)] to identify the global trend of rCFR for COVID-19. We used beta regression models to investigate the association between the rCFR and potential predictors of each country and reported incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of each variable. The weekly global cumulative COVID-19 rCFR reached a peak at 7.23% during the 17th week (April 22C28, 2020). We found a positive and increasing trend for global daily rCFR values of COVID-19 until the 17th week (pre-peak period) and then a strong declining trend up until the 53rd week (post-peak period) toward 2.2% (December 29C31, 2020). In pre-peak of rCFR, the percentage of people aged 65 and above and the prevalence of obesity were significantly associated with the COVID-19 rCFR. The declining trend of global COVID-19 rCFR was not merely because of increased COVID-19 testing, because COVID-19 tests per 1,000 population had poor predictive value. Decreasing rCFR could be explained by an increased rate of infection in younger people or by the improvement of health care management, shielding from infection, and/or repurposing of several drugs that had shown a beneficial effect on reducing fatality because of COVID-19.","output":"The Global Case-Fatality Rate of COVID-19 Has Been Declining Since May 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aim: Coronaviruses disease 2019 (COVID-19), for the first time detected in Wuhan, China, rapidly speared around the world and be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

Structural biology research has helped to establish the molecular bases for many virusCsialic acid interactions. Due to the icosahedral 532 point group symmetry that underlies many viral capsids, the receptor binding sites are frequently arranged in a highly symmetric fashion and linked by five-fold, three-fold, or two-fold rotation axes. For the inhibition of viral attachment, one emerging strategy is based on developing multivalent sialic acid-based inhibitors that can simultaneously engage several of these binding sites, thus binding viral capsids with high avidity. In this review, we will evaluate the structures of non-enveloped virus capsid proteins bound to sialylated glycan receptors and discuss the potential of these structures for the development of potent antiviral attachment inhibitors.","output":"The Symmetry of Viral Sialic Acid Binding SitesImplications for Antiviral Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created a new paradigm of life in social distancing, which in its turn has had a massive impact on education. Continuing education delivery through alternative channels of instruction became a top priority for education institutions aiming to minimize impacts of the pandemic on education. Most universities shifted from conventional, face-to-face instruction to distance teaching and learning, which meant that teaching approaches, tools of assessments, and ways of teacher-student communication had to be modified. Since the pandemic wake, various global educational organizations have carried out studies to identify threats and potential opportunities for higher education within and beyond the pandemic. Some attempts to analyze the experience of the Ukrainian higher education system transition to mass distance instruction have also been made. However, this research was limited by a territorial or time span, sectoral analysis, or focus on specific issues. Lack of comprehensive cross-sectoral nationwide research regarding the perceptions of the main actors of Ukraines higher education system (teachers and students) on outcomes of this abrupt transition, inspired the current research. In this regard, we saw the objective of the study in exploring the experience of mass distance learning application in Ukraines higher education system due to COVID-19 and identifying considerations for e-learning in the national system of higher education within and beyond the pandemic. The research was carried out using a survey. The order of the researchers' actions was as follows: questionnaire compilation, data collection, data analysis, and knowledge generation. In this study, a closed-format questionnaire containing questions with pre-offered answers (multiple choices) was the main research instrument. The questionnaire was distributed to Ukrainian university teachers and students by snowball sampling. The data analysis phase involved analyzing the quantitative datasets. The interpretation of the analyzed information led to the generation of knowledge. 882 responses from 65 Ukrainian higher education institutions were received. The survey data showed that the mass transition to distance learning was a challenge for the majority of Ukrainian universities: only 45.5% of the respondents reported experiences with distance teaching/learning before the pandemic. On the basis of the obtained data, several groups of problems were identified: problems of a technological nature associated with the improper digital infrastructures of Ukraines higher education institutions, unequal access of teachers and students to electronic devices and Internet connection;problems of a methodological nature associated with a lack of methodological support and special training programs for teachers to carry out distance instruction;problems of a psychological nature associated with the development of motivation, teachers commitment, and establishing new communication patterns. The research supports the e-learning practice of providing data regarding the experiences of Ukraine's national higher education system on mass and the abrupt transition to distance learning and advances in e-learning knowledge area by envisaging potential for this mode of instruction beyond the pandemic and specifying directions for further research (development of the methodological, technological and informational support model for teachers;studies of the impact of digital learning tools on the mental health of university students;comparative analysis and adoption of the results of international studies into the practice of national education systems;creation of high-quality platforms with an accessible interface and algorithm of use). ?

We show that miR-122 enhances HCV RNA levels by altering the fraction of HCV genomes available for RNA synthesis. Exogenous miR-122 increases viral RNA and protein levels in Xrn1-depleted cells, with enhanced RNA synthesis occurring before heightened protein synthesis. Inhibiting protein translation blocks miR-122-mediated increases in RNA synthesis, but independently enhances RNA synthesis by releasing ribosomes from viral genomes. Additionally, miR-122 reduces the fraction of viral genomes engaged in protein translation. Depleting AGO2 or PCBP2, which binds HCV RNA in competition with miR-122 and promotes translation, eliminates miR-122 stimulation of RNA synthesis. Thus, by displacing PCBP2, miR-122 reduces HCV genomes engaged in translation while increasing the fraction available for RNA synthesis.","output":"miR-122 Stimulates Hepatitis C Virus RNA Synthesis by Altering the Balance of Viral RNAs Engaged in Replication Versus Translation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the adoption of digital health technologies to maximize the accessibility of medical care in primary care settings. Medical appointment scheduling (MAS) systems are among the most essential technologies. Prior studies on MAS systems have taken either a user-oriented perspective, focusing on perceived outcomes such as patient satisfaction, or a technical perspective, focusing on optimizing medical scheduling algorithms. Less attention has been given to the extent to which family medicine practices have assimilated these systems into their daily operations and achieved impacts. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to fill this gap and provide answers to the following questions: (1) to what extent have primary care practices assimilated MAS systems into their daily operations? (2) what are the impacts of assimilating MAS systems on the accessibility and availability of primary care? and (3) what are the organizational and managerial factors associated with greater assimilation of MAS systems in family medicine clinics? METHODS: A survey study targeting all family medicine clinics in Quebec, Canada, was conducted. The questionnaire was addressed to the individual responsible for managing medical schedules and appointments at these clinics. Following basic descriptive statistics, component-based structural equation modeling was used to empirically explore the causal paths implied in the conceptual framework. A cluster analysis was also performed to complement the causal analysis. As a final step, 6 experts in MAS systems were interviewed. Qualitative data were then coded and extracted using standard content analysis methods. RESULTS: A total of 70 valid questionnaires were collected and analyzed. A large majority of the surveyed clinics had implemented MAS systems, with an average use of 1 or 2 functionalities, mainly automated appointment confirmation and reminders and online appointment confirmation, modification, or cancellation by the patient. More extensive use of MAS systems appears to contribute to improved availability of medical care in these clinics, notwithstanding the effect of their application of advanced access principles. Also, greater integration of MAS systems into the clinics electronic medical record system led to more extensive use. Our study further indicated that smaller clinics were less likely to undertake such integration and therefore showed less availability of medical care for their patients. Finally, our findings indicated that those clinics that showed a greater adoption rate and that used the provincial MAS system tended to be the highest-performing ones in terms of accessibility and availability of care. CONCLUSIONS: The main contribution of this study lies in the empirical demonstration that greater integration and assimilation of MAS systems in family medicine clinics lead to greater accessibility and availability of care for their patients and the general population. Valuable insight has also been provided on how to identify the clinics that would benefit most from such digital health solutions.","output":"Assimilation of Medical Appointment Scheduling Systems and Their Impact on the Accessibility of Primary Care: Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this study is to review the recent literature on disasters' impact on the course of psychotic spectrum disorders (PSDs) and how people with PSD fare during a disaster, including the effects of COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: Several, but not all, studies examining disasters including earthquake-affected communities and refugee populations have found increased incidence of PSDs. Studies have been inconsistent regarding psychosis incidence in COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, patients with PSD have been found to cope poorly in recent disasters including flooding and a nuclear accident. Patients with schizophrenia appear to be at particular risk during COVID-19 due to such issues as poor awareness of health precautions and the psychiatric impact of lockdown. However, novel methods including telepsychiatry have allowed care of this population to remain consistent during COVID-19. SUMMARY: There is conflicting evidence as to the association between disasters and onset of PSD, and further study is needed to elucidate this link. Patients with PSDs are more likely to fare worse during disasters. Novel approaches to delivery of care have helped offset the psychiatric risks to PSD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Most ML approaches focus on generalization performance on unseen data that are similar to the training data (In-Distribution, or IND). However, real world applications and deployments of ML rarely enjoy the comfort of encountering examples that are always IND. In such situations, most ML models commonly display erratic behavior on Out-of-Distribution (OOD) examples, such as assigning high confidence to wrong predictions, or vice-versa. Implications of such unusual model behavior are further exacerbated in the healthcare setting, where patient health can potentially be put at risk. It is crucial to study the behavior and robustness properties of models under distributional shift, understand common failure modes, and take mitigation steps before the model is deployed. Having a benchmark that shines light upon these aspects of a model is a first and necessary step in addressing the issue. Recent work and interest in increasing model robustness in OOD settings have focused more on image modality, while the Electronic Health Record (EHR) modality is still largely under-explored. We aim to bridge this gap by releasing BEDS-Bench, a benchmark for quantifying the behavior of ML models over EHR data under OOD settings. We use two open access, de-identified EHR datasets to construct several OOD data settings to run tests on, and measure relevant metrics that characterize crucial aspects of a model's OOD behavior. We evaluate several learning algorithms under BEDS-Bench and find that all of them show poor generalization performance under distributional shift in general. Our results highlight the need and the potential to improve robustness of EHR models under distributional shift, and BEDS-Bench provides one way to measure progress towards that goal.","output":"BEDS-Bench: Behavior of EHR-models under Distributional Shift--A Benchmark"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Basic and clinical studies have shown that magnesium sulphate ameliorates lung injury and controls asthma attacks by anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory effects. Both intravenous and inhaled magnesium sulphate have a clinical impact on acute severe asthma by inhibition of airway smooth muscle contraction. Besides, magnesium sulphate can dilate constricted pulmonary arteries and reduce pulmonary artery resistance. However, it may affect systemic arteries when administered intravenously. A large number of patients with covid-19 admitted to the hospital suffer from pulmonary involvement. COVID-19 can cause hypoxia due to the involvement of the respiratory airways and parenchyma along with circulatory impairment, which induce ventilation-perfusion mismatch. This condition may result in hypoxemia and low arterial blood oxygen pressure and saturation presented with some degree of dyspnoea and shortness of breath. Inhaled magnesium sulphate as a smooth muscle relaxant (natural calcium antagonist) can cause both bronchodilator and consequently vasodilator effects (via a direct effect on alveolar arterioles in well-ventilated areas) in the respiratory tract. We aim to investigate if inhaled magnesium sulphate as adjuvant therapy to standard treatment can reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatch in the respiratory tract and subsequently improve arterial oxygen saturation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN: A multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel arms design (1:1 ratio) PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18-80 years hospitalized at Masih Daneshvari Hospital and Shahid Dr. Labbafinejad hospital in Tehran and Shahid Sadoughi Hospital in Yazd will be included if they meet the inclusion criteria of the study.

Patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases including congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmia, heart block, the myocardial injury will be excluded from the study. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants will be randomly divided into two arms. Patients in the intervention arm will be given both standard treatment for COVID-19 (according to the national guideline) and magnesium sulphate (5 cc of a 20% injectable vial or 2 cc of a 50% injectable vial will be diluted by 50 cc distilled water and nebulized via a mask) every eight hours for five days. Patients in the control (comparator) arm will only receive standard treatment for COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES: Improvement of respiratory function and symptoms including arterial blood oxygen saturation, dyspnoea (according to NYHA functional classification), and cough within the first five days of randomization.

The program aims to support staff at non-profit community-based organizations by ensuring policy development, training, practice overdose response exercises, and post-overdose debriefing opportunities are established and implemented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three data sources were used in this descriptive cross-sectional study: FORB site registration data; naloxone administration forms; and a survey that was distributed to FORB sites in February 2019. FORB program site and naloxone administration data from December 1(st), 2016 to December 31(st), 2019 were analyzed using descriptive statistics. A Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess trends over time in naloxone administration event characteristics. Site coordinator survey results are reported to supplement findings from administrative data. RESULTS: As of December 31(st), 2019, FORB was implemented at 613 sites across BC and 1,758 naloxone administration events were reported. The majority (86.3%, n = 1,517) were indicated as overdose reversals. At registration, 43.6% of sites provided housing services, 26.3% offered harm reduction supplies, and 18.6% provided Take Home Naloxone. Refusal to be transported to hospital following overdose events when emergency services were called showed an increasing trend over time. Most respondents (81.3%) reported feeling confident in their ability to respond to the overdose and 59.6% were offered staff debrief. Based on the 89 site survey responses, supports most commonly made available following an overdose were debrief with a fellow staff member (91.0%), debrief with a supervisor (89.9%), and/or counselling services (84.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The uptake of the FORB program has contributed to hundreds of overdose reversals in community settings in BC.

OBJECTIVE: To objectify the reduced EC after COVID-19 and to evaluate for pathologic limitations. METHODS: Thirty patients with subjective limitation of EC performed cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). If objectively limited in EC or deteriorated in oxygen pulse, we offered cardiac stress magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a follow-up CPET. RESULTS: Eighteen male and 12 female patients were included. Limited relative EC was detected in 11/30 (36.7%) patients. Limitation correlated with reduced body weight-indexed peak oxygen (O(2)) uptake (peakV?O(2)/kg) (mean 74.7 (7.1) % vs. 103.6 (14.9) %, p < 0.001). Reduced peakV?O(2)/kg was found in 18/30 (60.0%) patients with limited EC. Patients with reduced EC widely presented an impaired maximum O(2) pulse (75.7% (5.6) vs. 106.8% (13.9), p < 0.001). Abnormal gas exchange was absent in all limited EC patients. Moreover, no patient showed signs of reduced pulmonary perfusion. Using cardiac MRI, diminished biventricular ejection fraction was ruled out in 16 patients as a possible cause for reduced O(2) pulse. Despite noncontrolled training exercises, follow-up CPET did not reveal any exercise improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Deterioration of EC was not associated with ventilatory or pulmonary vascular limitation. Exercise limitation was related to both reduced O(2) pulse and peakV?O(2)/kg, which, however, did not correlate with the initial severity of COVID-19. We hypothesize that impaired microcirculation or limited peripheral O(2) utilization might be causative for prolonged deterioration of EC following acute COVID-19 infection.","output":"Sustained Impairment in Cardiopulmonary Exercise Capacity Testing in Patients after COVID-19: A Single Center Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 pandemic has caused major out-break all around the world.

Two review authors will independently screen citations (title and abstract), extract data (using standardized forms), assess the risk of bias (using Cochrane risks of bias) and quality of data (using GRADE). Homogenous studies will be analyzed using the fixed-effect model of meta-analysis, while a narrative synthesis will be conducted for heterogeneous studies. Discussion: There are no specific physical activity/exercise parameters (frequency, intensity, type of exercise and time- FITT) for interventionists to use when developing high-quality RCT for individuals vulnerable to COVID-19. Therefore, it is important to review the literature to identify and highlight the exercise FITT parameters that increase the immune outcomes and reduce inflammatory biomarkers for proxy conditions that make individuals susceptible to COVID-19. It is also important to identify the specific exercise regimen suitable and beneficial for each proxy group.

The wide spectrum of clinical expression of SARS-CoV-2 illness suggests that individual immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 play a crucial role in determining the clinical course after first infection. Immunological studies have focussed on patients with moderate to severe disease, demonstrating excessive inflammation in tissues and organ damage. In order to understand the basis of the protective immune response in COVID-19, we performed a longitudinal follow-up, flow-cytometric and serological analysis of innate and adaptive immunity in 64 adults with a spectrum of clinical presentations: 28 healthy SARS-CoV-2-negative contacts of COVID-19 cases; 20 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected cases; 8 patients with Mild COVID-19 disease and 8 cases of Severe COVID-19 disease. Our data show that high frequency of NK cells and early and transient increase of specific IgA, IgM and, to a lower extent, IgG are associated to asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. By contrast, monocyte expansion and high and persistent levels of IgA and IgG, produced relatively late in the course of the infection, characterize severe disease. Modest increase of monocytes and different kinetics of antibodies are detected in mild COVID-19. The importance of innate NK cells and the short-lived antibody response of asymptomatic individuals and patients with mild disease suggest that only severe COVID-19 may result in protective memory established by the adaptive immune response.","output":"Spectrum of innate and adaptive immune response to SARS CoV 2 infection across asymptomatic, mild and severe cases; a longitudinal cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect a wide range of domestic and wild mammals. These viruses have a potential and tendency to cross-species barriers and infect humans. Novel human coronavirus 2019-nCoV (hCoV-19) emerged from Wuhan, China, and has caused a global pandemic. Genomic features of SARS-CoV-2 may attribute inter-species transmission and adaptation to a novel host, and therefore is imperative to explicate the evolutionary dynamics of the viral genome and its propensity for differential host selection. We conducted an in silico analysis of all the coding gene sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains (n = 39) originating from a range of non-human mammalian species, including pangolin, bat, dog, cat, tiger, mink, mouse, and the environmental samples such as wastewater, air and surface samples from the door handle and seafood market. Compared to the reference SARS-CoV-2 strain (MN908947; Wuhan-Hu-1), phylogenetic and comparative residue analysis revealed the circulation of three variants, including hCoV-19 virus from humans and two hCoV-19-related precursors from bats and pangolins. A lack of obvious differences as well as a maximum genetic homology among dog-, cat-, tiger-, mink-, mouse-, bat- and pangolin-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences suggested a likely evolution of these strains from a common ancestor. Several residue substitutions were observed in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, concluding a promiscuous nature of the virus for host species where genomic alternations may be required for the adaptation to novel host/s. However, such speculation needs in vitro investigations to unleash the influence of substitutions towards species-jump and disease pathogenesis.

Methods: Kabasura Kudineer is a polyherbal formulation containing 15 herbal drugs mixed in equal quantity. It is an official Siddha formulation, used for phlegmatic fevers and flu-like symptoms. To conduct this study Vero E6 (CL1008), the African monkey kidney epithelial cell line was taken and infected with SARS-CoV-2 viral isolate. The Kabasura Kudineer was added in different concentrations;0.5 mg/mL, 0.25 mg/mL, 0.12 mg/mL, 0.06 mg/mL and 0.03 mg/mL to the infected cells respectively. These cell plates were incubated for 3 days in 5% CO 2 incubator. Remdesivir was used as a positive control. The cells were fixed with formaldehyde, stained with crystal violet and plaques were visualised. Plaques were counted as PFU/ml. Result: Kabasura Kudineer was found to exhibit good antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The highest antiviral activity was 81.5% at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The IC-50 value was found to be 0.2 mg/mL. Conclusion: The antiviral efficacy of Kabasura Kudineer in our study showed reduction in the viral load which supports the results of clinical studies.

However, dengue virus (DENV) molecular biology and pathogenesis are not completely elucidated. New insights on those mechanisms have been facilitated by the development of reverse genetic systems in the past decades. Unfortunately, instability of flavivirus genomes cloned in Escherichia coli has been a major problem in these systems. Here, we describe the development of a complete reverse genetics system, based on the construction of an infectious clone and replicon for a low passage DENV-3 genotype III of a clinical isolate. Both constructs were assembled into a newly designed yeast- E. coli shuttle vector by homologous recombination technique and propagated in yeast to prevent any possible genome instability in E. coli . RNA transcripts derived from the infectious clone are infectious upon transfection into BHK-21 cells even after repeated passages of the plasmid in yeast. Transcript-derived DENV-3 exhibited growth kinetics, focus formation size comparable to original DENV-3 in mosquito C6/36 cell culture. In vitro characterisation of DENV-3 replicon confirmed its identity and ability to replicate transiently in BHK-21 cells.

Marine beaches, as the key zones where terrestrial plastic debris reach coastal waters, are faced with the increasing pressures of human activities. In this study, we explored the distribution, composition, and inventory of plastic debris over seasonal and tidal zones at the Yugang Park Beach (YPB) in Zhanjiang Bay, South China Sea, to provide a baseline for plastic debris on a marine beach. The results showed mean abundance of plastic debris in summer (6.00  2.10 items/m(2)) was significantly greater than that in winter (3.75  2.12 items/m(2)). In addition, the composition of plastic debris ranged in size mainly from 1 to 5 mm and 0.5 to 2.5 cm in winter and summer, respectively. In terms of composition, white plastic debris was the most common (81.1%), and foam was the most abundant (64.4%). Moreover, there was a significant relationship between the abundance of plastic debris and sand grain size fraction (p < 0.05), implying the abundances of microplastic debris were more easily impacted by sand grain size (>2 mm). In total inventory, there were about 1.18  10(5) and 2.95  10(5) items of plastic debris on the YPB in winter and summer, respectively. The tidal variation and human activities are responsible for the plastic debris accumulation.

METHODS: Secondary data analyses of administrative child welfare data from January 2010 to June 2021 from Florida were used. Spline regression equations were calculated for CAN hotline calls, CAN investigations, foster care entries, and foster care exits during three periods: 1) before the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2010 to February 2020); 2) after the pandemic, but before schools reopened (March 2020 to October 2020); and 3) after the pandemic and after schools reopened (November 2020 to June 2021). RESULTS: Prior to the pandemic, there was a non-statistically significant increase of 1.35 hotline calls per 100,000 children per month (p = .478), a statistically significant increase of 0.01 investigations per 100,000 children per month (p < .001), a non-statistically significant increase of 0.01 foster care entries per 100,000 children per month (p = .415), and a statistically significant increase of 0.03 foster care exits per 100,000 children per month (p < .05). Once the pandemic started in March 2020, there were statistically significant decreases of 136.02 hotline calls per 100,000 children per month (p < .001), 102.84 investigations per 100,000 children per month (p < .001), 6.32 foster care entries per 100,000 children per month (p < .001) and 5.75 foster care exits per 100,000 children per month (p < .01). Once all schools reopened for in-person learning in November 2020, there continued to be statistically significant decreases of 47.86 hotline calls per 100,000 children per month (p < .05), 6.38 foster care entries per 100,000 children per month (p < .001) and 6.53 foster care exits per 100,000 children per month (p < .001). This suggests that there were an estimated 34,374 fewer CAN hotline calls, 2338 children who did not enter foster care, and 2587 youth residing in foster care (YRFC) whose foster care exits were delayed. The delay in foster care exits suggests that YRFC in Florida had stayed a combined cumulative equivalent of 477.1 years longer in care. CONCLUSION: With the COVID-19 variants like Omicron continuing to wreak havoc in Florida, there will be a continued trend of decreasing CAN hotline calls, foster care entries and foster care exits even with in-person learning in all Florida schools.

Prior studies have established hematologic cancers as a risk factor associated with particularly poor outcomes from COVID-19. To our knowledge, no studies have established a beneficial role for anti-COVID-19 interventions in this at-risk population. Convalescent plasma therapy may benefit immunocompromised individuals with COVID-19, including those with hematologic cancers. Objective: To evaluate the association of convalescent plasma treatment with 30-day mortality in hospitalized adults with hematologic cancers and COVID-19 from a multi-institutional cohort. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study using data from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium registry with propensity score matching evaluated patients with hematologic cancers who were hospitalized for COVID-19. Data were collected between March 17, 2020, and January 21, 2021. Exposures: Convalescent plasma treatment at any time during hospitalization. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounders was performed. Hazard ratios (HRs) are reported with 95% CIs. Secondary subgroup analyses were conducted on patients with severe COVID-19 who required mechanical ventilatory support and/or intensive care unit admission. Results: A total of 966 individuals (mean [SD] age, 65 [15] years; 539 [55.8%] male) were evaluated in this study; 143 convalescent plasma recipients were compared with 823 untreated control patients. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, convalescent plasma treatment was associated with improved 30-day mortality (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.37-0.97). This association remained significant after propensity score matching (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29-0.92). Among the 338 patients admitted to the intensive care unit, mortality was significantly lower in convalescent plasma recipients compared with nonrecipients (HR for propensity score-matched comparison, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20-0.80). Among the 227 patients who required mechanical ventilatory support, mortality was significantly lower in convalescent plasma recipients compared with nonrecipients (HR for propensity score-matched comparison, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.14-0.72).

IFN-s act through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway to exert antiviral effects related to preventing and curing an infection. Although the immune function of IFN-s in virus invasion has been described, the molecular mechanism of IFNLR1 in that process is unclear. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of IFNLR1 in the pathogenesis and treatment of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). METHODS: The effects of IFNLR1 on the proliferation of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) during PRRSV infection were investigated using interference and overexpression methods. RESULTS: In this study, the expressions of the IFNLR1 gene in the liver, large intestine, small intestine, kidney, and lung tissues of Dapulian pigs were significantly higher than those in Landrace pigs. It was determined that porcine IFNLR1 overexpression suppresses PRRSV replication. The qRT-PCR results revealed that overexpression of IFNLR1 upregulated antiviral and IFN-stimulated genes. IFNLR1 overexpression inhibits the proliferation of PAMs and upregulation of p-STAT1. By contrast, knockdown of IFNLR1 expression promotes PAMs proliferation. The G0/G1 phase proportion in IFNLR1-overexpressing cells increased, and the opposite change was observed in IFNLR1-underexpressing cells. After inhibition of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, the G2/M phase proportion in the IFNLR1-overexpressing cells showed a significant increasing trend. In conclusion, overexpression of IFNLR1 induces activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of PAMs infected with PRRSV.

We followed a two-step process to achieve the objectives of this study. First, we conducted a systematic review of existing gene expression datasets to identify those with integrated genomic and environmental factors. This enabled us to curate a comprehensive genomic-environmental database for four key environmental factors (smoking, diet, infections and toxic chemicals) associated with various autoimmune and chronic conditions. Second, we developed a statistical analysis package that allows users to interrogate the relationships between differentially expressed genes and environmental factors under different disease conditions. Results The initial database search run on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) retrieved a total of 90,018 articles. After title and abstract screening against pre-set criteria, a total of 186 studies were selected. From those, 243 individual sets of genes, or gene modules, were obtained. We then curated a database containing four environmental factors, namely cigarette smoking, diet, infections and toxic chemicals, along with a total of 25789 genes that had an association with one or more of these gene modules. In six case studies, the database and statistical analysis package were then tested with lists of differentially expressed genes obtained from the published literature related to type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, small cell lung cancer, COVID-19, cobalt exposure and smoking.

However, application in the real-world setting, including feasibility of and adherence to these regimens, may be limited due to varying patient-, treatment-, and disease-related factors. Furthermore, approximately 40% of real-world MM patients do not meet the criteria for phase 3 studies on which approvals are based, resulting in a lack of representative phase 3 data for these patients. Therefore, treatment decisions must be tailored based on additional considerations beyond clinical trial efficacy and safety, such as treatment feasibility (including frequency of clinic/hospital attendance), tolerability, effects on quality of life (QoL), and impact of comorbidities. There are multiple factors of importance to real-world MM patients, including disease symptoms, treatment burden and toxicities, ability to participate in daily activities, financial burden, access to treatment and treatment centers, and convenience of treatment. All of these factors are drivers of QoL and treatment satisfaction/compliance. Importantly, given the heterogeneity of MM, individual patients may have different perspectives regarding the most relevant considerations and goals of their treatment. Patient perspectives/goals may also change as they move through their treatment course. Thus, the efficacy of treatment means different things to different patients, and treatment decision-making in the context of personalized medicine must be guided by an individuals composite definition of what constitutes the best treatment choice.

Overall, patients with inflammatory arthritis do not seem to be at a higher risk for infection or a severe course of COVID-19. Risk for critical COVID-19 in patients with systemic inflammatory diseases such as SLE or vasculitis might be increased, but this needs further confirmation. Furthermore, we summarize the data on DMARDs used to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection and hyperinflammation.","output":"Rheumatic Musculoskeletal Diseases and COVID-19 A Review of the First 6 Months of the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Educational institutions currently favor the adoption and use of modern information and communication technology for teaching and learning As a result, many learning management systems have been developed over recent years and established in education systems This paper reports the results of a study that examines the usability level of the Blackboard system from the perspectives of the academic members of Umm Al-Qura University in Saudi Arabia by using two of the most commonly used measures of perceived usability, namely, SUS and CSUQ It also examines the association between these measures, and the effect of faculty demographics attributes on their scores The results of the study revealed that the usability of Blackboard at the current institution is inadequate and needs to be further enhanced It also showed that SUS and CSUQ questionnaires correlated highly and largely appear to be measuring the same thing, presumably, perceived usability The results also indicated the significant effect of Blackboard frequency of use on both SUS and CSUQ scores (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Assessing academics' perceptions of blackboard usability using sus and csuq: A case study during the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak represents a challenge for the diagnostic laboratories responsible for developing test kits to identify those infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Currently, there is a wide variety of tests available with different detection methodologies, levels of specificity and sensitivity, detection time, and with an extensive range of prices. This review therefore aimed to conduct a patent search in relation to tests for the detection of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. The greatest number of patents identified in the search were registered between 2003 and 2011, being mainly deposited by China, the Republic of Korea, and the United States. Most of the patents used the existing RT-PCR, ELISA, and isothermal amplification methods to develop simple, sensitive, precise, easy to use, low-cost tests that reduced false-negative or false-positive results. The findings of this patent search show that an increasing number of materials and diagnostic tests for the coronavirus are being produced to identify infected individuals and combat the growth of the current pandemic; however, there is still a question in relation to the reliability of the results of these tests.","output":"Trends in MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Diagnosis Strategies: A Patent Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemiological data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 are more transmissible and infections are associated with a higher mortality than non-VOC virus infections.

Studies report an increase in perinatal parental distress as well as symptoms of anxiety or depression in children during the pandemic. Currently, little is known about the impact of the pandemic on infants and their development. Infant regulatory problems (RPs) have been identified as early indicators of child socio-emotional development, strongly associated with maternal mental health and the early parentCinfant interaction. Our study investigates whether early parenthood under COVID-19 is associated with more maternal depressive symptoms and with a perception of their infants as having more RPs regarding crying/fussing, sleeping, or eating, compared to mothers assessed before the pandemic. METHODS: As part of a longitudinal study, 65 women who had given birth during the first nationwide disease control restrictions in Northern Germany, were surveyed at 7 months postpartum and compared to 97 women assessed before the pandemic. RPs and on maternal depressive symptoms were assessed by maternal report. Number of previous children, infant negative emotionality, and perceived social support were assessed as control variables. RESULTS: Compared to the control cohort, infants born during the COVID-19 pandemic and those of mothers with higher depressive symptoms were perceived as having more sleeping and crying, but not more eating problems. Regression-based analyses showed no additional moderating effect of parenthood under COVID-19 on the association of depressive symptoms with RPs. Infant negative emotionality was positively, and number of previous children was negatively associated with RPs. LIMITATIONS: Due to the small sample size and cross-sectional assessment, the possibility for more complex multivariate analysis was limited. The use of parent-report questionnaires to assess infant RPs can support but not replace clinical diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic conditions affecting everyday life may have a long-term influence on impaired infant self- and maternal co-regulation and on maternal mental health. This should be addressed in peripartum and pediatric care. Qualitative and longitudinal studies focusing on long-term parental and infant outcomes under ongoing pandemic conditions are encouraged.","output":"Born Under COVID-19 Pandemic Conditions: Infant Regulatory Problems and Maternal Mental Health at 7 Months Postpartum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The low-pressure system developed in the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea during March-October, often forms tropical cyclones, depending upon the intensity widespread destruction occurs in the areas where landfall takes place along the Indian coastal region.

METHODS: A random population-based telephone survey interviewed income-earning adults in the Hong Kong general population during April 21C28, 2020 (n = 200). RESULTS: Mild to severe depression (according to PHQ-9) was reported by 12% of the participants. The prevalence of WFHS categories was 14% for 3C7 days and 13% for  8 days (past 2 weeks). The multivariable regression analysis showed that, social isolation ( = 0.36; p < 0.001), relaxation feeling in daily life ( = ? 0.22; p = 0.002), and WFHS  8 days ( = 0.15; p = 0.027), but not perceived huge inconvenience and improved family relationship, were associated with depressive symptoms. Statistically significant interaction effects were found. Some positive experiences buffered the potential harms of some negative experiences of social distancing on depressive symptoms; WFHS  8 days significantly moderated the risk/protective effects of social isolation, improved family relationship, and relaxation feeling on depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Social distancing is double-edged. Positive experiences should be maximized while negative experiences be minimized, as both were directly and interactively associated with depression. Intensive but not mild to moderate (< 80%) WFHS may impact depressive symptoms negatively via its direct association with depression; it also moderated the associations between positive/negative experiences due to social distancing and depression. Further research is required to discern the inter-relationships among WFHS, positive/negative experiences of social distancing, and depression to better cope with the stressful pandemic.

Investment in patient safety has focused mainly on learning from errors, though this has yet to be proved to reduce error rates. The Resilient Health Care approach advocates learning from everyday practices. Video reflexive ethnography (VRE) is an innovative methodology used to capture everyday practices, reflect on and thereby improve these. This study set out to explore the use of VRIIIs by utilising the VRE methodology. METHODS: This study was conducted in a Vascular Surgery Unit. VRE methodology was used to collect qualitative data that involved videoing healthcare practitioners caring for patients treated with VRIII and discussing the resulting clips with participants in reflexive meetings. Transcripts of these were subjected to thematic analysis. Quantitative data (e.g. blood glucose measurements) were collected from electronic patient records in order to contextualise the outcomes of the video-observed tasks. RESULTS: The use of VRE in conjunction with quantitative data revealed that context-dependent adaptations (seeking verbal orders to treat hypoglycaemia) and standardised practices (using VRIII guidelines) were strategies used in everyday work. Reflexive meetings highlighted the challenges faced while using VRIII, which were mainly related to lack of clinical knowledge, e.g. prescribing/continuing long-acting insulin analogues alongside the VRIII, and problems with organisational infrastructure, i.e. the wireless blood glucose meter results sometimes not updating on the electronic system. Reflexive meetings also enabled participants to share the meanings of the reality surrounding them and encouraged them to suggest solutions tailored to their work, for example face-to-face, VRIII-focused training. CONCLUSIONS: VRE deepened understanding of VRIII by shedding light on its essential tasks and the challenges and adaptations entailed by its use. Future research might focus on collecting data across various units and hospitals to develop a full picture of the use of VRIIIs.

Virtual machines' consolidation using live migration maximizes the hosts' and the reduction of energy consumption. An increase in the host's virtual machines in the consolidation process and the dynamic workload of the virtual machines may cause the overloading in the hosts. One approach to overcome this problem is reducing the hosts' virtual machines. One crucial issue to improve the quality of the consolidation process's quality is determining the best virtual machine for the migration process. Although the selection process has lower computational complexity than other challenges (like placement and overload prediction) in the consolidation process, this issue has received less attention. This article aims to present an efficient algorithm for the selection process. We first considered five main criteria for the selection process: migration time, migration risk, virtual machine connectivity, releasable resources, and penalty for SLA violation. Then, we propose an algorithm based on analytic hierarchy process multi\\\\criteria decision\\\\making technique. Next, to determine the weight of the proposed criteria, we simulate thousands of virtual machines of the PlanetLab workloads. These weights are tunable based on the data center preferences. The results of the suggested approach results show 23% reduction in the hosts' energy consumption, 49% reduction in the number of migrations, and 18% reduction in the SLA violation compared with other techniques. So, using the proposed method may significantly reduce the overall cost of the data centers.","output":"A flexible approach for virtual machine selection in cloud data centers with AHP: Practice & Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective We herein report the initial impact of a national BNT162b2 rollout on SARS-CoV-2 infections in Qatar.

This contribution presents a novel method based on a hierarchical intelligent system, that analyzes the application of deep learning models to detect and classify patients with COVID-19 using both X-ray and chest computed tomography (CT). The methodology was divided into three phases, the first being the detection of whether or not a patient suffers from COVID-19, the second step being the evaluation of the percentage of infection of this disease and the final phase is to classify the patients according to their severity. Stratification of patients suffering from COVID-19 according to their severity using automatic systems based on machine learning on medical images (especially X-ray and CT of the lungs) provides a powerful tool to help medical experts in decision making. In this article, a new contribution is made to a stratification system with three severity levels (mild, moderate and severe) using a novel histogram database (which defines how the infection is in the different CT slices for a patient suffering from COVID-19). The first two phases use CNN Densenet-161 pre-trained models, and the last uses SVM with LDA supervised learning algorithms as classification models.

METHODS: Case-control study conducted March 15 to June 15, 2020. Cases were infants born to mothers with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection at delivery. The infant of non COVID-19 mother born before and after each case were selected as controls. RESULTS: Of 695 deliveries, 62 (8.9%) infants were born to COVID-19 mothers; 124 controls were selected. Among cases, 18.3% were preterm compared to 8.1% in controls (p=0.04). In preterm cases, birth weight was not significantly different between groups. However, there was a significantly higher proportion of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions, need for respiratory support, suspected sepsis, hyperbilirubinemia, feeding intolerance and longer length of stay (LOS) in preterm cases. Among term cases, birth weight and adverse outcomes were not significantly different between cases and controls except for more feeding intolerance in cases. All infants born to COVID-19 mothers were COVID-19 negative at 24 and 48 h of life. No infants expired during birth hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly, more infants of COVID-19 mothers were premature compared to controls. Preterm cases were more likely to have adverse outcomes despite having similar birth weight and gestational age. These differences were not seen among full term infants.

High dose rehabilitation can result in clinically significant improvements in function even years after the incident, however there is still high variability in patient responsiveness to such interventions that cannot be explained by age, sex or time since stroke. This retrospective study investigated whether prescription of certain CNS-acting drug classes- GABA agonists, antiepileptics and antidepressants- influenced outcomes on the 3 week intensive Queen Square Upper-Limb (QSUL) programme. For 277 stroke or brain injury patients upper-limb impairment and activity was assessed at admission to the programme and at 6 months post-discharge, using the upper limb component of the Fugl-Meyer (FM), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), and Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory (CAHAI). Drug prescriptions were obtained from primary care physicians at referral. Specification curve analysis (SCA) was used to protect against selective reporting results and add robustness to the conclusions of this retrospective study. GABA agonist prescription had a significant negative effect on upper-limb scores at admission but did not impact programme-induced improvements. There were no effects of antiepileptic drug prescriptions on either admission scores, or improvement during the programme. Antidepressant prescriptions did not impact admission scores but resulted in reduced improvement in upper-limb function, even when accounting for anxiety and depression scores. These results demonstrate that, when prescribed appropriately, GABA agonists do not impair patient's ability to benefit from rehabilitation programmes. Patients prescribed antidepressants, however, performed poorer than expected on the QSUL rehabilitation programme. While the reasons for this effect are unclear, identifying these patients prior to admission may allow for better accommodation of differences in their rehabilitation needs.","output":"The influence of common, CNS-acting, drug prescriptions on outcomes from an intensive upper-limb rehabilitation program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the Black Death, the plague that spread like wildfire through Europe and Asia in the mid-fourteenth century and which decimated the population, the Christian world blamed its minority C Jews C and massacred them;the Muslim world did better and tolerated the Jews living amongst them HIV/AIDS dominated the last two decades of the 20th Century The victims of AIDS were targeted and denied their rights Eventually those with HIV were tolerated But, does anyone really want to be tolerated?

A cost effective and efficient diagnostic tool as near to the point of care (PoC) as possible would be a game changer in current testing. We tested reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a method which can produce results in under 30 minutes, alongside standard methods in a real-life clinical setting. Methods: This service improvement project piloted a research RT-LAMP method on nasal and pharyngeal swabs on 21 residents in an NHS Category 1 care home, with two index COVID-19 cases, and compared it to multiplex tandem reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of a single RT-LAMP swab compared to RT-PCR, as per STARD guidelines. We also recorded vital signs of patients to correlate clinical and laboratory information. Findings: The novel method accurately detected 8/10 PCR positive cases and identified a further 3 positive cases. Eight further cases were negative using both methods. Using repeated RT-PCR as a 'gold standard', the sensitivity and specificity of the novel test were 80% and 73% respectively. Positive predictive value (PPV) was 73% and negative predictive value (NPV) was 83%. We also observed hypothermia to be a significant early clinical sign in a number of COVID-19 patients in this setting. Interpretation: RT-LAMP testing for SARS-CoV-2 was found to be promising, fast, easy to use and to work equivalently to RT-PCR methods. Definitive studies to evaluate this method in larger cohorts are underway. RT-LAMP has the potential to transform COVID-19 detection, bringing rapid and accurate testing to the point of care.

Both drugs may increase risk of lethal arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation. Methods and Results We analyzed a case series of COVID-19-positive/suspected patients admitted between February 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020, who were treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, or a combination of both drugs. We evaluated baseline and postmedication QT interval (corrected QT interval [QTc]; Bazett) using 12-lead ECGs. Critical QTc prolongation was defined as follows: (1) maximum QTc &#8805;500 ms (if QRS <120 ms) or QTc &#8805;550 ms (if QRS &#8805;120 ms) and (2) QTc increase of &#8805;60 ms. Tisdale score and Elixhauser comorbidity index were calculated. Of 490 COVID-19-positive/suspected patients, 314 (64%) received either/both drugs and 98 (73 COVID-19 positive and 25 suspected) met study criteria (age, 6217 years; 61% men). Azithromycin was prescribed in 28%, hydroxychloroquine in 10%, and both in 62%. Baseline mean QTc was 44829 ms and increased to 45936 ms (P=0.005) with medications. Significant prolongation was observed only in men (1843 ms versus -0.228 ms in women; P=0.02). A total of 12% of patients reached critical QTc prolongation. Changes in QTc were highest with the combination compared with either drug, with much greater prolongation with combination versus azithromycin (1739 ms versus 0.540 ms; P=0.07). No patients manifested torsades de pointes. Conclusions Overall, 12% of patients manifested critical QTc prolongation, and the combination caused greater prolongation than either drug alone.

However, its full potential remains unclear and clinical comparative studies hardly exist. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate our experience with CALS for performing retroperitoneal nephrectomies in children when compared with controls undergoing open surgery in terms of safety, operative time, blood loss, opoid requirements, the duration of hospital stay and complications. CHILDREN AND METHODS Computer-assisted retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy was undertaken in ten consecutive children, mean age at the time of surgery 6.4 (SD  4.5) years, and compared with a retrospectively collected control group of all other children, mean age 3.9 (SD  4.6) years, who underwent the same procedure by conventional open surgery between the years 2005 and 2009. The endpoint of the study was 1 month postoperatively. RESULTS Nephrectomies were performed in all the children and no child was excluded from the study. There was no per-operative complication in any of the groups. The median (range) operative time was 202 (128-325) and 72 (44-160) min for the CALS and open group, respectively. The blood loss was minimal (<20 ml) for all the patients. The postoperative opoid requirements did not differ. The median (range) postoperative hospital stay was 1 (1-4) and 2 (1-7) days for the CALS and the open group, respectively. One complication in the form of an urinoma appeared 5 days after surgery in the CALS group. CONCLUSION Computer-assisted retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy is a safe, feasible and effective procedure in children.

Large-scale health insurance expansions are therefore a central focus of the UHC agenda. Importantly, however, health insurance does not protect against a key dimension of financial risk associated with illness: forgone wage income (due to short-term disability). In this paper, we quantify the economic burden of illness in India attributable--separately--to wage loss and to medical care spending, as well as differences in them across the socio-economic distribution. Methods: We use data from two Indian longitudinal household surveys: (i) the Village Dynamics in South Asia (VDSA) survey (1,350 households surveyed every month for 60 months between 2010 and 2015) and (ii) the Indian Human Development Survey (IHDS) (more than 40,000 households surveyed in 2005 and again in 2011). The VDSA allows us to study the economic dynamics of illness using high-frequency observations, and the IHDS allows us to confirm our findings in a nationally-representative sample. Both contain individual- and household-level information about illness, wage income, and medical spending over time. We use longitudinal variation in illness to estimate regression models of economic burden separately for wage loss and medical care spending across the socio-economic distribution. Our regression models include a series of fixed effects that control for differences in time-invariant household (or individual) characteristics and time-varying factors common across households. Findings: 1,184 households (88%) in the VDSA sample reported an episode of illness over 60 months, and 15770 households (40%) in the IHDS reported an illness in the preceding year. In the VDSA sample, on average, a day of illness was associated with a reduction in monthly per capita wage income of Rs 77 [95% CI -99 to -57] and an increase in monthly per capita medical spending of Rs 126 [95% CI 110-142]. Variation across the socio-economic distribution was substantial. Among the poorest households, wage loss due to illness is roughly 15% of total household spending--nearly three times greater than medical spending. Alternatively, among the most affluent households, wage loss is less than 5% of total household spending--and only one-third of medical spending. Put differently, wage loss accounts for more than 80% of the total economic burden of illness among the poorest households, but only about 20% of the economic burden of illness among the most affluent. Estimates from the IHDS sample show that this socio-economic gradient is present in the Indian population generally. Interpretation: Wage loss accounts for a substantial share of the total economic burden of illness in India--and disproportionately so among the poorest households. If Universal Health Coverage truly aims to protect households against the financial risk of illness--particularly poor households, the inclusion of wage loss insurance or another illness-related income replacement benefit is needed.","output":"Illness and Wage Loss: Longitudinal Evidence from India (and Implications for the Universal Health Coverage Agenda)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, I present the Hindi version of the COVID Stress Scale (Taylor et al., 2020).

Herein, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets are used to prepare modified polycotton fabrics having excellent antibacterial activity and photothermal properties. Upon sunlight irradiation, the nanosheet-modified fabrics rapidly increased the surface temperature to a??77 C, making them ideal for sunlight-mediated self-disinfection. Complete self-disinfection of the nanosheet-modified fabric was achieved within 3 min of irradiation, making the fabrics favorably reusable upon self-disinfection. The nanosheet-modified fabrics maintained the antibacterial efficiency even after 60 washing cycles. Furthermore, the particle filtration efficiency of three-layered surgical masks was found to be significantly improved through incorporation of the MoS2-modified fabric as an additional layer of protective clothing, without compromising the breathability of the masks. The repurposed surgical masks could filter out around 97% of 200 nm particles and 96% of 100 nm particles, thus making them potentially useful for preventing the spread of coronaviruses (120 nm) by trapping them along with antibacterial protection against other airborne pathogens.","output":"Reusable MoS2-Modified Antibacterial Fabrics with Photothermal Disinfection Properties for Repurposing of Personal Protective Masks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the case of a 61-year old female with a 20-year history of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who developed acute hepatitis.

The risk to pedestrians is high in developing nations like India since priorities are not respected by road users. Moreover, the non-yielding vehicular traffic puts pedestrians at further risk. While crossing the road, pedestrians are clear about rejecting small gaps and accepting the large gaps, however, they experience a dilemma between the small and large gaps. METHOD This study attempts to model the dilemma zone for pedestrians intending to cross the high-speed roads (posted speed limit of 60 km/h). The field data were collected using high-definition video cameras at two uncontrolled midblock crossings, each in the cities of Mumbai and Kolhapur, located in the southwestern part of India. The variations in the spatial gap acceptance behavior were analyzed for 1,107 pedestrian observations using binary logit models. RESULTS The findings revealed that the length and the distribution of the dilemma zone were significantly affected by the speed of the approaching vehicle and the distance from it. Moreover, the influence of vehicle type (truck, car, or two-wheeler), pedestrian type (walking alone or in a group), crossing speed, and waiting time also influenced pedestrians' gap acceptance behavior. Interestingly, pedestrians' gender did not play a significant role in their road crossing decisions. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the study identified the dilemma zone boundaries that will help pedestrians to judge the safe gaps while crossing, and in turn, reduce the probability of pedestrian-vehicle crashes.

It became a major public health challenge for China, and evolved into a global pandemic in March 2020. For radiation oncology departments, the COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique challenge for disease protection and prevention for both patients and staff, owing to the weakened immune systems of cancer patients and the need to deliver timely and uninterrupted radiotherapy. At the Hubei Cancer Hospital, the only hospital in Wuhan that specializes in oncology, we organized an emergency infection control team to lead special efforts to combat COVID-19 during this challenging time. Under its lead, the following measures were implemented in the radiation oncology department: the radiotherapy clinic was divided into different infection control zones with varying levels of protection; special staff and patient infection control training sessions were conducted and appropriate measures deployed; daily symptom testing criteria were implemented for patients undergoing treatment; special rotating schedules and infection control methods were implemented for various staff members such as medical physicists/dosimetrists and radiation therapists; modified radiotherapy workflow and specialized treatment area cleaning and disinfection policies and procedures were designed and executed; and special medical waste disposal methods were implemented. We began treating patients using this new COVID-19 radiotherapy treatment workflow and infection control measures on January 30, 2020. During more than one and a half months of uninterrupted radiation oncology clinical operation through the worst of the Wuhan outbreak, no known COVID-19 infection occurred at our radiotherapy center to our patients or employees.

The live attenuated vaccine 9R is able to successfully protect chickens older than six weeks by activating a robust cell-mediated immune response, but its safety and efficacy in young chickens remains controversial. An inactivated SG vaccine is being used as an alternative, but because of its low cellular immune response, it cannot be used as a replacement for live attenuated 9R vaccine. In this study, we employed gamma irradiation instead of formalin as an inactivation method to increase the efficacy of the inactivated SG vaccine. Humoral, cellular, and protective immune responses were compared in both mouse and chicken models. The radiation-inactivated SG vaccine (r-SG) induced production of significantly higher levels of IgG2b and IgG3 antibodies than the formalin-inactivated vaccine (f-SG), and provided a homogeneous functional antibody response against group D, but not group B Salmonella. Moreover, we found that r-SG vaccination could provide a higher protective immune response than f-SG by inducing higher Th17 activation. These results indicate that r-SG can provide a protective immune response similar to the live attenuated 9R vaccine by activating a higher humoral immunity and a lower, but still protective, cellular immune response. Therefore, we expect that the radiation inactivation method might substitute for the 9R vaccine with little or no side effects in chickens younger than six weeks.","output":"Radiation-Inactivated S. gallinarum Vaccine Provides a High Protective Immune Response by Activating Both Humoral and Cellular Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the ways to overcome the sheer devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic is to get vaccinated. However, vaccine hesitancy could be a significant barrier. The main purposes of the current study are to examine the impact of four types of theory-driven messages on COVID-19 vaccination intention and to understand the moderating role of partisan media use and vaccination attitudes. The study used a between-subject randomized online experiment with four conditions. The manipulation messages were presented as screenshots from the CDCs Facebook page. The total number of participants were 387 (female 43%, mean age 37 years). The participants were from the U.S. and older than 18 years. The findings show that loss vs. gain message frames did not have any impact on COVID-19 vaccine intention. The moderating effects of conservative media and attitudes show that in general, those who consumed lower conservative media and held positive attitudes were higher on vaccine intention, and individual vs. collective frames did not have a strong impact. However, among those participants who scored high on conservative media use, and held negative vaccination attitudes, the individual frame had a higher impact on vaccine intention. The current study experimentally tested the intertwined relationships among message frames, partisan media use, and attitudes on vaccine intention.

RESULTS More cycles of immunochemotherapy and higher cumulative doses of RTX and doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome conferred a high risk of ILD. Compared to the baseline, patients had a significantly lower white blood cell count (WBC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), and albumin level (4.95109 vs. 6.32109, 0.71109 vs. 1.61109, 34.1 vs. 40.4 g/L; P<0.05), and higher C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (-HBDH), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (15.36 vs. 7.00 mg/L, 293.0 vs. 163.1 U/L, 361.8 vs. 231.1 U/L; P<0.05) levels at ILD onset. Further, a positive correlation was found between early glucocorticosteroid intervention and the good prognostication of ILD. In addition, an analysis of the prognoses of 2 cases of patients with pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) infection indicated that after 3 cycles of treatment, patients, especially unfit patients or those who have received ILD glucocorticoid treatment, may need to receive trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) to prevent PCP.

The women were contacted by telephone and asked whether they would like to participate in the study. If they agreed, they were then emailed a questionnaire about their social behaviour and sexual activity during the pandemic, according to their cohabiting status, i.e., whether they were continuing to use their hormonal contraception and whether they had had an unplanned pregnancy. RESULTS The questionnaire was completed by 175 (81.8%) women who were using short-acting reversible contraception (SARC) and by 90 (87.4%) women who were using long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). All married and cohabiting women were continuing to use their contraceptive method. None had had an unplanned pregnancy.

The standard treatment for neonatal hypotension includes volume expanders and vasopressors. Recent evidence supports the use of glucocorticoids for the primary or rescue treatment of neonatal hypotension associated with impaired adrenal function. However, inconsistency regarding the prescribed dosing regimen to provide the best balance between efficacy and safety in this vulnerable population remains an area of concern. METHODS We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate low-dosing compared with high-dosing regimens of hydrocortisone for the treatment of hypotension in critically ill term, preterm and very low birth weight neonates. Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science will be searched from inception to November 2021. Study screening and selection will be completed as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline. Our primary outcomes will be (1) an improvement in end-organ perfusion, defined as an increase in blood pressure along with an increase in urine output or a reduction in serum lactate and (2) mortality prior to discharge.

Age-standardized death rates were calculated for rankings 10 leading CODs using WHO 2000 age structure as standard. RESULTS: The first leading COD was cancer in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan from 1998 to 2018 based on government list; nevertheless, became stroke based on WHO list, and was stroke and ischemic heart disease based on IHME list. In the WHO and IHME lists, cancer is categorized based on cancer site. The number of cancer sites included in the 10 leading CODs in 2018 was 4, 4, and 3 in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, respectively according to the WHO list and was 4, 4, and 2, respectively according to IHME list.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial with a wait-list controlled design to evaluate the effects of a home-based program with health coaching on breathlessness in subjects with moderate to severe COPD unable to attend the regular pulmonary rehabilitation program. The 8-week intervention consisted of video-guided exercises to be done 6 times a week and captured with a computer tablet. Health coaching was done weekly over the telephone to review subject activity and symptoms and to provide an opportunity for the subject to define their weekly goals. The primary outcomes were uptake, adherence, and Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) Dyspnea Domain. Secondary outcomes were self-management abilities and CRQ Emotions-Mastery-Fatigue. RESULTS: 154 subjects with moderate to severe COPD were randomized. Subject adherence was 86% to the proposed 6-times a week exercise routine. There (P = .062) was no significant difference in breathlessness (CRQ dyspnea). There was a significant improvement in self-management abilities (P < .001). The results of the qualitative interviews showed high levels of acceptability of the program. CONCLUSIONS: The tested home-based rehabilitation program with health coaching was feasible, highly acceptable, showed a high degree of adherence, and improved self-management abilities. This study offers seminal information for home-based rehabilitation programs to design alternative options of rehabilitation to individuals with COPD that cannot attend to the well-established center-based pulmonary rehabilitation.

The first, which involved a matching-to-sample paradigm, tested Caucasian subjects with either masked or unmasked faces using Caucasian and Asian samples. The participants exhibited the best performance in recognizing an unmasked face condition and the poorest when asked to recognize a masked face that they had seen earlier without a mask. Accuracy was also poorer for Asian faces than Caucasian faces. The second experiment presented Asian or Caucasian faces having different emotional expressions, with and without masks. The results for this task, which involved identifying which emotional expression the participants had seen on the presented face, indicated that emotion recognition performance decreased for faces portrayed with masks. The emotional expressions ranged from the most accurately to least accurately recognized as follows: happy, neutral, disgusted, and fearful. Emotion recognition performance was poorer for Asian stimuli compared to Caucasian. Experiment 3 used the same participants and stimuli and asked participants to indicate the social distance they would prefer to observe with each pictured person. The participants preferred a wider social distance with unmasked faces compared to masked faces. Social distance also varied by the portrayed emotion: ranging from farther to closer as follows: disgusted, fearful, neutral, and happy. Race was also a factor;participants preferred wider social distance for Asian compared to Caucasian faces. Altogether, our findings indicated that during the COVID-19 pandemic face perception and social distance were affected by mask use, ORE.","output":"Effects of Mask Use and Race on Face Perception, Emotion Recognition, and Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an advisory for regular and thorough cleaning of hands besides other measures such as social distancing and self-isolation.

INTRODUCTION: During COVID-19 pandemic reports increased of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in prone and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), mostly describing four and five chamber apical views, and inferior vena cava (IVC) by lateral IVC window (from right side of the patient). PURPOSE: Evaluate quality of images obtained with protocol of apical-subcostal TTE in patients with IMV and prone position. METHODS: Prospective study, between August and December 2020, in adults who required prone position during IMV. After placing the patient in the prone position, left arm was extended overhead, and a pillow was placed only under the left hemithorax to elevate and facilitate the apical window and space below the patient for subcostal window. Operator stands on the left side of the patient and takes images with the transducer in your right hand, starting with apical window and subsequently subcostal window. Apical views were apical four, two and three-chambers, to obtain function parameter of right and left ventricle (LV), evaluation of aortic valve, mitral and tricuspid valve. Subcostal views were four cardiac chambers and IVC, to obtain qualitative ventricle function, presence of pericardial effusion, and volume status and estimation of pulmonary pressure (together to peak systolic tricuspid pressure gradient from apical views). The images were acquired by cardiologist, then were saved, and finally evaluated by two echocardiography cardiologist experts. RESULTS: 16 ETTs were performed. Male gender and obesity predominate. Positive end-expiratory pressure average was 10.8 cm of water. One patient cannot be assessed by absence of acoustic window and the rest (n = 15) were analyzed with experts. It was achieved a four-chamber apical view in 100% (n = 15), a two-chambers apical view in 60% (n = 9) and a three-chambers apical view in 100% (n = 15). It was possible to assess global function of the LV in 100% (n = 15), LV segmental function in 53% (n = 8), LV outflow tract velocity time integral in 100% (n = 15) and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion in 100% (n = 15). Pulsed wave doppler of mitral valve in 100% (n = 15) and tissue doppler of lateral mitral valve annulus 100% (n = 15). Continuous wave doppler of aortic valve in 100% (n = 15) and tricuspid valve in 93% (n = 14). Subcostal four-chamber 80% (n = 12), presence pericardial effusion 100% (n = 15) and IVC 93% (n = 14). Non-complications associated with obtaining the position. CONCLUSIONS: ETT in the prone position during IMV was possible and interpretable images were achieved. The position described allows assessment by apical and subcostal views at the same time and position of the operator and the patient. In addition, it was a safe technique, and the position was easy to be incorporated by the health team. Limitations were obtaining the two-chamber apical view and evaluation of segmental alterations of the LV. Better validation requires a larger sample.","output":"Transthoracic echocardiogram by protocol apical-subcostal in prone position during invasive mechanical ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: In late 2019, a new coronavirus capable of infecting humans, SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China. The resultant respiratory disease was subsequently named COVID-19. In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, primary care optometry practices only remained open to deliver essential or emergency eye care. This study aimed to characterise the experiences of United Kingdom (UK)-based primary care optometrists during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An email invitation to participate in an online cross-sectional survey was sent to 3000 UK-based, currently practicing members of The College of Optometrists (UK). Responses to the structured questionnaire were analysed using descriptive statistics, including frequencies, means and standard deviations. Frequency analyses were used to evaluate items with multiple responses. Free-text responses were examined using thematic analyses. RESULTS: After data cleaning, a total of 1250 responses remained. Sixty-three percent were female, 70% self-identified as being of white ethnicity and 78% were based in England. During the first national lockdown, over half of all respondents were involved with the provision of remote consultations for emergency/urgent care. The majority felt 'very'/'moderately' comfortable conducting remote consultations, but 66% felt professional liability was increased. Forty percent were involved in the provision of face-to-face consultations. Eye-health and vision-related problems were the most commonly reported patient issues during both remote and face-to-face consultations, while contact-lens related problems were the least. Thematic analysis of the responses showed several challenges adjusting to the pandemic (e.g., working safely), but also some potential benefits (e.g., increased skills). CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide an overview of changes to optometric practice in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results may be used to inform the development of professional guidance and facilitate resource allocation for safe and effective eye care during this and any future pandemics.","output":"The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on working practices of UK primary care optometrists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of 2019, a new coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared on the world scene, which mainly affects the respiratory system, causing pneumonia and multi-organ failure, and, although it starts with common symptoms such as shortness of breath and fever, in about 2-3% of cases it leads to death. Unfortunately, to date, no specific treatments have been found for the cure of this virus and, therefore, it is advisable to implement all possible strategies in order to prevent infection. In this context, it is important to better define the role of all behaviors, in particular nutrition, in order to establish whether these can both prevent infection and improve the outcome of the disease in patients with COVID-19. In the literature, it is widely shown that states of malnutrition, overweight, and obesity negatively affect the immune system, leading to viral infections, and several studies have shown that nutritional interventions can act as immunostimulators, helping to prevent viral infections. Even if several measures, such as the assumption of a specific diet regimen, the use of dietary supplements, and other similar interventions, are promising for the prevention, management, and recovery of COVID-19 patients, it is important to highlight that strong data from randomized clinical trials are needed to support any such assumption.

The difficulty encountered in the management of mass gatherings, especially running in marathons, is how emergency services can deliver treatment in a timely manner. Therefore, for this kind of situation, preparation is the key to success in terms of patient management. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the presentation of cases at a start-finish medical post in an international marathon race set in a rural area. METHODS: All medical record forms were collected from the start-finish medical post of the Khon Kaen International Marathon (KKIM) 2020. The race took place on January 26, 2020. The data were coded by two authors, and in the case of different codes, the final codes were determined by discussion. RESULTS: The total number of participants in this event was 16,489. Participants who used the start-finish medical post numbered 74 (44.8 people per 10,000). More than one-half of patients were male (41; 56.9%), while 31 (34.0%) were female. The age range of the casualties was from 17 to 88 years old. The rate of incidence for those who used this post was 44.8 per 10,000 participants. The greatest density of users was at 3.40 hours after the marathon had started. The common symptoms which were found consisted of 17 soft tissue injuries (23.0%), 15 instances of cramps (20.3%), and 11 musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries (14.9%). Almost all patients were discharged, and only two of the cases were actually admitted to the hospital. No statistical significance between males and females was found (OR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.51-1.3). However, marathon and half-marathon runners had a higher risk of being casualties (OR = 3.49; 95% CI, 1.71-7.15 and OR = 3.51; 95% CI, 1.79-6.88). CONCLUSION: The injuries of most of the patients who used the medical post at a start-finish point were mild. Distances which are longer than 20km increase the risk for getting injured.

[3H]Thymidine incorporation of neuritogenic P2- and encephalitogenic myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T-cell lines declined after 48 h in culture with astrocytes. A similar suppressive effect was observed when T cells were cocultured with thymic APCs and astrocytes. This effect disappeared when astrocytes were separated by a transwell system. After 72 h of culture with astrocytes a mean of 17.5 +/- 12.4% T cells exhibited morphological signs of apoptosis. Apoptosis was identified by light microscopy, and confirmed by electron microscopy, by in situ tailing reaction and by agarose gel electrophoresis. Glucocorticosteroids and oestrogen specifically enhanced T-cell apoptosis within 8 h (69.8 +/- 23.1% and 69 +/- 17.1%, respectively) when added after 72 h to the astrocyte system, but not at earlier time points of T-cell activation or when thymic APCs were used. Glucocorticoid-mediated T-cell apoptosis was inhibited by the steroid-receptor antagonist RU 486. Pregnenolone, lipocortin-1, indomethacin and transforming growth factor-beta did not induce apoptosis in this system. The steroid effect was not associated with CD28, IL-2 receptor, or transferrin-receptor expression, which were equally upregulated on T cells activated by astrocytes or thymic APC as shown by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. We conclude that astrocytes as CNS-specific APC may render T cells susceptible for induction of apoptotic cell death. Some steroid hormones can markedly enhance this process in vitro and may augment an additional effect of a systemic corticosteroid response in vivo during recovery from autoimmune encephalomyelitis.","output":"Antigen presentation by astrocytes primes rat T lymphocytes for apoptotic cell death.

Evidence suggests that obesity and hypovitaminosis D constitute important risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, severity of disease, and poor outcomes. Due to their high prevalence globally, obesity and hypovitaminosis D are considered pandemics. This review presents current epidemiologic and genetic data linking obesity, hypovitaminosis D, and COVID-19, highlighting the importance of the convergence of three pandemics and their impact on public health. We also briefly summarize potential mechanisms that could explain these links. RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiologic data have shown that obesity is an independent risk factor for COVID-19, severe disease and death, and genetic evidence has suggested a causal association between obesity-related traits and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Additionally, obesity is independently associated with hypovitaminosis D, which is highly prevalent in subjects with obesity. Hypovitaminosis D is independently associated with a higher risk for COVID-19, severity, hospitalization, infectious complications, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and poor outcomes. However, genome-wide association studies have not revealed any causal association between vitamin D levels and the risk for COVID-19, while there is no robust evidence for a beneficial role of vitamin D supplementation in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. SUMMARY: In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the epidemiologic impact of obesity and hypovitaminosis D is emphasized. Efforts to increase public awareness and reinforce preventive and therapeutic measures against obesity and hypovitaminosis D are strongly required.","output":"Obesity, Hypovitaminosis D, and COVID-19: the Bermuda Triangle in Public Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From October 15, 2019, to June 12, 2020, Public Health-Seattle & King County conducted phone outreach to individuals referred to the public health department by civil surgeons.

The HSA had least impact on surviving fractions (SFs) of H1N1 and H3N2 (895%, 943%), followed by the Collison nebulizer (822%, 823%). The VMN yielded SFs of 782% and 762%, respectively. Conversely, for HRV-16, the VMN produced higher SFs (8615%). Our findings indicate that although the VMN had the greatest impact on IAV survival, it produced higher aerosol concentrations within the airborne-size range making it more suitable where high aerosol mass production is required. Importance Viral respiratory tract infections cause millions of lost days of work and physician visits globally, accounting for significant morbidity and mortality. Respiratory droplet and droplet nuclei from infected hosts are the substantial potential carriers of such viruses within indoor environments. Laboratory-generated bioaerosols are applied in understanding the transmission and infection of viruses, simulating the physiological aspects of bioaerosol generation in a controlled environment. However, little comparative characterization exists for nebulizers used in infectious disease aerobiology, including Collison nebulizer, Vibrating mesh nebulizer, and hydraulic spray atomizer. This study characterized the physical features of aerosols generated by laboratory nebulizers, and their performance in producing aerosols at a size relevant to airborne transmission used in infectious disease aerobiology. We also determined the impact of nebulization mechanisms of these nebulizers on the viability of human respiratory viruses, including IAV H1N1, IAV H3N2 and HRV-16.","output":"Characterization of the utility of three nebulizers in investigating infectivity of airborne viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei, has brought serious consequences to the lives and mental health of people and has induced psychological stress and affected behavior. Methods: This study used self-designed questionnaires and SPSS to analyze the psychological and behavioral responses of people in different regions during the COVID-19 pandemic and to check for the presence of psychological typhoon eye (PTE) effects. The questionnaires adopted three measurement subscales, namely, the risk cognitive subscale, stress response subscale, and behavioral response subscale, and these were administered online (www.wjx.cn) to investigate the psychological and behavioral conduct of respondents from three areas that have been affected by COVID-19 to varying degrees. Exploratory factor analysis and principal component analysis were conducted to explore the factorial structure of these subscales, and confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to explore the structural validity of the questionnaires. The analysis results were used to build a revised 18-item questionnaire which validity was evaluated via ANOVA and LSD. Results: Results confirm the presence of PTE in the research areas during the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak and highlight some significant differences in the cognition and emotions of the residents in these areas. PTE affected the cognition, emotions, and cognitive and emotional responses of the respondents but did not affect their behavioral responses. Conclusion: The findings underscore the urgency of providing sustainable mental health care services across different areas during the COVID-19 outbreak. The residents of those areas worst hit by the pandemic, who may not have taken the situation seriously, require emotional guidance the most. Meanwhile, the residents of other areas, who showed the most negative psychological reactions to the pandemic, require a sense of security, a timely disconnection from negative information, an accurate cognition of stress, and an acceptance of self-responses.","output":"Psychological Typhoon Eye Effect During the COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: One of the most prominent and concerning complications associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is venous and arterial thromboembolisms. The aim of the present study was to delineate the prevalence of thromboembolic events and the current status of prophylactic anticoagulation therapy in patients with COVID-19 in Japan. METHODS: Between February 1 and August 31, 2020, we performed a dual-center, retrospective cohort study based on data obtained from the medical charts of COVID-19 patients admitted to healthcare facilities in Japan. The primary outcome was any thromboembolic event including pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and other systemic thromboemboli. RESULTS: During the study period, we extracted 628 consecutive patients admitted for COVID-19. Prophylactic anticoagulant therapy was administered in 63 (10%) patients of whom 20 (31.7%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Thromboembolic events occurred in 18 (2.9%) patients (14.3% of patients in ICU and 2.2% of patients in the general wards). DVT were detected in 13 (2.1%) patients, PE in 11 (1.8%), and both DVT and PE in 6 (0.96%) patients. An increasing prevalence in thromboembolic events was noted with progressive clinical severity. Overall in-hospital mortality was 4.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic anticoagulation therapy was administered in only 10% of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The prevalence of any thromboembolic events was 2.9% in COVID-19 patients with most events occurring in severe and critical patients. Therefore, prophylactic anticoagulation therapy may be warranted in severe and critical patients but in asymptomatic to moderate patients the practice remains controversial.","output":"Prevalence of thromboembolic events and status of prophylactic anticoagulant therapy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The rate of all-cause mortality is twofold higher in type 2 diabetes than in the general population. Being able to identify patients with the highest risk from the very beginning of the disease would help tackle this burden. METHODS: We tested whether ENFORCE, an established prediction model of all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes, performs well also in two independent samples of patients with early-stage disease prospectively followed up. RESULTS: ENFORCEs survival C-statistic was 0.81 (95%CI: 0.72C0.89) and 0.78 (95%CI: 0.68C0.87) in both samples. Calibration was also good. Very similar results were obtained with RECODe, an alternative prediction model of all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes.

Unfortunately, the rapid spread of the virus has left us little time to prepare for such dataset in the wild. To circumvent this issue, we present a 3D model-based approach called WearMask3D for augmenting face images of various poses to the masked face counterparts. Our method proceeds by first fitting a 3D morphable model on the input image, second overlaying the mask surface onto the face model and warping the respective mask texture, and last projecting the 3D mask back to 2D. The mask texture is adapted based on the brightness and resolution of the input image. By working in 3D, our method can produce more natural masked faces of diverse poses from a single mask texture. To compare precisely between different augmentation approaches, we have constructed a dataset comprising masked and unmasked faces with labels called MFW-mini. Experimental results demonstrate WearMask3D1produces more realistic masked faces, and utilizing these images for training leads to state-of-the-art recognition accuracy for masked faces. ? 2021 IEEE","output":"A 3d Model-based Approach for Fitting Masks to Faces in the Wild"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To prevent and fight the increase of daily sedentary time and to promote and stimulate the positive effects of physical activity and exercise on health, both traditional interventions and new strategies are important for breast cancer survivors (BCS).

The main objective of this study was to measure COVID19 impact on sexual health services in this clinic in Beirut. Methods A review of electronically based STIs screenings and diagnoses for the period February-December 2020 was conducted. Results The clinic has noted a major reduction in STI testing rates. Only 116 screenings were recorded in the mentioned period which contrasts with the 334 screenings conducted during the same period of 2019 (65% drop in 2020).

This novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with a respiratory illness that may lead to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 shows some peculiar pathogenetic, epidemiological and clinical features which to date are not completely understood. AIMS: To provide a review of the differences in pathogenesis, epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19, SARS and MERS. SOURCES: The most recent literature in the English language regarding COVID-19 has been reviewed, and extracted data have been compared with the current scientific evidence about SARS and MERS epidemics. CONTENT: COVID-19 seems not to be very different from SARS regarding its clinical features. However, it has a fatality rate of 2.3%, lower than that of SARS (9.5%) and much lower than that of MERS (34.4%). The possibility cannot be excluded that because of the less severe clinical picture of COVID-19 it can spread in the community more easily than MERS and SARS. The actual basic reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19 (2.0-2.5) is still controversial. It is probably slightly higher than the R0 of SARS (1.7-1.9) and higher than that of MERS (<1).

The role of thyroid autoimmunity and SARS-CoV-2 viral load in SARS-CoV-2-related thyroid dysfunction is unclear. We evaluated the thyroid function of a cohort of COVID-19 patients, in relation to their clinical features, biochemical, immunological and inflammatory markers. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients, without known thyroid disorders, admitted to Queen Mary Hospital for COVID-19 from 21 July to 21 August, 2020 were included. Serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine (fT3) and anti-thyroid antibodies were measured on admission. RESULTS: Among 191 patients with COVID-19 (mean age 53.5  17.2 years; 51.8% male), 84.3% were mild, 12.6% were moderate, and 3.1% were severe. 13.1% had abnormal thyroid function. Ten patients had isolated low TSH, suggestive of subclinical thyrotoxicosis due to thyroiditis, although the contribution of autoimmunity was likely in two of them. Autoimmune thyroiditis probably also contributed to subclinical hypothyroidism in another patient. Ten patients had isolated low fT3, likely representing non-thyroidal illness syndrome. Lower SARS-Cov-2 PCR cycle threshold values and elevated C-reactive protein were independently associated with occurrence of low TSH (p=0.030) and low fT3 (p=0.007) respectively. A decreasing trend of fT3 with increasing COVID-19 severity (p=0.032) was found. Patients with low fT3 had more adverse COVID-19-related outcomes. CONCLUSION: Around 15% of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 had thyroid dysfunction. There may be a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 on thyroid function, potentially leading to exacerbation of pre-existing autoimmune thyroid disease. Low fT3, associated with systemic inflammation, may have a prognostic significance.","output":"Thyroid Dysfunction in Relation to Immune Profile, Disease Status and Outcome in 191 Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the advent of COVID-19 arose the need for social distancing measures, including the imposition of far-reaching lockdowns in many countries.

The duration of closure with knotless suture ranged from 3.9 to 13 minutes, which was less than the use of conventional suture in every study. The duration of suturing was significantly less in the barbed suture group during hysterectomy, the mean difference between the observed groups was 2.41 minutes per operation (95% confidence interval, 1.23-3.59) whereas in myomectomy there was no statistically significant difference between compared groups. Concerning the estimated blood loss and the presence of major bleeding in hysterectomy, no statistical difference between the 2 groups was observed, while the estimated blood loss in myomectomy was found to be statistically significant (P = .04). Regarding the dehiscence of vaginal cuff in hysterectomy, no statistically significant difference was observed (1031 patients, odds ratio = 1.63; 95% confidence interval = 0.37-7.25).

Pilot findings demonstrated the potential helpfulness, acceptability, and feasibility of RISE; however, a randomized clinical trial (RCT) is needed to support program effectiveness. Methods: This RCT enrolled 60 women who experienced IPV within the prior year. Participants were recruited from an urban Veterans Health Administration hospital (October 2018 to September 2020). Participants completed a pretreatment assessment that included measures of relevant outcomes (primary: empowerment, self-efficacy, patient activation, and valued living; secondary: depression symptoms, IPV, and satisfaction with the intervention) and were randomly assigned to RISE or an enhanced care as usual (ECAU) condition. RISE participants received 1 to 6 sessions. ECAU participants received a single session consisting of psychoeducation, safety planning, resources, and referrals. Participants were reassessed 10 and 14 weeks after enrollment. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses using unconditional growth models revealed significant time-by-condition effects: RISE participants demonstrated higher increases in empowerment (d = 3.46) and self-efficacy (d = 1.09). RISE participants also experienced significant improvements in valued living (d = 0.53), depression symptoms (d = 0.49), and IPV reduction (d = 1.07) over time; however, the lack of a significant difference by condition suggested similar effectiveness of the interventions on these outcomes.

Triggered by pathogenic surface patterns in different pathways, the cascade concludes with the formation of a membrane attack complex (MAC; complement components C5b to C9) and C5a, a potent anaphylatoxin that elicits various inflammatory signals through binding to C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1). Despite its important role in pathogen elimination, priming and recruitment of myeloid cells from the immune system, as well as crosstalk with other physiological systems, inadvertent activation of the complement system can result in self-attack and overreaction in autoinflammatory diseases. Consequently, it constitutes an interesting target for specialized therapies. The paradigm of safe and efficacious terminal complement pathway inhibition has been demonstrated by the approval of eculizumab in paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria. In addition, complement contribution in rare kidney diseases, such as lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, C3 glomerulopathy, or antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis has been demonstrated. This review summarizes the involvement of the terminal effector agents of the complement system in these diseases and provides an overview of inhibitors for complement components C5, C5a, C5aR1, and MAC that are currently in clinical development.

This causal relationship is further complicated by the multi-level social determinants such as socio-political context, socio-economic factors and health systems. The systems approach has potential to facilitate understanding of such complex causal mechanisms. The objective of this paper is to describe the role of tobacco and alcohol use in the interaction of social determinants of NCDs in Nepal. METHOD The study adopted a qualitative study design guided by the Systemic Intervention methodology. The study involved key informant interviews (n = 63) and focus group discussions (n = 12) at different levels (national, district and/or community) and was informed by the adapted Social Determinants of Health Framework. The data analysis involved case study-based thematic analysis using framework approach and development of causal loop diagrams. The study also involved three sense-making sessions with key stakeholders. RESULTS Three key themes and causal loop diagrams emerged from the data analysis. Widespread availability of tobacco and alcohol products contributed to the use and addiction of tobacco and alcohol. Low focus on primary prevention by health systems and political influence of tobacco and alcohol industries were the major contributors to the problem. Gender and socio-economic status of families/communities were identified as key social determinants of tobacco and alcohol use. CONCLUSION Tobacco and alcohol use facilitated interaction of the social determinants of NCDs in the context of Nepal. Socio-economic status of families was both driver and outcome of tobacco and alcohol use. Health system actions to prevent NCDs were delayed mainly due to lack of system insights and commercial influence.

We observed that cross-city movements, which increased substantially in chunyun and then dropped sharply during the lockdown, are primarily dependent on travel distance and the socio-economic development of cities. Following the Lunar New Year holiday, national mobility remained low until mid-February, and COVID-19 interventions delayed more than 72.89 million people returning to large cities. Mobility network analysis revealed clusters of highly connected cities, conforming to the social-economic division of urban agglomerations in China. While the mass migration back to large cities was delayed, smaller cities connected more densely to form new clusters. During the recovery period after travel restrictions were lifted, the netflows of over 55% city pairs reversed in direction compared to before the lockdown.

The evolution of next-generation sequencing has revolutionized genomic studies to generate more data at a cheaper cost. These are divided into short- and long-read sequencing technologies, depending on the length of reads generated during sequencing runs. Long-read sequencing also called third-generation sequencing emerged commercially through the instruments released by Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies, although relying on different sequencing chemistries, with the first one being more accurate both platforms can generate ultra-long sequence reads. Long-read sequencing is capable of entirely spanning previously established genomic identification regions or potentially small whole genomes, drastically improving the accuracy of the identification of pathogens directly from clinical samples. Long-read sequencing may also provide additional important clinical information, such as antimicrobial resistance profiles and epidemiological data from a single sequencing run.

Furthermore, a new mathematical model is developed to determine an appropriate seat layout for groups.

The sum of individual transmission rates is taken as the objective function to derive scenarios with a low level transmission risk. After the determination of an appropriate seat layout, the cellular automata is used to derive and evaluate a corresponding boarding sequence aiming at both short boarding times and low risk of virus transmission. We find that the consideration of groups in a pandemic scenario will significantly contribute to a faster boarding (reduction of time by about 60%) and less transmission risk (reduced by 85%), which reaches the level of boarding times in pre-pandemic scenarios.","output":"Analytical approach to solve the problem of aircraft passenger boarding during the coronavirus pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the pandemic of COVID-19 began in January 2020, the world has witnessed drastic social-economic changes. To harness the virus spread, several studies have been done to study contributing factors that are pertinent to COVID-19 transmission risks. However, little has been done to investigate how human activities on the spatial network are correlated to the virus transmission and spread. This paper performs a statistical analysis to examine interrelationships between spatial network characteristics and cumulative cases of COVID-19 in US counties. Specifically, both county-level transportation profiles (e.g., the total number of commute workers, route miles of freight railroad) and road network characteristics of US counties are considered. Then, the lasso regression model is utilized to identify a sparse set of significant variables that are sensitive to the response variable of COVID-19 cases. Finally, the fixed-effect model is built to capture the relationship between the selected set of predictors and the response variable. This work helps identify and determine salient features from spatial network characteristics and transportation profiles, thereby improving the understanding of COVID-19 spread dynamics. These significant variables can also be utilized to develop simulation models for the prediction of real-time positions of virus spread and the optimization of intervention strategies.","output":"Statistical Analysis of Spatial Network Characteristics in Relation to COVID-19 Transmission Risks in US Counties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of applications for facial recognition technology is increasing due to the improvement in image quality, artificial intelligence, and computer processing power that has occurred during the last decades.

However, a technical limitation of existing methods of estimating R(t) is the reliance on the daily number of cases with illness onset and the distribution of the serial interval, although the estimator of R(t) should be calculated as the ratio of newly infected cases at time t to the total number of potentially infectious people at the same time. Using historical data of a smallpox outbreak in Tokyo City, Japan, approximately 100 years ago, we propose a new method to compute R(t) that can be estimated using information on illness onset. Our method decomposes the mechanism of transmission into two distinct pieces of information: the frequency of secondary transmission relative to disease age and the probability density function of the incubation period. Employing a piecewise constant model, our maximum likelihood estimates of R(t) dropped below unity (0.6; 95% confidence interval: 0.5-0.7) for the period from Day 64 to Day 79, indicating that the epidemic was under control in this period. R(t) was continuously below one through the remaining days. The model prediction captured the overall observed pattern of the epidemic well. Our method is appropriate for acute infectious diseases other than smallpox for which variations in infectivity relative to disease age should be considered to correctly estimate the transmission potential, such as the ongoing global epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","output":"Estimation of R(t) based on illness onset data: An analysis of 1907-1908 smallpox epidemic in Tokyo."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the era of COVID-19 pandemic, organ transplantation programs were facing serious challenges. The lung transplantation donor pool was extremely limited and SARS-CoV-2 viral load assessment has become a crucial part of selecting an optimal organ donor. Since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, the viral load is thought to be more important in lung transplantations as compared to other solid organ transplantations. We present two challenging cases of potential lung donors with a questionable COVID-19 status. Based on these cases, we suggest that the cycle threshold (Ct) value should always be requested from the laboratory and the decision whether to proceed with transplantation should be made upon complex evaluation of diverse criteria, including the nasopharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage PCR results, the Ct value, imaging findings and the medical history. However, as the presence of viral RNA does not ensure infectivity, it is still to be clarified which Ct values are associated with the viral viability.

Furthermore, profiling of serological responses can be used to identify biomarkers indicative of exposure to pathogens. Conducting such immune surveillance requires readout methods that are high-throughput, robust, and require small sample volumes. While the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the classical readout method for assessing serological responses, the advent of multiplex assays has significantly increased the throughput and capacity for immunoprofiling. This report describes the development and assay performance (sensitivity, linearity of detection, requirement for multiple dilutions for each sample, intra- and inter-assay variability) of an electro-chemiluminescence (ECLIA)-based multiplex assay. METHODS: The current study describes the development of a multiplex ECLIA-based assay and characterizes the sensitivity, linear range, and inter- and intra-assay variability of the ECLIA platform and its agreement with the traditional ELISA. Special emphasis was placed on potential antigenic competition when testing closely related antigens in the multiplex format. RESULTS: Multiplexing of antigens in ECLIA provides significant practical benefits in terms of reducing sample volume requirements and experimental time. Beyond the practical advantages of multiplexing, the ECLIA provides superior assay performance when compared to the ELISA. Not only does ECLIA show good agreement with the ELISA assay, but the linear range of ECLIA is also sufficiently wide to permit single-dilution measurements of concentration without the need to do serial dilutions. The lack of antigenic competition allows the simultaneous testing of closely related antigens, such as plate antigens representing different alleles of the same protein, which can inform about cross-reactivitiesor lack thereofof serological responses. CONCLUSION: The advantages of the newly developed tool for assessing the antigen profiles of serological responses may ultimately lead to the identification of biomarkers associated with various disease stages and or protection against disease.","output":"Comparison of ELISA with electro-chemiluminescence technology for the qualitative and quantitative assessment of serological responses to vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People with pre-existing conditions including obesity, diabetes, and kidney disease are at greater risk for complications of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Predisposing risk factors could include poor dietary quality and at-risk alcohol use. Increased survival and aging of people living with HIV (PLWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is complicated by comorbidities including at-risk alcohol use, metabolic dysregulation, diabetes, and chronic renal disease, with obesity and metabolic syndrome highest in southern states. We hypothesize that poor dietary quality in combination with at-risk alcohol use may increase risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in PLWH. To test this hypothesis, biospecimen obtained from a longitudinal study in female rhesus macaques (macaca mulatta) were used to determine whether high-fat high-sucrose diet (HFD;protein/fat/carbohydrates 16/42/42% of total kcal and 27% sucrose by weight) and chronic binge alcohol administration (CBA) increased expression of the machinery required for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Female macaques (n=10) were assigned to HFD or standard chow diet (SD;protein/fat/carbohydrates 29/14/57% of total kcal) and CBA (50-60 mM peak blood alcohol, 5 days/week) or isovolumetric water (VEH) beginning 3 months before SIVmac251 infection. ART was initiated at 2.5 months of SIV infection. Tissue samples including lung, pancreas, and kidney were collected at study endpoint (~12 months post-SIV infection). Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded samples to determine protein expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Images were obtained at 20x magnification and fluorescence intensity was used for quantification. RNA was extracted from frozen samples and mRNA expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was measured by qPCR and quantified relative to ribosomal protein S13. Normality of data was verified and outliers identified using Grubbs test. Data were then analyzed using a 2 (alcohol) ? 2 (diet) ANOVA. Protein expression of ACE2 in the lung (p&lt;0.01, ?2=0.59), whole pancreas (p&lt;0.05, ?2=0.64), and pancreatic islets (p&lt;0.05, ?2=0.44) was greater in HFD- than SD-fed macaques and was not significantly altered by CBA. No alcohol- or diet-mediated differences in ACE2 protein expression were observed for whole kidney or proximal tubules. No alcohol- or diet-mediated differences in protein expression of TMPRSS2 or relative mRNA expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 were observed. Results indicate that a high-fat, high-sucrose diet increases expression of the ACE2 receptor in SIV-infected female macaques. Because the ACE2 receptor is required for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, this diet-mediated increase in expression may increase risk for greater vulnerability to COVID-19 disease and associated complications. These data provide direct evidence for a link between dietary quality and risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the context of SIV/HIV infection, urging diet counseling and increased access to higher-quality foods in this population.","output":"High-Fat High-Sucrose Diet Increases ACE2 Receptor Expression in Lung and Pancreatic Islets in SIV-Infected Rhesus Macaques: Implications for Increased Risk for SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social stigma is the spoilation of the social image of an individual, which leads to the social disapproval of the individual by the community. Patients of many diseases like HIV, deafness, and reproductive disorders often face social disproval.

The novel coronavirus is a recently emerged zoonotic viral agent that affects the respiratory system of humans. Following its outbreak from the Wuhan city of China, the COVID-19 spreaded fiercely around the globe, forming a pandemic. Since COVID-19 is a contagious disease with no available treatment, social distancing is considered as the best strategy to prevent the geometric spread of infection. With the social distancing model, the head & neck cancer survivors along with the various other stakeholders perceived stigma being a high-risk group for COVID-19 infection. As the pool of caregivers is diminished due to pandemic, head & neck cancer survivors face increased social isolation and perceived stigma in asking for help from relatives. At the time of the pandemic, social support is critical to fighting against the disease. Social distancing should be maintained along with communication with the patients through calls, text, and online social platforms.

DESIGN & SETTING: Systematic review. METHOD: The authors undertook an electronic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science from inception to June 2020. The study included studies that compared remote consultations to face-to-face consultations in primary care and reported outcomes by PROGRESS Plus criteria. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I. Data were synthesised narratively. RESULTS: Based on 13 studies that explored telephone and internet-based consultations, this review found that telephone consultations were used by younger people of working age, the very old, and non-immigrants, with internet-based consultations more likely to be used by younger people. Women consistently used more remote forms of consulting than men. Socioeconomic and ethnicity findings were mixed, with weak evidence that patients from more affluent areas were more likely to use internet-based communication. Remote consultations appeared to help patients with opioid dependence remain engaged with primary care. No studies reported on the impact on quality of care or clinical outcomes.

Chest computed tomography scans before the antiviral therapy showed bilateral multiple patchy ground-glass opacities (GGO) consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. The GGO regressed over the course of the antiviral treatment; however, new non-segmental patchy consolidations emerged, which resembled those of interstitial lung disease (ILD), specifically collagen vascular disease-associated ILD.

CONCLUSIONS: Some reports suggested that COVID-19-associated microangiopathy contributed to the kidney damage. Therefore, it is possible that our patients might have accompanied renal microangiopathy, and that this pathological background may have caused exaggerated tubular damage by vancomycin or heme pigment. The etiology of AKI in patients with COVID-19 is multifactorial. Superimposition of nephrotoxin(s) and virus-associate intra-renal microangiopathy may be a crucial trigger of kidney injury leading to severe AKI in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, in COVID-19 patients, risk factors for AKI should be taken into consideration to prevent its progression into severe AKI.","output":"Development of acute kidney injury with massive granular casts and microscopic hematuria in patients with COVID-19: two case presentations with literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe well-documented links between education and health mean that school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to be associated with significant health harms to children and young people (CYP). A systematic review of the evidence is needed to inform policy decisions around school closures and re-openings during the pandemic. MethodsWe undertook a high-quality systematic review of observational quantitative studies (published or preprint) of the impacts of school closures (for any reason) on the health, wellbeing and educational outcomes of CYP, excluding impacts of closure on transmission of infection (PROSPERO CRD42020181658). We used a machine learning approach for screening articles, with decisions on inclusion and data extraction performed independently by 2 researchers. Quality was assessed for study type. A narrative synthesis of results was undertaken as data did not allow meta-analysis. Results16,817 records were screened, of which 151 were reviewed in full-text and 72 studies were included from 20 countries. 33% were cohort studies using historical control periods; 19% pre-post studies; and 46% cross-sectional studies which assessed change by comparison with population reference data. 63% were high-quality, 25% medium-quality and 13% low-quality. Cause of closure in all studies was the first COVID-19 pandemic wave with the exception of 5 influenza studies and 1 teacher strike. 27 studies concerning mental health identified considerable impacts across emotional, behavioural and restlessness/inattention problems; 18-60% of CYP scored above risk thresholds for distress, particularly anxiety and depressive symptoms. Two studies reported non-significant rises in suicide rates. Self-harm and psychiatric attendances were markedly reduced, indicating a rise in unmet mental health need. Child protection referrals fell 27-39%, with a halving of the expected number of referrals originating in schools. 19 studies concerning health service use showed marked reductions in emergency department (ED) presentations and hospital admissions, with evidence of delayed presentations and potential widening of inequalities in vaccination coverage. Data suggested marked rises in screen-time and social media use and reductions in physical activity however data on sleep and diet were inconclusive. Available data suggested likely higher harms in CYP from more deprived populations. ConclusionsSchool closures as part of broader social distancing measures are associated with considerable harms to CYP health and wellbeing. Available data are short-term and longer-term harms are likely to be magnified by further school closures. Data are urgently needed on longer-term impacts using strong research designs, particularly amongst vulnerable groups. These findings are important for policy-makers seeking to balance the risks of transmission through school-aged children with the harms of closing schools.","output":"Impacts of school closures on physical and mental health of children and young people: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: To perform a retrospective report on the lethality of COVID-19 in different realities in the city of Rio de Janeiro (RJ).

A survey was administered to 585 US respondents in late November 2020 as part of an online longitudinal study. Respondents provided information on whether they would obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, once available, and how long they intended to wait before obtaining it. In the negative intention group, 3.4% reported waiting a few weeks, 34.0% waiting a few months, and 62.6% never getting vaccinated. In multivariable models, social norms were a significant and independent predictor of all vaccine delay and intention models. Vaccine delay was associated with low levels of worry about becoming infected with COVID-19, political conservatism, concerns about vaccine side effects, and low levels of believing a vaccine would be effective. Negative vaccine intentions were associated with worries about becoming infected with COVID-19, concerns about vaccine side effects, beliefs that the vaccines were developed too quickly, and low endorsement of the altruistic belief that older people should have vaccination priority. The study results highlight the importance of a multifactorial approach to assessing vaccine attitudes. The findings suggest that uptake programs should focus on enhancing pro-vaccine norms.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine delay: An examination of United States residents' intention to delay vaccine uptake"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examined the documentation underlying the decision to permit the Southern District Health Board (SDHB) to join the National Bowel Screening Programme (NBSP) at a time when it was not providing an adequate colonoscopy service for symptomatic patients A coordinated sequence of relevant Official Information Act 1982 (OIA) requests was lodged with the New Zealand Ministry of Health (MoH), which is responsible for determining the readiness of district health boards (DHBs) to join the NBSP However, the MoH OIA process was obfuscating, unduly long and responded only after they anticipated imminent intervention by the Office of the Ombudsman The amount of information provided was massive, partly irrelevant and presented in an inconvenient format It revealed that the MoH readiness process was incomplete, and permission for the SDHB to join the NBSP was given prematurely without following due process and despite concerns expressed by some MoH staff Subsequently, the MoH has failed to admit that they made errors in this case or have any weaknesses in their readiness assessment process The MoH readiness process failed to determine that the SDHB was not ready to join the NBSP in 2018 Concerns have been expressed in the public media that such failures have occurred with the assessment of other DHBs The process needs to be overhauled or replaced before further permissions are granted to DHBs Requests for information under the OIA from the MoH, and similar public entities and agencies subject to the OIA, are too easily deferred, derailed or declined The OIA is in need of revision","output":"Official Information Act investigation of the Ministry of Health's process to assess the Southern District Health Board's readiness to join the National Bowel Screening Programme in 2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This essay tackles the following issues: (a) The encounter of Holocaust survivor offspring whose damaged parents suffered from unresolved grief with a life\\\\threatening pandemic; (b) Changes of technique that may be needed during this period; and (c) The impact of countertransference of the analyst in the analytic cure in a shared life\\\\threatening situation.

An alternative medicine appears to be one choice to alleviate symptoms and reduce mortality during drug shortages. Dendrobium extract is one of the traditional medicines used for COVID-19 infection. Several compounds in Dendrobium sp. had been reported to exert pharmacological activities to treat common COVID-19-related symptoms. Herein, in silico screening of 83 compounds from Dendrobium sp. by using the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) as a drug target was performed in searching for a new lead compound against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Four hit compounds showing good binding affinity were evaluated for antiviral infection activity. The new lead compound DB36, 5-methoxy-7-hydroxy-9,10-dihydro-1,4-phenanthrenequinone, was identified with the IC(50) value of 6.87  3.07 M. The binding mode revealed that DB36 bound with the spike protein at the host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding motif, resulted in antiviral activity.

Patients with COVID-19Cassociated ARDS have elevated free serum levels of the cytokine lymphotoxin-like inducible protein that competes with glycoprotein D for herpesvirus entry on T cells (LIGHT; also known as TNFSF14). Such patients may benefit from LIGHT-neutralization therapy. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, multicenter, proof-of-concept trial enrolled adults hospitalized with COVID-19Cassociated pneumonia and mild to moderate ARDS. Patients received standard of care plus a single dose of a human LIGHTCneutralizing antibody (CERC-002) or placebo. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients receiving CERC-002 who remained alive and free of respiratory failure through day 28. Safety was assessed via adverse event monitoring. RESULTS: For most of the 83 enrolled patients, standard of care included systemic corticosteroids (88.0%) or remdesivir (57.8%). A higher proportion of patients remained alive and free of respiratory failure through day 28 after receiving CERC-002 (83.9%) versus placebo (64.5%; P = 0.044), including in patients 60 years of age or older (76.5% vs. 47.1%, respectively; P = 0.042). Mortality rates were 7.7% (CERC-002) and 14.3% (placebo) on day 28 and 10.8% and 22.5%, respectively, on day 60. Treatment-emergent adverse events were less frequent with CERC-002 than placebo. CONCLUSION: For patients with COVID-19Cassociated ARDS, adding CERC-002 to standard-of-care treatment reduces LIGHT levels and might reduce the risk of respiratory failure and death.

Abdominal wall desmoid tumors are rare, but they can be locally aggressive, with high incidence of recurrence. These tumors are more common in young, fertile women. They frequently occur during or after pregnancy. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 63-year-old post-menopausal woman with a desmoid tumor of the anterior abdominal wall. She had no relevant family history. During abdominoplasty, an incidental mass was excised and biopsied, and was identified as a desmoid tumor with free margins. One year later, the patient presented with vague abdominal discomfort and feeling of heaviness. An incision was made through the previous abdominoplasty scar to maintain the aesthetic outcome. A large mass, arising from the abdominal wall and extending intra-abdominally, was excised and was determined to be a recurrent desmoid tumor. CONCLUSIONS Recurrent anterior abdominal wall desmoid tumors in post-menopausal women are rare and locally aggressive, with a high risk of recurrence. During abdominal wall repair in abdominoplasty, desmoid tumor filaments might seed deep intra-abdominally. Therefore, it is necessary to take adequate safe margins before abdominal wall repair.

After perturbation removal, the increased TA activation persisted temporarily and was associated with a more dorsiflexed ankle during swing. The objective of the present case-series study was to verify if these results can be reproduced in persons post-stroke. METHODS Six participants who sustained a stroke walked on a treadmill before, during and after exposure to a torque perturbation applied at the ankle by a robotized ankle-foot orthosis. Spatiotemporal gait parameters, ankle and knee kinematics, and the electromyographic activity of TA and Soleus were recorded. Mean amplitude of the TA burst located around toe off and peak ankle dorsiflexion angle during swing were compared across the 3 walking periods for each participant. RESULTS At the end of the walking period with the perturbation, TA mean amplitude was significantly increased in 4 of the 6 participants. Among these 4 participants, modifications in TA activation persisted after perturbation removal in 3 of them, and led to a statistically significant increase in peak dorsiflexion during swing. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS This approach may be helpful to evaluate the residual adaptive capacity in the ankle dorsiflexors after a stroke and guide decision-making for the selection of optimal rehabilitation interventions.

In this study, we constructed a series of chimeric hAPN/pAPN genes and expressed the corresponding proteins in transfected cells. Subsequently, we identified the chimeric proteins that can function as a receptor for HCV 229E. The results show that replacement of a small region of pAPN sequence (pAPN amino acids 255-348) with the corresponding hAPN sequence (hAPN amino acids 260-353) converts pAPN into a functional receptor for HCV 229E. The region of hAPN that we have defined in this way does not correspond to the region of pAPN that has been identified as essential for the TGEV-receptor interaction.

Challenges and opportunities were encountered at the provider, patient, and family levels throughout the rapid transition period from in-person to online care to ensure continuity of services. Institutional, regional, and national policies that impacted the care team's capacity to respond swiftly to patients' changing needs were counterbalanced by those related to standards of care, education and training, and resource constraints. At the policy level, COVID-19 re-exposed a number of long-standing and complicated issues about professional licensure among behavioral health providers at the local and state levels and national long-distance practice restrictions during times of crisis. Issues of insurance reimbursement and regulations intended to protect the public may need to adapt and evolve as the practice of behavioral medicine increasingly takes place remotely, online, and over great distances.

Mannan has a complex, comb-like structure and includes a variety of structural units, with their combination varying depending on the Candida species and strain. Glucomannan, a polysaccharide from Candida utilis, contains terminal -d-glucose residues attached to oligomannoside side chains. This paper describes the first synthesis of a pentasaccharide structurally related to C. utilis glucomannan fragment, which is an -(12)-linked tetramannoside terminated at the non-reducing end by an -d-glucopyranosyl residue. The pentasaccharide was obtained as a 3-aminopropyl glycoside, which made it possible to synthesize also its biotinylated derivative, suitable for various glycobiological studies. The most complicated step in the pentasaccharide synthesis was stereoselective 1,2-cis-glycosylation to attach the -d-glucopyranosyl residue. This was accomplished using a glucosyl donor specially developed in our laboratory, the protecting groups of which provide the necessary -stereoselectivity.

Clinical trials have been hampered by a lack of meaningful diagnostic and prognostic markers of injury severity and neurologic recovery. Objective biomarkers and novel therapies for SCI represent urgent unmet clinical needs. Biomarkers of SCI that objectively stratify the severity of cord damage could expand the depth and scope of clinical trials and represent targets for the development of novel therapies for acute SCI. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent promising candidates both as informative molecules of injury severity and recovery, and as therapeutic targets. miRNAs are small, regulatory RNA molecules that are tissue-specific and evolutionarily conserved across species. miRNAs have been shown to represent powerful predictors of pathology, particularly with respect to neurologic disorders. METHODS Studies investigating miRNA alterations in all species of animal models and human studies of acute, traumatic SCI will be identified from PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. We aim to identify whether SCI is associated with a specific pattern of miRNA expression that is conserved across species, and whether SCI is associated with a tissue- or cell type-specific pattern of miRNA expression. The inclusion criteria for this study will include (1) studies published anytime, (2) including all species, and sexes with acute, traumatic SCI, (3) relating to the alteration of miRNA after SCI, using molecular-based detection platforms including qRT-PCR, microarray, and RNA-sequencing, (4) including statistically significant miRNA alterations in tissues, such as spinal cord, serum/plasma, and/or CSF, and (5) studies with a SHAM surgery group. Articles included in the review will have their titles, abstracts, and full texts reviewed by two independent authors. Random effects meta-regression will be performed, which allows for within-study and between-study variability, on the miRNA expression after SCI or SHAM surgery. We will analyze both the cumulative pooled dataset, as well as datasets stratified by species, tissue type, and timepoint to identify miRNA alterations that are specifically related to the injured spinal cord. We aim to identify SCI-related miRNA that are specifically altered both within a species, and those that are evolutionarily conserved across species, including humans. The analyses will provide a description of the evolutionarily conserved miRNA signature of the pathophysiological response to SCI. DISCUSSION Here, we present a protocol to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the conserved inter- and intra-species miRNA changes that occur due to acute, traumatic SCI. This review seeks to serve as a valuable resource for the SCI community by establishing a rigorous and unbiased description of miRNA changes after SCI for the next generation of SCI biomarkers and therapeutic interventions.

METHODS The study comprised 141 women who underwent TOT for clinically and urodynamically proved stress urinary incontinence. The postoperative ultrasound examination with an endovaginal biplane probe was performed before discharging the patients from hospital. The measurements obtained described the position of the tape relative to the urethra and pubic symphysis, as well as anatomical relationships in the anterior compartment. RESULTS Ninety-six (68.1 %) patients were cured, 27 (19.1 %) significantly improved, and in 18 cases (12.7 %), the surgery failed. The tape position under the midurethra (40-70th percentile of the urethral length) or distal urethra (>70th percentile) coincided with better results (cure rate 67.1 and 82.4 %, respectively) than the location in the proximity of the bladder neck (<40th percentile) (21.4 % cured, p = 0.0015 and p < 0.001, respectively). However, the risk of failure was the lowest when the tape was located under the distal urethra. Other ultrasonographic findings were not related to treatment results.

The disease is prevalent in all countries with almost 100% incidence rate. Chicken and commercially reared pheasant are the natural host for IBV. Virus causes respiratory diseases, poor weight gain, feed efficiency in broiler, damage to oviduct, and abnormal egg production in mature hens resulting in economic losses. IBV also replicates in tracheal and renal epithelial cells leading to prominent tracheal and kidney lesions. Virus undergoes spontaneous mutation leading to continual emergence of new variants. The effectiveness of immunization program is diminished because of poor cross-protection among the serotypes. Identification of circulating serotypes is important in controlling IBV infection. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR21 are involved in early recognition of virus resulting in induction of inflammatory cytokines. Both humoral and cellular immune responses are important in the control of infection. Humoral immunity plays an important role in recovery and clearance of viral infection. IBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes induce lysis of IBV-infected cells. Effective diagnostic tools are required at field level to identify different IBV variants. Embryonated chicken eggs are effective model for virus isolation. Identification by other specific methods like virus neutralization (VN), hemagglutination inhibition (HI), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunohistochemistry, or nucleic acid analysis or by electron microscopy is also indispensable.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that a well-trained deep learning system is able to recover the patient identity from chest X-ray data. We demonstrate this using the publicly available large-scale ChestX-ray14 dataset, a collection of 112,120 frontal-view chest X-ray images from 30,805 unique patients. Our verification system is able to identify whether two frontal chest X-ray images are from the same person with an AUC of 0.9940 and a classification accuracy of 95.55%.

The article includes the response of governments and that of United Nations agencies and in particular the World Health Organization, the International Maritime Organization, the International Labour Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization. The significant role played by the maritime industry in providing substantive guidance is commended. The article concludes that COVID-19 will continue to have a huge impact on the maritime industry and on world trade for the foreseeable future. The expectation is that the industry will hopefully emerge stronger and become more robust to enable world trade to be efficient and sustainable. It is also expected that the pandemic will enable a greater recognition of the worlds seafarers who facilitate world trade, while ensuring a better future for humanity.","output":"Shipping and COVID-19: protecting seafarers as frontline workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions in cancer care around the world due to logistical and psychosocial reasons This paper was written with the primary objective of providing a guide for medical oncologists in addressing concerns in the management of adult patients with solid tumours in the Philippines and for those working under similar circumstances These recommendations are divided into prioritisation of cancer care, ensuring a safe work environment, organising the transition of cancer care, and maintaining cohesion in a time of isolation","output":"Treatment of cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The demand for e-learning has increased every year.

Lightening the burden not only depends on government agencies, but also needs extensive social organization participation. However, few studies focus on how to promote social cooperation to support the provision of emergency supplies. This study aimed to find out the theoretical mechanism to expand the cooperative networks of supply support organizations during the epidemic. Data from the emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic in China were used. Three cooperative networks from a progressive perspective were constructed based on the cooperative relationships among organizations. The expansion mechanism was verified by the exponential random graph model. The results show that when the institutional network expands into an interactive network, the composition of organization types has changed, but the cooperative networks efficiency does not improve much. The matching effect of the organizational type and the Matthew effect of nodes are both effective paths to promote cooperative network expansion, however, the structure effect shows that complex relationship structure is not a critical factor. Our findings highlight the importance of core organizations and the function of different types of organizations in building cooperative network as well as providing theoretical frameworks for policymakers to use in guiding and motivating social cooperation in emergency supplies.","output":"The Expansion Mechanism of the Cooperative Networks of Supply Support Organizations in a Public Health Emergency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Manusia adalah makhluk sosial yang dalam kehidupannya sangat memerlukan interaksi satu sama lain.

For the characterization of gait alterations related to pathology, gait timing assessment is of primary importance. With the widespread use of inertial sensors, several algorithms have been proposed for gait timing estimation (i.e. gait events and temporal parameters) out of the water, while an assessment of their performance for walking in water is still missing. The purpose of the present study was to assess the performance in the temporal segmentation for gait in water of 17 algorithms proposed in the literature. METHODS Ten healthy volunteers mounting 5 tri-axial inertial sensors (trunk, shanks and feet) walked on dry land and in water. Seventeen different algorithms were implemented and classified based on: 1) sensor position, 2) target variable, and 3) computational approach. Gait events identified from synchronized video recordings were assumed as reference. Temporal parameters were calculated from gait events. Algorithm performance was analysed in terms of sensitivity, positive predictive value, accuracy, and repeatability. RESULTS For walking in water, all Trunk-based algorithms provided a sensitivity lower than 81% and a positive predictive value lower than 94%, as well as acceleration-based algorithms, independently from sensor location, with the exception of two Shank-based ones. Drop in algorithm sensitivity and positive predictive value was associated to significant differences in the stride pattern of the specific analysed variables during walking in water as compared to walking on dry land, as shown by the intraclass correlation coefficient. When using Shank- or Foot-based algorithms, gait events resulted delayed, but the delay was compensated in the estimate of Stride and Step time; a general underestimation of Stance- and overestimation of Swing-time was observed, with minor exceptions. CONCLUSION Sensor position, target variable and computational approach determined different error distributions for different gait events and temporal parameters for walking in water. This work supports an evidence-based selection of the most appropriate algorithm for gait timing estimation for walking in water as related to the specific application, and provides relevant information for the design of new algorithms for the specific motor task.","output":"Timing estimation for gait in water from inertial sensor measurements: Analysis of the performance of 17 algorithms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The telehealth revolution in response to COVID-19 has increased essential health care access during an unprecedented public health crisis.

The aim of the study was to conduct a rapid survey to assess the impact of COVID-19 on performance and image enhancing drug (PIED) use and training, and any subsequent negative physical or mental health outcomes. METHODS: During 2020, a convenience sample of 60 PIED consumers (mean age = 26.69; 68.3% located outside Australia) completed a quantitative anonymous online survey exploring how the coronavirus pandemic impacted patterns of PIED use and associated exercise habits. The survey was administered via the Qualtrics platform and distributed online through PIED forums as well as through the investigators networks. Participants were asked about their PIED use and exercise habits prior to and during restricted movement lockdowns. RESULTS: During pre-COVID, the majority of the sample opted to blast-cruise (an initial high dose, followed by a lower maintenance dose; 71.7%, n = 43). During lockdown, 45% (n = 27) reported a change in PIED use as a result of the restrictions. In light of health concerns during COVID-19, a majority of men (60%, n = 36) did not take any extra precautions relating to their PIED use. A subgroup of men ceased using PIEDs completely (16.7%, n = 10) with the majority (80%, n = 8) of that subgroup following post-cycle therapy (PCT) of some kind. Only a small proportion of the sample reported negative mental health issues as a result of PCT access issues. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the emerging literature of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on substance use, specifically PIED use among men. The results suggest that the pandemic did influence the choice of PIEDs that participants consumed, although there was little disruption to patterns of exercise, an important aspect of PIED use. Of the men who did cease use completely, the majority reported little issue with PCT access; those who reported difficulty accessing PCT compounds indicated experience some mental health concerns related to ceasing their PIED use. Clinicians and those who come into contact with this group should be alert for any negative physical or mental health concerns resulting from disrupted or ceased PIED use.","output":"Investigating the impact of COVID-19 on performance and image enhancing drug use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On-road traffic is the primary source of air pollutants in Cuenca (2500 m a s l ), an Andean city in Ecuador Most of the buses in the country run on diesel, emitting high amounts of NOx (NO + NO2) and PM2 5, among other air pollutants Currently, an electric tram system is beginning to operate in this city, accompanied by new routes for urban buses, changing the spatial distribution of the city&rsquo;s emissions, and alleviating the impact in the historic center The Ecuadorian energy efficiency law requires that all vehicles incorporated into the public transportation system must be electric by 2025 As an early and preliminary assessment of the impact of this shift, we simulated the air quality during two scenarios: (1) A reference scenario corresponding to buses running on diesel (DB) and (2) the future scenario with electric buses (EB) We used the Eulerian Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model for simulating the air quality during September, based on the last available emission inventory (year 2014) The difference in the results of the two scenarios (DB-EB) showed decreases in the daily maximum hourly NO2 (between 0 8 to 16 4 &micro;g m&minus;3, median 7 1 &micro;g m&minus;3), and in the 24-h mean PM2 5 (0 2 to 1 8 &micro;g m&minus;3, median 0 9 &micro;g m&minus;3) concentrations However, the daily maximum 8-h mean ozone (O3) increased (1 1 to 8 0 &micro;g m&minus;3, median 3 5 &micro;g m&minus;3) Apart from the primary air quality benefits acquired due to decreases in NO2 and PM2 5 levels, and owing to the volatile organic compounds (VOC)-limited regime for O3 production in this city, modeling suggests that VOC controls should accompany future NOx reduction for avoiding increases in O3 Modeled tendencies of these pollutants when moving from the DB to EB scenario were consistent with the tendencies observed during the COVID-19 lockdown in this city, which is a unique reference for appreciating the potentiality and identifying insights for air quality improvements This consistency supports the approach and results of this contribution, which provides early insights into the effects on air quality due to the recent operability of the electric tram and the future shift from diesel to electric buses in Cuenca","output":"Insights for Air Quality Management from Modeling and Record Studies in Cuenca, Ecuador"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cancer patients represent a vulnerable population for COVID-19 illness. We aimed to analyze outcomes of lung cancer patients affected by COVID-19 in a tertiary hospital of a high-incidence region during the pandemic. Methods: We annotated 23 lung cancer patients consecutively diagnosed with COVID-19 at our institution (HGUGM; Madrid, Spain) between March 4th, 2020 and May 12th, 2020. Only patients with a confirmatory SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR were included in the study. Results: All patients had at least 1 COVID-19 related symptom; cough (48%), shortness of breath (48%), fever (39%), and low-grade fever (30%) were the most common. Time from symptoms onset to first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR was 5.5 days (range 1C17), with 13% of cases needed from a 2nd PCR to confirm diagnosis. There was a high variability on thoracic imaging findings, with multilobar pneumonia as the most commonly found pattern (74%). Main lab test abnormalities were low lymphocytes count (87%), high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio -NLR- (78%), and elevated inflammatory markers: fibrinogen (91%), c-reactive protein -CRP- (87%), and D-dimer (70%). In our series, hospitalization rate was 74%, 39% of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the case-fatality rate was 35% (8/23). 87% of patients received anti-viral treatment (87% hydroxychloroquine, 74% lopinavir/ritonavir, 13% azithromycin), 43% corticosteroids, 26% interferon-, 4% tocilizumab, and 82% of hospitalized patients received anticoagulation. High-oxygen requirements were needed in 39% of patients, but only 1 pt was admitted for invasive MV and was discharged 42 days after admission. Multiple variables related to tumor status, clinical baseline conditions, and inflammation markers were associated with mortality but did not remain statistically significant in a multivariate model. In patients with lung cancer receiving systemic therapy (n = 242) incidence and mortality from COVID-19 were 4.5, and 2.1%, respectively, with no differences found by type of treatment. Conclusions: Lung cancer patients represent a vulnerable population for COVID-19, according to the high rate of hospitalization, onset of ARDS, and high mortality rate. Although larger series are needed, no differences in mortality were found by type of cancer treatment.

Most interestingly, camera-based techniques have become more popular in this kind of scenarios, given their robustness and scalability. In this paper, we implement an end-to-end strategy to address this scenario, allowing a robot to solve a maze in an autonomous way, by using computer vision and path planning. In addition, this robot shares the generated knowledge to another by means of communication protocols, having to adapt its mechanical characteristics to be capable of solving the same challenge. The paper presents experimental validation of the four components of this solution, namely camera calibration, maze mapping, path planning and robot communication.

However, T cells are also critical in protective immunity, especially in immune-compromised patients. In this study, we examined the association of T cell dysfunction, as marked by expression of T cell exhaustion molecules, and posttransplant infections in a cohort of liver transplant patients. We focused on Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) and T cell Ig- and mucin-domain molecule 3 (Tim-3), which are potent co-inhibitory receptors, and their persistent expression often leads to T cell dysfunction and compromised protective immunity. We found that patients with the highest expression of PD-1 +Tim-3+ T cells in the memory compartment before transplantation had increased incidence of infections after liver transplantation, especially within the first 90 days. Longitudinal analysis in the first year showed a strong association between variability of PD-1 and Tim-3 expression by T cells and infectious episodes in transplant patients. Furthermore, T cells that expressed PD-1 and Tim-3 had a significantly reduced capacity in producing interferon (IFN)- in vitro, and this reduced IFN- production could be partially reversed by blocking PD-1 and Tim-3. Interestingly, the percentage of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in liver transplant patients was stable in the study period. We concluded that the functional status of T cells before and after liver transplantation, as shown by PD-1 and Tim-3 expression, may be valuable in prognosis and management of posttransplant infections.","output":"Longitudinal assessment of T cell inhibitory receptors in liver transplant recipients and their association with posttransplant infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The objective of the study was to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics found in personnel screened during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.Materials and methods: Nasal and oropharyngeal swab samples were collected in the period between May 11 and May 26, 2020, from 496 people.

This may be even more pronounced during the current COVID-19 pandemic because of the extreme shortage of hospital admission and restricted access to important services. Therefore, the ability of detecting a history of falls that can be applied to wheelchair users and ambulatory individuals with SCI in various settings are essential. AIM: To investigate the discriminative ability of three clinical measures-the handgrip (HG) test, Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) III and upper limb loading during a seated push-up test (ULL-SPUT)-in discriminating individuals with SCI with and without a history of falls over the past six months. DESIGN: A six-month retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Inpatient tertiary rehabilitation centre. POPULATION: One hundred and fourteen wheelchair users and ambulatory individuals with SCI. METHODS: The participants were interviewed and assessed for their demographics, SCI characteristics and fall data over the past six months, with data confirmation from related events, their caregivers and medical records. Subsequently, they were assessed using the HG test, SCIM III, and ULL-SPUT. RESULTS: In total, 29 participants (25%) fell during the past six months (with the number of falls ranging from 1-20, with minor consequences after the falls). Among the three clinical measures assessed in this study, the ULL-SPUT data of faller participants were significantly higher than those of non-fallers (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The limited rehabilitation length and increased staying home and social isolation prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic may have reduced the fall rates of the participants. The findings suggest a higher likelihood of falls among wheelchair users and ambulatory individuals with SCI who have good mobility as determined using ULL-SPUT data. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Apart from being an important rehabilitation strategy, the present findings suggest an additional benefit of upper limb loading during a seated push-up test to identify individuals with spinal cord injury with a likelihood of future falls. The measurement can be done easily using digital bathroom scales placing over a flat and smooth surface. Therefore, it would enable the timely initiation of fall prevention strategies in various clinical, community, home and research settings; particularly in this COVID-19 pandemic of limited beds and hospital services for these individuals.","output":"Ability to detect history of falls among individuals with spinal cord injury using upper limb loading during a seated push-up test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Keller Army Community Hospital, a 12-bed community hospital located in the Hudson Valley of New York State, within the pandemic epicenter anticipated the surge of critically ill patients, which would overwhelm local resources during the coronavirus pandemic sweeping across the globe. In this facility, there were no Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and resources were mobilized in order to create a negative pressure Corona Virus Unit (CVU) consisting of seven ICU beds and two step-down beds. Although the creation of the CVU decreased the non-COVID inpatient capacity to five beds, the hospital also formulated a plan to expand overall bed capacity from 12 inpatient beds to 45 beds within 24 hours. OBJECTIVE To create a ICU embedded within a CVU and implement a three day curriculum to prepare four mixed teams of critical care and non-critical care staff nurses to manage critically ill patients with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS Nursing leaders and hospital education staff developed a critical care curriculum utilizing Elsevier didactic, the DoD COVID-19 Practice Guide, and hands-on training for 34 nurses.1,2 Nurses had varied scope of practice levels from licensed practical nurses to advance practice nurses, with diverse critical care expertise to non-critical care nursing staff from the primary care medical home (PCMH), all of which participated in the cross-leveling to the CVU unit during the pandemic response. Educational elements included PPE donning and doffing, mechanical ventilation, central venous catheter maintenance, arterial catheter management, hemodynamics, and critical care pharmacotherapy. A medical model skills station with common critical care equipment such as ventilators allowed for instantaneous feedback and 13 hands-on skills training. RESULTS A fully functional ICU and CVU was created with thirty-four nurses who completed training within seven days with a didactic completing rate of 94.65 % and 100% hands-on skills. The program endures with monthly tailored re-fresher training to improve efficiency and maintain critical competencies. The team maintained operational readiness through the surge and remain resolute for the next surge. CONCLUSIONS On-going program execution and evaluation continues to develop new staff members due to permanent change of station, recent on-boarding, or because of evidence based clinical guideline changes. Training has continued, but shifted to include normal inpatient operations over the summer of 2020. Re-fresher classes covering the treatment and care of COVID patients continue with the anticipation of a second wave surge of COVID-19 cases emerges this fall based on epidemiology predictions.","output":"Bench Building during COVID-19: Creating Capabilities and Training Teams."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The net oxygen change over a 24-hour day/night cycle in a laboratory study showed strong consistent patterns of (1) gain, when nutrients and light were available; (2) maintain, with daytime gains being matched by nighttime losses; and (3) loss, over brief periods of time during intense zooplankton grazing on previously grown phytoplankton or over long durations without an external source of nutrients.

APPROACH & RESULTS: This novel systematic review and meta\\\\analysis identified six studies of 586 patients delineating liver chemistries among patients with severe/critical illness versus mild cases of COVID\\\\19 infection. Patients with severe/critical illness with COVID\\\\19 infection have increased prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as compared to mild cases. A significant association between severe/critical COVID\\\\19 infections with elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (pooled mean difference [MD], 11.70 U/L; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.97, 20.43; P = 0.009), elevated total bilirubin (pooled MD, 0.14 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.06, 0.22; P = 0.0005), and decreased albumin (pooled MD, C0.68 g/L; 95% CI, C0.81, C0.55; P < 0.00001) was noted. There was also a trend toward elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels among these severe cases (pooled MD, 8.84 U/L; 95% CI, C2.28, 19.97; P = 0.12); however, this did not reach statistical significance. More severe/critically ill cases were associated with leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, elevated creatinine kinase, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated prothrombin time (PT). CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities, including CAD, cerebrovascular disease, and COPD, are more prevalent in hospitalized Chinese patients with severe/critical illness from COVID\\\\19, and these patients are more likely to manifest with abnormal liver chemistries.

We found that 2-doses of self-amplifying RNA vaccine based on the ancestral spike ameliorated weight loss following Delta infection and decreased viral loads, but had minimal effect on Omicron/BA.1 infection. Prior infection with ancestral or Alpha variant was partially protective against Omicron/BA.1 infection, whereas all animals previously infected with Delta and exposed to Omicron became infected, although shed less virus. We further tested whether prior infection with Omicron/BA.1 protected from re-infection with Delta or Omicron/BA.2. Omicron/BA.1 was protective against Omicron/BA.2, but not Delta reinfection, again showing Delta and Omicron have a very large antigenic distance. Indeed, cross-neutralisation assays with human antisera from otherwise immunonaive individuals (unvaccinated and no known prior infection), confirmed a large antigenic distance between Delta and Omicron. Prior vaccination followed by Omicron or Delta breakthrough infection led to a higher degree of cross-reactivity to all tested variants. To conclude, cohorts whose only immune experience of COVID is Omicron/BA.1 infection may be particularly vulnerable to future circulation of Delta or Delta-like derivatives.

However, frequent hand sanitation and the prolonged and continuous use of personal protective equipment are responsible for constant frictional and pressure forces on skin causing lesions, the most reported being acne, facial itching, dryness, and rash. Thus, it is important to find measures to prevent skin lesions, in order to improve the quality of life of health-care professionals and of the general public. This article gathers the current information regarding measures to prevent human to human transmission of COVID-19, reviews the most common skin lesions caused by the use of hand sanitizers and different types of personal protective equipment, and the possible preventive measures that can be used on a daily basis to minimize the risk of developing skin-related pathologies. Daily skin care routines and the incorporation of a dressing between the skin and the personal protective equipment to serve as a protective barrier are some of the applied measures. Moisturizers and dressings improve the skin's ability to respond to constant aggressions. Lastly, the need for additional studies to evaluate the lubrication properties of different types of dressings is discussed. The understanding of what kind of dressing is more suitable to prevent pressure injuries is crucial to promote healthy skin and wellbeing during pandemic times.","output":"Indirect consequences of coronavirus disease 2019: Skin lesions caused by the frequent hand sanitation and use of personal protective equipment and strategies for their prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remote monitoring of biometric data in the elderly population is an important asset for improving the quality of life and level of independence of elderly people living alone.

In-hospital treatment addresses the multifaceted nature of the illness including viral replication, cytokine storm, and endothelial injury with thrombosis. We identified nine reports of early treatment outcomes in COVID-19 nursing home patients. Multi-drug therapy including hydroxychloroquine with one or more anti-infectives, corticosteroids, and antithrombotic agents can be extended to seniors in the nursing home setting without hospitalization. Data from nine studies found multidrug regimens relying on the use of hydroxychloroquine as well as other agents including doxycycline were associated with a statistically significant and >60% reductions in mortality. Going forward, we theorize and based on the evidence, that early empiric treatment for the elderly with COVID-19 in the nursing home setting (or similar congregated settings with elderly residents/patients) has a genuine probability of success and acceptable safety. This group remains our highest at-risk group and warrants acute treatment focus that will prevent the development and/or worsening of problems associated with COVID-19, most particularly isolation, hospitalization, and death. In fact, with the rapidity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in nursing homes, in-center treatment of patients with acute COVID-19 is possibly the most rational and importantly feasible strategy to reduce the risks of hospitalization and death. If the approach remains wait-and-see and elderly high-risk patients in such congregated nursing room type settings are allowed to worsen with no early treatment, they may be too sick and fragile to benefit from in-hospital therapeutics and are at risk for pulmonary failure, life-ending micro-thrombi of the lungs, kidneys etc. We put forth the notion that the most important factor in this regard, is making available early therapeutic intervention as described here. These drugs include and under supervision by skilled doctors, combination/sequenced ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, azithromycin, doxycycline, bromhexine hydrochloride, and favipiravir (outside the US), along with inhaled steroids such as budesonide and oral steroids including dexamethasone and prednisone, and anti-thrombotic anti-clotting drugs such as heparin). As the clinical trials data on treatments for COVID-19 mature, this early treatment therapeutic option deserves serious, urgent, and sober consideration by the medical establishment and respective decision-makers.","output":"Early Multidrug Outpatient Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (COVID-19) and Reduced Mortality Among Nursing Home Residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Salvia species have been widely used as medicinal plants and have played an important role in the treatment and recovery of individuals with COVID-19 In this study, we reported two newly identified whole chloroplast genome sequences of Salvia medicinal plants (Salvia yangii and Salvia miltiorrhiza f alba) and compared them with those of seven other reported Salvia chloroplast genomes These were proven to be highly similar in terms of overall size, genome structure, gene content, and gene order We identified 10 mutation hot spots (trnK-rps16, atpH-atpI, psaA-ycf3, ndhC-trnV, ndhF, rpl32-trnL, ndhG-ndhI, rps15-ycf1, ycf1a, and ycf1b) as candidate DNA barcodes for Salvia Additionally, we observed the transfer of nine large-sized chloroplast genome fragments, with a total size of 49,895 bp (accounting for 32 97% of the chloroplast genome), into the mitochondrial genome as they shared &gt;97% sequence similarity Phylogenetic analyses of the whole chloroplast genome provided a high resolution of Salvia This study will pave the way for the identification and breeding of Salvia medicinal plants and further phylogenetic evolutionary research on them as well","output":"Characterization of chloroplast genomes from two Salvia medicinal plants and gene transfer among their mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Families were advised to stay home, and pediatricians quickly altered their practices to help safeguard staff and patients Young children unable to wear a mask are sometimes intimidated by the funny looking person doing doctor stuff, who sounds like that nice pediatrician he or she has seen before [ ]time that we can safely unmask-I now try a little harder to make my patients and parents laugh or giggle to make the office visit comforting Going forward While the pandemic curve is flattening, there continues to be widespread COVID-19 cases in my community [ ]the crisis is behind us, I suggest that front office staff and office nurses communicate with families via video visits whenever possible","output":"COVID-19: Keep Smiling!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: More than 15 million adults in the USA have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) places a high burden on the healthcare system. Many hospital admissions are due to an exacerbation, which is suspected to be from a viral cause. The purpose of this analysis was to compare the outcomes of patients with a positive and negative respiratory virus panel who were admitted to the hospital with COPD exacerbations. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in the Geisinger Healthcare System. The dataset included 2729 patient encounters between 1 January 2006 and 30 November 2017. Hospital length of stay was calculated as the discrete number of calendar days a patient was in the hospital. Patient encounters with a positive and negative respiratory virus panel were compared using Pearsons chi-square or Fishers exact test for categorical variables and Students t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous variables. Results: There were 1626 patients with a total of 2729 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation encounters. Nineteen percent of those encounters (n = 524) had a respiratory virus panel performed during their admission. Among these encounters, 161 (30.7%) had positive results, and 363 (69.3%) had negative results. For encounters with the respiratory virus panel, the mean age was 64.5, 59.5% were female, 98.9% were white, and the mean body mass index was 26.6. Those with a negative respiratory virus panel had a higher median white blood cell count (11.1 vs. 9.9, p = 0.0076). There were no other statistically significant differences in characteristics between the two groups. Respiratory virus panel positive patients had a statistically significant longer hospital length of stay. There were no significant differences with respect to being on mechanical ventilation or ventilation-free days. Conclusion: This study shows that a positive respiratory virus panel is associated with increased length of hospital stay. Early diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation patients with positive viral panel would help identify patients with a longer length of stay.","output":"Impact of a Positive Viral Polymerase Chain Reaction on Outcomes of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular disease, aging and insulin resistance.

Unstable power supply and increasing energy prices have significant effects on developing countries, especially during this COVID-19 pandemic. Renewable energy sources can provide sustainable and efficient electricity supply. Murzuq is a rural community situated in the southern part of Libya and endowed with renewable energy resources. While there is high electricity consumption during the lockdown, health clinics also experienced higher energy consumption of longer operating hours and an increased number of electrical appliances. This study investigates the techno-economic assessment of three different hybrid energy systems for health clinics in Murzuq. HOMER (Hybrid optimization model for electric renewables) software tool was used to evaluate the feasibility of employing renewable energy, to provide sustainable energy supply to the clinic. The current unsteady energy supply comes from the national grid and the current energy supply is not sufficient for the clinics operating hours and requires a sustainable and steady supply. Measured data collected from the health clinic and HOMER software were used to analyze and optimize the change in overall electricity demand for the health clinic before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that the photovoltaic/battery hybrid energy system has a lower net present cost, compared to the Photovoltaic/Generator set/ battery hybrid energy system, but higher than the standalone generator set. However, the highest amount of carbon emission associated with the standalone generator set compared to the other two hybrid energy systems disqualifies it from being a suitable contender for the source of electricity for the health clinic. The photovoltaic/battery was deemed to be most economically beneficial in terms of emission reduction and energy price. The outcomes of this investigation will help stakeholders and designers to optimize hybrid energy systems that economically meet the health clinic energy demands, especially during this pandemic.

This was due to concerns for donor and recipient safety, restrictions on elective cases, and diversion of staff and resources in centers with a higher incidence of COVID-19 infections. Telehealth was explored as a strategy to continue living donor evaluations during the pandemic, but faced barriers including restrictive physician licensing, reduced reimbursement, lack of infrastructure, prohibitive local policies, limited exam, and personal biases. This review highlights these barriers and potential solutions. RECENT FINDINGS: Telehealth usage in the transplant population improves medication adherence, reduces hospitalization rates for recipients, and makes living donor evaluation convenient. Transplant centers have implemented telehealth successfully for living kidney donor evaluations. Broad use of telemedicine will be possible only if policies support the changing landscape of healthcare delivery.

This study is part of a larger investigation to design mCARES, a mobile technology-based, adherence intervention for ethnic minority women with HIV (MWH). Objective: To understand barriers and facilitators of care adherence (treatment and appointment) for ethnic MWH; examine the relationship between these factors across three ethnic groups; and, explore the role of mobile technologies in care adherence. Methods: Cross-sectional, mixed-methods data were collected from a cohort of African-American, Hispanic-American and Haitian-American participants. Qualitative data were collected through a focus group (n = 8) to assess barriers and facilitators to care adherence. Quantitative data (n = 48) surveyed women on depressive symptomology (PHQ-9), HIV-related stigma (HSS) and resiliency (CD-RISC25). We examined the relationships between these factors and adherence to treatment and care and across groups. Findings: Qualitative analyses revealed that barriers to treatment and appointment adherence were caregiver-related stressors (25%) and structural issues (25%); routinization (30%) and religion/spirituality (30%) promoted adherence to treatment and care. Caregiver role was both a hindrance (25%) and promoter (20%) of adherence to treatment and appointments. Quantitatively, HIV-related stigma differed by ethnic group; Haitian-Americans endorsed the highest levels while African-Americans endorsed the lowest. Depression correlated to stigma (R = 0.534; p < 0.001) and resiliency (R = ?0.486; p < 0.001). Across ethnic groups, higher depressive symptomology and stigma were related to viral non-suppression (p < 0.05)a treatment adherence marker; higher resiliency was related to viral suppression. Among Hispanic-Americans, viral non-suppression was related to depression (p < 0.05), and among African-Americans, viral suppression was related to increased resiliency (p < 0.04). Conclusion: Multiple interrelated barriers to adherence were identified. These findings on ethnic group-specific differences underscore the importance of implementing culturally-competent interventions.

The magnitude of exposure risk to COVID-19 infections in Ethiopia is rapidly increasing following its spread in the country. However, studies about the risk of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers and factors associated with risk of COVID-19 infection are lacking in Ethiopia. OBJECTIVE: The study investigated level of risk of COVID-19 infection and associated factors among healthcare workers at Eka Kotebe COVID-19 treatment center. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from September to October 2020 to determine risk of COVID-19 infection and associated factors at Eka Kotebe COVID-19 treatment center. In total, 318 healthcare workers participated in the study. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 25. A binary logistic regression model was used to evaluate the risk of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers. RESULTS: A total of 243 (76%) healthcare workers had a high exposure risk of COVID-19 infection. Department of healthcare workers, ICU department workers [AOR: 6.545, 95% CI; (1.79C23.97)], long working hours [AOR: 9.224, 95% CI; (2.00C42.61)], inadequate supply of PPE [AOR: 0.318, 95% CI; (0.14C0.75)], lack of access to alcohol-based hand rub [AOR: 0.093, 95% CI; (0.01C0.98)], providing care within one meter of COVID-19 patients [AOR: 20.633, 95% CI; (3.88C109.76)], and direct contact with an environment in which a COVID-19 patient received care [AOR: 9.600, 95% CI; (1.05C84.50)] were found to be risk factors for COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Healthcare workers face a high risk of COVID-19 infection while providing care for COVID-19 patients. Proper use and adequate supply of PPE and the implementation of basic infection prevention and control with frequent protocol revision and strict supervision are crucial to limit exposure risk to COVID-19 among healthcare workers.","output":"Risk of COVID-19 Infection and Associated Factors Among Healthcare Workers: A Cross-Sectional Study at Eka Kotebe Treatment Center in Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has a multitude of uses in biomedical imaging due to its ability to discern ultrastructure morphology at the nanometer scale.

However, safety concerns is one of the major obstacles for LAVs development. In an effort to achieve the optimal balance between immunogenicity and safety, researchers currently have taken different strategies for the development of LAVs. METHODS: We constructed a novel infectious self-propagating hybrid replicon particle (PRP), VEEV-RABV-G, through replacing the entire structural proteins of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) with the glycoprotein of rabies virus (RABV-G) as the single structural protein. We evaluated the potential of VEEV-RABV-G as a safe live attenuated vaccine in mice model. FINDINGS: We found that VEEV-RABV-G could self-propagate efficiently in cell culture and induce a robust humoral immunity and provide protection against virulent RABV challenge in immunized mice. Remarkably, VEEV-RABV-G is highly attenuated in both adult and sucking mice, causing much weaker inflammatory and apoptotic effects in the brains of infected adult mice and significantly lower weight loss and morbidity compared with the commonly used RABV-derived LAVs.

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of daily 3 mg subcutaneous (s/c) Liraglutide amongst obese non-diabetic patients in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of obese non-diabetic Saudi patients with obesity managed with s/c Liraglutide 3.0 mg who visited the outpatient clinic in Al Mashfa Hospital, Al Khobar, KSA during 2019C2021. We collected patient data from the electronic reporting system for different parameters. Body weight, hemoglobin A1c %, systolic and diastolic blood pressure mmHg were obtained at baseline and after the intervention. RESULTS: Records of 258 patients who were using a daily dose of Liraglutide 3.0 mg s/c for at least four months have been reviewed. The body weight loss of patients who used Liraglutide for four months was 8.10.8 kg. Moreover, around 204 patients continued for up to six months. Meanwhile, the mean body weight loss was 13 kg. There was a significant reduction of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) % by 0.43%. The majority of patients (94.5%) reported satisfaction with the treatment, while adverse events were mainly nausea, vomiting and constipation.

Dysregulation in hostCcommensal interactions has been implicated as the central pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which predisposes to developing colorectal cancer. Recent animal studies have begun to outline some unique physiology and pathology involving each PRR signaling in the intestine. The major roles played by PRRs in the gut appear to be the regulation of the number and the composition of commensal bacteria, epithelial proliferation, and mucosal permeability in response to epithelial injury. In addition, PRR signaling in lamina propria immune cells may be involved in induction of inflammation in response to invasion of pathogens. Because some PRR-deficient mice have shown variable susceptibility to colitis, the outcome of intestinal inflammation may be modified depending on PRR signaling in epithelial cells, immune cells, and the composition of commensal flora. Through recent findings in animal models of IBD, this review will discuss how abnormal PRR signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammation and inflammation-associated tumorigenesis in the intestine.

We invited medical students at the University of Leeds, UK, to answer 15 multiple choice questions before and immediately after watching the video, and again one month later. Only one previous study specifically assessed medical students knowledge of dystonia whilst five others tested their knowledge of movement disorders, or neurology generally, with some questions on dystonia. Of the University of Leeds medical students, 87 (100%), 77 (89%) and 40 (46%) completed the baseline, immediate-recall and delayed-recall questionnaires, respectively. The mean score for students who completed all three questionnaires increased from 7.7 (out of 15) to 12.5 on the immediate-recall questionnaire (p < 0.001), and to 10.1 on the delayed-recall questionnaire (p < 0.001). At baseline, 76% of students rated their confidence in recognising dystonia as low. After watching the video, 78% rated their confidence as a high, and none rated it low.

However, the ability to measure and monitor human mobility, health risk and their changing patterns across spatial and temporal scales using traditional data sources has been limited. To facilitate a better understanding of the use of emerging mobile phone technology and data in travel medicine, we reviewed relevant work aiming at measuring human mobility, disease connectivity and health risk in travellers using mobile geopositioning data. KEY FINDINGS Despite some inherent biases of mobile phone data, analysing anonymized positions from mobile users could precisely quantify the dynamical processes associated with contemporary human movements and connectivity of infectious diseases at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Moreover, recent progress in mobile health (mHealth) technology and applications, integrating with mobile positioning data, shows great potential for innovation in travel medicine to monitor and assess real-time health risk for individuals during travel. CONCLUSIONS Mobile phones and mHealth have become a novel and tremendously powerful source of information on measuring human movements and origin-destination-specific risks of infectious and non-infectious health issues. The high penetration rate of mobile phones across the globe provides an unprecedented opportunity to quantify human mobility and accurately estimate the health risks in travellers.

By comparing with the change of the positive rate, we argue that the psychology of people was the cause of the observed asymmetry and shallow valleys in the number of confirmed cases. We discuss that the positive rate as large as 1-5% in the valleys of the epidemic implies that many people are already infected and immune. The observed fact that the positive rate followed the number of positives accurately and the value lower than those reported in the test-negative design studies of influenza are attributable to the government policy of finding as many patients as possible.

To determine the pathway by which virus reaches the cord, brains and spinal cords of infected, asymptomatic mice were analyzed by in situ hybridization. Viral RNA was always detected in the anterior part of the upper spinal cord. A similar analysis of mice with the recent onset of hindlimb weakness showed that viral RNA was detected in the same location. The results suggest that MHV is transported to the spinal cord via well-defined neuroanatomic pathways and that viral amplification with resultant clinical disease occurs from this site of persistence in the anterior spinal cord. This process of viral amplification may involve the generation of viral variants as has been described for MHV-infected rats. No major changes in viral RNA or protein could be detected when MHV isolated from mice with hindlimb paralysis was analyzed. The data suggest that the generation of viral variants is not important in the pathogenesis of the late onset neurological disease induced by MHV in mice.","output":"Identification of the spinal cord as a major site of persistence during during chronic infection with a murine coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) now is considered a global public health emergency. One of the unprecedented challenges is defining the optimal therapy for those patients with severe pneumonia and systemic manifestations of COVID-19. The optimal therapy should be largely based on the pathogenesis of infections caused by this novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the onset of COVID-19, there have been many prepublications and publications reviewing the therapy of COVID-19 as well as many prepublications and publications reviewing the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. However, there have been no comprehensive reviews that link COVID-19 therapies to the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. To link COVID-19 therapies to pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, we performed a comprehensive search through MEDLINE, PubMed, medRxiv, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science using the following keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, novel 2019 coronavirus, pathology, pathologic, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, coronavirus pneumonia, coronavirus infection, coronavirus pulmonary infection, coronavirus cardiovascular infection, coronavirus gastroenteritis, coronavirus autopsy findings, viral sepsis, endotheliitis, thrombosis, coagulation abnormalities, immunology, humeral immunity, cellular immunity, inflammation, cytokine storm, superantigen, therapy, treatment, therapeutics, immune-based therapeutics, antiviral agents, respiratory therapy, oxygen therapy, anticoagulation therapy, adjuvant therapy, and preventative therapy. Opinions expressed in this review also are based on personal experience as clinicians, authors, peer reviewers, and editors. This narrative review linking COVID-19 therapies with pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in six major therapeutic goals for COVID-19 therapy based on the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. These goals are listed below: 1. The first goal is identifying COVID-19 patients that require both testing and therapy. This is best accomplished with a COVID-19 molecular test from symptomatic patients as well as determining the oxygen saturation in such patients with a pulse oximeter. Whether a symptomatic respiratory illness is COVID-19, influenza, or another respiratory pathogen, an oxygen saturation less than 90% means that the patient requires medical assistance. 2. The second goal is to correct the hypoxia. This goal generally requires hospitalization for oxygen therapy; other respiratory-directed therapies such as prone positioning or mechanical ventilation are often used in the attempt to correct hypoxemia due to COVID-19. 3. The third goal is to reduce the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. Ideally, there would be an oral antiviral agent available such as seen with the use of oseltamivir phosphate for influenza. This oral antiviral agent should be taken early in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such an oral agent is not available yet. Currently, two options are available for reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. These are post-Covid-19 plasma with a high neutralizing antibody titer against SARS-CoV-2 or intravenous remdesivir; both options require hospitalization. 4. The fourth goal is to identify and address the hyperinflammation phase often seen in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Currently, fever with an elevated C-reactive protein is useful for diagnosing this hyperinflammation syndrome. Low-dose dexamethasone therapy currently is the best therapeutic approach. 5. The fifth goal is to identify and address the hypercoagulability phase seen in many hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients who would benefit from anticoagulation therapy can be identified by a marked increase in d-dimer and prothrombin time with a decrease in fibrinogen. To correct this disseminated intravascular coagulation-like phase, anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin is preferred. Anticoagulation therapy with unfractionated heparin is preferred in COVID-19 patients with acute kidney injuries. 6. The last goal is prophylaxis for persons who are not yet infected. Potential supplements include vitamin D and zinc. Although the data for such supplements is not extremely strong, it can be argued that almost 50% of the population worldwide has a vitamin D deficiency. Correcting this deficiency would be beneficial regardless of any impact of COVID-19. Similarly, zinc is an important supplement that is important in one's diet regardless of any effect on SARS-CoV-2. As emerging therapies are found to be more effective against the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic mechanisms identified, they can be substituted for those therapies presented in this review.","output":"Pathogenesis-directed therapy of 2019 novel coronavirus disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), occurred in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China The coronavirus has spread throughout the world, posing a severe threat to human health By using flow cytometry, here we observed the dynamic changes of peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets in COVID-19 patients, with an attempt to explore their roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and their impacts on prognosis Methods: Eighty-nine COVID-19 patients were divided into a moderate group (n=70) and the severe/ critical group (n=19) according to the disease severity Furthermore, the severe/critical patients were divided into the improved group (n=14) and unimproved group (n=5) according to the outcomes The absolute peripheral blood lymphocytes counts and subsets, including CD45+, CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+, in the acute phase, and flow cytometry measured the recovery phase for all patients Then, the results were compared with those in the normal control group Results: The absolute counts of lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and their subsets decreased during the acute phase in COVID-19 patients, especially in the severe/critical group The T-lymphocyte count reached the lowest point on the 14th day in the severe/critical group It rose with fluctuations to the normal level in the improved group as the immune function recovered;in the unimproved group, however, the T-lymphocyte count remained at a low level or even continued to decrease The percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes showed no visible change in the improved group;however, the percentage of CD8+ T cells dropped in the unimproved group, resulting in higher CD4+/CD8+ ratio Conclusions: T lymphocytes count, and their subsets can be used for monitoring the immune functions and predicting the prognosis of COVID-19 patients","output":"Dynamic changes of T-lymphocyte subsets and the correlations with 89 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 200 countries.

The pattern of outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China during the flu season is further proof that meteorological conditions may potentially influence the susceptibility of human populations to coronaviruses, a situation that may become increasingly evident as the current global pandemic of COVID-19 unfolds.

It is unclear if the currently high rates of COVID-19 infections in countries of the northern hemisphere will wane during the summer months, or if fewer people overall will become infected with COVID-19 in countries south of the equator where warmer weather conditions prevail through most of the year. However, apart from the influence of seasons, evidence based on the structural biology and biochemical properties of many enveloped viruses similar to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2 (aetiology of COVID-19), support the higher likelihood of the latter of the two outcomes. Other factors that may potentially impact the rate of virus spread include the effectiveness of infection control practices, individual and herd immunity, and emergency preparedness levels of countries.

Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, data from the Molecular Epidemiology of ARDS (MEARDS) study, a prospective cohort of 403 patients with ARDS and 1227 non-ARDS controls, were analyzed. Patients were recruited in intensive care units (ICUs) at Massachusetts General Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, both in Boston, Massachusetts, from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2014. Data analysis was performed from December 9, 2018, to January 4, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Participants were followed up daily for ARDS development defined by Berlin criteria, requiring fulfillment of chest radiograph and oxygenation criteria on the same calendar day during invasive ventilatory assistance. A 2-stage study design was used to explore novel metabolites associated with ARDS risk and survival. Results: Of the 1630 participants from MEARDS who were admitted to the ICU , 403 (24.7%) were diagnosed with ARDS (mean [SD] age, 63.0 [17.0] years; 251 [62.3%] male) and 1227 (75.3%) were at-risk but did not have ARDS (mean [SD] age, 62.3 [16.9] years; 753 [61.4%] male). Mendelian randomization suggested that genetically regulated serum mannose was associated with ARDS risk (odds ratio [OR], 0.64; 95% CI, 0.53-0.78; P = 7.46  10-6) in the discovery stage. In the functional validation stage incorporating 83 participants with ARDS and matched at-risk participants in the control group from the ICU, the protective association of mannose with ARDS risk was validated (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.97; P = .03). Furthermore, serum mannose was associated with 28-day (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.11-0.56; P = 6.95  10-4) and 60-day (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.19-0.71; P = 3.12  10-3) mortality and 28-day (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32-0.74; P = 6.41  10-4) and 60-day (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37-0.80; P = 2.11  10-3) survival. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, genetically regulated serum mannose appeared to be associated with ARDS risk and outcome, and increased serum mannose at admission was associated with reduced ARDS risk and better survival.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare different internet platform technologies for remotely viewing radiological images and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. METHODS: Oracle Java, Adobe Flash, and HTML5 were each used to develop a comprehensive web-based medical imaging app that connected to a medical image server and provided several required functions for radiological interpretation (eg, navigation, magnification, windowing, and fly-through). Java-, Flash-, and HTML5-based medical imaging apps were tested on different operating systems over a local area network and a wide area network. Three computed tomography colonography data sets and 2 ordinary personal computers were used in the experiment. RESULTS: The experimental results demonstrated that Java-, Flash-, and HTML5-based apps had the ability to provide real-time 2D functions. However, for 3D, performances differed between the 3 apps. The Java-based app had the highest frame rate of volume rendering. However, it required the longest time for surface rendering and failed to run surface rendering in macOS. The HTML5-based app had the fastest surface rendering and the highest speed for fly-through without platform dependence.

The long tradition of using mathematical models to generate insights about the transmission of a disease, as well as new computer techniques such as Artificial Intelligence, have opened the door to diverse investigations providing relevant information about the evolution of COVID-19. In this research, we seek to advance the existing epidemiological models based on microscopic Markov chains to predict the impact of the pandemic at medical and economic levels. For this purpose, we have made use of the Spanish population movements based on mobile-phone geographically-located information to determine its economic activity using Artificial Intelligence techniques and have developed a novel advanced epidemiological model that combines this information with medical data. With this tool, scenarios can be released with which to determine which restriction policies are optimal and when they have to be applied both to limit the destruction of the economy and to avoid the feared possible upsurge of the disease.","output":"An epidemic model for economical impact predicting and spatiotemporal spreading of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of the importance of schools to childhood development, the relationship between in-person schooling and COVID-19 risk has been one of the most important questions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous work using data from the United States in winter 2020-21 showed that in-person schooling carried some risk for household members, and that mitigation measures reduced this risk. However, in-person schooling behavior and the COVID-19 landscape changed radically over the 2021 spring semester. Here we use data from a massive online survey to characterize changes in in-person schooling behavior and associated risks over that period. We find a significant increase in the frequency of in-person schooling and a reduction in mitigation, and that in-person schooling is associated with increased reporting of COVID-19 outcomes, even among vaccinated individuals (though the absolute risk among the vaccinated is greatly reduced). Moreover, vaccinated teachers working outside the home were less likely to report COVID-19-related outcomes than unvaccinated teachers reporting no work outside the home.

Resistance to triclabendazole, one of the principal veterinary medicines used to prevent losses, has been reported and is now considered widespread in fluke endemic regions of the UK. METHODS Thirteen farmers participated in a trial in 2013 and the triclabendazole resistance status was obtained for each farm. Based on these results, a knowledge exchange programme on fluke control was delivered to nearly 100 farmers in the region. In this follow-up study, 11 farmers involved in the original trial, participated in semistructured in-depth qualitative interviews in July 2017. RESULTS Overall, participants identified benefits from participating in the 2013 trial, gaining information about triclabendazole resistance on their farms and knowledge about fluke control. The information on their farm's resistance status was a driver for changing their liver fluke control programmes. Factors such as habitual and repetitive behaviours, grazing restrictions due to agri-environmental schemes, economic pressures and climate change were identified that could impede or prevent the adoption of new control strategies.

However, the branching of this artery and the drainage patterns of this vein vary among individuals, and the characteristics and perfusion region of this artery in elderly patients remain unclear. AIM To evaluate the characteristics and perfusion region of the IMA in elderly patients using angiography. METHODS We enrolled 154 patients (> 65 years old) who underwent digital subtraction angiography of the IMA. The characteristics, bifurcation, and distribution of the IMA and termination of the anastomotic perfusion of the left colon and rectum were examined using digital subtraction angiography. Collateral arterial arches and the IMA hemoperfusion region were also recorded. Perfusion regions were cross-referenced with clinical and anatomical features by the univariate analysis. RESULTS Of 154 patients, 25 (16.2%) had IMA lesions. The left colic artery arose independently from the IMA in 44.2% of patients, shared a trunk with the sigmoid artery in 35.1%, shared an opening with the sigmoid and superior rectal arteries in 16.9%, and was absent in 5.1%. The IMA perfusion region stopped at the splenic flexure in 50 (32.5%) patients. The collateral circulation existed in the colonic perfusion region, including the marginal artery (Drummond's artery), the ascending branch of the left colonic artery to supply the transverse colon, and the arc of Riolan with a frequency of 100%, 22.7%, and 1.9%, respectively. The IMA perfusion region was independently associated with the comorbidity of atherosclerosis, IMA atherosclerotic lesion, branching pattern, collateral circulation, and marginal artery integrity. CONCLUSION The IMA and its branches are prone to arteriosclerosis, and IMA perfusion may be interrupted at the splenic flexure in elderly patients. The applicability and precision of preoperative angiography for evaluating the IMA branching and perfusion patterns could facilitate geriatric laparoscopic left-sided colorectal cancer surgery with suspicion of poor IMA perfusion.","output":"Evaluation of characteristics of left-sided colorectal perfusion in elderly patients by angiography."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, we present an open-source stochastic epidemic simulator calibrated with extant epidemic experience of COVID-19.

Methods: Inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Enze Hospital from January 17, 2020 to February 15, 2020 were included. The evolving characteristics of CT manifestations and treatment outcomes were analyzed. Results: Twenty-two patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. Clinical symptoms at the time of onset included fever (n=19) and cough (n=8). The first CT findings mainly included ground-glass opacities (GGOs) (n=18), lung consolidation (n=7), interlobular septal thickening (n=5), and fibrosis-like stripes (n=4). Dynamic CT showed GGOs, lung consolidation, and fibrosis-like stripes, all of which demonstrated a trend that initially increased in number, and then gradually decreased in number or disappeared. According to the characteristics of CT evolution. COVID-19 could be divided into early stage, progressing stage, recovery stage, and dissipation stage. The median times of the respective stages were: early stage - 3 days (1-8 days) after disease onset, progressing stage - 7 days (4-17 days) after onset, recovery stage - 10 days (8-14 days) after onset, and dissipation stage - 19.5 days (11-25 days) after onset. Conclusions: COVID-19 has an acute onset, with main imaging manifestations of different types of GGO with or without lung consolidation in the subpleural regions of the bilateral lungs. The CT manifestations of lung lesions change rapidly. The lung lesions of mild and ordinary types of COVID-19 may improve significantly or disappear in a short period after active treatment, with good prognosis.

We provide the proof of principle that this combination immunoregulatory therapy targeting two non-redundant checkpoints of the immune response, i.e., priming and effector functions, can improve persistence of transduced cells in experimental settings where cytotoxic T cells escape initial blockade.

The response is modeled by assuming that the rate of change of the reproduction number is proportional to the negative deviation of the incidence rate from an intervention threshold. This delay dynamical system exhibits damped oscillations in one part of the parameter space, and growing oscillations in another, and these are separated by a surface where the solution is a strictly periodic nonlinear oscillation. For the COVID-19 pandemic, the tipping transition from damped to growing oscillations occurs for response delays of about one week, and suggests that, without vaccination, effective control and mitigation of successive epidemic waves cannot be achieved unless NPIs are implemented in a precautionary manner, rather as a response to the present incidence rate.

The Irish response to COVID-19 has been framed as a collective effort, fostering national solidarity. However, dominant representations of the national community often unreflexively reaffirm the prototypicality of majority group members, implicitly marginalizing minority group members. This may have implications for adherence behaviours. We propose that majority/minority membership of the national community predicts adherence to COVID-19 health advice via prototypicality and national solidarity. In Study 1, we collected data online from Irish residents (N = 1,185) during the first wave of restrictions in Ireland's response. In Study 2, we collected data from Irish residents (N = 537) during the second wave of restrictions, with more targeted sampling of minority groups. Based on these two studies, there is no difference between minority and majority group members' adherence behaviours. However, mediation analysis showed that greater adherence to COVID-19 health advice is shown when group members perceive themselves to be prototypical of the Irish national community, and thereby show greater national solidarity. In Study 3, we manipulated an appeal to adhere to restrictions (N = 689) and show that an inclusive solidarity appeal increased reported intentions to adhere to COVID-19 restrictions compared to an exclusive solidarity appeal among minority group members.

Design The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases to find abstracts of relevant articles in journals published from 2010 until May 16, 2020. The sources of data included Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. The search terms used included repositioning of drugs, repurposing of drugs and COVID-19 therapy, and SARS-CoV-2 therapy. Setting The research team conducted this study at the Department of Pharmacology, Punjab University College of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan; Mangalbare Hospital, Morang, Nepal; and Dr Iwamura Memorial Hospital, Bhaktapur, Nepal. Results Repurposing of drugs from different pharmacological groups including antivirals like remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir, arbidol, oseltamivir, penciclovir, favipiravir, ganciclovir, and ribavirin; other antibiotics like azithromycin, ivermectin, eravacycline, valrubicin, streptomycin, nitazoxanide, teicoplanin, caspofungin, and colistin; and other agents like hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, tocilizumab, camostat, nafamostat, carfilzomib, interferon, aprepitant, and dexamethasone can be considered for COVID-19 therapy.

Then, the proposed system estimates indoor population density from collected environment data. The proposed system estimates the indoor population density from indoor environment data by machine learning. This study also investigates whether sensor data are adequate for estimating indoor population density. The experimental results show that the proposed system achieves about 80 % or more estimation accuracy by using multiple types of sensors, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed system. The proposed system is expected to measure the closed space also estimate crowded rooms, which is a helpful finding for preventing the spread of COVID-19. ? 2022 by the authors.","output":"Estimating Indoor Population Density from Non-contact Sensor Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) constitutes a public health emergency globally. The number of infected people and deaths are proliferating every day, which is putting tremendous pressure on our social and healthcare system. Rapid detection of COVID-19 cases is a significant step to fight against this virus as well as release pressure off the healthcare system. OBJECTIVE: One of the critical factors behind the rapid spread of COVID-19 pandemic is a lengthy clinical testing time. The imaging tool, such as Chest X-ray (CXR), can speed up the identification process. Therefore, our objective is to develop an automated CAD system for the detection of COVID-19 samples from healthy and pneumonia cases using CXR images. METHODS: Due to the scarcity of the COVID-19 benchmark dataset, we have employed deep transfer learning techniques, where we examined 15 different pre-trained CNN models to find the most suitable one for this task. RESULTS: A total of 860 images (260 COVID-19 cases, 300 healthy and 300 pneumonia cases) have been employed to investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm, where 70% images of each class are accepted for training, 15% is used for validation, and rest is for testing. It is observed that the VGG19 obtains the highest classification accuracy of 89.3% with an average precision, recall, and F1 score of 0.90, 0.89, 0.90, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of deep transfer learning techniques for the identification of COVID-19 cases using CXR images.","output":"Identification of COVID-19 samples from chest X-Ray images using deep learning: A comparison of transfer learning approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a continued threat to human health in both community and healthcare settings. In hospitals, control efforts would benefit from accurate estimation of asymptomatic colonization and infection importation rates from the community. However, developing such estimates remains challenging due to limited observation of colonization and complicated transmission dynamics within hospitals and the community. Here, we develop an inference framework that can estimate these key quantities by combining statistical filtering techniques, an agent-based model, and real-world patient-to-patient contact networks, and use this framework to infer nosocomial transmission and infection importation over an outbreak spanning 6 years in 66 Swedish hospitals. In particular, we identify a small number of patients with disproportionately high risk of colonization. In retrospective control experiments, interventions targeted to these individuals yield a substantial improvement over heuristic strategies informed by number of contacts, length of stay and contact tracing.","output":"Inference and control of the nosocomial transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a retrospective descriptive study of the chest imaging findings of 118 patients with confirmed A(H1N1) in a tertiary referral centre.

This review summarizes and discusses the principles regarding nuclear cardiology techniques and AI, and the current evidence regarding its performance and contribution to the improvement of risk prediction in cardiovascular disease. RECENT FINDINGS AND SUMMARY: There is a growing body of evidence on the experimentation with and implementation of machine learning-based AI on nuclear cardiology studies both concerning SPECT and PET technology for the improvement of risk-of-disease (classification of disease) and risk-of-events (prediction of adverse events) estimations. These publications still report objective divergence in methods either utilizing statistical machine learning approaches or deep learning with varying architectures, dataset sizes, and performance. Recent efforts have been placed into bringing standardization and quality to the experimentation and application of machine learning-based AI in cardiovascular imaging to generate standards in data harmonization and analysis through AI. Machine learning-based AI offers the possibility to improve risk evaluation in cardiovascular disease through its implementation on cardiac nuclear studies.

It is highly variable in its expression and severity. It is believed to be autoimmune in nature. The cause is unknown; both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis. MS generally presents with the acute or subacute onset of neurologic abnormalities that may wax and wane over many years. Diagnosis is generally made by means of observation of the clinical course in conjunction with a neurologic examination and laboratory tests. These tests may include magnetic resonance imaging of the head and spine, lumbar puncture, and evoked potentials. Treatment is based on general supportive care, the use of corticosteroids for relapses, and symptomatic management of ongoing problems. The frequency of relapses can be reduced with interferon- (Betaseron). Copolymer 1 and interferon- la are being evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval for use for reduction in the frequency of relapses in relapsing-remitting MS. Treatment of chronic progression is often attempted with immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide. Use of other agents is being investigated.","output":"Multiple sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of smart cities, there is a general benefit from monitoring close encounters among pedestrians. For instance, for the access control to office buildings, subway, commercial malls, etc., where a high amount of users may be present simultaneously, and keeping a strict record on each individual may be challenging. GPS tracking may not be available in many indoor cases; video surveillance may require expensive deployment (mainly due to the high-quality cameras and face recognition algorithms) and can be restrictive in case of low budget applications; RFID systems can be cumbersome and limited in the detection range. This information can later be used in many different scenarios. For instance, in case of earthquakes, fires, and accidents in general, the administration of the buildings can have a clear record of the people inside for victim searching activities. However, in the pandemic derived from the COVID-19 outbreak, a tracking that allows detecting of pedestrians in close range (a few meters) can be particularly useful to control the virus propagation. Hence, we propose a mobile clustering scheme where only a selected number of pedestrians (Cluster Heads) collect the information of the people around them (Cluster Members) in their trajectory inside the area of interest. Hence, a small number of transmissions are made to a control post, effectively limiting the collision probability and increasing the successful registration of people in close contact. Our proposal shows an increased success packet transmission probability and a reduced collision and idle slot probability, effectively improving the performance of the system compared to the case of direct transmissions from each node.","output":"Mobile Clustering Scheme for Pedestrian Contact Tracing: The COVID-19 Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Goal The Ea??/a??(EaSa) index is an echocardiographic parameter to determine a patient's left ventricular filling pressure. This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of the echocardiographic Ea??/a??(EaSa) index guided diuretic therapy compared to urine output (conventional) guided diuretic treatment.Material and Methods In this cross-sectional study, patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who were hospitalized due to acute decompensation episode were consecutively allocated in a 1:1 ratio to monitoring arms. The diuretic dose, which provided 20a??% reduction in the Ea??/a??(EaSa) index value compared to initial value, was determined as adequate dose in echocardiography guided monitoring group. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), change in weight, NT pro-BNP level and dyspnea assessment on visual analogue scale (VAS) were analyzed at the end of the monitoring.Results Although the similar doses of diuretics were used in both groups, the patients with Ea??/a??(EaSa) index guided strategy had the substantial lower NT pro-BNP level within 72 hours after diuretic administration (2172 vs.2514 pga??/a??mL, p= 0.036). VAS score on dyspnea assessment was significantly better in the patients with Ea??/a??(EaSa) index guided strategy (52 vs. 65; p= 0.04).

Evidence over the past decade indicates that the interaction of genetic variation with changes in the intake of 18-carbon essential dietary omega-6 (n-6) and omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), linoleic acid (LA) and -linolenic acid (ALA), respectively, has impacted numerous molecular and clinical phenotypes. Interactions are particularly relevant with the FADS1 and FADS2 genes, which encode key fatty acid desaturases in the pathway that converts LA and ALA to their long chain (20 carbons), highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) counterparts. These gene by nutrient interactions affect the levels and balance of n-6 and n-3 HUFA that in turn are converted to a wide array of lipids with signaling roles, including eicosanoids, docosanoids, other oxylipins and endocannabinoids. With few exceptions, n-6 HUFA are precursors of pro-inflammatory/pro-thrombotic signaling lipids, and n-3 HUFA are generally anti-inflammatory/anti-thrombotic. We and others have demonstrated that African ancestry populations have much higher frequencies (vs. European-, Asian- or indigenous Americas-ancestry populations) of a FADS derived haplotype that is associated with the efficient conversion of high levels of dietary n-6 PUFA to pro-inflammatory n-6 HUFA. By contrast, an ancestral haplotype, carrying alleles associated with a limited capacity to synthesize HUFA, which can lead to n-3 HUFA deficiency, is found at high frequency in certain Hispanic populations and is nearly fixed in several indigenous populations from the Americas. Based on these observations, a focused secondary subgroup analysis of the VITAL n-3 HUFA supplementation trial stratifying the data based on self-reported ancestry revealed that African Americans may benefit from n-3 HUFA supplementation, and both ancestry and FADS variability should be factored into future clinical trials design.","output":"Interpreting Clinical Trials With Omega-3 Supplements in the Context of Ancestry and FADS Genetic Variation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on the reflection on these three misunderstandings for the design of negative pressure isolation ward, as well as a series of experimental studies, both the concept and the effective technology for effective isolation of airborne transmission were formed under the dynamic condition during the common operation of negative pressure isolation ward.","output":"Principle and Technology of Dynamic Isolation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Patients with COVID-19 infection present with a variety of clinical symptoms such as fever, diarrhea, dyspnea, anosmia and various electrolyte abnormalities Hypokalemia is an important electrolyte abnormality associated with infection due to SARS-CoV-2 as it may be associated with life threatening cardiac abnormalities","output":"Hypokalemia as a Surrogate Marker of Severity in COVID 19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Backround: This study aimed to determine the effects of LC n-3 PUFA supplementation on the prevention and treatment of obesity and obesity-related diseases, and to compare the efficiency of different LC n-3 PUFA sources via biochemical and genetic mechanisms in rats. Methods: Male Wistar rats were randomized into four study groups, and fed with a standard diet, High Fat Diet (HFD), HFD+%2.5 Fish Oil (FO-HFD) or HFD+%2.5 Krill Oil (KO-HFD) for eight weeks. Food consumption, weight gain, serum glucose, insulin, ghrelin and leptin concentrations, lipid profile, liver fatty acid composition, and FADS1 and FADS2 mRNA gene expression levels were measured. Results: Weight gain in each HFD group was significantly higher than control group (p < 0.001), without any differences among them (p < 0.05). LC n-3 PUFAs modified lipid profile, but not glucose tolerance. Serum leptin levels were significantly higher in HFD groups than in the control group, however, no difference in serum ghrelin levels was observed among the groups.

RNA interference (RNAi) pathways have emerged as important regulators of virusChost cell interactions. In this study, two siRNA expression plasmids (shN1 and shN2) were generated to target two different coding regions of the nucleocapsid protein (N) of PHEV. The shRNAs were transiently transfected into a porcine kidney cell line, PK-15, to determine whether these constructs inhibited PHEV production. Our results revealed that both shRNAs were highly capable of inhibiting viral RNA genome replication, especially shN2. Next, stable transfection of shN2 was used to produce two siRNA stably expressing PK-15 cell clones (shN2-1 and shN2-2), and these two lines were infected with PHEV. The analysis of cytopathic effects (CPE) demonstrated that shN2-1 and shN2-2 were capable of protecting cells against PHEV infection with high specificity and efficiency. Furthermore, effective inhibition of viral replication persisted for up to 120 h by a TCID(50) assay. These results indicated that RNAi targeting of the N gene could facilitate studies of the specific function of viral genes associated with PHEV replication and may have potential therapeutic applications.","output":"Inhibition of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus replication by short hairpin RNAs targeting of the nucleocapsid gene in a porcine kidney cell line"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fear of COVID-19 is associated with public health compliance but also with negative well-being; however, no articles have reported associations of such fear with perceived benefits and harms.

In a 6-day population-based cross-sectional online survey in May 2020, 4,890 adults provided data on fear and perceived benefits and harms, personal happiness and family well-being, and sociodemographic characteristics. Linear regression was used to analyze associations. The level of fear was moderate (mean score 6.3/10). Fewer respondents reported perceived benefits (10.6%-21.7%) than harms (13.4%-43.5%).

A scoping review was conducted to examine existing literature on the impact of preventative measures on communication and to characterize the clinical implications. METHOD: A systematic search of three electronic databases (Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL) was conducted yielding 2,158 articles. After removing duplicates and screening to determine inclusion eligibility, key data were extracted from the 50 included articles. Findings are reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews, including the PRISMA-ScR checklist. RESULTS: Studies fell into three categories: Studies addressing the impacts of personal protective equipment (PPE) and/or distancing on communication in healthcare contexts (n = 20); studies examining the impact of preventative measures on communication in everyday life (n = 13), and studies measuring the impact of face coverings on speech using acoustic and/or behavioral measures (n = 29). The review revealed that masks disrupt verbal and non-verbal communication, as well as emotional and social wellbeing and they impact people with hearing loss more than those without. These findings are presumably because opaque masks attenuate sound at frequencies above 1 kHz, and conceal the mouth and lips making lipreading impossible, and limit visibility of facial expressions. While surgical masks cause relatively little sound attenuation, transparent masks and face shields are highly attenuating. However, they are preferred by people with hearing loss because they give access to visual cues. CONCLUSION: Face coverings and social distancing has detrimental effects that extend well beyond verbal and non-verbal communication, by affecting wellbeing and quality of life. As these measures will likely be part of everyday life for the foreseeable future, we propose that it is necessary to support effective communication, especially in healthcare settings and for people with hearing loss.","output":"Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Virus (COVID-19) Preventative Measures on Communication: A Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies have shown that the prevalence of mental health problems is high among left-behind children (LBC).

We conducted this cross-sectional study in an economically disadvantaged area of China in May 2020. Information on socio-demographic factors, eating habits (the frequency of eating carbohydrates, fruits, vegetables, protein, and breakfast), and mental health problems (insomnia, depression, and anxiety) were collected among local adolescents.

Associations between dietary habits and mental health were analyzed by generalized linear models. Results indicated that the dietary pattern was unhealthy among LBC and even worse in females. Compared to routinely eating breakfast and fruits, lower frequencies of eating breakfast and fruits were identified as two significant factors with higher risks of mental health problems. Moreover, the association was more pronounced in females. Therefore, improving diet quality, particularly the frequency of eating breakfast and fruit intake may be an effective approach in the mental health promotion for LBC, especially for females.","output":"Care Their Diet and Mind: Association between Eating Habits and Mental Health in Chinese Left-behind Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the impact of the exceptional events of the 2020 pandemic and the government containment responses it triggered on two ethical issues that arose before the virus took its toll.

Eukaryotes use a series of complementary pathways to efficiently recognize and dispose of these terminally misfolded proteins.

Although there has been great progress in identifying ERAD components, how these factors accurately identify substrates remains poorly understood. The targeting of misfolded glycoproteins in the ER lumen for ERAD requires the lectin Yos9, which recognizes the glycan species found on terminally misfolded proteins. In a role that remains poorly characterized, Yos9 also binds the protein component of ERAD substrates. Here, we identified a 45-kDa domain of Yos9, consisting of residues 22-421, that is proteolytically stable, highly structured, and able to fully support ERAD in vivo.

Disease severity was mild in 155 (49%) of 318 patients, while severe disease requiring mechanical ventilation occurred in 45 (14%) of 318 patients-ie, 28 (15%) of 184 allogeneic HSCT recipients and 17 (13%) of 134 autologous HSCT recipients. At 30 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19, overall survival was 68% (95% CI 58-77) for recipients of allogeneic HSCT and 67% (55-78) for recipients of autologous HSCT. Age 50 years or older (hazard ratio 253, 95% CI 116-552; p=0020); male sex (353; 144-867; p=0006), and development of COVID-19 within 12 months of transplantation (267, 133-536; p=0005) were associated with a higher risk of mortality among allogeneic HSCT recipients, and a disease indication of lymphoma was associated with a higher risk of mortality compared with plasma cell disorder or myeloma (241, [108-538]; p=0033) in autologous HSCT recipients. INTERPRETATION: Recipients of autologous and allogeneic HSCT who develop COVID-19 have poor overall survival. These data emphasise the need for stringent surveillance and aggressive treatment measures in HSCT recipients who develop COVID-19.

These mutations enable the SARS-CoV-2 to evolve into new strains. Viral quasispecies emerge from de novo mutations that occur in individual patients. In combination, these sets of viral mutations provide distinct genetic fingerprints that reveal the patterns of transmission and have utility in contact tracing. METHODS: Leveraging thousands of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we performed a viral pangenome analysis to identify conserved genomic sequences. We used a rapid and highly efficient computational approach that relies on k-mers, short tracts of sequence, instead of conventional sequence alignment. Using this method, we annotated viral mutation signatures that were associated with specific strains. Based on these highly conserved viral sequences, we developed a rapid and highly scalable targeted sequencing assay to identify mutations, detect quasispecies variants, and identify mutation signatures from patients. These results were compared to the pangenome genetic fingerprints. RESULTS: We built a k-mer index for thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identified conserved genomics regions and landscape of mutations across thousands of virus genomes. We delineated mutation profiles spanning common genetic fingerprints (the combination of mutations in a viral assembly) and a combination of mutations that appear in only a small number of patients. We developed a targeted sequencing assay by selecting primers from the conserved viral genome regions to flank frequent mutations. Using a cohort of 100 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples, we identified genetic fingerprints consisting of strain-specific mutations seen across populations and de novo quasispecies mutations localized to individual infections. We compared the mutation profiles of viral samples undergoing analysis with the features of the pangenome. CONCLUSIONS: We conducted an analysis for viral mutation profiles that provide the basis of genetic fingerprints. Our study linked pangenome analysis with targeted deep sequenced SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples. We identified quasispecies mutations occurring within individual patients and determined their general prevalence when compared to over 70,000 other strains. Analysis of these genetic fingerprints may provide a way of conducting molecular contact tracing.","output":"Profiling SARS-CoV-2 mutation fingerprints that range from the viral pangenome to individual infection quasispecies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite a plethora of studies demonstrating significant morbidity and mortality due to community-acquired respiratory viral (CRV) infections in intensively treated hematology patients, and despite the availability of evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of respiratory viral infections in this setting, there is no uniform inclusion of respiratory viral infection management in the clinical hematology routine.

Medical and allied healthcare appointments and surgeries are being temporarily postponed. Mandatory self-isolation has created new obstacles for individuals with endometriosis seeking pain relief and improvement in their quality of life. Anxieties may be heightened by concerns over whether endometriosis may be an underlying condition that could predispose to severe COVID-19 infection and what constitutes an appropriate indication for presentation for urgent treatment in the epidemic. Furthermore, the restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 can impose negative psychological effects, which patients with endometriosis may be more prone to already. In combination with medical therapies, or as an alternative, we encourage patients to consider self-management strategies to combat endometriosis symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. These self-management strategies are divided into problem-focused and emotion-focused strategies, with the former aiming to change the environment to alleviate pain, and the latter address the psychology of living with endometriosis. We put forward this guidance, which is based on evidence and expert opinion, for healthcare providers to utilize during their consultations with patients via telephone or video. Patients may also independently use this article as an educational resource. The strategies discussed are not exclusively restricted to consideration during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Results and Discussions: Severe manifestations in COVID-19 patients are due to immune system response. MSCs have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effect and therefore may be beneficial to alleviate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A small published study showed that MSCs had beneficial effect on COVID-19 patients, who showed clinical symptom improvements.

Here, we show cysteine protease Cathepsin L (CatL) involvement with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 from different points of view. CatL is a lysosomal enzyme that participates in numerous physiological processes, including apoptosis, antigen processing, and extracellular matrix remodeling. CatL is implicated in pathological conditions like invasion and metastasis of tumors, inflammatory status, atherosclerosis, renal disease, diabetes, bone diseases, viral infection, and other diseases. CatL expression is up-regulated during chronic inflammation and is involved in degrading extracellular matrix, an important process for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host cells. In addition, CatL is probably involved in processing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. As its inhibition is detrimental to SARS-CoV-2 infection and possibly exit from cells during late stages of infection, CatL could have been considered a valuable therapeutic target. Therefore, we describe here some drugs already in the market with potential CatL inhibiting capacity that could be used to treat COVID-19 patients.

This empirical gap hampers the understanding of the implications of these visual changes, especially since the MC and PC pathways are thought to sustain central bottom-up and top-down processes during cognitive processing. They thus influence our ability to efficiently monitor our environment and make the most effective decisions. To overcome this limitation, we measured PC-inferred spatial and MC-inferred temporal resolution in 35 individuals with SAUD and 30 healthy controls. We used Landolt circles displaying small apertures outside the sensitivity range of MC cells or flickering at a temporal frequency exceeding PC sensitivity. We found evidence of preserved PC spatial resolution combined with impaired MC temporal resolution in SAUD. We also measured how spatial and temporal sensitivity is influenced by the prior presentation of fearful faces - as emotional content could favor MC processing over PC one - but found no evidence of emotional modulation in either group. This spatio-temporal dissociation implies that individuals with SAUD may process visual details efficiently but perceive rapidly updating visual information at a slower pace. This deficit has implications for the tracking of rapidly changing stimuli in experimental tasks, but also for the decoding of crucial everyday visual incentives such as faces, whose micro-expressions vary continuously.

We observed that human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are receptive to these EVs, and viral genes were detectable in the cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, the uptake of viral RNA-harboring EVs led to an upregulation of inflammation-related genes in hiPSC-CMs. Thus, our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 RNA containing EVs represents an indirect route of viral RNA entry into cardiomyocytes.","output":"Detection of viral RNA fragments in human iPSC cardiomyocytes following treatment with extracellular vesicles from SARS-CoV-2 coding sequence overexpressing lung epithelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The eradication of infectious diseases has been achieved only once in history, in 1980, with smallpox.

Despite education, some patients still do not recognise potential COVID symptoms. AIMS: We assessed patient knowledge of COVID, and its impact on their behaviours, concerns, and healthcare experience. METHODS: A 16-page questionnaire was distributed to 120 oncology patients attending the day unit of a tertiary Irish cancer centre for systemic anti-cancer therapy (May/June 2020). The Irish 7-day COVID incidence during this period ranged from 2 to 11 cases/100,000 people. RESULTS: One hundred and one responses were received, 1% had tested positive for COVID, and 31% had undergone testing. Participant insight into their knowledge about COVID and their own behaviour was limited in some cases. Seventy-five percent reported total compliance with restrictions, but many were not fully compliant. Self-reported confidence in knowledge was high, but did not predict demonstrated knowledge. Sixty percent did not recognise two or more symptoms; 40% did not self-identify as high-risk. Patients reported more health-related worry (72%), loneliness (51%), and lower mood (42%) since the pandemic began. Financial toxicity worsened, with increased financial worry (78%), reductions in household income (40%), and increased costs due to lockdown (62%). Use of facemasks introduced new communications barriers for 67% of those with hearing loss.

METHODS The Task Force was composed of 9 pediatric rheumatologists, 2 adult rheumatologists, 2 pediatric cardiologists, 2 pediatric infectious disease specialists, and 1 pediatric critical care physician. Preliminary statements addressing clinical questions related to MIS-C and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 were developed based on evidence reports. Consensus was built through a modified Delphi process that involved anonymous voting and discussion through webinars. A 9-point scale was used to determine the appropriateness of each statement (1-3, inappropriate; 4-6, uncertain; 7-9, appropriate), and consensus was rated as low (L), moderate (M), or high (H) based on dispersion of the votes along the numeric scale. Approved guidance statements had to be classified as appropriate with moderate or high levels of consensus, which were pre-specified prior to voting. RESULTS The first version of the guidance was approved by the Task Force in June 2020 and consisted of 40 final guidance statements accompanied by a flow diagram depicting the diagnostic pathway for MIS-C.

The purpose of this study was to determine if salubrinal, an enhancer of the unfolded protein response, reduces the neural damage modulating the inflammatory response. The study was performed in CA1 and CA3 hippocampal areas as well as in the cerebral cortex whose different vulnerability to ischemic damage is widely described. Characterization of proteins was made by western blot, immunofluorescence, and ELISA, whereas mRNA levels were measured by Quantitative PCR. The salubrinal treatment decreased the cell demise in CA1 at 7 days as well as the levels of matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9) in CA1 and cerebral cortex at 48 h and ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 cell adhesion molecules. However, increases in tumor necrosis factor  and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) inflammatory markers were observed at 24 h. Glial fibrillary acidic protein levels were not modified by salubrinal treatment in CA1 and cerebral cortex. We describe a neuroprotective effect of the post-ischemic treatment with salubrinal, measured as a decrease both in CA1 cell demise and in the blood-brain barrier impairment. We hypothesize that the ability of salubrinal to counteract the CA1 cell demise is because of a reduced ability of this structure to elicit unfolded protein response which would account for its greater ischemic vulnerability. Data of both treated and non-treated animals suggest that the neurovascular unit present a structure-dependent response to ischemia and a different course time for CA1/cerebral cortex compared with CA3. Finally, our study reveals a high responsiveness of endothelial cells to salubrinal in contrast to the limited responsiveness of astrocytes. The alleviation of ER stress by enhancing UPR with salubrinal treatment reduces the ischemic damage. This effect varies across the different neurovascular unit cell types. The salubrinal neuroprotective effect on CA1 supports differences in neurovascular unit for different brain regions and involves the inflammatory response and its time course.

By exploring how the key dimensions of the resilient health system framework are applied, the present systematic review synthesizes the vital features of resilient health systems in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this review is to ascertain the relevance of health system resilience in the context of a major shock, through better understanding its dimensions, uses and implications. METHODS The review uses the best-fit framework synthesis approach. An a priori conceptual framework was selected and a coding framework created. A systematic search identified 4284 unique citations from electronic databases and reports by non-governmental organisations, 12 of which met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted and coded against the pre-existing themes. Themes outside of the a priori framework were collated to form a refined list of themes. Then, all twelve studies were revisited using the new list of themes in the context of each study. RESULTS Ten themes were generated from the analysis. Five confirmed the a priori conceptual framework that capture the dynamic attributes of a resilient system. Five new themes were identified as foundational for achieving resilience: realigned relationships, foresight and motivation as drivers, and emergency preparedness and change management as organisational mechanisms. CONCLUSION The refined conceptual model shows how the themes inter-connect. The foundations of resilience appear to be critical especially in resource-constrained settings to unlock the dynamic attributes of resilience.

Preinfection with pH1N1 resulted in modulation of adhesion- and invasion-associated MRSA virulence factors during lag phase bacterial replication. Host response modulation in coinfected alveolar epithelial cells were primarily related to TLR- and inflammatory response-mediated cell signaling events. While less extensive in cocultured endothelial cells, coinfection resulted in changes to cellular stress response- and TLR-related signaling events.

We offer both a framework for understanding the mental health impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on physicians while proposing a systems based model to respond to these challenges.","output":"Burnout and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: Intersection, Impact, and Interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a post-COVID-19 world, extensive study of deep learning-based biometric authentication techniques prompts the need to secure them. Further, the biometric data is assumed to be largely immutable;thus, if it is compromised, it is lost forever. Hence, reliable and secure biometric authentication is of utmost importance. In this paper, we address the security and privacy concerns of biometric templates generated via deep networks. We propose a cancelable biometric authentication approach. The framework consists of a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a few-shot enrollment for generating biometric templates. Further, to enhance biometric templates discriminative power and to provide revocability, biometric templates are projected onto a random subspace (based on the user-specific key). Later projected biometric templates are mapped onto robust n-bit unique codes (using a KNN classifier) and protected via. SHA-3 hash digest. Moreover, a real-world biometric authentication system is always dynamic (users keep on changing). Thus we have also integrated phase-wise incremental learning within a deep learning-based cancelable biometric authentication framework. This is the first work in which deep cancelable templates are generated incrementally to the best of our knowledge. We analyze the proposed scheme for its performance and privacy preservation on three benchmarks constrained iris data-sets and over one unconstrained iris data-set along with one publicly available knuckle data-set. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the proposed cancelable incremental framework strictly follows the four fundamental properties of cancelability viz. non-invertibility, unlinkability, revocability, and usability.","output":"A generic framework for deep incremental cancelable template generation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Originating from Wuhan, China, COVID-19 has rapidly spread worldwide Neurological manifestations are more commonly associated with severe COVID-19 infection Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) is a rare immune-mediated postinfectious neuropathy It has been reported as a possible rare complication of COVID-19 We report a case of GBS associated with COVID-19 in the UK","output":"Guillain-Barr syndrome associated with COVID-19 infection: a case from the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder that in many cases is associated with mental health disorders, in addition to characteristic symptoms such as hyperphagia. The current Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has led to massive restrictions in health care and social life worldwide. People with PWS represent a particularly vulnerable population group to these restrictions, with unknown impact on their mental health. METHODS: We conducted an online questionnaire to assess the impact of the restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of people with PWS. RESULTS: One hundred and eight caregivers completed the survey about individuals with PWS. Individuals with PWS > 6 years (n = 89) were included for evaluation with regard to psychopathological change. Respondents frequently reported an increase in psychopathological symptoms associated with PWS during the lockdown, with 51.7% reporting increased temper outbursts, 43.8% showing signs of sadness, 38.2% being anxious, 55.0% more irritable, and 39.3% showing more food seeking behaviour. Adjusted for the type of accommodation food seeking behaviour and irritability is increased to a significantly lesser extent in people with PWS accommodated in specialised care facilities compared with those living in their family home. No significant difference could be found between the sexes. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant effect on the mental health of individuals with PWS, evidenced by an increase in behaviours associated with PWS, including temper outbursts, food-seeking, and irritability, which again underlines their need for specialised care. Individuals living with their families were particularly vulnerable, indicating that they and their families are in special need of support.","output":"Behavioural change in Prader-Willi syndrome during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are a leading cause of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs). Although HPIV-4 has been associated with mild ARTIs for years, recent investigations have also associated HPIV-4 infection with severe respiratory syndromes and with outbreaks of ARTIs in children. Objectives To characterize the role of HPIV-4 and its clinical features in children with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs) in Beijing, China. Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 2009 hospitalized children with ALRTIs between March 2007 and April 2010. RT-PCR and PCR analyses were used to identify HPIV types and other known respiratory viruses. Results HPIVs were detected in 246 (12.2%) patients, of whom 25 (10.2%) were positive for HPIV-4, 11 (4.5%) for HPIV-2, 51 (20.7%) for HPIV-1, 151 (61.4%) for HPIV-3, and 8 (3.3%) were co-detected with different types of HPIVs. Like HPIV-3, HPIV-4 was detected in spring, summer, and late fall over the study period. Seasonal incidence varied for HPIV-1 and -2. The median patient age was 20 months for HPIV-4 infections and 7C11 months for HPIV-1, -2, and -3 infections, but the clinical manifestations did not differ significantly between HPIV-1, -2, -3, and -4 infections. Moreover, co-detection of HPIV-4 (44%) with other respiratory viruses was lower than that of HPIV-1 (62.7%), HPIV-2 (63.6%), and HPIV-3 (72.7%). Conclusions HPIV-4 plays an important role in Chinese paediatric ALRTIs. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics reported here improve our understanding of the pathogenesis associated with HPIV-4.","output":"Human parainfluenza virus type 4 infection in Chinese children with lower respiratory tract infections: A comparison study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Employees in female-dominated sectors are exposed to high workloads, emotional job demands, and role ambiguity, and often have insufficient resources to deal with these demands. This imbalance causes strain, threatening employees work ability. The aim of this study was to examine whether resource-providing leadership at the workplace level buffers against the negative repercussions of these job demands on work ability. Employees (N = 2383) from 290 work groups across three countries (Germany, Finland, and Sweden) in female-dominated sectors were asked to complete questionnaires in this study. Employees rated their immediate supervisors resource-providing leadership and also self-reported their work ability, role ambiguity, workload, and emotional demands. Multilevel modeling was performed to predict individual work ability with job demands as employee-level predictors, and leadership as a group-level predictor. Work ability was poor when employees reported high workloads, high role ambiguity, and high emotional demands. Resource-providing leadership at the group level had a positive impact on employees work ability. We observed a cross-level interaction between emotional demands and resource-providing leadership. We conclude that resource-providing leadership buffers against the repercussions of emotional demands for the work ability of employees in female-dominated sectors; however, it is not influential in dealing with workload or role ambiguity.","output":"The Cross-Level Moderation Effect of Resource-Providing Leadership on the DemandsWork Ability Relationship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19, is a disease outbreak that was first identified in Wuhan, a Central Chinese city In this report, a short analysis focusing on Australia, Italy, and the United Kingdom is conducted The analysis includes confirmed and recovered cases and deaths, the growth rate in Australia compared with that in Italy and the United Kingdom, and the trend of the disease in different Australian regions Mathematical approaches based on susceptible, infected, and recovered (SIR) cases and susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined, and recovered (SEIQR) cases models are proposed to predict epidemiology in the above-mentioned countries Since the performance of the classic forms of SIR and SEIQR depends on parameter settings, some optimization algorithms, namely BroydenCFletcherCGoldfarbCShanno (BFGS), conjugate gradients (CG), limited memory bound constrained BFGS ( L-BFGS-B), and NelderCMead, are proposed to optimize the parameters and the predictive capabilities of the SIR and SEIQR models The results of the optimized SIR and SEIQR models were compared with those of two well-known machine learning algorithms, i e , the Prophet algorithm and logistic function The results demonstrate the different behaviors of these algorithms in different countries as well as the better performance of the improved SIR and SEIQR models Moreover, the Prophet algorithm was found to provide better prediction performance than the logistic function, as well as better prediction performance for Italy and UK cases than for Australian cases Therefore, it seems that the Prophet algorithm is suitable for data with an increasing trend in the context of a pandemic Optimization of SIR and SEIQR model parameters yielded a significant improvement in the prediction accuracy of the models Despite the availability of several algorithms for trend predictions in this pandemic, there is no single algorithm that would be optimal for all cases","output":"Analysis and Prediction of COVID-19 Using SIR, SEIQR and Machine Learning Models: Australia, Italy and UK Cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the midst of the Spring 2020 initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York, members of the Psychiatry Department of Weill Cornell Medicine/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital rapidly created and implemented a brief, behavioral skills-based intervention program, CopeNYP, to address the immediate mental health needs of the employees of the hospital and medical school.

The RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection was positive with an epidemiologic link 72 hours before onset of symptoms. Methods: The patient was referred to Gutierrez Childrens Hospital intensive care unit (ICU), where she was diagnosed with TEN, bibasal pneumonia and MIS, gammaglobulin and corticosteroids therapy was indicated. She had severe ocular compromise, with bilateral bullous lesions on eyelids and extensive corneal ulcer. We performed amniotic membrane transplantation and placed a symblepharon ring in order to minimize the destructive inflammation and damage of the ocular surface during acute phase. Results: Patient evolution was favorable. She was transferred to the COVID-19 unit after 10 days. Complete reabsorption of amniotic membrane was confirmed in 15 days, symblepharon ring was removed and continued with preservative-free lubricant, cyclosporine 0.05% and serum tears drops. After 35 days of hospitalization, she was discharged with regulated multidisciplinary controls. The patient achieved best-corrected visual acuity 20/20 in both eyes, with moderate dry eye symptoms and localized trichiasis. Conclusion/Relevance: In this case, a strong correlation of COVID-19 with TEN was suspected. TEN is a potentially devastating disease that involves permanent painful visual problems.

This study was undertaken to identify the major phase I metabolites of PAP-1 in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. 2. Five phase I metabolites, that is 5-(oxybutyric-acid)psoralen (M1), 5-[4-(4-hydroxybutoxy)]psoralen (M2), 5-[4-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)butoxy]psoralen (M3), 5-[4-(3-hydroxyphenoxy)butoxy]psoralen (M4), and 8-hydroxyl-5-(4-phenoxybutoxy)psoralen (M5), were isolated from the bile of rats and identified by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy.

Incubation of PAP-1 with SD rat liver microsomes rendered the same five major metabolites in a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent manner suggesting that cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are involved in PAP-1 metabolism. Inhibitors of rat CYP1A1/2 (alpha-naphthoflavone) and CYP3A (ketoconazole) but not CYP2D6 (quinidine), CYP2E (diethyldithiocarbamate), or CYP2C9 (sulphaphenazole) blocked the metabolism of PAP-1 in rat microsomes. 4.

This study aimed to derive a parsimonious model for predicting overall survival (OS) among re-infected COVID-19 patients using machine-learning algorithms. METHODS: The retrospective data of 283 re-infected COVID-19 patients admitted to twenty-six medical centers (affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences) from 10 June to 26 December 2020 were reviewed and analyzed. An elastic-net regularized Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression and model approximation via backward elimination were utilized to optimize a predictive model of time to in-hospital death. The model was further reduced to its core features to maximize simplicity and generalizability. RESULTS: The empirical in-hospital mortality rate among the re-infected COVID-19 patients was 9.5%. In addition, the mortality rate among the intubated patients was 83.5%. Using the Kaplan-Meier approach, the OS (95% CI) rates for days 7, 14, and 21 were 87.5% (81.6-91.6%), 78.3% (65.0-87.0%), and 52.2% (20.3-76.7%), respectively. The elastic-net Cox PH regression retained 8 out of 35 candidate features of death. Transfer by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) (HR=3.90, 95% CI: 1.63-9.48), SpO(2)85% (HR=8.10, 95% CI: 2.97-22.00), increased serum creatinine (HR=1.85, 95% CI: 1.48-2.30), and increased white blood cells (WBC) count (HR=1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.15) were associated with higher in-hospital mortality rates in the re-infected COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The results of the machine-learning analysis demonstrated that transfer by EMS, profound hypoxemia (SpO(2)85%), increased serum creatinine (more than 1.6 mg/dL), and increased WBC count (more than 8.5 (10(9) cells/L)) reduced the OS of the re-infected COVID-19 patients.

The web interface means that interactions with the 3D specimens are controlled by mouse movements, which can be less intuitive and confusing. We have developed a technology that allows students to manipulate and turn the 3D specimens with 6 degrees of freedom using their mobile phones as a controller. The VanVR APP was created using multiple development tools such as Unity Engine for the overall environment setup and UI implementation, C# scripts for the interactive functionalities, 3D photogrammetry for specimen visualization, MongoDB for database, render Unity built WebGL and deployed the web app on Azure app service. To improve the interactivity and increase the intuitive design of the application, a new functionality of mobile gyro control was implemented using Photon to connect with the 3D specimens in WebGL using generated pairing code to match the web app and the mobile device in a virtual room. The orientation of the phone is transmitted to a spherical model in WebGL, which accordingly transforms the coordinates of any chosen specimen displayed in front of the user. This means that simply by tilting a phone like a gyro controller, users will be able to intuitively mirror how the specimen rotates in the virtual lab with significantly more freedom than the traditional mouse movement control. Along with the functionality of zooming in/out and comparing different models side by side, the app simulates the feeling of handling a specimen physically. In addition, learners can view the documented annotations tailored to each specimen illustrating details of various regions on the model. The addition of the mobile gyro control gives a more natural way to examine the specimen.

It is rationally designed and manufactured by facile electrospinning. PDCJF is firstly constructed using 2,7-dibromo-9-fluorenone (DBF) with photoconductive and luminescent properties. Janus nanofibers are respectively used as the building units to construct the top layer (T-PDCJF) and the bottom layer (B-PDCJF) of PDCJF. The two layers are tightly bonded to form PDCJF. Under light irradiation, there is photosensitive dual-anisotropic conduction in PDCJF, but there is no anisotropic conduction without light. Thus, the transition of PDCJF from mono-functional magnetism to tri-functionalities is realized under light and without light. The luminescence color of PDCJF is tunable and it emits white-light. This is made possible by modulating the amounts of luminescent substances and excitation wavelength. The microscopic Janus nanofibers used as building units and macroscopic Janus film structure ensure high photosensitive dual-anisotropic conduction and excellent fluorescence in PDCJF. The two-dimensional (2D) PDCJF is rolled to obtain three-dimensional (3D) Janus-type tubes and 2D plus 3D complete flag-like structures with exceptional multi-functionalities.

We observed the protein-induced structural changes of the amphiphilic glycopeptide assembly in the lipid bilayer membrane using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier transform infrared reflection-absorption spectra (FTIR-RAS) measurements. The glycopeptides re-arranged to form a bundle that acted as an ion channel due to the interaction among the target protein and the terminal sugar groups of the glycopeptides. The bundle in the lipid bilayer membrane was fixed on a gold-deposited quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) electrode by the membrane fusion method. The protein-induced re-arrangement of the terminal sugar groups formed a binding site that acted as a receptor, and the re-binding of the target protein to the binding site induced the closing of the channel. We monitored the detection of target proteins by the changes of the electrochemical properties of the membrane. The response current of the membrane induced by the target protein recognition was expressed by an equivalent circuit consisting of resistors and capacitors when a triangular voltage was applied. We used peanut lectin (PNA) and concanavalin A (ConA) as target proteins. The sensing membrane induced by PNA shows the specific response to PNA, and the ConA-induced membrane responded selectively to ConA. Furthermore, PNA-induced sensing membranes showed relatively low recognition ability for lectin from Ricinus Agglutinin (RCA120) and mushroom lectin (ABA), which have galactose binding sites. The protein-induced self-organization formed the spatial arrangement of the sugar chains specific to the binding site of the target protein.

If a gastric tube can be guided into the esophagus under direct vision with a video laryngoscope, misplacement of the gastric tube into the trachea can be avoided. We compared gastric tube insertion under direct vision using a video laryngoscope with the conventional method of blind insertion. METHODS We enrolled 60 patients who required a transnasal gastric tube to facilitate elective abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. The participants were recruited consecutively into one of two groups, a group of 30 patients in whom a gastric tube was inserted using a King Vision? video laryngoscope (KV group), and a group of 30 patients who underwent conventional blind insertion of the gastric tube (Blind group). The success rate, the time taken to insert the gastric tube, and the incidence of complications were compared. RESULTS In the KV group, the time required for gastric tube placement was 52.5  17.1 seconds, with a success rate of 100%. Slight oral hemorrhage occurred in two participants and slight epistaxis in one participant. In the Blind group, the time required for gastric tube placement was 65.9  39.9 seconds, with a success rate of 90% (27 out of 30 patients). Slight oral hemorrhage occurred in two participants, slight epistaxis occurred in two participants, and tracheal malposition occurred in one participant but was detected promptly and corrected using the video laryngoscope. There were no significant differences in the time required for placing the gastric tube, the success rate, or the incidence of complications between the groups.

These symptoms include low platelet count, severe hypoxia, increased inflammatory cytokines and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Additionally, severe COVID-19 is associated with several chronic co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The identification of genetic risk factors that impact differential host responses to SARS-CoV-2, resulting in the development of severe COVID-19, is important in gaining greater understanding into the biological mechanisms underpinning life-threatening responses to the virus. These insights could be used in the identification of high-risk individuals and for the development of treatment strategies for these patients. METHODS As of June 6, 2020, there were 976 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were hospitalized, indicating they had a severe response to SARS-CoV-2. There were however too few patients with a mild form of COVID-19 to use this cohort as our control population. Instead we used similar control criteria to our previous study looking at shared genetic risk factors between severe COVID-19 and sepsis, selecting controls who had not developed sepsis despite having maximum co-morbidity risk and exposure to sepsis-causing pathogens. RESULTS Using a combinatorial (high-order epistasis) analysis approach, we identified 68 protein-coding genes that were highly associated with severe COVID-19. At the time of analysis, nine of these genes have been linked to differential response to SARS-CoV-2. We also found many novel targets that are involved in key biological pathways associated with the development of severe COVID-19, including production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, endothelial cell dysfunction, lipid droplets, neurodegeneration and viral susceptibility factors. CONCLUSION The variants we found in genes relating to immune response pathways and cytokine production cascades, were in equal proportions across all severe COVID-19 patients, regardless of their co-morbidities. This suggests that such variants are not associated with any specific co-morbidity, but are common amongst patients who develop severe COVID-19. Among the 68 severe COVID-19 risk-associated genes, we found several druggable protein targets and pathways. Nine are targeted by drugs that have reached at least Phase I clinical trials, and a further eight have active chemical starting points for novel drug development. Several of these targets were particularly enriched in specific co-morbidities, providing insights into shared pathological mechanisms underlying both the development of severe COVID-19, ARDS and these predisposing co-morbidities. We can use these insights to identify patients who are at greatest risk of contracting severe COVID-19 and develop targeted therapeutic strategies for them, with the aim of improving disease burden and survival rates.","output":"Analysis of Genetic Host Response Risk Factors in Severe COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Lyme disease incidence is increasing, despite current prevention options. New Lyme disease vaccine candidates are in development, however, investigation of the acceptability of a Lyme disease vaccine among potential consumers is needed prior to any vaccine coming to market. We conducted a population-based, cross-sectional study to estimate willingness to receive a potential Lyme disease vaccine and factors associated with willingness. METHODS The web-based survey was administered to a random sample of Connecticut, Maryland, Minnesota, and New York residents June-July 2018. Survey-weighted descriptive statistics were conducted to estimate the proportion willing to receive a potential Lyme disease vaccine. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression models were used to quantify the association of sociodemographic characteristics and Lyme disease vaccine attitudes with willingness to be vaccinated. RESULTS Surveys were completed by 3313 respondents (6% response rate). We estimated that 64% of residents were willing to receive a Lyme disease vaccine, while 30% were uncertain and 7% were unwilling. Compared to those who were willing, those who were uncertain were more likely to be parents, adults 45-65 years old, non-White, have less than a bachelor's degree, or have safety concerns about a potential Lyme disease vaccine. Those who were unwilling were also more likely to be non-White, have less than a bachelor's degree, or have safety concerns about a potential Lyme disease vaccine. In addition, the unwilling had low confidence in vaccines in general, had low perceived risk of contracting Lyme disease, and said they would not be influenced by a positive recommendation from a healthcare provider. DISCUSSION Overall, willingness to receive a Lyme disease vaccine was high. Effective communication by clinicians regarding safety and other vaccine parameters to those groups who are uncertain will be critical for increasing vaccine uptake and reducing Lyme disease incidence.","output":"Evaluating public acceptability of a potential Lyme disease vaccine using a population-based, cross-sectional survey in high incidence areas of the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has attracted the attention of scientists where it has a high mortality rate among older adults and individuals suffering from chronic diseases, such as chronic kidney diseases (CKD) It is important to elucidate molecular mechanisms by which COVID-19 affects the kidneys and accordingly develop proper nutritional and pharmacological strategies Although numerous studies have recently recommended several approaches for the management of COVID-19 in CKD, its impact on patients with renal diseases remains the biggest challenge worldwide In this paper, we review the most recent evidence regarding causality, potential nutritional supplements, therapeutic options, and management of COVID-19 infection in vulnerable individuals and patients with CKD To date, there is no effective treatment for COVID-19-induced kidney dysfunction, and current treatments are yet limited to anti-inflammatory (e g ibuprofen) and anti-viral medications (e g Remdesivir, and Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine) that may increase the chance of treatment In conclusion, the knowledge about kidney damage in COVID-19 is very limited, and this review improves our ability to introduce novel approaches for future clinical trials for this contiguous disease","output":"Kidney diseases and COVID-19 infection: causes and effect, supportive therapeutics and nutritional perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We describe the large-scale self-initiated recruitment of patients to a self-monitoring initiative for macular pathologic features during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. DESIGN: Observational study with retrospective analysis. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2272 patients from the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) whose visits were rescheduled over lockdown (April 13CJune 1, 2020) were offered participation in a self-monitoring initiative administered by SNEC with the Alleye application (Switzerland) as the testing instrument. METHODS: This was an observational study with retrospective analysis. Demographics and characteristics were compared between those who signed up and those who did not. Similar comparisons were made between patients who complied with the initiative versus those who did not. Outcomes were tracked for 6 months starting from the commencement of lockdown. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participation and compliance rates and characteristics of patients who were more likely to participate and comply with the initiative. RESULTS: Seven hundred thirty-two patients (32%) participated in this self-monitoring initiative. Those who participated were younger (62 years of age vs. 68 years of age; P < 0.001), men, and living with family. Patients not receiving treatment and those with poorer vision in the worse-seeing eye were more likely to participate. When grouped according to diagnosis, the proportion who participated was highest for diabetic macular edema (52%), nonneovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD; 42%), diabetic retinopathy (35%), retinal vein occlusions (18%), and neovascular AMD (15%; P < 0.001). Testing compliance rate was 43% (315/732). Patients who complied with the initiative were older, were receiving treatment, and had poorer vision in the worse-seeing eye. Trigger events occurred in 33 patients, with 5 patients having clinically verified disease progression (1.6%). CONCLUSIONS: We provide clinical data on characteristics of patients with stable retinal diseases who were offered, participated in, and complied with a self-monitoring program. The lower participation rate compared with standardized clinical studies reflects the difficulties in implementation for such initiatives in clinical settings. Despite this, self-monitoring continues to show promise in relieving clinic resources, suggesting the feasibility of scaling such programs beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Patterns and Characteristics of a Clinical Implementation of a Self-Monitoring Program for Retina Diseases during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak rapidly became a worldwide pandemic in early 2020.

Retaining the infectivity of the rVSV-S during the downstream process was challenged by the shear sensitivity of the enveloped rVSV-S and its membrane protruding spike protein. Through a series of screening experiments, we evaluated and established the required endonuclease treatment conditions, filter train composition, and hollow fiber-tangential flow filtration parameters to remove large particles, reduce the load of impurities, and concentrate and exchange the buffer while retaining rVSV-S infectivity.

Overall, approximately 40% of viral recovery was obtained and the regulatory requirements of less than 10 ng host cell DNA per dose were met. However, while 86-97% of the host cell proteins were removed, the regulatory acceptable HCP levels were not achieved, requiring subsequent purification and polishing steps.

Building on this, the German Network for Autopsies in Pandemics (DEFEAT PANDEMIcs) was established on 1 September 2020. RESULTS: The main goal of DeRegCOVID is to collect and distribute de facto anonymized data on potentially all autopsies of people who have died from COVID-19 in Germany in order to meet the need for centralized, coordinated, and structured data collection and reporting during the pandemic. The success of the registry strongly depends on the willingness of the respective centers to report the data, which has developed very positively so far and requires special thanks to all participating centers.

Contradicting this view, we show here that the T cell repertoire specific for two different latent herpes viruses in the peripheral blood displayed significant contemporaneous co-fluctuations of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells. The coordinated responses to two different viruses suggest that the fluctuations within the T cell repertoire may be driven by sub-clinical viral reactivation or a more generalized 'bystander' effect. The later contention was supported by the observation that, while absolute number of CD3(+) T cells and their subsets and also the cell surface phenotype of antigen-specific T cells remained relatively constant, a loss of CD62L expression in the total CD8(+) T cell population was coincident with the expansion of tetramer-positive virus-specific T cells.

Viruses are frequently involved in asthma exacerbations. OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of measuring serum IgG concentrations in asthma exacerbations and assess their link with viral infections in patients hospitalized for asthma. METHODS: Patients hospitalized for asthma exacerbation were included in an observational study from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2015. Serum IgG concentrations on admission were compared between patients with a positive upper airway viral sample and those with a negative viral sample. RESULTS: Among the 82 patients included, those with positive viral nasopharyngeal samples (n = 40) presented with lower serum IgG concentrations during exacerbation than those with a negative viral sample (n = 42) (10.1  2.3 g/L vs 11.5  3.6 g/L; P < .05). The median concentration of serum IgG was lower in patients hospitalized for more than 3 days compared with those hospitalized for less than 3 days (10.0 g/L [8.2-12.4] vs 11.4 g/L [10.1-12.8]; P < .05) and in patients who received oral corticosteroid therapy for more than 5 days compared with those treated with oral steroids for less than 5 days (10.1 g/L [8.3-12.2] vs 11.6 g/L [10.0-13.8]; P < .05).

There is still no clear priority for the choice of lung ultrasound protocol in an outpatient setting. Aim: The objective of the study was to evaluate the applicability of 12-zone protocol lung ultrasound for the diagnosis of COVID-19 associated pneumonia in outpatients. Materials and methods: We examined 39 outpatients meeting the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 infection (17 men and 22 women) aged 31C75 years (median 49 years). All patients underwent lung ultrasound immediately after chest computed tomography performed by a blinded specialist. Correlation analysis of the results of a quantitative assessment of the detected signs, assessment of the diagnostic significance of lung ultrasound for identifying signs of pneumonia were performed. Results: Pneumonia was diagnosed by computed tomography in 25 (64%; 95% CI 47C79) out of 39 patients. At the same time, ultrasound signs of interstitial abnormalities were detected in 31 patients. Multiple (narrow) B-lines, confluent (wide) B-lines, as well as areas of subpleural consolidation and white lung were the most common lung ultrasound abnormalities. When evaluating the method, the optimal sensitivity/specificity ratio was obtained for a value of 2 points, the area under the curve = 0.970 (95% CI 0.858C0.999; p <0.0001). The score of lung ultrasound significantly correlated with computed tomography quantitative assessment (r = 0.928, p <0.001). Conclusion: Despite some limitations, lung ultrasound can be extremely useful in primary care settings, also in the case of a significant number of admitted patients, to detect features of COVID-19 associated pneumonia.","output":"Diagnostic value of 12-zone lung ultrasound protocol for diagnosing COVID-19-associated pneumonia in outpatients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The present study compared the predictive performance of pretreatment computed tomography (CT)-based radiomics signatures and clinicopathological and CT morphological factors for ligand programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression level and tumor mutation burden (TMB) status and further explored predictive models in patients with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: A total of 120 patients with advanced-stage NSCLC were enrolled in this retrospective study and randomly assigned to a training dataset or validation dataset. Here, 462 radiomics features were extracted from region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation based on pretreatment CT images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and logistic regression were applied to select radiomics features and develop combined models with clinical and morphological factors for PD-L1 expression and TMB status prediction. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the accuracy, and the predictive performance of these models was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) analyses. RESULTS: The PD-L1-positive expression level correlated with differentiation degree (p = 0.005), tumor shape (p = 0.006), and vascular convergence (p = 0.007). Stage (p = 0.023), differentiation degree (p = 0.017), and vacuole sign (p = 0.016) were associated with TMB status. Radiomics signatures showed good performance for predicting PD-L1 and TMB with AUCs of 0.730 and 0.759, respectively. Predictive models that combined radiomics signatures with clinical and morphological factors dramatically improved the predictive efficacy for PD-L1 (AUC = 0.839) and TMB (p = 0.818). The results were verified in the validation datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative CT-based radiomics features have potential value in the classification of PD-L1 expression levels and TMB status.

The use of positron emission tomography (PET) would further increase the resolution and quantification accuracy of Affibody-based imaging. The rapid in vivo kinetics of Affibody molecules permit the use of the generator-produced radionuclide (68)Ga (T1/2=67.6 min). Earlier studies have demonstrated that the chemical nature of chelators has a substantial influence on the biodistribution properties of Affibody molecules. To determine an optimal labeling approach, the macrocyclic chelators 1,4,7,10-tetraazacylododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-N,N,N-triacetic acid (NOTA) and 1-(1,3-carboxypropyl)-1,4,7- triazacyclononane-4,7-diacetic acid (NODAGA) were conjugated to the N-terminus of the synthetic Affibody molecule ZHER2:S1 targeting HER2. Affibody molecules were labeled with (68)Ga, and their binding specificity and cellular processing were evaluated. The biodistribution of (68)Ga-DOTA-ZHER2:S1, (68)Ga-NOTA-ZHER2:S1 and (68)Ga-NODAGA-ZHER2:S1, as well as that of their (111)In-labeled counterparts, was evaluated in BALB/C nu/nu mice bearing HER2-expressing SKOV3 xenografts.

Whereas a serious lack of ventilators, vaccine being months away makes the condition even worse. That's why promising drug therapy is required. One of them was suggested in this article. It is the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) to which the COVID-19 virus binds and upon downregulation of which the pulmonary permeability increases and results in the filling of alveoli by proteinaceous fluids, which finally results in ARDS. ARDS can be assisted by angiotensinII type-1 receptor (AT-1R) blocker and ACE-2 upregulator. AT-1R blocker will prevent vasoconstriction, the proinflammatory effect seen otherwise upon its activation. ACE-2 upregulation will ensure less formation of angiotensin II, vasodilatory effects due to the formation of angiotensin (1-7), increased breakdown of bradykinin at lung level. Overall, decreased vasoconstriction of vessels supplying lungs and decreased vasodilation of lung tissues will ensure decreased pulmonary permeability and eventually relieve ARDS. It should also be considered that all components of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) are located in the lung tissues. A drug with the least plasma protein binding is required to ensure its distribution across these lung tissues. Cotinine appears to be a promising candidate for COVID-19- induced ARDS. It acts across the board and acts as both an AT-1R blocker, ACE-2 upregulator. It also has a weak plasma protein binding that helps to spread through the lung tissues. In this review, we summarized that cotinine, along with COVID-19 virus replication blocker anti-virals, may prove to be a promising therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 induced ARDS.","output":"Possible therapeutic interventions in COVID-19 induced ARDS by cotinine as an ACE-2 promoter and AT-1R blocker."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective: to analyze the incidence of renal dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and assess the significance of systemic inflammation for its development. Subjects and methods: The analysis was performed basing on data of 3,806 patients with COVID-19 treated at the Pavlov State Medical University, 395 of them were admitted to the intensive care units (ICU). The criterion for establishing renal dysfunction (RD) is the increase in blood creatinine level above the upper limit of reference values (0.115 mmol/l). Patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease who needed to continue routine long-term dialysis were not included in the study. We analyzed the incidence of renal dysfunction, changes in blood levels of creatinine, urea, and electrolytes during 8 days. In addition, glomerular filtration rate, diuresis volume, levels of hematocrit, hemoglobin, LDH, CRP, ferritin, and procalcitonin were evaluated. Results. The frequency of RD among all patients was 19.0%, among patients in the ICU - 41.0%. In 79% and 81%, respectively, it was detected on the first day of hospitalization. The increase in the number of patients with RD and the aggravation of the existing dysfunction occurred after 6 days. At the initial stage of the disease, the manifestations of RD in most cases were not expressed even in those with an unfavorable course of the disease but the level of creatinine showed a weak but significant (p < 0.5) correlation with changes in CRP (r = 0.110), ferritin (r = 0.137), and procalcitonin (PCT, r = 0.418). The difference in the level of creatinine in patients with PT level above and below 0.5 ng/ml was observed on the first day only;the value of this parameter returned to normal faster in the subgroup of patients whose procalcitonin level did not exceed 0.5 ng/ml. Conclusion. In case of the signs indicative of RD, it is advisable to distinguish between primary and secondary injury. In the first case, it is primarily due to systemic inflammation, in the second case it is caused by additional impact of other aggressive factors. This will make it possible to clarify the renal and non-renal indications for renal replacement therapy (RRT) in patients with COVID-19, and to evaluate the results adequately since the effectiveness of RRT at different stages of the disease cannot be the same. ? 2021 Serbian Chemical Society.

This can be overwhelming in the beginning, mentally taxing, and induce errors into the resulting annotations; especially in citizen science or crowd sourcing scenarios where domain expertise is not required and only annotation guidelines are provided. To alleviate these issues, we propose annotation curricula, a novel approach to implicitly train annotators. Our goal is to gradually introduce annotators into the task by ordering instances that are annotated according to a learning curriculum. To do so, we first formalize annotation curricula for sentence- and paragraph-level annotation tasks, define an ordering strategy, and identify well-performing heuristics and interactively trained models on three existing English datasets. We then conduct a user study with 40 voluntary participants who are asked to identify the most fitting misconception for English tweets about the Covid-19 pandemic. Our results show that using a simple heuristic to order instances can already significantly reduce the total annotation time while preserving a high annotation quality. Annotation curricula thus can provide a novel way to improve data collection.

Controlling for confounders, we conducted multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses using propensity score matching (PSM) and Inverse propensity score weighting (IPSW) for high-risk patient subsets. RESULTS: Compared to non-ACEI/ARB users, ACEI/ARB users had an eight-fold higher risk of developing critical or severe COVID-19 (OR = 8.25, 95%CI = 3.32-20.53); a nearly 7-fold higher risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR = 6.76, 95%CI = 2.88-15.89) and a nearly 5-fold higher risk of requiring noninvasive ventilation (OR = 4.77,95%CI = 2.15-10.55).

Dietary intake of foods and foods groups in grams per day before and during the confinement was estimated by considering standard serving sizes of foods. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze differences between the regions with regard to dietary behavior changes during the confinement. Differences were deemed significant at p-value < 0.05. Dietary patterns (DPs) before and during the confinement were derived from principal component analysis. Certain dietary habits were adopted by the study population during the confinement (e.g., higher frequency of snacking and home cooking), with significant differences by regions with regard to these habits, as well as regarding culinary processes.

However, there are limits to how far China has advanced in gaining full recognition from the region. The competing political and economic interests of China, Taiwan, the United States, and the Central American countries themselves, continue to influence patterns of diplomatic switching.

In addition, the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants increases the threat of uncontrolled dissemination and additional antiviral therapies are urgently needed for effective containment. In previous in vitro studies Echinacea purpurea demonstrated strong antiviral activity against enveloped viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we examined the potential of Echinacea purpurea in preventing and treating respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and in particular, SARS-CoV-2 infections. 120 healthy volunteers (m,f, 1875 years) were randomly assigned to Echinacea prevention or control group without any intervention. After a run-in week, participants went through 3 prevention cycles of 2, 2 and 1 month with daily 2,400 mg Echinacea purpurea extract (Echinaforce(?), EF). The prevention cycles were interrupted by breaks of 1 week. Acute respiratory symptoms were treated with 4,000 mg EF for up to 10 days, and their severity assessed via a diary. Naso/oropharyngeal swabs and venous blood samples were routinely collected every month and during acute illnesses for detection and identification of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 via RT-qPCR and serology. Summarized over all phases of prevention, 21 and 29 samples tested positive for any virus in the EF and control group, of which 5 and 14 samples tested SARS-CoV-2 positive (RR = 0.37, Chi-square test, p = 0.03). Overall, 10 and 14 symptomatic episodes occurred, of which 5 and 8 were Covid-19 (RR = 0.70, Chi-square test, p > 0.05). EF treatment when applied during acute episodes significantly reduced the overall virus load by at least 2.12 log(10) or approx. 99% (t-test, p < 0.05), the time to virus clearance by 8.0 days for all viruses (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.02) and by 4.8 days for SARS-CoV-2 (p > 0.05) in comparison to control. Finally, EF treatment significantly reduced fever days (1 day vs 11 days, Chi-square test, p = 0.003) but not the overall symptom severity. There were fewer Covid-19 related hospitalizations in the EF treatment group (N = 0 vs N = 2). EF exhibited antiviral effects and reduced the risk of viral RTIs, including SARS-CoV-2. By substantially reducing virus loads in infected subjects, EF offers a supportive addition to existing mandated treatments like vaccinations.

This study aims at comparatively analyzing COVID-19's effect on cancer care from both patient and provider perspectives. METHODS: A multi-institutional survey was developed to assess COVID-19-specific concerns regarding treatment, safety, and emotional stress through 5-point Likert-type prompts and open-ended questions before and during the pandemic. Wilcoxon signed-rank and rank-sum tests were used to analyze before/during answers for providers and patients independently. Open-ended responses were assessed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 104 (69.3%) patients and 50 (50%) providers. Patients demonstrated a significant change in only 1 of 15 Likert prompts. Most significant were increased concern regarding susceptibility to infection [z = 2.536, p = 0.011] and concerns regarding their cancer outcome [z = 4.572, p < 0.001]. Non-physician providers demonstrated significant change in 8 of 13 Likert prompts, whereas physicians had all 13 Likert prompts change in the COVID-19 setting. Physicians believed care to be more poorly planned [z = -3.857, p &#8804; 0.001], availability of protective personal equipment to be more limited [z = -4.082, p < 0.001], and were significantly concerned infecting family members [z = 4.965, p < 0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: While patients had more difficulty coping with their cancer, they did not perceive significant differences in their actual treatment.

In this study, we evaluate the potential role of myoglobin in predicting poor outcome in patients with Sars-Cov2 pneumonia. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-one Sars-Cov 2 patients with an average age of 69.9  13.2 years, and symptoms duration of 8.8  7.9 days were enrolled in the study. At the admission, the serum levels of myoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, ferritin, creatine phosphokinase, creatinine, fibrinogen, d-dimers, lactic dehydrogenase, troponin (Tn-I), creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB), complement fractions C3 and C4, immunoglobulins, interleukin 6 were evaluated. We also assessed the patients' complete clinical history and performed a thorough physical examination including age, disease history, and medications. RESULTS: Twenty-four (20%) patients died, and 18 (15%) patients required intensive care. The mean time between symptoms onset and death was 12.4 days  9.1. Univariate analysis of the patients' data highlighted some independent risk factors for mortality in COVID-19, including higher neutrophils rate (HR: 1.171), lower lymphocyte rate (HR: 0.798), high CK-MB serum levels (HR: 1.6), high Tn-I serum levels (HR: 1.03), high myoglobin serum levels (HR: 1.014), Alzheimer (HR 5.8), and higher CRP values (HR: 1.011). Cox regression analysis model revealed that higher serum values of myoglobin (HR 1.003; 95%CI: 1.001-1.006; p = 0.01), and CRP (HR 1.012; 95% CI: 1.001-1.023; p = 0.035) could be predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients. The value of the myoglobin level for predicting 28 days-mortality using ROC curve was 121.8 ng/dL. Lower survival rate was observed in patients with serum levels of myoglobin>121.8 ng/dL (84% vs 20% respectively, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that higher serum levels of myoglobin could be a considerable and effective predictor of poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients; a careful follow-up in these patients is strongly suggested.

In the United States, foreign-born persons account for 70% of tuberculosis (TB) diagnoses. Comparatively, testicular cancer is much less common. However, metastatic disease may present similarly. Diagnosis is supported by elevated tumor markers and radical orchiectomy with specimen biopsy confirms the diagnosis and tumor type. Following resection, adjuvant treatment for metastatic disease includes chemotherapy. Case Presentation: This case describes a 22-year-old male immigrant with shortness of breath as the presenting symptom. Chest imaging showed a cavitary lung lesion encroaching the bronchus and left atrium. The patient was placed on airborne precautions and a complex hospital course ensued which resulted in the diagnosis of metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumor. The patient's 8 cm testicular tumor was treated with radical orchiectomy followed by chemotherapy. His condition deteriorated quickly, and he passed away in the hospital. Clinical Discussion: Metastatic testicular cancer is relatively rare compared to tuberculosis, especially in the immigrant population. Differentiating extrapulmonary TB from metastatic disease can pose a diagnostic challenge due to similar presentations. Complete physical exam including the genitalia is paramount in discerning a diagnosis of testicular cancer.

However, current available medical image datasets, such as those for COVID-19 CT images, have large variations of infections and domain shift problems. To address this issue, we propose a prior knowledge driven domain adaptation and a dual-domain enhanced self-correction learning scheme. Based on the novel learning schemes, a domain adaptation based self-correction model (DASC-Net) is proposed for COVID-19 infection segmentation on CT images. DASC-Net consists of a novel attention and feature domain enhanced domain adaptation model (AFD-DA) to solve the domain shifts and a self-correction learning process to refine segmentation results. The innovations in AFD-DA include an image-level activation feature extractor with attention to lung abnormalities and a multi-level discrimination module for hierarchical feature domain alignment. The proposed self-correction learning process adaptively aggregates the learned model and corresponding pseudo labels for the propagation of aligned source and target domain information to alleviate the overfitting to noises caused by pseudo labels. Extensive experiments over three publicly available COVID-19 CT datasets demonstrate that DASC-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation, domain shift, and coronavirus infection segmentation methods. Ablation analysis further shows the effectiveness of the major components in our model. The DASC-Net enriches the theory of domain adaptation and self-correction learning in medical imaging and can be generalized to multi-site COVID-19 infection segmentation on CT images for clinical deployment.","output":"Domain adaptation based self-correction model for COVID-19 infection segmentation in CT images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has shown an exponential trend of infected people across the planet. Crediting its virulent nature, it becomes imperative to identify potential therapeutic agents against the deadly virus. The 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) is a cysteine protease which causes the proteolysis of the replicase polyproteins to generate functional proteins, which is a crucial step for viral replication and infection. Computational methods have been applied in recent studies to identify promising inhibitors against 3CLpro to inhibit the viral activity. This review provides an overview of promising drug/lead candidates identified so far against 3CLpro through various in silico approaches such as structure-based virtual screening (SBVS), ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) and drug-repurposing/drug-reprofiling/drug-retasking. Further, the drugs have been classified according to their chemical structures or biological activity into flavonoids, peptides, terpenes, quinolines, nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, protease inhibitors, phenalene and antibiotic derivatives. These are then individually discussed based on the various structural parameters namely estimated free energy of binding (&#916;G), key interacting residues, types of intermolecular interactions and structural stability of 3CLpro-ligand complexes obtained from the results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

Current methods for cognitive assessment tend to be inconvenient, costly and infrequently performed. This is unfortunate because cognitive assessment is an important tool. In the young it can detect atypical development, and in older people it can detect cognitive decline. For both young and old, cognitive assessments can identify problems and trigger interventions for reducing harms (e.g., adverse reactions to drugs) or providing treatment. Serious games for cognitive assessment can potentially be self-administered and played on an on-going basis so as to track cognitive status over time, something that is not practical with current methods. Inspired by this opportunity the BrainTagger team has developed a suite of cognitive assessment games. Studies are being carried out to assess the validity of these games for measuring the cognitive functions that they target, but those studies don't address the issue of whether people will be willing to play the game repeatedly, without supervision, over an extended period of time. Thus we carried out a longitudinal study with BrainTagger.

Allicin has been reported to exert therapeutic effects on AMI, but the underlying mechanisms of its action have not been fully elucidated. To investigate this, a rat model of AMI was generated by ligating the left anterior descending branch of the coronary artery. DL-propargylglycine (PAG), a specific hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) synthetase inhibitor, was used to examine the effects of allicin on H(2)S production. Isolated coronary arteries and cardiomyocytes were assessed for vascular reactivity and cellular Ca(2+) transport using a multiwire myography system and a cell-contraction-ion detection system, respectively. Allicin administration improved cardiac function and myocardial pathology, reduced myocardial enzyme levels, and increased H(2)S and H(2)S synthetase levels. Allicin administration resulted in concentration-dependent effects on coronary artery dilation, which were mediated by receptor-dependent Ca(2+) channels, ATP-sensitive K(+) channels, and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release induced by the ryanodine receptor. Allicin administration improved Ca(2+) homeostasis in cardiomyocytes by increasing cardiomyocyte contraction, Ca(2+) transient amplitude, myofilament sensitivity, and SR Ca(2+) content. Allicin also enhanced Ca(2+) uptake via SR Ca(2+)-ATPase and Ca(2+) removal via the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, and it reduced SR Ca(2+) leakage. Notably, the protective effects of allicin were partially attenuated by blockade of H(2)S production with PAG.

However, prognosis for patients with lung cancer is still poor. Although immunotherapy is highly effective in some cases, not all patients experience significant or durable responses, and further strategies are needed to improve outcomes. Therapeutic cancer vaccines are designed to exploit the bodys immune system to activate long-lasting memory against tumor cells that ensure tumor regression, with minimal toxicity. A unique feature of cancer vaccines lies in their complementary approach to boost antitumor immunity that could potentially act synergistically with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, single-line immunization against tumor epitopes with vaccine-based therapeutics has been disappointingly unsuccessful, to date, in lung cancer. The high level of success of several recent vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted the evolving advances in science and technology in the vaccines field, raising hope that this strategy can be successfully applied to cancer treatments.

The Cognitive Reserve (CR) theory poses that constant brain activity earlier in life later helps to deter pathological changes in the brain, delaying the onset of disease symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To determine the reliability and validity of the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq) in AD patients. METHODS: Primary data collection was done using the CRIq to quantify CR in 90 participants. Correlations and multivariable linear regressions were used to assess reliability and validity. RESULTS: Reliability was tested in 34 participants. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.89 (p < 0.001) indicated a strong positive correlation. Validity was tested in 33 participants. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.30 (p = 0.10) indicated an insignificant weak positive correlation. CONCLUSION: The CRIq was found reliable.

This study follows patients with bipolar disorder living in two geographically close cities (Cagliari and Tunis), but with different lockdown conditions: less severe in Tunis. Methods: Two cohorts were evaluated during lockdown (April 2020, t0) and 2 months later with lockdown lifted for a month (t1). Individuals were: over 18 years old without gender exclusion, BD I or II, in care for at least 1 year, received a clinical interview in the month before the start of the lockdown, stable clinically before the lockdown. The assessment was conducted by telephone by a psychiatrist or psychologist with good knowledge of patients. Diagnoses were made according to DSM-5 criteria. Depressive symptoms were collected through the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; cut-off 14 indicative of depressive episode. Circadian rhythms were measured using the BRIAN scale. Results: Forty individuals in Cagliari (70%female, age 48.57  11.64) and 30 in Tunis (53.3% Female, age 41.8  13.22) were recruited. In Cagliari at t0 45% had depressive episodes against none in Tunis, a similar difference appeared at t1. At t0 and t1 the Cagliari sample had more dysfunctional scores in the overall BRIAN scale and in the areas of sleep, activities and social rhythms; no differences were found in nutrition, both samples had predominantly nocturnal rhythm. In Cagliari at t0 and t1, the depressive sub-group showed more dysfunctional scores in the BRIAN areas sleep, activity, and nutrition. However, the differences in biological rhythms resulted, through ANCOVA analysis, independent of the co-presence of depressive symptoms. Discussion: A rigid lockdown could expose people with BD to depressive relapse through dysregulation of biological rhythms. The return to more functional rhythms did not appear 1 month after lockdown. The rekindling of the pandemic and the restoration of new restrictive measures will prevent, at least in the short term, the beneficial effect of a return to normality of the two cohorts. This was a limited exploratory study; future studies with larger samples and longer observational time are needed to verify the hypothesis.","output":"Living With Bipolar Disorder in the Time of Covid-19: Biorhythms During the Severe Lockdown in Cagliari, Italy, and the Moderate Lockdown in Tunis, Tunisia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the early stages of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, containment of disease importation from epidemic areas was essential for outbreak control.

Sexual distress can be present within this group of patients. The aim of our study is to carry out the cross-cultural adaptation/translation and validation of the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R) for Brazilian Portuguese women with VL. METHODS: Women age  18 years, with VL (n=82), and without VL (n=53) were included. Continuous variables were described in the form of mean/standard deviation or median/range, and Students t test was used. The Chi-squared test was used for dichotomous variables. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used for internal consistency and Spearman's correlation was used to assess construct validity (FSDS-R, Female Sexual Function Index [FSFI], and Incontinence Questionnaire Vaginal Symptoms [ICIQ-VS]). A significance level of 5% was established using a two-tailed test. RESULTS: Women with VL presented more anal/vaginal sexual intercourse than women without VL (p=0.030). All three instruments (FSDS-R, FSFI, and ICIQ-VS) presented discriminant validity between women with and without VL (p<0.001). A high internal consistency (Cronbachs alpha =0.887) was found in women with VL and without VL (0.917).

A wide variety of organs have been found to be involved with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent reports indicate that the CNS is not spared. Headache, dysguesia and hyposmia, some more serious neurologic manifestations including encephalopathy Guillain Barre syndrome and stroke are now being reported as the number of patients with COVID-19 across the globe. We report a case of meningoencephalitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 who presented with altered mental status. CASE PRESENTATION: 43-year-old male with a PMH significant for insulin-dependent diabetes presented with altered mental status. In Emergency department was noted to have rhythmic jerking movements and his gaze was deviated to the right, concerning for seizure activity. Upon admission it was confirmed to have COVID-19 via detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid in a nasopharyngeal swab specimen using the Simplexa SARS-CoV-2 assay. Neurological examination revealed confusion with orientation only to self, inability to follow commands, and no apparent focal neurological deficits. Otherwise, general examination was unremarkable and vital signs were within normal. CT head was negative for any acute pathology. His cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and color less with an elevated CSF cell count and lymphocytic predominance suspicious for viral encephalitis.The CSF glucose (70 mg/dL) was increased and CSF protein levels (19 mg/dL) were decreased. A CSF PCR panel including Cryptococcus neoformans, HSV, varicella zoster virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis and enterovirus was negative. The SARS-CoV-2 CSF PCR was negative. Labs were significant for elevated ferritin, LDH, C reactive protein and Di dimer. EEG shows diffuse slowing in the theta range indicative of encephalopathy and lacked any epileptogenic activity. Patient started on steroids, Remedesivir with concern of COVID 19 meningoencephalitis. Within the next 3 days, his mentation progressively improved;he was able to communicate, and was following commands. DISCUSSION: The neuroinvasive nature of human coronavirus has been previously reported during the 2002C2003 SARS-CoV pandemic when viral nucleic acids were found in the human brain upon autopsies. It was postulated by scientists in China that SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus from the SARS-CoV family, could also infect the brain when they observed neurologic signs among patients with COVID-19 related respiratory illness. CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, meningoencephalitis should be considered as a possible manifestation of COVID-19 disease. A suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 meningitis or encephalitis should be high among patients presenting with neurological symptoms during this era of pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 testing should be included as part of the workup in addition to other infectious causes. REFERENCE #1: Gu J., Gong E., Zhang B. Multiple organ infection and the pathogenesis of SARS.

Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.","output":"Breaking the Waves: Modelling the Potential Impact of Public Health Measures to Defer the Epidemic Peak of Novel Influenza A/H1N1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Health-care workers (HCWs) carry a pronounced risk of acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

Respiratory particles of 31 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and 31 asymptomatic healthy volunteers were captured on N-95 masks layered with a gelatin membrane in a 30-minute process that involved talking/reading, coughing, and tidal breathing. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected and quantified using rRT-PCR in the mask and in concomitantly collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. The data were analyzed with respect to patient demographics and clinical presentation. Thirteen of 31(41.9%) patients showed SARS-COV-2 positivity in both the mask and NPS samples, while 16 patients were mask negative but NPS positive. Two patients were both mask and NPS negative. All healthy volunteers except one were mask and NPS negative. The mask positive patients had significantly lower NPS Ct value (26) compared to mask negative patients (30.5) and were more likely to be rapid antigen test positive. The mask positive patients could be further grouped into low emitters (expelling <100 viral copies) and high emitters (expelling >1000 viral copies). The study presents evidence for variation in emission of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles by COVID-19 patients reflecting differences in infectivity and transmission risk among individuals.

While individuals from minority backgrounds were more likely to test positive (Black versus White: odds ratio [OR] 1.93, 95% CI 1.85C2.01, p < 0.001; Hispanic versus White: OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.74C1.94, p < 0.001), 30-day mortality did not differ by race/ethnicity (Black versus White: OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80C1.17, p = 0.74; Hispanic versus White: OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.73C1.34, p = 0.94). The disparity between Black and White individuals in testing positive for COVID-19 was stronger in the Midwest (OR 2.66, 95% CI 2.41C2.95, p < 0.001) than the West (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11C1.39, p < 0.001). The disparity in testing positive for COVID-19 between Hispanic and White individuals was consistent across region, calendar time, and outbreak pattern. Study limitations include underrepresentation of women and a lack of detailed information on social determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide study, we found that Black and Hispanic individuals are experiencing an excess burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection not entirely explained by underlying medical conditions or where they live or receive care. There is an urgent need to proactively tailor strategies to contain and prevent further outbreaks in racial and ethnic minority communities.","output":"Patterns of COVID-19 testing and mortality by race and ethnicity among United States veterans: A nationwide cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 pandemic is a global emerging viral disease caused by SARS- COV-2, 2019 It is a respiratory disease first reported in China in December 2019 It impacts on global health, economic, and social life with tremendous challenges This study evaluates the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on orthopedic practice in Nigeria Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional electronic survey of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on orthopedic practice among orthopedic surgeons in Nigeria was done The demographic characteristics, attitudes of orthopedic surgeons, available infrastructures, equipment, and the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on their practices were assessed","output":"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on orthopedic practice in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of oxidants in viral diseases is fairly complex because it includes metabolic regulation both of host metabolism and viral replication. However, a role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) as mediators of virus-induced lung damage is supported by studies and antioxidants can thus be expected to act at many different levels. The aim of the present pilot study was to test an antioxidant nutraceutical approach on some relevant immunological parameters known to be affected in common seasonal respiratory tract infection. The study population consisted of 90 sedentary healthy patients, previously selected as being GSTM1-positive, divided into three groups: A) 20-40 years; B) 41-65 years; B) over 65 years. Each patients was administered a life style and dietary questionnaire. Subjects were supplemented for 6 weeks with either 9g/day (4.5g twice a day sublingually) of a fermented papaya preparation (Osato Research Institute, Gifu, Japan) or placebo. After a further month period of wash out, subjects were treated again in a crossover manner. Parameters checked were as follows: routine blood tests with WBC formula, saliva flow rate and secretary IgA and lysozyme production and redox gene expression of Phase II enzyme and SOD from upper airways cells (from nasal lavage). Salivary secretion rate showed an age-related decline and was significantly increased by FPP supplementation only in the youngest age-group (p less than 0.05). Subjects treated with FPP showed a significantly higher lever of IgA and lisozyme production., irrespective of age group while their baseline production was significantly lower in the oldest age-group as compared to the youngest one (C vs A, p less than 0.05). FPP treatment brought about a significant upregulation of all phase II enzyme and SOD gene expression tested in nasal lavage cells. In conclusion, FPP supplementation during 1 month resulted in higher salivary IgA and increase in phase II and SOD enzyme expression, i.e the most important antioxidant in the respiratory tract. The biological significance of these effects i.e., whether it will help reducing the whole respiratory oxidative stress in the human airway and, hopefully, the incidence and/or severity of URTI remains to be demonstrated in longer clinical trials.","output":"Is there a potential application of a fermented nutraceutical in acute respiratory illnesses?

Expressed in several tissues, apoD is up-regulated under different stress stimuli and in a variety of pathologies. Numerous studies have revealed that overexpression of apoD led to neuroprotection in various mouse models of acute stress and neurodegeneration. This multifunctional protein is internalized in several cells types, but the specific internalization mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that the internalization of apoD involves a specific cell surface receptor in 293T cells, identified as the transmembrane glycoprotein basigin (BSG, CD147); more particularly, its low glycosylated form. Our results show that internalized apoD colocalizes with BSG into vesicular compartments. Down-regulation of BSG disrupted the internalization of apoD in cells. In contrast, overexpression of basigin in SH-5YSY cells, which poorly express BSG, restored the uptake of apoD. Cyclophilin A, a known ligand of BSG, competitively reduced apoD internalization, confirming that BSG is a key player in the apoD internalization process. In summary, our results demonstrate that basigin is very likely the apoD receptor and provide additional clues on the mechanisms involved in apoD-mediated functions, including neuroprotection.","output":"Apolipoprotein D Internalization Is a Basigin-dependent Mechanism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Multiple serosurveillance studies have focused on the presence of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the general population and confirmed cases. However, seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) among contacts of confirmed cases can add further value to the scientific findings. Objectives The objective is to estimate COVID-19 seropositivity among contacts of COVID-19 cases and to compare the seropositivity between types of contact for the assessment of differential risk and transmission dynamics. Methods Large scale population-based serosurveillance on contacts of COVID-19 cases was carried out during the second half of August 2020 in Ahmedabad using the COVID-Kavach. The seropositivity among contacts was estimated and correlated-compared with type of contact and other demographic factors. Results With 1268 positive for IgG antibodies from 3973 samples, the seropositivity against COVID-19 among contacts of cases in Ahmedabad was 31.92% (95% confidence interval 30.48%-33.38%). The seropositivity among family contacts was significantly higher (39.36%) as compared to other contacts (28.72%) (Z = 6.60, P < 0.01). This trend is seen across all age groups and both the sex groups. The seropositivity has increasing trend with increasing age and is significantly higher among females (35.11%) than males (28.95%) (Z = 4.16, P < 0.01). Conclusion Seropositivity of 31.92% among contacts indicates that a large proportion of contacts have already acquired immunity on account of their contact with the case. Higher seropositivity among family contacts justifies the risk categorization and testing strategy adopted for the contacts of the cases.

Infection management and control would benefit from identification of biomarkers for early detection and prognosis. While animal models suggest that Trefoil Factor Family proteins (TFF2 and TFF3) and interleukin-33 (IL-33) -driven type 2 immune responses are critical mediators of tissue repair and worm clearance in the context of hookworm infection, very little is known about how they are modulated in the context of human helminth infection. We measured TFF2, TFF3, and IL-33 levels in serum from patients in Brazil infected with Hookworm and/or Schistosomes, and compared them to endemic and non-endemic controls. TFF2 was specifically elevated by Hookworm infection in females, not Schistosoma or co-infection. This elevation was correlated with age, but not worm burden. TFF3 was elevated by Schistosoma infection and found to be generally higher in females. IL-33 was not significantly altered by infection. To determine if this might apply more broadly to other species or regions, we measured TFFs and cytokine levels (IFN, TNF, IL-33, IL-13, IL-1, IL-17A, IL-22, and IL-10) in both the serum and urine of Nigerian school children infected with S. haematobium.

Objective The present review summarizes currently published evidence of Covid-19 epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment and prevention. No proven effective treatments for this disease currently exist. Data Synthesis COVID-19 started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, and it soon became clear that efficient person-to-person transmission was also occurring. Symptoms are varied, and not all patients develop all of them. Conclusion Social distancing seems to have been successful in several places in the world. However, this recommendation alone is not enough to contain the disease, and it is not a long-term solution. Large-scale testing by health professionals of representative samples of the population may give an estimate of the progression of the disease. Different treatments are under test and bring hope of a cure to the population. However, no current treatments (April 27, 2020) have been proven to be the key to success in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

Selecting PRO-CTCAE? items for monitoring symptomatic adverse events is hindered by the heterogeneity and complexity of IrAEs, and no standardised selection process exists. We aimed to reach expert consensus on the PRO-CTCAE? symptom terms relevant for cancer patients receiving ICIs and to gather preliminary expert opinions about additional symptom terms reflecting ICI symptomatic toxicities. Additionally, we gathered expert consensus about a core set of priority symptom terms for prospective surveillance and monitoring. DESIGN This Delphi study involved an international panel of experts (n = 6 physicians; n = 3 nurses, n = 1 psychiatrist and n = 1 patient advocates). Experts prioritised the relevance and importance of symptom terms to monitor in patients treated with ICIs. RESULTS Experts reached a consensus on the relevance of all (n = 80) PRO-CTCAE? Symptom Terms. Consensus on the importance of these symptom terms for prospective monitoring in patients receiving ICIs was reached for 81% (n = 65) of these terms. Additional symptoms terms (n = 56) were identified, with a consensus that 84% (47/56) of these additional symptom terms should also be considered when monitoring symptomatic IrAEs. CONCLUSION This study identified a prioritised list of symptom terms for prospective surveillance for symptomatic IrAEs in patients receiving ICI treatment. Our results indicate the need to strengthen the validity of PRO measures used to monitor patients receiving ICIs. While these results provided some support for the content validity of the PRO CTCAE? and resulted in a preliminary set of salient symptomatic adverse events related to the use of ICIs, broader international agreement and patient involvement are needed to further validate our initial findings.","output":"Patient-reported outcomes for monitoring symptomatic toxicities in cancer patients treated with immune-checkpoint inhibitors: A Delphi study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of Covid-19 has affected all aspects of human life across the globe. Lockdowns everywhere are having dramatic social and economic consequences. No therapy has yet been approved, and vaccines are a priority potential tool to control the pandemic and its impacts. Multiple vaccines are in the last stage of the development process, but part of the population is not willing to get vaccinated for Covid-19. Several studies have examined the percentage of the population willing to get vaccinated, but few have analyzed the reasons for their decision. In this context, researching the factors influencing individuals intention to use a potential Covid-19 vaccine will be important to public health strategies. This paper analyzes these factors with an adapted Cognitive-Affective-Normative (CAN) model. Perceived vaccine efficacy is used as a cognitive variable, fear of the vaccine and fear of Covid-19 are used as affective variables, and social influence is used as the normative variable. The proposed model strongly explains the intention to use the Covid-19 vaccine (R2 = 0.81). The results show that vaccine efficacy will be the most important determinant of Covid-19 vaccine acceptance, followed by social influence.

The most commonly used embolic material, n-butylcyanoacrylate glue, requires experience and skill to handle its quick and unpredictable flow and polymerisation. A new liquid embolic agent, ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (Onyx), is less adhesive and polymerises slowly, which provides better control for radiologists performing embolisation. OBJECTIVE To report our experience in embolisation using Onyx alone or in combination with histoacryl for bAVM embolisation in our tertiary referral centre. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the anatomy, technical conditions, complications and clinical outcome of all bAVM patients embolised at our centre using Onyx alone or in combination with n-butylcyanoacrylate glue. RESULTS Between 2010 and 2013, 13 patients [6 (46.2%) male; 7 (53.8%) female; aged, 14-57 years] were included, and a total of 31 embolisations were performed. Clinical presentation included hemorrhage [9 (69.2%)], seizures [2 (15.4%)], and headache [2 (15.4%)]. Most AVMs were located in the brain hemispheres [12 (92.3%)] and measured <3 cm [7 (53.8%].

Participants were youths aged younger than 18 years who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection at one of 41 EDs across 10 countries including Argentina, Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, Italy, New Zealand, Paraguay, Singapore, Spain, and the United States. Statistical analysis was performed from September to October 2021. EXPOSURES: Acute SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by nucleic acid (eg, polymerase chain reaction) testing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Severe outcomes, a composite measure defined as intensive interventions during hospitalization (eg, inotropic support, positive pressure ventilation), diagnoses indicating severe organ impairment, or death. RESULTS: Among 3222 enrolled youths who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 3221 (>99.9%) had index visit outcome data available, 2007 (62.3%) were from the United States, 1694 (52.6%) were male, and 484 (15.0%) had a self-reported chronic illness; the median (IQR) age was 3 (0-10) years.

Bacteriophage encoded endolysin as an alternative antibiotics is a peptidoglycan degrading enzyme with a low rate of resistance. Here, the engineered endolysin was developed to defeat multiple drug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii. First, putative endolysin PA90 was predicted by genome analysis of isolated Pseudomonas phage PBPA. The His-tagged PA90 was purified from BL21(DE3) pLysS and tested for the enzymatic activity using Gram-negative pathogens known for having a high antibiotic resistance rate including A. baumannii. Since the measured activity of PA90 was low, probably due to the outer membrane, cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) DS4.3 was introduced at the N-terminus of PA90 to aid access to its substrate. This engineered endolysin, DS-PA90, completely killed A. baumannii at 0.25 M, at which concentration PA90 could only eliminate less than one log in CFU/ml. Additionally, DS-PA90 has tolerance to NaCl, where the 50% of activity could be maintained in the presence of 150 mM NaCl, and stable activity was also observed with changes in pH or temperature. Even MDR A. baumannii strains were highly susceptible to DS-PA90 treatment: five out of nine strains were entirely killed and four strains were reduced by 3C4 log in CFU/ml. Consequently, DS-PA90 could protect waxworm from A. baumannii-induced death by 70% for ATCC 17978 or 44% for MDR strain 1656-2 infection.

Budding of flavivirus membranes is driven by the viral transmembrane proteins prM and E independently of NC interaction. We show that control of signalase cleavage of the multimembrane-spanning flavivirus polyprotein by the catalytic function of the viral protease is critical for efficient virus morphogenesis. In wild-type virus, signalase cleavage of prM remains inefficient until cleavage of capsid at the cytosolic side of the signal sequence separating the two proteins has occurred. This obligatory sequence of cleavages was uncoupled in a mutant virus with the consequence of greatly reduced incorporation of NC into budding membranes and augmented release of NC-free virus-like particles. Efficient signalase cleavage of prM in the mutant virus resulted in partial inhibition of cleavage of capsid by the viral NS2B-3 protease. Our results support a model for flavivirus morphogenesis involving temporal and spatial coordination of NC assembly and envelopment by regulated cleavages of an ER membrane-spanning capsid-prM intermediate.","output":"Inefficient signalase cleavage promotes efficient nucleocapsid incorporation into budding flavivirus membranes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Altered smell is one of the most prevalent symptoms in acute COVID-19 infection.

Extensive evidence has indicated that lncRNAs are involved in multiple cancers, and the potential mechanism of lncRNAs, such as LINC00092, mentioned in IDC remains elusive. IDC clinical samples from TCGA database were used to analyze the expression levels of LINC00092, miR-1827 and SFRP1. Kaplan-Meier method was applied to plot the overall survival curves. KEGG and GO were employed to screen the pathway that LINC00092 participated in. Pearson's correlation analysis determined the relationship between LINC00092 and SFRP1. Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay examined the association among LINC00092, miR-1827, and SFRP1. Cell counting kit-8, colony formation and transwell assays were performed to detect cell viability, colony formation, and migration and invasion, respectively. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot were utilized to investigate the expression at RNA and protein levels. LINC00092 expression was down-regulated in IDC tissues and cells, which was correlated with poor prognosis. Down-regulated LINC00092 facilitated cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration and invasion, while up-regulated LINC00092 inhibited cell malignant behaviors. LINC00092/SFRP1 physically bound to miR-1827 in IDC. SFRP1 expression was proportional to LINC00092 expression and inversely proportional to miR-1827 expression. The inhibitory effects of LINC00092 on cell aggressive behaviors were partially regulated by miR-1827/SFRP1.

However, they may cause a wide range of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). While most irAEs are manageable with temporary cessation of ICI and immunosuppression, cardiovascular toxicity can be associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. As ICIs evolve to include high-risk patients with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors and disease, the risk and relevance of ICI-associated cardiotoxicity may be even higher. RECENT FINDINGS: Several cardiovascular toxicities such as myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, and pericardial disease have been reported in association with ICIs. Recent findings also suggest an increased risk of atherosclerosis with ICI use. ICI-associated myocarditis usually occurs early after initiation and can be fulminant. A high index of suspicion is required for timely diagnosis. Prompt treatment with high-dose corticosteroids is shown to improve outcomes. SUMMARY: Although the overall incidence is rare, ICI cardiotoxicity, particularly myocarditis, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, making it a major therapy-limiting adverse event. Early recognition and prompt treatment with the cessation of ICI therapy and initiation of high-dose corticosteroids are crucial to improve outcomes.

Moreover, infected patients can experience contrasting outcomes depending on lymphocytopenia status. Patients with resolved lymphocytopenia are more likely to recover, whereas critically ill patients with signs of unresolved lymphocytopenia develop severe complications, sometimes culminating in death. Why immunodepression manifests in patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. Therefore, the evaluation of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings from infected patients is critical for understanding the disease course and its consequences.

We present a SIR-based, SUIR model in which the influence of testing and a reduction of contacts is studied by distinguishing 'Unidentified' and 'Identified' spreaders of infections. The model uses four ordinary differential equations and is kept deliberately simple to investigate general patterns occurring from testing and contact restrictions. The model goes beyond other efforts, by introducing time dependent parameter curves that represent different strategies in controlling the pandemic. Our analysis reveals the effect of 'pro-active' testing for the design of contact restriction measures. By pro-active testing we mean testing beyond those people who show symptoms. The simulations can explain why the timing of contract restrictions and pro-active testing is important.

Glucose is the dominant energy source for the brain. However, little is known about how glucose metabolism impacts the coordination of network activity in the brain in healthy adults. What is the main finding and its importance? We demonstrate that both alpha oscillations and the aperiodic signal components of resting electroencephalography are both modulated by experimentally elevated blood glucose levels. Our findings suggest that glucose increases measures associated with excitation-inhibition (E:I) balance, but that the effect on alpha oscillations may plateau at a certain level. Understanding the relationship between glucose consumption and E:I balance is critical to developing our understanding of how metabolism shapes human brain activity. ABSTRACT Brain network oscillations can broadly be divided into periodic and aperiodic signal components which are sensitive to state-dependent changes in network coordination and excitation to inhibition (E:I) balance. We sought to address whether the brain's dominant energy source, glucose, is implicated in regulating network activity and excitability. We conducted an experimenter-blind, crossover study of the effect of blood glucose level (BGL) on the resting electroencephalography (EEG) frequency spectrum. Participants consumed a glucose drink (75 g glucose) or an equivalent volume of water on two separate visits. EEG data were sampled before and up to three hours after the drink. We found the experimentally induced changes in BGL exhibited an inverted u-shaped relationship with changes in the individual alpha frequency peak, whereas the slope of the aperiodic signal component of the frequency spectrum showed a positive linear association suggestive of greater excitation. By contrast, peak alpha power-typically associated with top-down inhibitory processes-was negatively associated with changes in BGL. Collectively these results suggest that high BGL alters brain network coordination in the form of alpha oscillations and measures associated with E:I balance. This article is protected by copyright.

At least one of the three views was obtained in 91% of the attempts. We found an excellent agreement between the machines LVEF calculations from images acquired by the novices with the GT-EF (bias of 3.5%  5.6 and r = 0.92, p < 0.001 in the best-LVEF algorithm). This pilot study shows first evidence that a machine-learning algorithm can guide ultrasound-novices to acquire diagnostic echo loops and provide an automated LVEF calculation that is in agreement with a human expert.","output":"A machine learning algorithm supports ultrasound-na?ve novices in the acquisition of diagnostic echocardiography loops and provides accurate estimation of LVEF"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To analyze radiological changes in portable chest radiographs in coronavirus disease-19(COVID-19) patients to optimize the management of hospitalized patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 638 portable radiographs of 422 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection. All the radiographs were reported in a structured format by two experienced radiologists. A severity score was assigned to every Chest Xray (CXR) and correlation was done with the CT scans whenever available. RESULTS: Out of 422 baseline portable radiographs assessed, the ratio of male: female patients was 337:85 that is 79.8% were males and 20.14% were females. The mean age was 50.5 years and the range was 17C84 years. Of these 422 patients, 187 patients (44.3%) had abnormal baseline CXR. 161 out of 187 (86%) had either typical or indeterminate findings for COVID-19 pneumonia, rest 26 (13.9%) patients had CXR findings not consistent with COVID-19, like pleural effusion, hydropneumothorax, or lung cavity. Most commonly observed CXR findings in COVID 19 pneumonia were bilateral, multifocal air space opacities (consolidation and ground-glass opacities) predominantly involving lower zones and peripheral lung fields. X-ray identifiable lung changes of COVID-19 were mostly seen at 9-11 days after symptom onset. CONCLUSION: The presence of multifocal air-space opacities with bilateral, peripheral distribution on chest radiograph is highly suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia in this pandemic setting. Portable chest radiography is a widely available and quicktool for estimating the evolution and assessing the severity of lung involvement of COVID-19 pneumonia in hospitalized symptomatic patients.","output":"Role of portable chest radiography in management of COVID-19: Experience of 422 patients from a tertiary care center in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted to the ICU have high mortality. The host response to coronavirus disease 2019 has only been partially elucidated, and prognostic biomarkers have not been identified. We performed targeted proteomics on critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients to better understand their pathophysiologic mediators and to identify potential outcome markers. DESIGN: Blood was collected at predetermined ICU days for proximity extension assays to determine the plasma concentrations of 1,161 proteins. SETTING: Tertiary care ICU and academic laboratory. SUBJECTS: All patients admitted to the ICU suspected of being infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, using standardized hospital screening methodologies, had blood samples collected until either testing was confirmed negative on ICU day 3 (coronavirus disease 2019 negative) or until ICU day 10 if the patient positive (coronavirus disease 2019 positive). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects and ICU patients who were either coronavirus disease 2019 positive or coronavirus disease 2019 negative were enrolled. Cohorts were well-balanced with the exception that coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients suffered bilateral pneumonia more frequently than coronavirus disease 2019 negative patients. Mortality rate for coronavirus disease 2019 positive ICU patients was 40%. Feature selection identified the top performing proteins for identifying coronavirus disease 2019 positive ICU patients from both healthy control subjects and coronavirus disease 2019 negative ICU patients (classification accuracies 100%). The coronavirus disease 2019 proteome was dominated by interleukins and chemokines, as well as several membrane receptors linked to lymphocyte-associated microparticles and/or cell debris. Mortality was predicted for coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients based on plasma proteome profiling on both ICU day 1 (accuracy 92%) and ICU day 3 (accuracy 83%). Promising prognostic proteins were then narrowed down to six, each of which provided excellent classification performance for mortality when measured on ICU day 1 CMRF-35-like molecule, interleukin receptor-12 subunit B1, cluster of differentiation 83 [CD83], family with sequence similarity 3, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor and opticin; area-under-the-curve =1.0; p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Targeted proteomics with feature classification easily distinguished both healthy control subjects and coronavirus disease 2019 tested negative ICU patients from coronavirus disease 2019 tested positive ICU patients. Multiple proteins were identified that accurately predicted coronavirus disease 2019 tested positive patient mortality.","output":"Novel Outcome Biomarkers Identified With Targeted Proteomic Analyses of Plasma From Critically Ill Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As of July 17, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected over 14 million people worldwide, with over 3.68 million cases in the United States. As the number of COVID-19 cases increased in Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health mandated that all health care workers be screened for symptoms daily prior to entering any hospital or health care facility. We rapidly created a digital COVID-19 symptom screening tool to enable this screening for a large, academic, integrated health care delivery system, Partners HealthCare, in Boston, Massachusetts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe the design and development of the COVID Pass COVID-19 symptom screening application and report aggregate usage data from the first three months of its use across the organization. METHODS: Using agile principles, we designed, tested, and implemented a solution over the span of one week using progressively customized development approaches as the requirements and use case become more solidified. We developed the minimum viable product (MVP) of a mobile-responsive, web-based, self-service application using research electronic data capture (REDCap). For employees without access to a computer or mobile device to use the self-service application, we established a manual process where in-person, socially distanced screeners asked employees entering the site if they have symptoms and then manually recorded the responses in an Office 365 Form. A custom .NET Framework application solution was developed as COVID Pass was scaled. We collected log data from the .NET application, REDCap, and Microsoft Office 365 from the first three months of enterprise deployment (March 30 to June 30, 2020). Aggregate descriptive statistics, including overall employee attestations by day and site, employee attestations by application method (COVID Pass automatic screening vs manual screening), employee attestations by time of day, and percentage of employees reporting COVID-19 symptoms, were obtained. RESULTS: We rapidly created the MVP and gradually deployed it across the hospitals in our organization. By the end of the first week, the screening application was being used by over 25,000 employees each weekday. After three months, 2,169,406 attestations were recorded with COVID Pass. Over this period, 1865/160,159 employees (1.2%) reported positive symptoms. 1,976,379 of the 2,169,406 attestations (91.1%) were generated from the self-service screening application. The remainder were generated either from manual attestation processes (174,865/2,169,406, 8.1%) or COVID Pass kiosks (25,133/2,169,406, 1.2%). Hospital staff continued to work 24 hours per day, with staff attestations peaking around shift changes between 7 and 8 AM, 2 and 3 PM, 4 and 6 PM, and 11 PM and midnight. CONCLUSIONS: Using rapid, agile development, we quickly created and deployed a dedicated employee attestation application that gained widespread adoption and use within our health system. Further, we identified 1865 symptomatic employees who otherwise may have come to work, potentially putting others at risk. We share the story of our implementation, lessons learned, and source code (via GitHub) for other institutions who may want to implement similar solutions.","output":"A Web-Based, Mobile-Responsive Application to Screen Health Care Workers for COVID-19 Symptoms: Rapid Design, Deployment, and Usage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical condition in children. In the UK, appendicectomy is the most common treatment with non-operative management unusual. Due to concerns about the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during surgical procedures, surgeons were advised to consider non-operative treatment and avoid laparoscopy where possible. This study aims to report management and outcomes, to date, of children with appendicitis in the UK and Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Survey of consultant surgeons who treat children with appendicitis that informed a prospective multicentre observational cohort study. SETTING: Data were collected from centres in the UK and Ireland for cases admitted between 1 April and 31 May 2020 (first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic) at both general surgical and specialist paediatric surgical centres. PARTICIPANTS: The study cohort includes 838 children with a clinical and/or radiological diagnosis of acute appendicitis of which 527 (63%) were male. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURED: Primary outcome was treatment strategy used for acute appendicitis. Other outcomes reported include change in treatment strategy over time, use of diagnostic imaging and important patient outcomes to 30 days following hospital admission. RESULTS: From very early in the pandemic surgeons experienced a change in their management of children with appendicitis and almost all surgeons who responded to the survey anticipated further changes during the pandemic. Overall, 326/838 (39%) were initially treated non-operatively of whom 81/326 (25%) proceeded to appendicectomy within the initial hospital admission. Of cases treated initially surgically 243/512 (48%) were performed laparoscopically. Diagnostic imaging was used in 445/838 (53%) children. Cases treated non-operatively had a shorter hospital stay than those treated surgically but hospital readmissions within 30 days were similar between groups. In cases treated surgically the negative appendicectomy rate was 4.5%. There was a trend towards increased use of surgical treatment and from open to laparoscopic appendicectomy as the pandemic progressed. CONCLUSION: Non-operative treatment of appendicitis has been widely used for the first time in children in the UK and Ireland and is safe and effective in selected patients. Overall patient outcomes do not appear to have been adversely impacted by change in management during the pandemic thus far.","output":"Management and early outcomes of children with appendicitis in the UK and Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic: a survey of surgeons and observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In medical practice, the concept of survival is reduced to a quantitative approach related to the patient's sameness.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of hospital-based group medical quarantine (H-GMQ) on blood pressure (BP) in MHD patients, and the effect of age on change in BP. METHODS MHD patients in our dialysis center who were under H-GMQ due to exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were enrolled. Their demographic data, clinical characteristics, and laboratory data were collected from 3 months before H-GMQ to the end of H-GMQ. They were divided into two groups by median age (61 y). BP and related data before and during H-GMQ between groups were analyzed. The association between age and change in BP was estimated using multivariable linear regression analysis. RESULTS One hundred and thirty MHD patients were enrolled. The pre-dialysis systolic BP (SBP) and heart rate (HR) during H-GMQ were significantly higher than before, the serum sodium decreased significantly at the end of H-GMQ. After adjusting for covariates by multivariable regression, age had a negative correlation with BP elevation (R2 =0.218, P=0.246). Subgroup analysis showed that both pre-dialysis SBP and diastolic BP (DBP) increased significantly during H-GMQ in patients less than 61 years old, instead, neither SBP nor DBP changed in the elderly. CONCLUSIONS H-GMQ increased the pre-dialysis BP in MHD patients, especially in younger patients. More attention should be paid to these patients' BP if another quarantine is needed.","output":"Hospital-based group medical quarantine increased the pre- dialysis blood pressure in maintenance hemodialysis patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of digital marketing by tourism, has an increasing importance, since most of the time, it is through digital marketing that it is possible to obtain information about tourists or make them reach information.

The current research aimed to examine two important issues concerning this model that have lacked investigation: the roles of parental socialization (i.e., authoritative and authoritarian parenting styles) and social ecologies (i.e., urban vs. rural settings that differ in levels of economic development and modernization) in the development of reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety attitudes. To this end, a two-wave short-term longitudinal survey study was conducted among 850 early adolescents residing in urban (N = 314, 49.4% females, mean age = 13.31 years) and rural China (N = 536, 45.3% females, mean age = 13.72 years), who completed questionnaires twice, 6 months apart, in the spring semester of grade 7 and the fall semester of grade 8. Multigroup path analyses revealed bidirectional associations over time between perceived parenting styles and adolescents filial piety attitudes, with both similarities and differences in these associations between urban and rural China. In both settings, perceived authoritative parenting predicted increased reciprocal filial piety 6 months later, whereas perceived authoritarian parenting predicted reduced reciprocal filial piety among urban (but not rural) adolescents over time. Moreover, in both settings, reciprocal filial piety predicted higher levels of perceived authoritative parenting and lower levels of perceived authoritarian parenting 6 months later, with the latter effect being stronger among urban (vs. rural) adolescents. Adolescents perceived parenting styles did not predict their authoritarian filial piety over time; however, authoritarian filial piety predicted higher levels of perceived authoritative parenting (but not perceived authoritarian parenting) 6 months later in both settings.

OBJECTIVE: This study compared HIV testing utilization in 3 different reference periods (period 1: before the COVID-19 outbreak, November 2019-January 2020; period 2: after the outbreak, February-April 2020; and period 3: after the pandemic was under initial control, May-July 2020). Factors associated with HIV testing utilization after the COVID-19 outbreak (combined periods 2 and 3) were also investigated. METHODS: Participants were MSM aged 18 years living in Shenzhen, China. Those self-reporting as HIV positive were excluded. A total of 595 participants recruited through multiple sources completed a self-administered online survey during August-September 2020. HIV testing utilization after the COVID-19 outbreak was the dependent variable, and multivariate logistic regression models were fitted. RESULTS: HIV testing utilization was significantly lower in period 2 than in period 1 (n=262 vs 363, 44.0% vs 61.0%, P<.001). However, HIV testing utilization was not significantly higher in period 3 than in period 2 (n=277 vs 262, 46.6% vs 44.0%, P=.21). The prevalence of HIV testing utilization after the COVID-19 outbreak was seen in 331 (55.6%) participants. After adjusting for significant background characteristics, condomless anal intercourse (CAI) with regular male sex partners (RPs; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.15, 95% CI 1.29-3.57) and sexualized drug use (SDU; AOR 2.94, 95% CI 1.41-6.06) both before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, CAI with RPs (AOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.06-4.07) and nonregular male sex partners (NRPs; AOR 3.57, 95%CI: 1.43-8.89) only after the COVID-19 outbreak was positively associated with the dependent variable. Regarding HIV prevention service utilization, HIV testing utilization before the COVID-19 outbreak (AOR 10.75, 95% CI 7.22-16.02) and the use of sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing (AOR 7.02, 95% CI 4.10-12.02), other HIV/STI prevention (AOR 3.15, 95% CI 2.16-4.60), and preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP; AOR 3.58, 95% CI 1.54-8.34) after the COVID-19 outbreak were associated with higher HIV testing utilization. The current perceived risk of HIV infection was higher than that before the COVID-19 outbreak (AOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.30), and perceived COVID-19 preventive measures taken by HIV testing service providers to be effective (AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.29-1.78) and perceived higher behavioral control to undergo HIV testing (AOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.40) were positively associated with HIV testing utilization. Concerns about COVID-19 infection during HIV testing (AOR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68-0.89), avoiding crowded places (AOR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48-0.98), and HIV testing service providers reducing their working hours (AOR 0.59, 95% CI 0.48-0.98) were negatively associated with the dependent variable. CONCLUSIONS: HIV testing utilization among Chinese MSM declined after the COVID-19 outbreak and did not increase after the pandemic was under initial control. Removing structural barriers to accessing HIV testing caused by COVID-19, modifying perceptions related to HIV testing, and making use of HIV self-testing (HIVST) might be useful strategies to improve HIV testing among MSM during the pandemic.","output":"The Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on HIV Testing Utilization Among Men Who Have Sex With Men in China: Cross-sectional Online Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite the growing body of literature examining social media in health contexts, including public health communication, promotion, and surveillance, limited insight has been provided into how the utility of social media may vary depending on the particular public health objectives governing an intervention. For example, the extent to which social media platforms contribute to enhancing public health awareness and prevention during epidemic disease transmission is currently unknown. Doubtlessly, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) represents a great challenge at the global level, aggressively affecting large cities and public gatherings and thereby having substantial impacts on many health care systems worldwide as a result of its rapid spread. Each country has its capacity and reacts according to its perception of threat, economy, health care policy, and the health care system structure. Furthermore, we noted a lack of research focusing on the role of social media campaigns in public health awareness and public protection against the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan as a developing country. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of social media platforms on public health protection against the COVID-19 pandemic via public health awareness and public health behavioral changes as mediating factors in Jordan. METHODS: A quantitative approach and several social media platforms were used to collect data via web questionnaires in Jordan, and a total of 2555 social media users were sampled. This study used structural equation modeling to analyze and verify the study variables. RESULTS: The main findings revealed that the use of social media platforms had a significant positive influence on public health protection against COVID-19 as a pandemic. Public health awareness and public health behavioral changes significantly acted as partial mediators in this relationship. Therefore, a better understanding of the effects of the use of social media interventions on public health protection against COVID-19 while taking public health awareness and behavioral changes into account as mediators should be helpful when developing any health promotion strategy plan. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the use of social media platforms can positively influence awareness of public health behavioral changes and public protection against COVID-19. Public health authorities may use social media platforms as an effective tool to increase public health awareness through dissemination of brief messages to targeted populations. However, more research is needed to validate how social media channels can be used to improve health knowledge and adoption of healthy behaviors in a cross-cultural context.","output":"Influence of Social Media Platforms on Public Health Protection Against the COVID-19 Pandemic via the Mediating Effects of Public Health Awareness and Behavioral Changes: Integrated Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is much public debate regarding the high cost of insulin.

Patients who purchase insulin from illegitimate internet pharmacies remove themselves from traditional health care systems that ensure safe, quality-assured, and effective medication use. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the accessibility of Humalog and NovoLog insulin from internet pharmacies and characterize how these sites approached patient safety, and priced as well as marketed their products. METHODS: From September to December 2019, we queried the phrases buy insulin online, buy Humalog online, and buy NovoLog online in common search engines. The first 100 search results from Google and Bing, and the first 50 search results from Yahoo! and DuckDuckGo were screened. Websites were included if they claimed to sell Humalog or NovoLog insulin, were active, free access, in the English language, and had a unique URL. The legitimacy of websites was classified using LegitScript. Safety and marketing characteristics were compared across the legitimacy of internet pharmacies. Internet pharmacy prices were compared with the prices offered through brick-and-mortar pharmacies using GoodRx. RESULTS: We found that 59% (n=29) of the 49 internet pharmacies in our analysis were illegitimate, whereas only 14% (n=7) were legitimate and 27% (n=13) were unclassified. Across illegitimate internet pharmacies, Humalog and NovoLog insulin were 2 to 5 times cheaper as compared with both legitimate internet pharmacies and brick-and-mortar stores. Risks associated with the use of illegitimate internet pharmacies by American consumers were evident: 57% (8/14) did not require a prescription, 43% (6/14) did not display medication information or warnings, and only 21% (3/14) offered access to purported pharmacists. This included 9 rogue internet pharmacies that sold Humalog and NovoLog insulin within the United States, where 11% (1/9) required a prescription, 11% (1/9) placed quantity limits per purchase, and none offered pharmacist services. Rogue internet pharmacies often offered bulk discounts (11/18, 61%), assured privacy (14/18, 78%), and promoted other products alongside insulin (13/18, 72%). The marketing language of illegitimate internet pharmacies appealed more to quality, safety, and customer service as compared with legitimate sites. CONCLUSIONS: The ease of access to low-cost insulin through illegitimate internet pharmacies calls for urgent attention. Illegitimate internet pharmacies place patients at risk of poor-quality medications and subpar pharmacy services, resulting in adverse events and poor diabetes control. A multifaceted approach is needed to close illegitimate internet pharmacies through legal and regulatory measures, develop better search engine filters, raise public awareness of the dangers of illegitimate internet pharmacies, and address the high costs of insulin.","output":"Accessibility of Low-cost Insulin From Illegitimate Internet Pharmacies: Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated the role of microRNA-21 in the macrophage response to peritonitis; microRNA-21 expression increases in peritoneal macrophages after lipopolysaccharide stimulation but is delayed until 48 hours after cecal ligation and puncture. MicroRNA-21-null mice and bone marrow-derived cell lines were exposed to cecal ligation and puncture or lipopolysaccharide, and survival, microRNA-21 levels, target messenger RNAs and proteins, and cytokines were assayed. Macrophages were also transfected with microRNA-21 mimics and antagomirs, and similar endpoints were measured. Survival in microRNA-21-null mice was significantly decreased after lipopolysaccharide-induced peritonitis but unchanged after cecal ligation and puncture compared with similarly treated wild-type mice. MicroRNA-21 expression, tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin 6, and programmed cell death protein 4 levels were increased after lipopolysaccharide addition in peritoneal cells. Pelino1 and sprouty (SPRY) messenger RNAs were similarly increased early, whereas programmed cell death protein 4 messenger RNA was decreased after lipopolysaccharide, and all microR-21 target messenger RNAs were subsequently decreased by 24 hours after lipopolysaccharide. Transfection with mimics and antagomirs led to appropriate responses in microRNA-21 and tumor necrosis factor-. Knockdown of microRNA-21 in bone marrow-derived cells showed increased tumor necrosis factor- and decreased interleukin 10 in response to lipopolysaccharide. Target proteins were unaffected by knockdown as was extracellular signal-regulated kinase; however, the nuclear factor B p65 subunit was increased after lipopolysaccharide in the microRNA-21 knockout cells. In contrast, there was little change in these parameters after cecal ligation and puncture induction between null and wild-type mice. MicroRNA-21 is beneficial to survival in mice following lipopolysaccharide peritonitis. Overexpression of microRNA-21 decreased tumor necrosis factor- secretion, whereas suppression of microRNA-21 expression increased tumor necrosis factor- and interleukin 6, and decreased interleukin 10 levels after lipopolysaccharide. Protein targets of microRNA-21 were not different following suppression of microRNA-21. Nuclear factor B was increased by suppression of microRNA-21. These findings demonstrate microRNA-21 is beneficial in modulating the macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide peritonitis and an improved understanding of the anti-inflammatory effects of microRNA-21 may result in novel, targeted therapy against peritonitis and sepsis.","output":"Anti-inflammatory effects of miR-21 in the macrophage response to peritonitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are currently no evidence-based guidelines that provide standardized criteria for the discharge of COVID-19 patients from the hospital. OBJECTIVE: To address this gap in practice guidance, we reviewed published guidance and collected discharge protocols and procedures to identify and synthesize common practices. DESIGN: Rapid review of existing guidance from US and non-US public health organizations and professional societies and qualitative review using content analysis of discharge documents collected from a national sample of US academic medical centers with follow-up survey of hospital leaders SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We reviewed 65 websites for major professional societies and public health organizations and collected documents from 22 Academic Medical Centers (AMCs) in the US participating in the HOspital MEdicine Reengineering Network (HOMERuN). RESULTS: We synthesized data regarding common practices around 5 major domains: (1) isolation and transmission mitigation; (2) criteria for discharge to non-home settings including skilled nursing, assisted living, or homeless; (3) clinical criteria for discharge including oxygenation levels, fever, and symptom improvement; (4) social support and ability to perform activities of daily living; (5) post-discharge instructions, monitoring, and follow-up. LIMITATIONS: We used streamlined methods for rapid review of published guidance and collected discharge documents only in a focused sample of US academic medical centers. CONCLUSION: AMCs studied showed strong consensus on discharge practices for COVID-19 patients related to post-discharge isolation and transmission mitigation for home and non-home settings. There was high concordance among AMCs that discharge practices should address COVID-19-specific factors in clinical, functional, and post-discharge monitoring domains although definitions and details varied.","output":"Discharge Practices for COVID-19 Patients: Rapid Review of Published Guidance and Synthesis of Documents and Practices at 22 US Academic Medical Centers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Shortly after the WHOs first notice a suspected case of omicron SARS-CoV-2 was reported in Liberec, Czech Republic. The primary goal of the following actions was to test the presence of the variant and stop the spread of the virus variant. On November 25 a sixty-year-old lady, who had recently returned from Namibia, visited a GP with flu-like symptoms and a rash on her chest. The antigen test was positive for SARS-CoV-2, a PCR test was planned. At that time, it was not known that a new variant of concern was spreading from Africa. On November 26 in the morning the GP announced a suspected omicron case to the Regional public health authority, who organized the following steps. A mobile sampling team was sent to the patient's home immediately, sample transported into the regional hospital and analyzed with the help of the national reference laboratory. The captured virus SARS-CoV-2 fitted the description of the omicron variant, was shared in the GISAID database and named hCoV-19/Czech Republic/KNL_2021-110119140/2021. Contact tracing was started immediately, eleven persons were tested and quarantined. One of them positive with no further spread. It is the first documented omicron case in the Czech Republic and one of the first cases in Europe, with an excellent systemic response to the alert. The laboratory was able to detect the omicron variant instantly after the request.

Immediate protection in new born could be provided either by vectors that express virus-interfering molecules in a tissue specific form, or by the production of animals expressing resistance to virus replication. The mucosal surface is the largest body surface susceptible to virus infection that can serve for virus entry. Then, it is of high interest to develop strategies to prevent infections of these areas. Virus growth can be interfered intracellularly, extracellularly or both. The antibodies neutralize virus intra- and extracellularly and their molecular biology is well known. In addition, antibodies efficiently neutralize viruses in the mucosal areas. The autonomy of antibody molecules in virus neutralization makes them functional in cells different from those that produce the antibodies and in the extracellular medium. These properties have identified antibodies as very useful molecules to be expressed by vectors or in transgenic animals to provide resistance to virus infection. A similar role could be played by antimicrobial peptides in the case of bacteria. Intracellular interference with virus growth (intracellular immunity) can be mediated by molecules of very different nature: (i) full length or single chain antibodies; (ii) mutant viral proteins that strongly interfere with the replication of the wild type virus (dominant-negative mutants); (iii) antisense RNA and ribozyme sequences; and (iv) the product of antiviral genes such as the Mx proteins. All these molecules inhibiting virus replication may be used to obtain transgenic animals with resistance to viral infection built in their genomes. We have developed two strategies to target into mucosal areas either antibodies to provide immediate protection, or antigens to elicit immune responses in the enteric or respiratory surfaces in order to prevent virus infection. One strategy is based on the development of expression vectors using coronavirus derived defective RNA minigenomes, and the other relies on the development of transgenic animals providing virus neutralizing antibodies in the milk during lactation. Two types of expression vectors are being engineered based on transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) defective minigenomes. The first one is a helper virus dependent expression system and the second is based on self-replicating RNAs including the information required to encode the TGEV replicase. The minigenomes expressing the heterologous gene have been improved by using a two-step amplification system based on cytomegalovirus (CMV) and viral promoters. Expression levels around 5 micrograms per 10(6) cells were obtained. The engineered minigenomes will be useful to understand the mechanism of coronavirus replication and for the tissue specific expression of antigen, antibody or virus interfering molecules. To protect from viral infections of the enteric tract, transgenic animals secreting virus neutralizing recombinant antibodies in the milk during lactation have been developed. Neutralizing antibodies with isotypes IgG1 or IgA were produced in the milk with titers of 10(6) in RIA that reduced virus infectivity by one million-fold. The recombinant antibodies recognized a conserved epitope apparently essential for virus replication. Antibody expression levels were transgene transgene copy number independent and were related to the transgene integration site. This strategy may be of general use since it could be applied to protect newborn animals against infections of the enteric tract by viruses or bacteria for which a protective MAb has been identified. Alternatively, the same strategy could be used to target the expression of antibio","output":"Interference with virus and bacteria replication by the tissue specific expression of antibodies and interfering molecules."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Binding of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor triggers translocation of the virus into cells. Both the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein are heavily glycosylated, including at sites near their binding interface. We built fully glycosylated models of the ACE2 receptor bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we found that the glycosylation of the human ACE2 receptor contributes substantially to the binding of the virus. Interestingly, the glycans at two glycosylation sites, N90 and N322, have opposite effects on spike protein binding. The glycan at the N90 site partly covers the binding interface of the spike RBD. Therefore, this glycan can interfere with the binding of the spike protein and protect against docking of the virus to the cell. By contrast, the glycan at the N322 site interacts tightly with the RBD of the ACE2-bound spike protein and strengthens the complex. Remarkably, the N322 glycan binds to a conserved region of the spike protein identified previously as a cryptic epitope for a neutralizing antibody. By mapping the glycan binding sites, our MD simulations aid in the targeted development of neutralizing antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitors.","output":"Dual nature of human ACE2 glycosylation in binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air pollution by aerosol particles is mainly monitored as mass concentrations of particulate matter, such as PM(10) and PM(2.5). However, mass-based measurements are hardly representative for ultrafine particles (UFP), which can only be monitored adequately by particle number (PN) concentrations and are considered particularly harmful to human health. This study examines the dispersion of UFP in Hamburg city center and, in particular, the impact of passenger ferryboats by modeling PN concentrations and compares concentrations to measured values. To this end, emissions inventories and emission size spectra for different emission sectors influencing concentrations in the city center were created, explicitly considering passenger ferryboat traffic as an additional emission source. The city-scale chemical transport model EPISODE-CityChem is applied for the first time to simulate PN concentrations and additionally, observations of total particle number counts are taken at four different sampling sites in the city. Modeled UFP concentrations are in the range of 1.5C3  10(4) cm(?3) at ferryboat piers and at the road traffic locations with particle sizes predominantly below 50 nm. Urban background concentrations are at 0.4C1.2  10(4) cm(?3) with a predominant particle size in the range 50C100 nm. Ferryboat traffic is a significant source of emissions near the shore along the regular ferry routes. Modeled concentrations show slight differences to measured data, but the model is capable of reproducing the observed spatial variation of UFP concentrations. UFP show strong variations in both space and time, with day-to-day variations mainly controlled by differences in air temperature, wind speed and wind direction.

We introduce mutations in silico for alpha, omicron, and delta variants, for several sequences which have been rarely observed, for sequences which have not yet been observed, for other coronaviruses (NL63, OC43, HUK1a, HUK1b, MERS, and 229E), and for the H5N1 flu. We show that interfacial hydrogen bonds between the furin cleavage domain and furin are a good measure of binding strength that correlate well with endpoint binding free energy estimates, and conclude that among all candidate viral sequences studied, delta is near the very top binding strength within statistical accuracy. However, the binding strength of several rare sequences match delta within statistical accuracy. We find that the furin S1 pocket is optimized for binding arginine as opposed to lysine. This residue, typically at sequence position five, contains the most hydrogen bonds to the furin, and hydrogen bond count for just this residue shows a strong positive correlation with the overall hydrogen bond count. We demonstrate that the root mean square backbone C-alpha fluctuation of the first residue in the furin cleavage domain has a strong negative correlation with the interfacial hydrogen bond count.

Unless they meet a specific exemption, all of these children are deemed chargeable for NHS secondary care.8 The number of families subject to healthcare charging in the UK is likely to be increasing rapidly.9 Children and young people who are nationals of other European countries may have unwittingly lost legal residency in the UK as a result of Britains exit from the European Union.9 This particularly affects young people in state care and recent care-leavers, who are reliant on Local Authorities to apply for the EU Settlement Scheme on their behalf in order to maintain legal residency once leaving care. A devastating example of someone being too scared to access care despite being eligible for free treatment, was seen in April 2020 when an adult died at home of COVID-19 due to fears of charging and immigration control, despite the fact that treatment of COVID-19 is exempt from charging.17 Similarly, a mother and her baby had potentially avoidable health consequences after avoiding antenatal care due to fear of charging, despite being a victim of trafficking and therefore exempt.2 The dangers of spreading fear and distrust are one of the key reasons why we oppose healthcare charging for all patients, not just for children and young people. At the RCPCH, we have written guidance for health professionals to provide them with the knowledge and tools to advocate for families impacted by charging,8 and host a tool where professionals can report on the impacts of charging on child health.31 We continue to support our members in advocating for the right of all children to access healthcare, and encourage other professional bodies to join us in our position against this legislation.","output":"Why charging patients in the UK for going to hospital is wrong and bad for child health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study we propose a Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) mathematical model that stratifies infectious subpopulations into: infectious asymptomatic individuals, symptomatic infectious individuals who manifest mild symptoms and symptomatic individuals with severe symptoms.

Social inequalities in the risk of infection due to different living and working conditions, and social inequalities in the susceptibility and risk factors for severe COVID-19, particularly in pre-existing medical conditions, might play an important role in explaining those findings. Such inequalities are well established for Germany, as well. It can therefore be assumed that also in Germany people with a lower socioeconomic status might be more affected during the further course of the pandemic. In addition, the interventions to contain the pandemic might have unequal social, economic and psychological impacts on different social groups.

Social-epidemiological research into COVID-19 is therefore needed to advance measures of health protection and infection control in an evidence-based, targeted and socially equitable manner.","output":"[Social Inequalities and COVID-19: Social-Epidemiological Perspectives on the Pandemic]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the COVID-19 has spread globally, prompting world health organization (WHO) to declare COVID-19 a pandemic As of January 2, 2021, about 82,579,768 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported to the WHO with 1,818,849 deaths (https://covid19 who int) The pandemic has severely impacted health care systems around the world, resulting in a vast number of surgical procedures being cancelled or postponed and an unprecedented burden on intensive care units (ICU) A critical component of the perioperative or ICU services delivery is the provision of analgesia and sedation Volatile inhalational anesthetics combined with opioids are widely used in an operating room, whereas in ICUs, intravenous drugs are used for this purpose Although target-controlled infusions are not routinely used in ICUs, in the context of the thematic series on total intravenous anesthesia during COVID-19 pandemic, this article will focus on key aspects of intravenous sedation and analgesia in the management of critically ill patients admitted to an ICU following positive swab test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA","output":"Analgesia and Sedation in Critically Ill Adult Patients Admitted to a COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To investigate the consequences of COVID-19 lockdown on screen media use in children and adolescents with mental health problems, an online survey was conducted on leisure media use before, during and after the lockdown of spring 2020. METHOD: Parents of patients (10-18 yrs) referred to child and adolescent psychiatry participated in an anonymous online survey, approximately six weeks after the first easing of lockdown measures. Parents rated the amount, the content and the psychological impact of their children's media use before, during and after the lockdown. RESULTS: N = 477 parents completed the survey. Patients showed a significant increase in media time during the lockdown (including devices such as mobile, tablet/PC, video game console, TV, and activities such as gaming, social media) and a moderate increase in the negative impact of media use on everyday life. After the lockdown, total media time returned to pre-COVID-19 levels in most patients, but remained slightly higher in males. A worsening of the main psychopathological problem during lockdown was related to elevated media time in children (10-13 yrs), but not in adolescents (14-18 yrs). CONCLUSION: According to parents' retrospective ratings, the increase in screen media time was reversible, and seems to reflect an expected coping strategy during lockdown. However, male patients did not completely return to pre-COVID-19 gaming time, and a small number continued to display excessive gaming.","output":"Media use before, during and after COVID-19 lockdown according to parents in a clinically referred sample in child and adolescent psychiatry: Results of an online survey in Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the context of growing concerns about seafarers mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of psychosocial distress among seafarers of ocean-going vessels during the current health emergency. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 470 multinational seafarers working on two oil tanker international shipping companies. Psychosocial distress was assessed by using Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (DASS-21). General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) were used to assessed genral psychiatry disorders and self-rate anxiety. Perceived health status was assessed by a single-item question. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association between demographic and work-related variables with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 439 out of 470 invited seafarers with a mean age of 34.5 (SD: 8.05) participated in this study (participation rate: 93.4%). The prevalence (95% confidence interval) of depression, anxiety, stress, self-rated anxiety, general psychiatric disorders, and poor perceived health status was 12.3% (9.4C15.7), 11.6% (8.7C15.0), 5.9% (3.9C8.5), 2.1% (0.9C3.8), 42.6% (38.0C47.4), and 4.3% (2.6C6.6), respectively. In the multivariate model, by increasing the duration of stay (per month) on board, the odds of depression increased by 20% (OR: 1.20 (95% CI: 1.02C1.40)). Also, non-officer seafarers experienced significantly lower psychosocial distress such as anxiety and stress levels than officers. CONCLUSION: High prevalence of depression, anxiety, and general psychiatric disorders among seafarers during COVID-19 was observed. Our findings also highlight the factors that need to be considered to protect seafarers mental well-being. Further studies to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on psychological health issues at sea are recommended.","output":"Prevalence and associated factors of psychosocial distress among seafarers during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis removes the diseased tissue in ulcerative colitis but also allows gastrointestinal continuity and stoma-free living. Pouch strictures are a complication with a reported incidence of 5-38%. The three areas where pouch strictures occur are in the pouch inlet, mid-pouch and pouch-anal anastomosis. Aim To undertake a systematic review of the literature and to identify management strategies available for pouch-anal, mid-pouch and pre-pouch ileal strictures and their outcomes. Methods A computer-assisted search of the online bibliographic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE limited to 1966 to February 2016 was performed. Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, observational studies and case reports were considered. Those where data could not be extracted were excluded. Results Twenty-two articles were considered eligible. Pouch-anal strictures have been initially managed using predominately dilators which include bougie and Hegar dilators with various surgical procedures advocated when initial dilatation fails. Mid-pouch strictures are relatively unstudied with both medical, endoscopic and surgical management reported as successful. Pouch inlet strictures can be safely managed using a combined medical and endoscopic approach. Conclusion The limited evidence available suggests that pouch-anal strictures are best treated in a stepwise fashion with initial treatment to include digital or instrumental dilatation followed by surgical revision or resection. Management of mid-pouch strictures requires a combination of medical, endoscopic and surgical management. Pouch inlet strictures are best managed using a combined medical and endoscopic approach. Future studies should compare different treatment modalities on separate stricture locations to enable an evidenced-based treatment algorithm.","output":"A Systematic Review: The Management and Outcomes of Ileal Pouch Strictures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Berries and flowers of Sambucus nigra L tree are well known for their ability to mitigate symptoms of upper respiratory disorders related to reported antiviral properties Industrial application and commercial cultivation of S nigra is largely limited to a few widely grown cultivars Restricted genetic diversity of cultivated S nigra can be disadvantageous if new industrial applications are discovered In this study wild S nigra populations located on the north-east edge of the species natural range were explored by assessing genetic origin, berry and flower anti-oxidative potential, and berry rutin content Best performing wild S nigra extracts were selected for an assessment of previously unreported biological activity- inhibitory capacity against SARS-CoV2 S1 protein receptor binding domain (RBD) binding to recombinant human angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in vitro based on competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) marker-based genetic characterization suggested that explored wild S nigra populations result from wild gene pool expanding northwards with admixture of historically introduced cultivated S nigra Average values of total phenolic content, anti-radical activity, and total flavonoids content of wild S nigra populations did not exceed those of cv 'Haschberg' Concentration-dependent inhibition of ACE2-SARS-CoV2 S-protein RBD binding was demonstrated in vitro for elderberry fruits and flowers extracts (IC50 of 1 66 mg DW ml-1 and 0 532 mg DW ml-1, respectively) Wild elderberry fruit extract exhibited higher inhibitory capacity than the extract from berries of cv 'Haschberg' This study validates the requirement for S nigra wild germplasm bioprospecting and opens up directions for further research of new anti-SARS-CoV2 industrial applications of S nigra","output":"Wild Sambucus nigra L. from north-east edge of the species range: A valuable germplasm with inhibitory capacity against SARS-CoV2 S-protein RBD and hACE2 binding in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of pneumonia caused by severe acute vespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 December 2019, the situation of epidemic prevention and control has become more serious In order to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic and effectively prevent the spread, provinces and cities across the country have successively initiated grade I responses to major public health events A large number of clinical trials have been obliged to suspend follow-up and group joining Drug management is an important part of drug clinical trials In order to actively respond to national requirements, clinical trial institutions around the country have launched a series of emergency management measures to respond to the administration of follow-up drug delivery in an epidemic situation and ensure safety of relevant researchers and participants We hereby discuss the formulation of a central pharmacy management system for clinical trial institutions, with a view to safeguard the rights and interests of participants and ensure carrying out clinical trials safely, orderly and successfully","output":"Guidance for central pharmacy management of clinical drug research institutions based on grade I response to major public health emergencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of COVID-19 is colliding with the epidemic of opioid use disorders (OUD) and other substance use disorders (SUD) in the United States (US).

This is a retrospective case-control study of electronic health records (EHRs) data of 73,099,850 unique patients, of whom 12,030 had a diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients with a recent diagnosis of SUD (within past year) were at significantly increased risk for COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio or AOR = 8.699 [8.411C8.997], P < 10(?30)), an effect that was strongest for individuals with OUD (AOR = 10.244 [9.107C11.524], P < 10(?30)), followed by individuals with tobacco use disorder (TUD) (AOR = 8.222 ([7.925C8.530], P < 10(?30)). Compared to patients without SUD, patients with SUD had significantly higher prevalence of chronic kidney, liver, lung diseases, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, obesity and cancer. Among patients with recent diagnosis of SUD, African Americans had significantly higher risk of COVID-19 than Caucasians (AOR = 2.173 [2.01C2.349], P < 10(?30)), with strongest effect for OUD (AOR = 4.162 [3.13C5.533], P < 10(?25)). COVID-19 patients with SUD had significantly worse outcomes (death: 9.6%, hospitalization: 41.0%) than general COVID-19 patients (death: 6.6%, hospitalization: 30.1%) and African Americans with COVID-19 and SUD had worse outcomes (death: 13.0%, hospitalization: 50.7%) than Caucasians (death: 8.6%, hospitalization: 35.2%). These findings identify individuals with SUD, especially individuals with OUD and African Americans, as having increased risk for COVID-19 and its adverse outcomes, highlighting the need to screen and treat individuals with SUD as part of the strategy to control the pandemic while ensuring no disparities in access to healthcare support.","output":"COVID-19 risk and outcomes in patients with substance use disorders: analyses from electronic health records in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Convalescent plasma therapy was administered in patients with acute, viral respiratory disorders with severe clinical course (SARS- or MERS coronavirus, influenza H1N1, H5N1).

The pandemic (COVID-19) continues to hit the global economies adversely. Pakistan is the 5th-most-populous nation, and recorded positive cases with the third-highest positivity ratio in South Asia, and 26th-highest deaths toll of 21,450 and 29th number of most COVID-19 positive cases with 933,750 worldwide, as of June 6, 2021. The first wave appeared at the end of May 2020, and mid of June reported its peak, which ended by mid-July 2020. Early November 2020 witnessed the second wave with low intensity reached the climax by mid-December. The COVID-19's third wave severely affected the country during mid-March 2021. It exhibited the highest positivity rate, around 20%. New positive patients and deaths toll commenced to skyrocket and reported peak by April 15, 2021. Then situation gradually improved with effective measures and restrictions. The pandemic coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected 220 territories, regions, and countries and resulted in more than 174.116 million infections, deaths, 3.75 million, and 157.157 million positive cases fully recovered from this infectious disease, as of June 7, 2021. The pandemic has caused a severe crisis of healthcare facilities and economic challenges worldwide. Pakistani economy reported GPD's negative growth (C0.05) for the first time over the last 60 years in 2020, which caused a massive financial crisis. The Government's relief package intervened to reduce public mental stress and improve the quality of their lives. IMF reported that Pakistan's GPD bounced back at 4% growth by June 2021. This article determines that economic instability and health burden happened in Pakistan for a longer time than financial disequilibrium that occurred globally. Pakistan encountered this crisis due to its feeble healthcare systems and fragile economy.

Out of 60,441 surveyed patients, 1368 were infected as of April 23rd, 2020. However, center-specific proportions showed substantial heterogeneity. We therefore undertook new analyses to identify explanatory factors, contextual effects, and decision rules for infection containment. METHODS: We investigated fixed factors and contextual effects by multilevel modeling. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was used to develop decision rules. RESULTS: Increased positivity among hemodialysis patients was predicted by center location [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-1.51], positive healthcare workers (IRR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.17), test-all policy (IRR 5.94, 95% CI 3.36-10.45), and infected proportion in the general population (IRR 1.002, 95% CI 1.001-1.003) (all p < 0.01). Conversely, lockdown duration exerted a protective effect (IRR 0.95, 95% CI 0.94-0.98) (p < 0.01). The province-contextual effects accounted for 10% of the total variability. Predictive factors for peritoneal dialysis and transplant cases were center location and infected proportion in the general population. Using recursive partitioning, we identified decision thresholds at general population incidence &#8805; 229 per 100,000 and at &#8805; 3 positive healthcare workers. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond fixed risk factors, shared with the general population, the increased and heterogeneous proportion of positive patients is related to the center's testing policy, the number of positive patients and healthcare workers, and to contextual effects at the province level. Nephrology centers may adopt simple decision rules to strengthen containment measures timely.","output":"Risk factors and action thresholds for the novel coronavirus pandemic.
