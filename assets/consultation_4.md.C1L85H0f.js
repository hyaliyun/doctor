Some groups aimed at supporting mothers in a specific geographical area also have associated face\\\\to\\\\face groups, facilitated as either professional or peer support. Little is currently known about these specific local groups, their prevalence, impact or value to mothers. This paper examines mothers' experiences of using local BSF groups and why they value them as part of a larger study exploring the impact of midwife moderation on these groups. An online survey consisting of open and closed questions was completed by 2028 mothers. Findings identified that local BSF groups are widely used and highly valued for their connection with local face\\\\to\\\\face services and other mothers. They offer access to expertise and shared experience in a format mothers find convenient and timely, improving confidence and self\\\\efficacy. Local BSF groups enable the formation of support networks and development of breastfeeding knowledge that mothers credit with increased well\\\\being, motivation and breastfeeding duration. As such, they have the potential to add value to local face\\\\to\\\\face services and improve breastfeeding experiences and knowledge in communities.

Complications that may occur include wound infection, issues with the DBS hardware, and others. This case report presents a patient who suffered ear numbness following DBS implantation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old man presented with resting tremors in both hands. He reported that his handwriting had worsened and his movements had slowed. Physical examination revealed rigidity and postural instability. The patient was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and a bilateral subthalamic nucleus DBS implantation was scheduled combined with the patient's medication all this time. Patient's symptoms showed improvement after the procedure. However, the patient complained of ear numbness and occasional pain in the area around his ear. We observed the patient over the next 3 months and the symptoms eventually resolved without any medication and intervention. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Ear numbness is a rare complication that occasionally occurs after DBS implantation. This complication occurs because the tunneling track's proximity to the great auricular nerve and the lesser occipital nerve can result in accidental damage to either one or both of these nerves during subcutaneous tunneling. CONCLUSION: We suggest a simple procedure to avoid neural injury while maintaining the course of the tunneling in which the tunnel is created below the periosteum rather than at the subcutaneous level.","output":"Case report on ear numbness following deep brain stimulation implantation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this systematic umbrella review we aggregate the current knowledge of how virtual and augmented reality technologies are applicable to and impact remote learning in higher education;specifically, how they impact such learning outcomes as performance and engagement in all stages of higher education from course preparation to student evaluation and grading This review was done as part of a state wide research effort of Latvia, to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and specifically to provide a framework for a technological transformation of education in this context In this work we search the Scopus and Web of Science databases for articles describing the use of virtual and/or augmented reality technologies in remote learning for higher education and their impact on learning outcomes We identified 68 articles from which, after multiple screening and eligibility phases, nine review articles were left for extraction phase in which 30 structural elements with corresponding interventions and measured effects were extracted Of these, 24 interventions had a measured effect on student performance (11 positive, seven negative, six no impact) and six interventions had a measured effect on student engagement (all six positive)","output":"Use of Augmented and Virtual Reality in Remote Higher Education: A Systematic Umbrella Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease with widespread transmission of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in the Netherlands.

This epidemiological study examines e?scooter injuries and compares them with e?bike and bicycle injuries. OBJECTIVE: In order to create a comparable database on the dangers of e?scooters, e?bikes and bicycles, the typical injury patterns were analyzed and prevention options derived from them. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All accidents involving e?scooters, e?bikes and bicycles that were presented via the university emergency room of a level 1 trauma center between 15 June 2019 and 31 October 2020 were prospectively investigated. RESULTS: In our study, 68 accidents in e?scooter drivers were included, of which only 11.8% (n = 8) were recorded by the police. Significantly more of them were male than female (p = 0.032) with a mean age of 31.1 (13) years. At the same time, we registered 34 accidents in e?bike riders and 356 in cyclists. In all three groups, most injuries occurred to the head, followed by injuries to the upper extremities. Significantly more e?scooter drivers had an ISS  16 than in the group of injured cyclists (p = 0.016). E?scooter riders who had an accident had a significantly longer length of stay in hospital, than e?bike riders (p = 0.003) and cyclists (p = 0.001), 52.9% (n = 18) of e?bike riders and 53.3% (n = 113) cyclists wore a helmet, compared to only 1.5% (n = 1) of e?scooter riders. The most common cause of accidents among e?bike riders (17.7%; n = 6) and cyclists (10.4%; n = 37) was slipping away on tram rails, while for e?scooter riders it was colliding with a curb (7.4%; n = 5). CONCLUSION: The three patient collectives examined showed different causes and profiles of injuries. The reasons for an increased proportion of seriously injured people compared to cyclists are electromobility, driving under the influence of alcohol and inadequate wearing of a helmet on e?scooters when head injuries dominate. 73.5% (n = 50) of the e?scooter accidents recorded by us were not registered by the police and therefore do not appear in the current statistics of the statistisches Bundesamt. As a result, a much higher number of e?scooter accidents can be assumed. Preventive measures could include the introduction of compulsory helmets, a higher number of traffic controls and the expansion of bike tracks.","output":"E-Scooter?, E-Bike- und Fahrradverletzungen im gleichen Zeitraum C eine prospektive Vergleichsstudie eines Level-1-Traumazentrums"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Newborn animals, in the fetal-to-neonatal transition, usually face several challenges in their first 24 hours, including issues with acid-base balance, glycemic levels and oxygenation. Difficulties to overcome such issues have caused several deaths among newborns. Therefore, studies have been carried out in order to evaluate them. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the correlation between the serum lactate level in the mother, in the placenta and in the newborn. Moreover, the study measured the lactate level, blood glucose level and blood gas level in the first 24 hours. Tests were carried out right after birth, and at 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after. Lactate levels were quite similar to the placental levels (p=0.991) which, in turn, were significantly different from the mother's (p=0.011). Results showed that, shortly after birth, the production of lactate in the placenta is part of the issue. Along the first 24 hours, the study observed a reduction of the levels of lactate in newborns; the levels were closer to the normal index levels for the species.

COVID-19-related deaths in Brazil were analyzed during the period of social distancing measures. Mortality data for COVID-19 was obtained from the Worldometer website (www.worldometer.info). Deaths were estimated up to the 31st day after the occurrence of the 5th COVID-19-related death in Brazil. Social distance was measured using Google's community mobility reports (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/). The Brazilian epidemic curves were interconnected, and mathematical models were evaluated to fit the mortality estimation curves. The optimistic model was defined in the opening period of social distancing and, therefore, in the lower mobility (40-60%). The realistic model was calculated according to relaxed social distance measures (<40%) and the pessimistic model was calculated based on the transmission rate between 2-3. Thus, the equations of the mathematical models provided the outcomes for the date of June 9, 2020, as follows: realistic model with 40,623 deaths, pessimistic model with 64,310 deaths and the optimistic model with a projection of 31,384 deaths. As a result of these analyzes, on May 24, 2020, there were a total of 22,965 deaths related to COVID-19, and those deaths included within the proposed mathematical models were 17,452 for the optimistic model, 22,623 for the realistic model and 32,825 for the pessimistic model. Thus, it is concluded that social distancing measures promoted by the Brazilian public managers contributes to the reduction in approximately ten thousand deaths related to COVID-19 in the current pandemic scenario.","output":"Social distancing measures could have reduced estimated deaths related to COVID-19 in Brazil/ Medidas de distanciamento social podem ter reduzido as mortes estimadas relacionadas  COVID-19 no Brasil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amiodarone is a common antiarrhythmic drug that is utilised in clinical practice and is associated with pulmonary toxicity.

Until widely available vaccines, adherence to preventive behaviours remains the most crucial tool to prevent SARS/COVID-19 virus transmission. Our review focuses on the determinants of adherence behaviours. RECENT FINDINGS: Adherence behaviours include the use of a face mask and protective gloves, personal hygienic behaviours (handwashing or using hand sanitiser), and keeping physical distance and avoiding social gatherings. In almost all studies, males and younger people show less adherence. Risk perception and health beliefs (especially perceived severity of COVID-19 related conditions) can explain the sex and age differences in adherence. Studies covering the impact of mental disorders on adherence are surprisingly missing, with the exception of smoking. SUMMARY: Engaging men and young people in adopting preventive behaviours is crucial in protecting the whole community and specific vulnerable populations. There is a lack of studies investigating preventive behaviours among people living with mental disorders and addiction problems. Furthermore, descriptive and intervention studies are needed to understand and improve the adherence of this population to preventive behaviours.","output":"Who complies with coronavirus disease 2019 precautions and who does not?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To document the level of frailty in sub-acute COVID-19 patients recovering from acute respiratory failure and investigate the associations between frailty, assessed by the nurse using the Blaylock Risk Assessment Screening Score (BRASS), and clinical and functional patient characteristics during hospitalisation. BACKGROUND: Frailty is a major problem in patients discharged from acute care, but no data are available on the frailty risk in survivors of COVID-19 infection. DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional study (STROBE checklist). METHODS: At admission to sub-acute care in 2020, 236 COVID-19 patients (median age 77 years - interquartile range 68-83) were administered BRASS and classified into 3 levels of frailty risk. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) was also administered to measure physical function and disability. Differences between BRASS levels and associations between BRASS index and clinical parameters were analysed. RESULTS: The median BRASS index was 14.0 (interquartile range 9.0-20.0) denoting intermediate frailty (32.2%, 41.1%, 26.7% of patients exhibited low, intermediate and high frailty, respectively). Significant differences emerged between the BRASS frailty classes regards to sex, comorbidities, history of cognitive deficits, previous mechanical ventilation support and SPPB score. Patients with no comorbidities (14%) exhibited low frailty (BRASS: median 5.5, interquartile range 3.0-12.0). Age &#8805;65 years, presence of comorbidities, cognitive deficit and SPPB % predicted <50% were significant predictors of high frailty. CONCLUSIONS: Most COVID-19 survivors exhibit substantial frailty and require continuing care after discharge from acute care.

During the lockdown period, improvement in ambient air quality helped us in circumventing the coronavirus community spread. The preliminary results showing the decrease in horizontal advection of pollutants has given an opportunity to understand the background concentrations of air pollutants over Delhi. To analyse this peculiar situation, we have assessed the pollutants datasets collected by twelve different online ambient air quality monitoring stations (AQMS) of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), New Delhi, India and observed a colossal improvement in the ambient air quality.

METHODS: We included adult patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within 48 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission with complete clinical data until ICU death or discharge. We examined the importance of factors associated with disease progression over the first week, implementation and responsiveness to interventions used in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and ICU outcome. We used machine learning (ML) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to characterise the evolution of clinical parameters and our ICU data visualisation tool is available as a web-based widget (https://www.CovidUK.ICU). RESULTS: Data for 633 adults with COVID-19 who underwent IMV between 01 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 were analysed. Overall mortality was 43.3% and highest with non-resolution of hypoxaemia [60.4% vs17.6%; P < 0.001; median PaO(2)/FiO(2) on the day of death was 12.3(8.9C18.4) kPa] and non-response to proning (69.5% vs.31.1%; P < 0.001). Two ML models using weeklong data demonstrated an increased predictive accuracy for mortality compared to admission data (74.5% and 76.3% vs 60%, respectively). XAI models highlighted the increasing importance, over the first week, of PaO(2)/FiO(2) in predicting mortality. Prone positioning improved oxygenation only in 45% of patients. A higher peak pressure (OR 1.42[1.06C1.91]; P < 0.05), raised respiratory component (OR 1.71[ 1.17C2.5]; P < 0.01) and cardiovascular component (OR 1.36 [1.04C1.75]; P < 0.05) of the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and raised lactate (OR 1.33 [0.99C1.79]; P = 0.057) immediately prior to application of prone positioning were associated with lack of oxygenation response. Prone positioning was not applied to 76% of patients with moderate hypoxemia and 45% of those with severe hypoxemia and patients who died without receiving proning interventions had more missed opportunities for prone intervention [7 (3C15.5) versus 2 (0C6); P < 0.001]. Despite the severity of gas exchange deficit, most patients received lung-protective ventilation with tidal volumes less than 8 mL/kg and plateau pressures less than 30cmH(2)O. This was despite systematic errors in measurement of height and derived ideal body weight. CONCLUSIONS: Refractory hypoxaemia remains a major association with mortality, yet evidence based ARDS interventions, in particular prone positioning, were not implemented and had delayed application with an associated reduced responsiveness. Real-time service evaluation techniques offer opportunities to assess the delivery of care and improve protocolised implementation of evidence-based ARDS interventions, which might be associated with improvements in survival.

Throughout the pandemic period which is still ongoing as of October 2020, it was observed that the recovery periods for individuals affected by the virus have been inconsistent in different regions around the world. Motivated by this irregularity in recovery periods, this paper presents an inverse linear association between the quality of air measured in terms of Air Quality Index (AQI) of a particular city or region and the average recovery period of individuals residing in that city or region. The poorer the air quality in a particular region, that is, higher is the AQI, faster is the recovery period for an average individual residing in that region. The scope of the dataset is limited to a group of cities in India, for which the corresponding air quality data provided and maintained by the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) project team and COVID-19 data provided by official government handles was available. Data collection and corroboration accompanied with programmatic data preprocessing and analysis was performed. Linear regression (LR) was used to quantify and forecast the recovery period in a particular city based on the AQI of that city calculated over a period of time. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"Correlation Between Air Quality Index and COVID-19 Recovery Period in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The epidemiological relationship between vitamin D levels and cancer has been thoroughly investigated. Published data from large studies appear to corroborate a significant relationship between higher serum vitamin D concentrations and improved survival. Mechanistic reviews on commonly-studied cancers - including breast cancer, colon cancer and melanoma - focus predominantly on data from older studies. In outlining avenues for future research, we believe there is utility in summarizing novel findings introduced to the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this narrative review, we used MEDLINE, PUBMED and Cochrane databases to identify mechanistic studies published from January 1, 2015 onwards exploring this topic. RESULTS Twenty-five mechanistic studies were included in this review. It was found that vitamin D plays a critical role in both direct (i.e. tumor gene expression, proliferation, invasiveness, sensitivity to chemotherapy etc.) and indirect (i.e. effects on the tumor microenvironment and immunomodulation) tumor suppression mechanisms. CONCLUSION These newly-identified pathways warrant further research, with the hopes that we may understand how and when vitamin D supplementation can be integrated into precision medicine therapeutics for cancers of the breast, colon and skin. Cancer care providers should consider recommendations to screen for vitamin D deficiency in this population.","output":"Newly-identified Pathways Relating Vitamin D to Carcinogenesis: A Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three-dimensional (3D) printing applications in medicine have been limited due to high cost and technical difficulty of creating 3D printed objects. It is not known whether patient-specific, hollow, small-caliber vascular models can be manufactured with 3D printing, and used for small vessel endoluminal testing of devices. Manufacture of anatomically accurate, patient-specific, small-caliber arterial models was attempted using data from a patient's CT scan, free open-source software, and low-cost Internet 3D printing services. Prior to endovascular treatment of a patient with multiple splenic artery aneurysms, a 3D printed model was used preoperatively to test catheter equipment and practice the procedure. A second model was used intraoperatively as a reference. Full-scale plastic models were successfully produced. Testing determined the optimal puncture site for catheter positioning. A guide catheter, base catheter, and microcatheter combination selected during testing was used intraoperatively with success, and the need for repeat angiograms to optimize image orientation was minimized. A difficult and unconventional procedure was successful in treating the aneurysms while preserving splenic function. We conclude that creation of small-caliber vascular models with 3D printing is possible. Free software and low-cost printing services make creation of these models affordable and practical.

This is an observational retrospective study conducted in the University Hospital of Pisa including consecutive patients with CRAB infections (January 2020 to August 2021). Patients were divided in two study groups according to the antibiotic treatment received: cefiderocol- and colistin-containing regimens. The primary outcome was the 30-day mortality. A Cox regression analysis was performed to identify factors independently associated with 30-day mortality. A propensity score analysis using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was also performed. A total of 124 patients were included: 47 (37.9%) received cefiderocol, while 77 (62.1%) colistin-containing regimens. Overall, 79 (63.7%) patients had a bloodstream infection (BSI), 35 (28.5%) a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and 10 (8.1%) other infections. Thirty-day mortality was higher in patients receiving colistin- compared to those who received cefiderocol-containing regimens (55.8% versus 34%, P = 0.018). This difference was confirmed in patients with BSI, but not in those with VAP. On multivariable analysis, septic shock, SOFA score, and age were independently associated with 30-day mortality, while cefiderocol therapy was protective in an IPTW analysis (Hazard ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.22-0.66, P < 0.001). Nephrotoxicity was more common in the colistin group. Microbiological failure occurred in 17.4% of patients receiving cefiderocol versus 6.8% of those receiving colistin (P = 0.079).

The idea of death is especially exacerbated when there are close to death experiences that remind us how close we are to fatality. This is why it is important to measure fatalistic ideas of those who have not yet been infected. Objective To revalidate a scale that measures fatalistic perception prior to COVID-19 infection in a population of 13 Latin American countries. Methodology We conducted an instrumental study. We used a previously validated scale in Peru, with seven items divided into two factors and with five possible Likert-type responses (from strongly disagree to strongly agree). It was administered to a large population in 13 Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America;for each of the seven questions, 886 people were surveyed. With these results, descriptive and analytical statistics were performed. Results The mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of the seven initial questions were adequate in most cases. In the confirmatory factor analysis, the lack of fit was improved with the indexes' modification technique, which let us delete items 1 and 6. Thus, we could obtain satisfactory goodness-of-fit indices (CFI = 0.972, TLI = 0.931, GFI = 0.990, AGFI = 0.961, RMSEA = 0.080, and RMR = 0.047).

This study examined the co-detections, the distribution of viruses, symptoms, and illness burden associated with ARI between December 2012 and March 2013. METHODS: Outpatients with ARI were assayed for presence of 18 viruses using multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (MRT-PCR) to simultaneously detect multiple viruses. RESULTS: Among 935 patients, 60% tested positive for a single virus, 9% tested positive for 1 virus and 287 (31%) tested negative. Among children (<18 years), the respective distributions were 63%, 14%, and 23%; whereas for younger adults (18C49 years), the distributions were 58%, 8%, and 34% and for older adults (50 years) the distributions were 61%, 5%, and 32% (P < 0.001). Co-detections were more common in children than older adults (P = 0.01), and less frequent in households without children (P = 0.003). Most frequently co-detected viruses were coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus. Compared with single viral infections, those with co-detections less frequently reported sore throat (P = 0.01), missed fewer days of school (1.1 vs. 2 days; P = 0.04), or work (2 vs. 3 days; P = 0.03); other measures of illness severity did not vary.

In this study, we investigated the advantages of using polymeric microparticles carrying the luciferase reporter gene in increasing transfection efficiency in the readily transfectable HEK293 cell line and the difficult to transfect RAW264.7 cell line. The results indicated that there was a limit to the ratio of nitrogen in polyethylenimine (PEI) to phosphate in DNA (N/P ratio) beyond which further increases in transgene expression no longer, or only marginally, occurred. Microparticles encapsulating PEI:DNA nanoplexes induced cellular toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. PEGylation increased transgene expression, likely related to enhanced degradation of particles. Furthermore, intra-tracheal instillation in rats allowed us to investigate the inflammatory response in the lung as a function of PEGylation, porosity, and size. Porosity did not influence cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in the absence of PEG, but in particles containing PEG, non-porous particles recruited fewer inflammatory cells than their porous counterparts. Finally, both 1 m and 10 m porous PLA-PEG particles recruited more neutrophils than 4 m particles. Thus, we have shown that PEGylation and lack of porosity are advantageous for faster release of genetic cargo from microparticles and a reduced inflammatory response, respectively.

Here, using the recently developed T-CoV bioinformatics pipeline (https://t-cov.hse.ru) we analyzed the peculiarities of the viral peptide presentation for the Omicron, Delta and Wuhan variants of SARS-CoV-2. First, we showed the absence of significant differences in the presentation of SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides by the most frequent HLA class I/II alleles and the corresponding HLA haplotypes. Then, the analysis was limited to the set of peptides originating from the Spike proteins of the considered SARS-CoV-2 variants. The major finding was the destructive effect of the Omicron mutations on PINLVRDLPQGFSAL peptide, which was the only tight binder from the Spike protein for HLA-DRB1*03:01 allele and some associated haplotypes. Specifically, we predicted a dramatical decline in binding affinity of HLA-DRB1*03:01 and this peptide both because of the Omicron BA.1 mutations (N211 deletion, L212I substitution and EPE 212-214 insertion) and the Omicron BA.2 mutations (V213G substitution). The computational prediction was experimentally validated by ELISA with the use of corresponding thioredoxin-fused peptides and recombinant HLA-DR molecules. Another finding was the significant reduction in the number of tightly binding Spike peptides for HLA-B*07:02 HLA class I allele (both for Omicron and Delta variants).

The role of ventilation in removing exhaled airborne bio-aerosols and preventing cross infections has been multidisciplinary extensively studied after the SARS outbreak in 2003. The characteristics of droplet-borne, short-range airborne and long-range airborne transmission of infectious diseases were identified. Increasing ventilation rate can effectively reduce the risk of long-range airborne transmission, while it may be of little useful in preventing the droplet-borne transmission. To maintain the airflow direction from clean cubicles to dirty cubicles is an effective way to prevent the cross infection between cubicles, which is widely used in hospital isolation rooms. Field measurements showed that wrong air flow direction was due to poor construction quality or maintenance. The impacts of different airflow patterns on removing large droplets and fine droplet nuclei were discussed. Some new concepts in general ventilation systems and local personalized equipment were also introduced. This review updates current knowledge of the airborne transmission of pathogens and the improvement of ventilation efficiency concerning the infection prevention.","output":"Ventilation control for airborne transmission of human exhaled bio-aerosols in buildings."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunological and technical advances have led to tremendous increases in the number of people potentially able to benefit from allotransplantation. Ironically, it is the success of the field that has led to a renewed interest in xenotransplantation during the past several decades. To a large part, this has occurred because of the great scarcity of human organ and tissue donors. However, it has expanded to include the use of cells from animals into humans such as porcine islet cells for diabetes or extracorporeal perfusion of human blood through animal organs or cells. Similar to allotransplantation, issues regarding transmission of infections from the graft to the human recipient were brought up for consideration with these procedures in the 1990s (Michaels and Simmons, 1994; Chapman et al., 1995; Hammel et al., 1998; Fishman et al., 1998). A risk for infection exists with the use of any biologic agent regardless of whether it is from a human or an animal source. Accordingly, transmission of infections from human organs, tissues, or cells is a well-recognized cause of disease after allotransplantation (Ison and Grossi, 2013; Green and Michaels, 2012). As the human graft shortage continues, newer cellular therapies are explored. Thus, attention continues to be given to the potential use of xenogeneic organs, tissues, or cells for human maladies through xenotransplantation. The potential for novel zoonotic infections to emerge because of xenotransplantation (xenozoonoses or xenosis) led to a debate on whether the field should be permitted to progress. This chapter reviews the issues of xenotransplantation related to infections from animals to humans. Lessons learned from infections with prior nonhuman primate xenotransplantation and human allotransplantation are used to help inform about risks with newer xenogeneic procedures. In addition, information on known zoonoses is reviewed to better develop constructs to decrease the hazard of infection with these novel procedures.","output":"Xenozoonoses: The Risk of Infection after Xenotransplantation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Historical innovations in mechanical thrombectomy devices and strategies for ischemic stroke have resulted in improved angiographic outcomes and better clinical outcomes.

Newer generation aspiration catheters with flexible distal tips and a larger bore have demonstrated faster and better recanalization relative to older devices. Recently, several species of distal access catheters have similar structural characteristics to the Penumbra reperfusion catheter. Therefore, we used the distal access catheter for forced arterial suction thrombectomy in three patients with acute ischemic stroke. In each case, we achieved fast and complete recanalization without significant complications.

With increased use of these medications, physicians need to become knowledgeable of these drugs' neuropsychiatric side effects and interactions with psychiatric medications. OBJECTIVE: Clarify evidence base regarding the psychiatric side effects and psychiatric drug interactions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. METHODS: A literature review was performed in PubMed from 1950 to 2020 regarding psychiatric topics and targeted pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. RESULTS: First, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may mildly inhibit CYP2D6 metabolism of psychiatric medications, and psychiatric medications that interfere with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity could alter chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine levels. Second, they may prolong the QT interval, warranting caution with concomitant prescription of other QT prolonging agents. Finally, neuropsychiatric side effects are very uncommon but possible and include a potentially prolonged phenomenon of \\"psychosis after chloroquine.\\" Hydroxychloroquine has less information available about its neuropsychiatric side effects than chloroquine, with psychosis literature limited to several case reports. Weak evidence suggests a possible association of hydroxychloroquine exposure and increased suicidal ideation. It is not clear whether patients with psychiatric illness are more vulnerable to neuropsychiatric sequela of these medications; however, overdose of these medications by suicidal patients has high risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: The risk of neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used for coronavirus disease-2019 treatment is not known. Best practice may include suicide risk assessment for patients treated with hydroxychloroquine. However, delirium is expected to be a more likely etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in critically ill patients treated for coronavirus disease-2019, and adjustment disorder is a much more likely etiology of anxiety and depression symptoms than the side effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.","output":"Psychiatric Aspects of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine Treatment in the Wake of Coronavirus Disease-2019: Psychopharmacological Interactions and Neuropsychiatric Sequelae"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging global infectious disease with emerging medical knowledge.

Based on the vibration signal of mechanical equipment, a PLSR-DNN hybrid network model for health prediction of medical equipment is proposed by using partial least squares regression (PLSR) algorithm and deep neural networks (DNNs). At the same time, in the diagnosis of medical imaging equipment fault, the paper proposes to use rough set to screen the fault factors and then use BP neural network to classify and identify the fault and analyzes the practical application effect of the two technologies. The results show that the PLSR-DNN hybrid network model for health prediction of medical imaging equipment is basically consistent with the actual health value of medical equipment; medical imaging equipment fault diagnosis technology is based on rough set and BP neural network. In the test set, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of medical imaging equipment fault identification are 75.0%, 83.3%, and 85.0%.

A full five years after the globally coordinated removal of serotype 2 oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV2) from trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV) for use in national immunization programs, cVDPV2s did not die out. Since OPV2 cessation, responses to outbreaks caused by cVDPV2s mainly used serotype 2 monovalent OPV (mOPV2) from a stockpile. A novel vaccine developed from a genetically stabilized OPV2 strain (nOPV2) promises to potentially facilitate outbreak response with lower prospective risks, although its availability and properties in the field remain uncertain. Using an established global poliovirus transmission model and building on a related analysis that characterized the impacts of disruptions in GPEI activities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we explore the implications of trade-offs associated with delaying outbreak response to avoid using mOPV2 by waiting for nOPV2 availability (or equivalently, delayed responses waiting for national validation of meeting the criteria for nOPV2 initial use). Consistent with prior modeling, responding as quickly as possible with available mOPV2 promises to reduce the expected burden of disease in the outbreak population and to reduce the chances for the outbreak virus to spread to other areas. Delaying cVDPV2 outbreak response (e.g., modeled as no response January-June 2021) to wait for nOPV2 can considerably increase the total expected cases (e.g., by as many as 1,300 cVDPV2 cases in the African region during 2021-2023) and increases the likelihood of triggering the need to restart widescale preventive use of an OPV2-containing vaccine in national immunization programs that use OPV. Countries should respond to any cVDPV2 outbreaks quickly with rounds that achieve high coverage using any available OPV2, and plan to use nOPV2, if needed, once it becomes widely available based on evidence that it is as effective but safer in populations than mOPV2.","output":"Serotype 2 oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV2) choices and the consequences of delaying outbreak response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In type II CRISPR systems, the guide RNA (gRNA) comprises a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and a hybridized trans-acting CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA), both being essential in guided DNA targeting functions.

METHODS: A literature search was performed using combination of keywords (MeSH terms and free text words) relating to COVID-19, urology, faeces and stool on multiple databases. Primary outcomes were the urological manifestations of COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection in urine and stool samples. Meta-analyses were performed when there were two or more studies reporting on the same outcome. Special considerations in urological conditions that were relevant in the pandemic of COVID-19 were reported in a narrative manner. RESULTS: There were a total of 21 studies with 3714 COVID-19 patients, and urinary symptoms were absent in all of them. In patients with COVID-19, 7.58% (95% CI 3.30-13.54%) developed acute kidney injury with a mortality rate of 93.27% (95% CI 81.46-100%) amongst them. 5.74% (95% CI 2.88-9.44%) of COVID-19 patients had positive viral RNA in urine samples, but the duration of viral shedding in urine was unknown. 65.82% (95% CI 45.71-83.51%) of COVID-19 patients had positive viral RNA in stool samples, which were detected from 2 to 47 days from symptom onset. 31.6% of renal transplant recipients with COVID-19 required non-invasive ventilation, and the overall mortality rate was 15.4%.

STUDY DESIGN Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Department of Radiology, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining, Shandong, China, from January to April, 2020. METHODOLOGY CT scan images were analysed retrospectively. The main CT findings, including pulmonary opacities, airway wall visibility, wall thickening, luminal changes, and the formation of mucus plugs were evaluated. Airway segments were classified into three types based on the spatial relationship between conducting airways and pulmonary opacities. RESULTS A total of 275 lesions were detected in 52 patients. Of these, 170 (61.82%) lesions were associated with 243 airway segments, including segments enclosed within lesions (type I, 152, 62.55%), crossing the lesions (type II, 51, 20.99%), and abutting the lesions (type III, 40, 16.46%). The bronchial walls of 154 (63.37%) segments were ill-defined; whereas, the walls of 89 (36.63%) segments were well-defined; in the latter group, 62 (69.66%) showed mild thickening. The bronchial lumen of 183 (75.31%) segments presented mild bronchiectasis and 60 (24.69%) segments appeared normal. Mucus plug was detected in one segment (0.41%). There were no cases of bronchial stenosis, and all bronchial segments located in normal lung regions appeared normal. The appearance of 196 (80.66%) affected bronchi was completely restored before hospital discharge. CONCLUSION Typical airway changes in adult COVID-19 pneumonia include bronchial wall thickening without significant stenosis of the airway lumen and the absence of bronchial mucus plugs. Moreover, bronchi located in unaffected lung regions have a normal appearance. These characteristics have potential value in differential diagnosis.

We globally evaluate the effect of social media and online foreign disinformation campaigns on vaccination rates and attitudes towards vaccine safety. METHODS: Weuse a large-n cross-country regression framework to evaluate the effect ofsocial media on vaccine hesitancy globally. To do so, we operationalize social media usage in two dimensions: the use of it by the public to organize action(using Digital Society Project indicators), and the level of negative lyoriented discourse about vaccines on social media (using a data set of all geocoded tweets in the world from 2018-2019). In addition, we measure the level of foreign-sourced coordinated disinformation operations on social media ineach country (using Digital Society Project indicators). The outcome of vaccine hesitancy is measured in two ways. First, we use polls of what proportion ofthe public per country feels vaccines are unsafe (using Wellcome Global Monitor indicators for 137 countries). Second, we use annual data of actual vaccination rates from the WHO for 166 countries. RESULTS: We found the use of social media to organise offline action to be highly predictive of the belief that vaccinations are unsafe, with such beliefs mounting as more organisation occurs on social media. In addition, the prevalence of foreign disinformation is highly statistically and substantively significant in predicting a drop in mean vaccination coverage over time. A 1-point shift upwards in the 5-point disinformation scale is associated with a 2-percentage point drop in mean vaccination coverage year over year. We also found support for the connection of foreign disinformation with negative social media activity about vaccination. The substantive effect of foreign disinformation is to increase the number of negative vaccine tweets by 15% for the median country. CONCLUSION: There is a significant relationship between organisation on social media and public doubts of vaccine safety. In addition, there is a substantial relationship between foreign disinformation campaigns and declining vaccination coverage.","output":"Social media and vaccine hesitancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Under-detection and -reporting in the private sector constitute a major barrier in Viet Nams fight to end tuberculosis (TB).

We subsidized chest x-ray screening and Xpert MTB/RIF testing, and supported test logistics, recording, and reporting. Among 393 participating private providers, 32.1% (126/393) referred at least one symptomatic person, and 3.6% (14/393) reported TB patients treated in their practice. In total, the study identified 1203 people with TB through private provider engagement. Of these, 7.6% (91/1203) were referred for treatment in government facilities. The referrals led to a post-intervention increase of +8.5% in All Forms TB notifications in the intervention districts.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the characteristics of patients admitted to a northern Israeli hospital with common surgical complaints during three periods: the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Second Lebanon War in 2006, and a regular period. METHODS: Demographic, medical, laboratory, imaging, intraoperative, and pathological data were collected from electronic medical files of patients who received emergency treatment at the surgery department of a single hospital in northern Israel. We retrospectively compared the characteristics of patients who were admitted with various conditions during three periods. RESULTS: Patients' mean age and most of the clinical parameters assessed were similar between the periods. However, pain was reportedly higher during the COVID-19 than the control period (8.7 vs. 6.4 on a 10-point visual analog scale, P < 0.0001). During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Second Lebanon War, and the regular period, the mean numbers of patients admitted daily were 1.4, 4.4, and 3.0, respectively.

METHOD: : A total of 55 eyes of 46 patients who were received in the study period participated in this retrospective study, including 28 patients (37 eyes) with diabetic macular edema (DME), 11 patients (11 eyes) with retinal vein occlusion (RVO), and 7 patients (7 eyes) with wet age-related macular degeneration (wet-AMD). The patients were diagnosed with DME, RVO, or wet-AMD in February 2020 and had planned 3-dose loading injections in March, April, and May 2020, but could not be injected due to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: : From the patients initial examination in February 2020, the mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.72  59 logMAR. After the patients lockdown visit in July 2020, the mean BCVA was 0.76  64 logMAR. BCVA was stable in 11 eyes, decreased in 12 eyes, and increased in 14 eyes for patients with DME. BCVA was stable in 6, decreased in 3, and increased in 2 eyes for patients with RVO, and it was stable in 4 eyes and decreased in 3 eyes for patients with wet-AMD.

Safety and efficacy of Tocilizumab (TCZ) in Covid-19 pneumonia is uncertain yet. In this study, we aimed to determine clinical outcomes in patients treated with TCZ. Objectives: In this study we aimed to share our retrospective results which we had obtained from patients with COVID-19 diagnosis received TCZ. Methods: We performed a retrospective case control study between May and August 2020 in Turkey. We compared outcomes in patients who received TCZ with those who did not. Death in hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) requirements were evaluated as endpoints. Demographic data, comorbidities, additional treatment, treatment side effects, laboratory and clinical results were retrospectively assessed. There are no significant differences between groups according to age, gender and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Results: 12 (27.3%) patients died in standard group and eight (18.6%) patients died in TCZ group (p=0.150).Days of staying in the hospital were eight days in standard treatment group and 12 days in TCZ group (p=0.03). 10 of 43 patients in TCZ group were admitted to ICU. MV support was needed in 8 of these patients. 18 of 44 patients (40.9%) within the standard group were admitted to ICU and 12 patients (27.3%) were intubated (p=0.125,p=0.480). Significant IL-6 decrease was not observed post treatment in TCZ group according to pretreatment period (p=0.60). Significant decreases were examined in CRP and ferritin values through TCZ treatment. However, D-dimer and thrombocyte values increased. Conclusion: TCZ may not be an effective treatment for reducing ICU requirement, to prevent intubation or death, for shortening period for staying in hospital.

Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study including 432 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to three medical centers in Hubei province from January 1st to April 10th 2020. Primary outcomes included ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and death occurring while hospitalized or within 30 days. Results: Of the 432 confirmed patients, 9.5% were admitted to the ICU, 27.3% required mechanical ventilation, and 33.1% died. Total leukocyte count was higher in survivors compared with those who died (8.9 vs 4.8 x 109/l), but lymphocyte counts were lower (0.6 vs 1.0 x 109/l). D-dimer was significantly higher in patients who died compared to survivors (6.0ug/l vs 1.0ug/l, p<0.0001. This was also seen when comparing mechanically versus non-mechanically-ventilated patients. Other significant differences were seen in AST, ALT, LDH, total bilirubin and creating kinase.

Because catheterization is often performed in emergency situations, speed and accuracy are emphasized. METHODS We retrospectively compared the Micropuncture kit with the standard 18-gauge Angiocath IV catheter for tunneled cuffed catheter insertion in the right jugular vein. From June 2016 to May 2017, 31 tunneled cuffed catheters were successfully inserted via the Micropuncture kit and another 31 via the Angiocath IV catheter. All patients underwent the same ultrasound-guided procedure performed by a single experienced interventionalist. Procedure time was the time from draping of the patient to the completion of povidone dressing after the catheterization. In our center, the Angio Lab nurse maintains records, including procedure time and method for every procedure. All patient records were retrospectively tracked through electronic medical record review. The primary outcome was procedure time and the secondary outcomes were complications and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the patients' demographic data between the two groups. However, procedure time was significantly shorter in the Angiocath group than in the Micropuncture group (12.4  3.5 vs 17.6  6.9 min, p = 0.001); there were no serious complications, such as hemorrhage, pneumothorax, or hematoma, in both groups. Moreover, cost-effectiveness was better in the Angiocath group than in the Micropuncture group (0.34 vs 52 US$, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Using the Angiocath IV catheter can reduce procedure time and cost with no severe complications. Moreover, experienced practitioners can reduce the risk of complications when using Angiocath. There are several limitations to this study. First, it was retrospective; second, it was not randomized; and finally, it was conducted by only one experienced interventionalist.","output":"Placement of tunneled cuffed catheter for hemodialysis: Micropuncture kit versus Angiocath IV catheter."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Olfactory and taste disorders were reported in up to 30%-80% of COVID-19 patients. The purpose of our study was to objectively assess smell impairment in COVID-19 patients and to correlate olfactory function with viral recovery. METHODS: Between 15 and 30 April 2020, hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent an objective assessment of olfactory function with the Smell Identification subtest of the Sniffin' Sticks Test (SI-SST). Association between viral recovery and SI-SST performance was evaluated. RESULTS: 51 patients were enrolled (49% males, mean age 66.2  14.6 years). At the time of test administration, 45% were clinically recovered and 39% were virus-free. Objective hyposmia/anosmia was found in 45% of the patients. Subjective olfactory disorders showed no association with the clinical or viral recovery status of the patients. On the contrary, none of the patients with anosmia and the 5% of hyposmic patients at test had viral recovery. The relative risk for hyposmic patients to be still positive at swab test was 10.323 (95% CI 1.483-71.869, p < .0001). Logistic regression analysis showed an independent and significant correlation between viral clearance and SI-SST scores (OR = 2.242; 95% CI 1.322-3.802, p < .003). ROC curve analysis confirmed that a SI-SST > 10.5 predicts viral clearance with 79% sensitivity and 87% specificity (AUC = 0.883). CONCLUSION: Hyposmia is part of COVID-19 symptoms; however, only objectively assessed olfactory function is associated with viral recovery.

Although there is extensive supporting literature on the use of facemask to reduce infection rates, its effect on the individual and course of disease has remained controversial. The purpose of this study was to find if mandatory masking influences the case fatality rate. This study used data on case updates, mask mandates, and demographic status related to the Kansas state, USA. The data were analyzed using a parallelization approach based on county-level data. The results showed that in Kansas during the summer of 2020, the counties with mask mandate had significantly higher case fatality rates compared to counties without mask mandate, with a risk ratio of 1.85 [1.51-2.10] for death with COVID-19. Even after adjusting for the number of protected persons, i.e., the number of persons who were not infected in the mask-mandated group compared to the no-mask group, the risk ratio remained significantly high at 1.52 [1.24-1.72]. By analyzing the excess mortality in Kansas, this study determines that over 95% of this effect can solely be attributed to COVID-19. The cause of this trend and the possible connection between long-term effects associated with SARS-CoV-2 and facemasks are explained in the theory herein by the foegen effect;i.e., deep reinhalation of pure virions caught in the facemasks as droplets can worsen the prognosis.

METHOD: A total of 984 participants completed a self-administered online questionnaire. RESULTS: Over 90% were healthy (i.e., not in a high-risk health-related group for COVID-19), did not have COVID-19 symptoms within 30 d, and always/frequently engaged in preventive measures. Fifty-eight percent thought that they had a 0% to 25% chance of having immunity/antibodies to COVID-19. Non-dental health care workers thought that their chance was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than others. Over 70% were sometimes, frequently, or always worried about their friends and loved ones getting COVID-19 and of resulting financial problems. Dental workers were significantly less afraid than non-dental health care and non-health care providers. For all groups, more than half of the respondents stated that the pandemic had a negative (somewhat worse or worse) impact on daily life (59%), interactions with others (65%), stress levels (66%), and enjoyment of life (56%). There were significant differences among all 3 groups regarding the percentage of individuals with a negative impact on job security (dental, 47%; non-dental health care, 34%; non-health care, 31%). However, more than half of the respondents stated that the pandemic had a positive impact (same, somewhat better, or much better) on caring about one another, self-care, and exercise. Knowing the results of an antibody test would decrease the level of stress and anxiety in 67% of respondents.

Each OCTR reading was concluded using a 5-point scale: normal, non-infectious, infectious non-COVID-19, indeterminate and highly suspicious of COVID-19. The senior reading reported the lesions' semiology, distribution, extent and differential diagnoses. After pre-filtering clinical and radiological features through univariate Chi-2, Fisher or Student t-tests (as appropriate), multivariate stepwise logistic regression (Step-LR) and classification tree (CART) models to predict a positive RT-PCR were trained on 412 patients, validated on an independent cohort of 101 patients and compared with the OCTR performances (295 and 71 with available clinical data, respectively) through area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC). Regarding models elaborated on radiological variables alone, best performances were reached with the CART model (i.e., AUC = 0.92 [versus 0.88 for OCTR], sensitivity = 0.77, specificity = 0.94) while step-LR provided the highest AUC with clinical-radiological variables (AUC = 0.93 [versus 0.86 for OCTR], sensitivity = 0.82, specificity = 0.91). Hence, these two simple models, depending on the availability of clinical data, provided high performances to diagnose positive RT-PCR and could be used by any radiologist to support, modulate and communicate their conclusion in case of COVID-19 suspicion. Practically, using clinical and radiological variables (GGO, fever, presence of fibrotic bands, presence of diffuse lesions, predominant peripheral distribution) can accurately predict RT-PCR status.","output":"Practical clinical and radiological models to diagnose COVID-19 based on a multicentric teleradiological emergency chest CT cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, namely Covid-19, one of the greatest pandemics in human history posed some new challenges to the human beings for its prevention and control as it is an airborne respiratory disease and highly contagious. The most common practices suggested by WHO and government of India are;to wear a face mask, keep social distancing etc. It becomes much more important when the whole world is opening its economy. In such situations, there are a number of places where maintaining social distances or wearing a face mask is quite a tough job for example Laboratories and eating messes and canteens of schools and colleges. Thus, the present studies focus on the designing of economic PODS which may be helpful in controlling the spread of airborne disease in mass gathering places like in educational institutions in particular laboratories and eating messes. The present studies first emphasize on the flow field analysis of human cough by assuming it as a turbulent jet using CFD. Then, based on the physical dimensions covered by the coughing jets a further detailed study is conducted on 23 number of PODS of various shapes and sizes using CFD to select a suitable POD so that the effect of coughing in a laboratory/mess can be minimized to contain the infections. A POD with 1 m length and 30 cm height having an arc inside (POD 20) is found to be the best POD to contain the airborne infections.","output":"Design of economic PODS to safeguard against contagious diseases using computational fluid dynamics (CFD)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A broad body of scientific literature exists on the effects that COVID-19 related confinement has had on the population: mental health problems, isolation, and problems concerning cohesion and employment, among others.

UVC inactivates a wide range of microorganisms by damaging the structure of nucleic acids and proteins at the molecular level, so they become unable to replicate and cause disease. Thus, UVC can improve indoor air quality by controlling bioaerosols and can be used as an engineering device to interrupt the transmission of pathogenic organisms and potential bioterrorism agents. Recently, the World Health Organization recognized that the COVID-19 virus could be transmitted across large distances, suggesting that indoor ventilation is key in airborne transmission. As a test for the future dissemination of UVC light installations to improve indoor air quality in Hospitals in Sergipe State, Brazil, we made a first installation of UVGI disinfection lamps, strategically placed in the Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at the University Hospital of Lagarto, Federal University of Sergipe, Brazil. Six 15 W low-vapor-pressure mercury lamps emitting 253.7 nm UVGI were installed in the ducts of the fan coil, maximizing their luminous interaction in the air passage. One of the greatest advantages of this type of installation is that the lamps were completely covered, avoiding any risk of hazardous exposure to people and animals. Microbiological tests were carried out to verify the germicidal effect, analyzing the viability of microorganisms circulating in the environment. In this paper, we present our encouraging results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the installation, suggesting that similar devices should be installed in HVAC systems to avoid biological risk to people inside buildings. In addition, we believe that this study may provide useful evidence and guidance for the design of equipment intended to abate the microorganisms that may be used in CBRNE terror attacks.","output":"Effectiveness of a UVC air disinfection system for the HVAC of an ICU"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Action on the World Health Organization Consolidated guideline on sexual and reproductive health and rights of women living with HIV requires evidence-based, equity-oriented, and regionally specific strategies centred on priorities of women living with HIV.

Between 2017 and 2019, leading Canadian womens HIV community, research, and clinical organizations partnered with the World Health Organization to convene a webinar series to describe the World Health Organization Consolidated guideline, define sexual and reproductive health and rights priorities in Canada, disseminate Canadian research and best practices in sexual and reproductive health and rights, and demonstrate the importance of communityCacademic partnerships and meaningful engagement of women living with HIV. Four webinar topics were pursued: (1) Trauma and Violence-Aware Care/Practice; (2) Supporting Safer HIV Disclosure; (3) Reproductive Health, Rights, and Justice; and (4) Resilience, Self-efficacy, and Peer Support. Subsequent in-person (2018) and online (2018C2021) consultation with > 130 key stakeholders further clarified priorities. Consultations yielded five cross-cutting key recommendations: 1. Meaningfully engage women living with HIV across research, policy, and practice aimed at advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights by, with, and for all women. 2. Centre Indigenous womens priorities, voices, and perspectives. 3. Use language that is actively de-stigmatizing, inclusive, and reflective of womens strengths and experiences. 4.

Conventional approaches such as the transpetrosal approach often require significant brain retraction. We present the successful purely endoscopic, endonasal, transclival resection of a symptomatic cavernoma located in the ventromedial pons. CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 17-year-old male patient presented with acute onset of headache, facial numbness, and tingling. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an enhancing lesion in the pons consistent with a cavernous malformation. Over the course of the next 3 weeks, the patient had 2 additional episodes of acutely worsening neurological deficits that left him with left-sided hemiparesis, a right sixth nerve palsy, and dysphagia. A purely endoscopic, endonasal, transclival approach was used to resect the cavernoma. Postoperatively, he had a transient worsening of his left-side motor function and restricted horizontal gaze, but at the last follow-up, his hemiparesis had improved and his magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a radiographic cure. He developed a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak despite prophylactic lumbar CSF drainage for 2 days and the use of bilateral vascularized nasoseptal flaps. The CSF leak was repaired with CSF diversion and a second surgical procedure; at the last follow-up, he had no recurrence of the leak. CONCLUSION An endoscopic, endonasal, transclival approach is a novel and effective approach to cavernous malformations presenting to the ventral surface of the pons. Recently developed techniques for closure and repair of the skull base defect have minimized but have not eliminated the risk of CSF leak in these procedures.","output":"Endoscopic, endonasal, transclival resection of a pontine cavernoma: case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have reviewed a considerable amount of recent scientific papers relating inflammation caused by air pollution with chronic and severe medical conditions.

Twenty-six studies were included with most studies coming from Brazil. No studies reported the incidence of HZ in the general population. In population at higher risk, the cumulative incidence ranged from 318-3,423 cases of HZ per 100,000 persons per year of follow-up. The incidence density was 6.4-36.5 cases per 1,000 person-years. Age was identified as a major risk factor towards HZ incidence which increase significantly in people >50 years of age. Hospitalization rates ranged from 3%-35.7%. The in-hospital HZ mortality rate ranged from 0%-36%. Overall, HZ mortality rates were found to be higher in females across all age groups and countries. The incidence of HZ complications (such as post-herpetic neuralgia, ophthalmic herpes zoster, and Ramsay Hunt syndrome) was higher in the immunosuppressed compared to the immunocompetent population. Acyclovir was the most frequently used therapy. Epidemiological data from Ministry of Health databases (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile y Mexico) and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Global Burden of Disease project reported stable rates of hospitalizations and deaths over the last 10 years.

METHODS: In this single\\\\arm prospective phase II trial, patients with unresectable locally advanced or recurrent/metastatic ESCC received camrelizumab 200 mg, liposomal paclitaxel 150 mg/m(2), and nedaplatin 50 mg/m(2) on day 1, and apatinib 250 mg on days 1\\\\14. The treatments were repeated every 14 days for up to 9 cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with camrelizumab and apatinib. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1). Secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), progression\\\\free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: We enrolled 30 patients between August 7, 2018 and February 23, 2019. The median follow\\\\up was 24.98 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23.05\\\\26.16 months). The centrally assessed ORR was 80.0% (95% CI: 61.4%\\\\92.3%), with a median duration of response of 9.77 months (range: 1.54 to 24.82+ months). The DCR reached 96.7% (95% CI: 82.8%\\\\99.9%). The median PFS was 6.85 months (95% CI: 4.46\\\\14.20 months), and the median OS was 19.43 months (95% CI: 9.93 months C not reached). The most common grade 3\\\\4 treatment\\\\related adverse events (AEs) were leukopenia (83.3%), neutropenia (60.0%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase level (26.7%). Treatment\\\\related serious AEs included febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, and anorexia in one patient (3.3%), and single cases of increased blood bilirubin level (3.3%) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (3.3%).

Seven hundred and ninety fresh stool samples were obtained from Omani patients attending Sultan Qaboos University Hospital with GI manifestation from the 1st of June to the 30th of November 2019. Bacterial identification in stool samples was carried out by inoculation in culture media, microscopical examination and biochemical tests confirmed by MALDI. BD PhoenixTM. The antibiotics sensitivity testing was carried out by the Manual disk diffusion method and by MALDI. BD PhoenixTM. Out of 790 stool samples, 49 samples were positive for GIT bacterial infections. Salmonella spp. was the most prevalent isolate and more associated with children less than ten years old. Out of the 49 bacterial isolates, 3 (6.1%) were Clostridium difficili, 4 (8.2%) were Shigella flexneri, 5 (10.2%) were Campylobacter jejuni, and different Salmonella spp. serotypes were detected such as Salmonella Kentucky (8.2%), Salmonella enteritidis (6.1%), Salmonella infantis (4.1%), Salmonella welteverden (4.1%), Salmonella typhimurium (4.1%), Salmonella anatum (2.0%), Salmonella tesvia (2.0%), Salmonella Uganda (2.0%), Salmonella Arizona (2.0%) and (40.8%) of other Salmonella spp. serotypes. Eighty percent of isolated Campylobacter jejuni were resistant to Ciprofloxacin and Tetracycline. Salmonella spp. and Shigella flexneri were highly resistant to Amikacin, Gentamicin, and Cefuroxime. The low level of bacterial infection detected among screened patients in the present study indicates the excellent hand washing hygiene practice in reducing GIT infections among patients in Oman. This good hand washing hygiene practice is of great help in the efforts of controlling the spread of other severe diseases like COVID-19.

Our focus is to explore the values associated with the principle of communicating early and often and how use of this principle can signal respect for people's self-determination whilst also conveying other values relevant to the circumstances. We suggest that doing this requires communication that explicitly acknowledges and addresses with empathy those who will be most directly impacted by any disease-control measures.

The outputs generally are the value-adding and decision-enabling predictions or simulations of how that physical system will act on those inputs. These help in quickly and easily realizing highly optimized and organized products with less cost and risk. The manufacturing industry had embraced the digital twin technology long time back to be modern in their operations, outputs, and offerings. The distinct contributions of the digital twin paradigm, since then, have gone up significantly with the seamless synchronization with a number of pioneering technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), big and streaming data analytics, data lakes, software-defined cloud environments, blockchain, etc. With the concept of cyber physical systems (CPS) is being adopted and adapted widely and wisely, complicated yet sophisticated electronics devices at the ground level are being blessed with their corresponding digital twins. The digital twins enable data scientists and system designers to optimize a number of things including process excellence, knowledge discovery and dissemination in time, better system design, robust verification and validation, etc. In the recent past, with the flourishing of the blockchain technology, the scope for digital twins has gone up remarkably.

The current pharmacotherapies for COVID-19 largely rely on supportive and anti-thrombi treatment and the repurposing of antimalarial and antiviral drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir. For a better mechanistic understanding of COVID-19, our present review focuses on its primary pathophysiologic features: hypoxia and cytokine storm, which are a prelude to multiple organ failure and lethality. We discussed a possible link between the activation of hypoxia inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;) and cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, since HIF-1&#945; is shown to suppress the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and upregulate disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17).

METHODS: From November to December 2020, we searched publicly available information (e.g. Department Of Corrections websites and press releases) for 53 US prison systems, including all states, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and Puerto Rico. Coders reviewed if states had prison labor policies, if states had COVID-19 specific prison labor policies, the location of work, industries both pre- and during the COVID-19 pandemic, the scope of work, and hourly wage. Findings were compared to the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions occupational vaccine prioritization recommendations. RESULTS: Every facility has incarcerated individuals working in some capacity with some resuming prison labor operations to pre-pandemic levels. All but one prison system has off-site work locations for their incarcerated population and many incarcerated workers have resumed their off-site work release assignments. Additionally, every state has incarcerated workers whose job assignments are considered frontline essential workers (e.g. firefighters). In at least five states, incarcerated workers are participating in frontline health roles that put them at higher risk of acquiring COVID-19. Yet, no state followed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended vaccination plan for its incarcerated population given their incarcerated workers essential worker status. CONCLUSION: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that incarcerated people be prioritized for vaccination primarily due to the risk present in congregate style prison and jail facilities. Furthermore, our review found that many incarcerated people perform labor that should be considered essential, which provides another reason why they should have been among the first in line for COVID-19 vaccine allocation.

However, it can take a great deal of time and effort for teachers to mark assessments, and to provide useful feedback to the students. Furthermore, it also creates a significant cognitive load on the assessors, especially in ensuring fairness and equity. Therefore, an alternative approach to marking called comparative judgement (CJ) has been proposed in the educational space. Inspired by the law of comparative judgment (LCJ). This pairwise comparison for as many pairs as possible can then be used to rank all submissions. Studies suggest that CJ is highly reliable and accurate while making it quick for the teachers. Alternative studies have questioned this claim suggesting that the process can increase bias in the results as the same submission is shown many times to an assessor for increasing reliability. Additionally, studies have also found that CJ can result in the overall marking process taking longer than a more traditional method of marking as information about many pairs must be collected. In this paper, we investigate Elo, which has been extensively used in rating players in zero-sum games such as chess. We experimented on a large-scale Twitter dataset on the topic of a recent major UK political event (\\"Brexit\\", the UK's political exit from the European Union) to ask users which tweet they found funnier between a pair selected from ten tweets.

This review summarizes the history, past achievements, and future directions of the GeoSentinel Network. KEY FINDINGS: Funded by the US CDC in 1996, GeoSentinel has grown from a group of eight US-based travel and tropical medicine centers to a global network, which currently consists of 68 sites in 28 countries. GeoSentinel has provided important contributions that have enhanced the ability to use destination-specific differences to guide diagnosis and treatment of returning travelers, migrants, and refugees. During the last two decades, GeoSentinel has identified a number of sentinel infectious disease events including previously unrecognized outbreaks and occurrence of diseases in locations thought not to harbor certain infectious agents. GeoSentinel has also provided useful insight into illnesses affecting different traveling populations such as migrants, business travelers, and students, while characterizing in greater detail the epidemiology of infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, leishmaniasis, and Zika virus disease. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance of travel- and migration-related infectious diseases has been the main focus of GeoSentinel for the last 25 years. However, GeoSentinel is now evolving into a network that will conduct both research and surveillance. The large number of participating sites and excellent geographic coverage for identification of both common and illnesses in individuals who have traversed international borders uniquely position GeoSentinel to make important contributions of travel-related infectious diseases in the years to come.","output":"GeoSentinel: past, present and future?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionIn the United States, COVID-19 is a nationally notifiable disease, cases and hospitalizations are reported to the CDC by states. Identifying and reporting every case from every facility in the United States may not be feasible in the long term. Creating sustainable methods for estimating burden of COVID-19 from established sentinel surveillance systems is becoming more important. We aimed to provide a method leveraging surveillance data to create a long-term solution to estimate monthly rates of hospitalizations for COVID-19. MethodsWe estimated monthly hospitalization rates for COVID-19 from May 2020 through April 2021 for the 50 states using surveillance data from COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) and a Bayesian hierarchical model for extrapolation. We created a model for six age groups (0-17, 18-49, 50-64, 65-74, 75-84, and []85 years), separately. We identified covariates from multiple data sources that varied by age, state, and/or month, and performed covariate selection for each age group based on two methods, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Spike and Slab selection methods. We validated our method by checking sensitivity of model estimates to covariate selection and model extrapolation as well as comparing our results to external data. ResultsWe estimated 3,569,500 (90% Credible Interval:3,238,000 - 3,934,700) hospitalizations for a cumulative incidence of 1,089.8 (988.6 - 1,201.3) hospitalizations per 100,000 population with COVID-19 in the United States from May 2020 through April 2021. Cumulative incidence varied from 352 - 1,821per 100,000 between states. The age group with the highest cumulative incidence was aged []85 years (5,583.1; 5,061.0 - 6,157.5). The monthly hospitalization rate was highest in December (183.8; 154.5 - 218.0). Our monthly estimates by state showed variations in magnitudes of peak rates, number of peaks and timing of peaks between states. ConclusionsOur novel approach to estimate COVID-19 hospitalizations has potential to provide sustainable estimates for monitoring COVID-19 burden, as well as a flexible framework leveraging surveillance data.","output":"Estimating COVID-19 Hospitalizations in the United States with surveillance data using a Bayesian Hierarchical model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces and frequent hand hygiene are recommended measures to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

An opt-in Internet panel survey of 502 U.S. adults was conducted in May 2020. Survey items evaluated knowledge regarding use and storage of cleaners, disinfectants, and hand sanitizers; attitudes about household cleaning and disinfection; and safety precautions practiced during the prior month. We assigned a knowledge score to each respondent to quantify knowledge of safety precautions and calculated median scores by demographic characteristics and attitudes. We identified gaps in knowledge regarding safe use and storage of cleaners, disinfectants, and hand sanitizers; the overall median knowledge score was 5.17 (95% CI: 4.85-5.50; maximum 9.00). Knowledge scores were lower among younger than older age-groups and among black non-Hispanic and Hispanic respondents compared with white non-Hispanic respondents. A greater proportion of respondents expressed knowledge of safety precautions than the proportion who engaged in these precautions. Tailored communication strategies should be used to reach populations with lower knowledge of cleaning and disinfection safety.

Here, we evaluated TB-LAMP performance alone and in combination with conventional assays for diagnosing PTB in Chinese children, using mycobacterial culture or CCRS (the composite clinical reference standard) as references. DESIGN OR METHODS: BALF samples were collected at Shenyang Tenth Peoples Hospital from 251 children susceptible to TB infection with indications for fiberoptic bronchoscopy. RESULTS: When mycobacterial culture was the reference, TB-LAMP used alongside smear microscopy doubled sensitivity for detecting pediatric PTB compared with smear microscopy alone (82.5% vs 40.0%). When CCRS was the reference, AFB microscopy, MTB culture, and TB-LAMP had sensitivities of 16.5%, 30.1%, and 51.1%, respectively, and specificities of 98.2%, 100.0%, and 99.1%. Combining MTB culture with TB-LAMP gave a sensitivity of 61.1% and specificity of 96.6%. TB-LAMP identified 39.3% and 43.2% of cases with negative MTB culture or AFB microscopy results.

Although males are affected slightly more than females, the impact of SARS-COV-2 on male reproductive system remains unclear. This systematic review aims to provide a concise update on the effects of COVID-19 on male reproductive health, including the presence of viral RNA in semen, and the impact on semen quality, testicular histology, testicular pain and male reproductive hormones. The global health is fronting an immediate as well as impending threat from the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease (COVID-19), that inflicts more males than females. Evidence suggest that male reproductive system is susceptible to this viral infection. However, there are still several pertinent queries that remain to be fully explained regarding the mechanism in testicular SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and the exact mode of its actions. Thus, the present systematic review aims to provide a concise update on the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on male reproduction.. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines searching the PubMed database. Eligibility for inclusion were original human studies evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on male reproductive health. Specific outcomes required for inclusion were at least one of the following: i) seminal detection of mRNA virus, or evaluation of ii) semen analysis, iii) testicular histology or ultrasonography, iv) testicular clinical symptoms and/or v) male reproductive hormones in COVID-19-positive patients. RESULTS: Of 553 retrieved articles, 25 met the inclusion criteria. This included studies primarily investigating the presence of viral RNA in semen (n = 12), semen quality (n = 2), testicular histology (n = 5), testicular pain (n = 2) and male reproductive hormones (n= 4). Results show little evidence for the presence of viral RNA in semen, although COVID-19 seems to affect seminal parameters, induce orchitis, and cause hypogonadism. Mortality cases suggest severe histological disruption of testicular architecture, probably due to a systemic and local reproductive tract inflammatory response and oxidative stress-induced damage. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical evaluation of the male reproductive tract, seminal parameters and reproductive hormones is recommended in patients with current or a history of COVID-19, particularly in males undergoing fertility treatment. Any long-term negative impact on male reproduction remains unexplored and an important future consideration.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on the male reproductive tract and fertility: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza A viruses are important pathogens that cause acute respiratory diseases and annual epidemics in humans. Macrophages recognize influenza A virus infection with their pattern recognition receptors, and are involved in the activation of proper innate immune response. Here, we have used high-throughput subcellular proteomics combined with bioinformatics to provide a global view of host cellular events that are activated in response to influenza A virus infection in human primary macrophages. We show that viral infection regulates the expression and/or subcellular localization of more than one thousand host proteins at early phases of infection. Our data reveals that there are dramatic changes in mitochondrial and nuclear proteomes in response to infection. We show that a rapid cytoplasmic leakage of lysosomal proteins, including cathepsins, followed by their secretion, contributes to inflammasome activation and apoptosis seen in the infected macrophages. Also, our results demonstrate that P2X(7) receptor and src tyrosine kinase activity are essential for inflammasome activation during influenza A virus infection. Finally, we show that influenza A virus infection is associated with robust secretion of different danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) suggesting an important role for DAMPs in host response to influenza A virus infection. In conclusion, our high-throughput quantitative proteomics study provides important new insight into host-response against influenza A virus infection in human primary macrophages.","output":"Quantitative Subcellular Proteome and Secretome Profiling of Influenza A Virus-Infected Human Primary Macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on PM(2.5) levels in eleven urban environments across the United States: Washington DC, New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Detroit, Phoenix, and Seattle. We estimate daily PM(2.5) levels over the contiguous U.S. in MarchCMay 2019 and 2020, and leveraging a deep convolutional neural network, we find a correlation coefficient, an index of agreement, a mean absolute bias, and a root mean square error of 0.90 (0.90), 0.95 (0.95), 1.34 (1.24) g/m(3), and 2.04 (1.87) g/m(3), respectively. Results from Google Community Mobility Reports and estimated PM(2.5) concentrations show a greater reduction of PM(2.5) in regions with larger decreases in human mobility and those in which individuals remain in their residential areas longer. The relationship between vehicular PM(2.5) (i.e., the ratio of vehicular PM(2.5) to other sources of PM(2.5)) emissions and PM(2.5) reductions (R = 0.77) in various regions indicates that regions with higher emissions of vehicular PM(2.5) generally experience greater decreases in PM(2.5).

The COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed for all patients. Median time to seeking medical care after COVID-19 was 4 [3; 7] months. The diagnosis of myocarditis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart (n=10) and by endomyocardial biopsy of the right ventricle (n=6). The virus was detected in the myocardium with PCR; immunohistochemical (IHC) study with antibody to SARS-Cov-2 was performed; anticardiac antibody level was measured; and echocardiography and Holter monitoring were performed. Hemodynamically significant coronary atherosclerosis was excluded for all patients older than 40 years.Results All patients showed a clear connection between the emergence or exacerbation of cardiac symptoms and COVID-19. 11 patients did not have any signs of heart disease before COVID-19; 4 patients had previously had moderate arrhythmia or heart failure (HF) without myocarditis. Symptoms of myocarditis emerged at 1-5 months following COVID-19. MRI revealed typical late gadolinium accumulation, signs of hyperemia, and one case of edema. The level of anticardiac antibodies was increased 3-4 times in 73 % ҧݧߧ. Two major clinical variants of post-COVID myocarditis were observed. 1. Arrhythmic (n=6), with newly developed extrasystole or atrial fibrillation without systolic dysfunction. 2. Decompensated variant with systolic dysfunction and biventricular HF (n=9). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 34.17.8 %, and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was 5.80.7 cm. In one case, myocarditis was associated with signs of IgG4?negative aortitis. SARS-Cov-2 RNA was found in 5 of 6 biopsy samples of the myocardium. The longest duration of SARS-Cov-2 persistence in the myocardium was 9 months following COVID-19.

As one such demographic, university students worldwide have experienced a sudden shift toward the provision of socially distanced online education, often in the absence of a coherent institutional plan. The mechanisms of stress appraisal and response differ between individuals in part determined by personality. With a sample of 293 undergraduate students at a Japanese university operating under prohibitions relating to face-to-face education, this article examines the impact of personality on the affordance of socially distanced online education mediated through generalized life stress and online learning stress appraisal. A retrimmed structural model returned an acceptable goodness of fit accounting for 31.6% of the criterion variance. The model indicates that conscientiousness (positive) and neuroticism (negative) hold a significant mediated impact on the affordance of socially distanced online education through generalized life stress and online learning stress appraisal. Moreover, and in the absence of face-to-face social interaction, the model shows that extroverted students experience greater online learning stress appraisals than neurotic students. Neurotic students were, however, negatively impacted by appraisals of generalized life stress but not online learning stress. Informed by personality characteristics and stress appraisals, the outcomes are discussed in relation to educational improvements and appropriate pedagogies for the delivery of socially distanced online education.

The proposed model adequately describes the development of the coronavirus epidemic with insufficient adherence to quarantine and social distancing. The transition from the absolute number of infected persons to their relative number per inhabitant of a settlement makes it possible to obtain universal calculation ratios. In performing the calculations, the choice of the date of the beginning of the epidemic is of great importance. Recommendations are given on how to determine the date of the beginning of the epidemic based on the analysis of statistical data on the spread of the epidemic. The coefficient of virus transmission rate k included in the calculated prognostic relation depends on the population size and the type of virus strain in the settlement in question. A simple ratio for calculating this coefficient as a function of population size is proposed. Control calculations performed using only a single empirical coefficient showed high accuracy. The calculated curves for Germany, Berlin, and its districts agree well with the corresponding statistical data. The correlation coefficients between the corresponding curves reach values of 0.93 to 0.97. The further development of the model should thus go in the direction of identifying causal links between the intensity of the epidemic and the main factors affecting this process. Some of these factors are related to the characteristics of the population's behaviour and the infrastructure of cities. The increase in the incidence in areas with a large percentage of the population rooted in Islamic countries is one of the main factors determining the development of the epidemic in Berlin. In order to explain and clarify this conclusion, it is necessary to make further assumptions about the possible emergence of a new strain of coronavirus in Berlin and in Germany and, accordingly, about the possibility of new epidemic waves. A preliminary ratio for predicting the spread of the epidemic under conditions of simultaneous existence of both strains of coronavirus is given. Simplicity of the proposed prognostic method and high accuracy of the results allow to recommend it as an effective tool for operative analysis of various measures aimed to control the spread of COVID-19 epidemic including mass vaccination of population.","output":"Analysis of the intensity of the COVID-19 epidemic in Berlin towards an universal prognostic relationship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic outbreak is an emerging new virus accountable for respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, originated in Wuhan city, Hubei province China, urgently calls to adopt prevention and intervention strategies Several viral epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003 and H1N1 influenza in 2009 were reported since last two decades Moreover, the Saudi Arabia was the epicenter for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 The CoVs are large family with single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) Genome sequence of 2019-nCoV, shows relatively different homology from other coronavirus subtypes, categorized in betacoronavirus and possibly found from strain of bats The COVID-19 composed of exposed densely glycosylated spike protein (S) determines virus binding and infiltrate into host cells as well as initiate protective host immune response Recently published reviews on the emerging SARS-CoV-2 have mainly focused on its structure, development of the outbreak, relevant precautions and management trials Currently, there is an urgency of pharmacological intervention to combat this deadly infectious disease Elucidation of molecular mechanism of COVID-19 becomes necessary Based on the current literature and understanding, the aim of this review is to provide current genome structure, etiology, clinical prognosis as well as to explore the viral receptor binding together functional insight of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) with treatment and preventive measures","output":"SARS-CoV-2: Insight in genome structure, pathogenesis and viral receptor binding analysis - An updated review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Direct analysis of whole blood on bloodstained textiles is achieved with thread spray mass spectrometry (MS).

AIM: The study aimed to assess the effect of lockdown on mental health among individuals (patients or accompanying person) seeking services at a tertiary care center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Kathmandu Medical College is a tertiary care center and a medical college in Kathmandu, Nepal. In this study, we enrolled every 4(th) individual coming to the hospital's outpatient department registration counter to seek service and giving consent, for the duration of 1 month during the ongoing lockdown period. A semi-structured questionnaire was developed and approved by the department and was used to collect sociodemographic details and to rate the stress level. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) Nepali version was used to assess psychological well-being of the participants and a score of 3 by binary method was taken as positive case. RESULTS: The total number of cases enrolled in the study was 204, out of them 62.2% were male and 32.8% were female and the mean age was 32.03 years. Twenty-three percent (23.5%) had preexisting health conditions. Out of the 204 participants, 67.6% said they were stressed following the lockdown and the mean rated stress was 2.90 in a scale ranging from 1 to 7. The frequently identified stressors were fear of contamination, restricted movement, and for inadequate supplies. Twenty-seven percent said they had some psychological symptoms and the most common symptoms were palpitation and sleep disturbance. Seventy-three individuals (36.5%) were found to have psychiatric problem according to their scores in GHQ-12. Rated stress and GHQ-12 scores were found to be strongly correlated (P = 0.000).

METHODS: We enrolled 117 consecutive patients admitted to Seoul St. Mary's Hospital with LRTI using the WHO criteria. We recorded data on fever duration and peak temperature before admission, duration of fever after admission, respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation upon admission, duration of oxygen supplementation, and duration of hospital stay. Upon admission, white blood cell (WBC) count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP level were measured. Multiplex respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction was performed using nasal swabs. PTX\\\\3, PCT, and various cytokines were measured after the study had been completed. RESULTS: We found that there was no significant difference in the level of PTX\\\\3 according to the type of viral infection. PTX\\\\3 levels showed a significant correlation with PCT levels, but not with levels of CRP. The level of PTX\\\\3 showed a significant correlation with peak temperature and duration of fever before admission as well as interleukin (IL)\\\\6 levels.

Evidence increasingly suggests that the symptoms of coronavirus disease\\\\2019 (COVID\\\\19)\\\\related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) differ from those of classic ARDS. Recently, the severity of COVID\\\\19 has been attributed to a systemic, thrombotic, and inflammatory disease that damages not only the lungs but multiple organs, including the heart, brain, toes, and liver. This systemic form of COVID\\\\19 may be due to inflammation and vascular endothelial cell injury. The vascular endothelial glycocalyx comprises glycoproteins, and plays an important role in systemic capillary homeostasis maintenance. The glycocalyx covers the entire vascular endothelium, and its thickness varies among organs. The endothelial glycocalyx is very thin in the pulmonary capillaries, where it is affected by gaseous exchange with the alveoli and the low intravascular pressure in the pulmonary circulation. Despite the clearly important roles of the glycocalyx in vascular endothelial injury, thrombosis, vasculitis, and inflammation, the link between this structure and vascular endothelial cell dysfunction in COVID\\\\19 remains unclear.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Nuchal translucency thickness at the first trimester scan was not significantly different in pregnant women with versus without SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy and there was no significantly increased risk of pregnancy loss in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first trimester. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Pregnant women are more vulnerable to viral infections. Previous coronavirus epidemics have been associated with increased maternal morbidity, mortality and adverse obstetric outcomes. Currently, no evidence exists regarding possible effects of SARS-CoV-2 in first trimester pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Cohort study of 1019 women with a double test taken between 17 February and 23 April 2020, as a part of the combined first trimester risk assessment, and 36 women with a first trimester pregnancy loss between 14 April and 21 May 2020, prior to the double test. The study period was during the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave in Denmark. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Cohort 1 included pregnant women with a double test taken within the study period. The excess serum from each double test was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Results were correlated to the nuchal translucency thickness and the number of pregnancy losses before or at the time of the first trimester scan. Cohort 2 included women with a pregnancy loss before the gestational age for double test sample. Serum from a blood test taken the day the pregnancy loss was identified was analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The study was conducted at a public university hospital serving a??12% of pregnant women and births in Denmark. All participants in the study provided written informed consent. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Eighteen (1.8%) women had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the serum from the double test suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy. There was no significant difference in nuchal translucency thickness for women testing positive for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 16) versus negative (n = 966) (P = 0.62). There was no significantly increased risk of pregnancy loss for women with antibodies (n = 1) (OR 3.4, 0.08-24.3 95% CI, P = 0.27). None of the women had been hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. None of the women with pregnancy loss prior to the double test (Cohort 2) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: These results may only apply to similar populations and to patients who do not require hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A limitation of the study is that only 1.8% of the study population had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies suggestive of previous infection. WIDER IMPLICATION OF THE FINDINGS: Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection had no effect on the nuchal translucency thickness and there was no significantly increased risk of pregnancy loss for women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in first trimester pregnancy. Evidence concerning COVID-19 in pregnancy is still limited. These data indicate that infection with SARS-CoV-2 in not hospitalized women does not pose a significant threat in first trimester pregnancies. Follow-up studies are needed to establish any risk to a fetus exposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection.

During evacuations the sharing of resources and vehicles is a crucial mechanism for expanding critical capacity and enabling inclusive disaster response. This paper examines the complexity of rideshare decision-making in the wake of simultaneous emergencies. Specifically, the need for physical distancing measures during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic complicates face-to-face resource sharing between strangers. The ability of on-demand ridesharing to provide emergency transportation to individuals without access to alternatives calls for an understanding of how evacuees weigh risks of contagion against benefits of spontaneous resource sharing. In this research, we examine both sociodemographic and situational factors that contribute to a willingness to share flood evacuation rides with strangers during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesize that the willingness to share is significantly correlated with traditional emergency resource sharing motivations and current COVID-19 risk factors. To test these hypotheses, we distributed an online survey during the pandemic surge in July 2020 to 600 individuals in three midwestern and three southern states in the United States with high risk of flooding. We estimate a random parameter multinomial logit model to determine the willingness to share a ride as a driver or passenger. Our findings show that willingness to share evacuation rides is associated with individual sociodemographics (such as being female, under 36 years old, Black, or republican-identifying) and the social environment (such as households with children, social network proximity, and neighborly sharing attitudes). Moreover, our findings suggest higher levels of income, COVID-19 threat perception, evacuation fear, and household preparedness all correspond with a lower willingness to share rides. We discuss the broader implications of emergency on-demand mobility during concurrent disasters to formulate strategies for transportation agencies and on-demand ridehailing providers.","output":"Dueling emergencies: Flood evacuation ridesharing during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Inhaled bronchodilator therapy is currently the mainstay of treatment for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Some inhalers require patients to achieve certain inhalation efforts either to activate the device or to deliver medication to the site of action. For dry powder inhalers, low peak inspiratory flow (PIF) can result in poor medication delivery but the clinical significance of this is not well understood. METHODS: TRONARTO was a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group study which stratified patients with moderate-to-severe COPD according to their PIF against medium-low resistance at screening. Patients were randomized to receive tiotropium/olodaterol (5 g/5 g) or matched placebo delivered via the Respimat(?) Soft Mist? inhaler (SMI). After 4 weeks of treatment, we assessed change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) area under the curve 0C3 hours (FEV(1) AUC(0C3h)) and trough FEV(1). RESULTS: Overall, 213 patients were randomized, of whom 106 received tiotropium/olodaterol (PIF <60 L/min, 55; PIF 60 L/min, 51) and 107 received placebo (PIF <60 L/min, 55; PIF 60 L/min, 52). For FEV(1) AUC(0C3h), the adjusted mean change from baseline versus placebo was 336 mL (95% confidence interval [CI] 246C425 mL; P<0.0001) in the PIF <60 L/min group and 321 mL (95% CI 233C409 mL; P<0.0001) in the PIF 60 L/min group. For trough FEV(1), the adjusted mean change from baseline versus placebo was 201 mL (95% CI 117C286 mL; P<0.0001) in the PIF <60 L/min group and 217 mL (95% CI 135C299 mL; P<0.0001) in the PIF 60 L/min group. CONCLUSION: In the TRONARTO study, which included patients with moderate-to-severe COPD and varying inspiratory flow abilities, treatment with tiotropium/olodaterol resulted in significant lung function improvements versus placebo.

However, limited data are available on how the immunological and transcriptional responses elicited by virulent and low-virulent PRRSV-1 strains are comparable and how they are conserved during the infection. To explore the kinetic transcriptional signature associated with the modulation of host immune response at lung level, a time-series transcriptomic analysis was performed in bronchoalveolar lavage cells upon experimental in vivo infection with two PRRSV-1 strains of different virulence, virulent subtype 3 Lena strain or the low-virulent subtype 1 3249 strain. The time-series analysis revealed overlapping patterns of dysregulated genes enriched in T-cell signaling pathways among both virulent and low-virulent strains, highlighting an upregulation of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory immune checkpoints that were disclosed as Hub genes. On the other hand, virulent Lena infection induced an early and more marked negative regulation of immune system process with an overexpression of co-inhibitory receptors genes related to T-cell and NK cell functions, in association with more severe lung lesion, lung viral load, and BAL cell kinetics. These results underline a complex network of molecular mechanisms governing PRRSV-1 immunopathogenesis at lung level, revealing a pivotal role of co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory immune checkpoints in the pulmonary disease, which may have an impact on T-cell activation and related pathways. These immune checkpoints, together with the regulation of cytokine-signaling pathways, modulated in a virulence-dependent fashion, orchestrate an interplay among pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the major threats to swine health and global production, causing substantial economic losses. We explore the mechanisms involved in the modulation of host immune response at lung level performing a time-series transcriptomic analysis upon experimental infection with two PRRSV-1 strains of different virulence. A complex network of molecular mechanisms was revealed to control the immunopathogenesis of PRRSV-1 infection, highlighting an interplay among pro- and anti-inflammatory responses as a potential mechanism to restrict inflammation-induced lung injury. Moreover, a pivotal role of co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory immune checkpoints was evidenced, which may lead to progressive dysfunction of T cells, impairing viral clearance and leading to persistent infection, favoring as well secondary bacterial infections or viral rebound. However, further studies should be conducted to evaluate the functional role of immune checkpoints in advanced stages of PRRSV infection and explore a possible T-cell exhaustion state.","output":"Time Series Transcriptomic Analysis of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Cells from Piglets Infected with Virulent or Low-Virulent Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus 1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) is a well-established microfluidic platform that allows the miniaturization of chemical and biological processes onto a single unit.

To slow down the spread of the virus and to limit the pressure on the health care systems, different regulations and recommendations have been implemented by authorities, comprising amongst others the closure of all entertainment venues and social distancing. These measures have received mixed reactions, particularly from young individuals, with many not following available advice. Drawing on the information in social media discussion forums, the present study explores the reasons why people ignore the orders and recommendations of the authorities and why the authorities are unable to produce a shared sense of inclusion concerning protective measures against the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Three open-access social media forums (Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube comments) were systematically searched with respect to COVID-19-related beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours of individuals. The data was retrieved in the first 3 weeks of March 2020. Qualitative document analysis and qualitative content analysis were used as the methodical approach. The data was reviewed by all authors and jointly interpreted to minimise inconsistencies. RESULTS: The study reveals that reasons such as information pollution on social media, the persistence of uncertainty about the rapidly spreading virus, the impact of the social environment on the individual, and fear of unemployment associated with inequality in the distribution of income lead people to ignore the orders and recommendations of the authorities. The findings suggest that government representatives and politicians could not produce a shared sense of inclusion concerning protective measures against the COVID-19 outbreak, due to not building trust among the public and taking concrete economic steps to satisfy them. CONCLUSION: In uncertain crises, transparency in the presentation of information and government policies emerge as influential determinants in creating social susceptibility and solidarity. The differences between social classes constitute one of the important factors that affect the decision-making mechanisms of individuals in determining the necessary steps to be undertaken in times of crisis.","output":"Lay perspectives on social distancing and other official recommendations and regulations in the time of COVID-19: a qualitative study of social media posts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Foram coletados cinqenta e oito (58) amostras de cachorro-do-mato (Cerdocyon thous) de vida livre, provenientes do Estado do Esprito Santo, Brasil.

While initial neuroresuscitative efforts are focused on ameliorating the effects of primary injury through patient stabilization, secondary injury in neurotrauma is a potential cause of cell death, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. These secondary injuries lack defined therapy. The major causes of secondary injury in neurotrauma include endoplasmic reticular stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the buildup of reactive oxygen or nitrogenous species. Stress to the endoplasmic reticulum in neurotrauma results in the overactivation of the unfolded protein response with subsequent cell apoptosis. Mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to the release of caspases and the buildup of reactive oxygen species; several characteristics make the central nervous system particularly susceptible to oxidative damage. Together, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial, and oxidative stress can have detrimental consequences, beginning moments and lasting days to months after the primary injury. Understanding these causative pathways has led to the proposal of various potential treatment options.","output":"Secondary Mechanisms of Neurotrauma: A Closer Look at the Evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work intends to determine the effect on the aroma profile, phenolic content and antioxidant activity of prickly pear vinegars produced by the surface culture at two different fermentation temperatures and using different acetic acid bacteria (AAB) inocula. Prickly pear wine was fermented at two temperature levels (30 and 37 C) by using bacteria inocula containing Acetobacter, Gluconobacter or a mixture of bacteria isolated from Sherry vinegars. Eighty-five individual volatile compounds from different families and sixteen polyphenolic compounds have been identified. It was confirmed that the highest temperature tested (37 C) resulted in a lower concentration of volatile compounds, while no significant effect on the vinegars' volatile composition could be associated with the AAB inoculum used. Contrariwise, the highest content of polyphenolic compounds was detected in those vinegars produced at 37 C and their concentration was also affected by the type of AAB inoculum used. Prickly pear wine displayed greater antioxidant activity than juices or vinegars, while the vinegars obtained through the mixture of AAB from Sherry vinegar showed higher antiradical activity than those obtained through either of the two AAB genera used in this study. It can be therefore concluded that, although the volatile content of vinegars decreased when fermented at a higher temperature, vinegars with a higher content in polyphenols could be obtained by means of partial fermentations at 37 C, as long as thermotolerant bacteria were employed.","output":"Influence of Different Bacteria Inocula and Temperature Levels on the Chemical Composition and Antioxidant Activity of Prickly Pear Vinegar Produced by Surface Culture."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the factors that affect the number of coronavirus (COVID-19) deaths among low-income and high-income countries Low-income countries report a significa","output":"Determinants of the Number of Deaths from COVID-19: Differences between Low-Income and High-Income Countries in the Initial Stages of the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Picornavirus positive-strand RNAs are selectively encapsidated despite the coexistence of viral negative-strand RNAs and cellular RNAs in infected cells. However, the precise mechanism of the RNA encapsidation process in picornaviruses remains unclear. Here we report the first identification of an RNA element critical for encapsidation in picornaviruses. The 5' end of the genome of Aichi virus, a member of the family Picornaviridae, folds into three stem-loop structures (SL-A, SL-B, and SL-C, from the most 5' end). In the previous study, we constructed a mutant, termed mut6, by exchanging the seven-nucleotide stretches of the middle part of the stem in SL-A with each other to maintain the base pairings of the stem. mut6 exhibited efficient RNA replication and translation but formed no plaques. The present study showed that in cells transfected with mut6 RNA, empty capsids were accumulated, but few virions containing RNA were formed. This means that mut6 has a severe defect in RNA encapsidation. Site-directed mutational analysis indicated that as the mutated region was narrowed, the encapsidation was improved. As a result, the mutation of the 7 bp of the middle part of the stem in SL-A was required for abolishing the plaque-forming ability. Thus, the 5'-end sequence of the Aichi virus genome was shown to play an important role in encapsidation.","output":"The 5'-end sequence of the genome of Aichi virus, a picornavirus, contains an element critical for viral RNA encapsidation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to describe a participatory qualitative research project using the Delphi consensus technique aided by Internet technology for successful transition of academic endeavors during and the post COVID era The study aimed to derive a holistic competency matrix for an optometry program for transformation of the program to competency-based education Design/methodology/approachThis study combined a scoping review of literature for developing a baseline competency framework, along with derivation of an E-Delphi consensus within a panel of diverse stakeholders to achieve the objective of plotting a detailed competency matrix FindingsThe involvement of all stakeholders of educational system in Delphi study resulted in a valid and all-inclusive competency framework with 18 competency units and 97 competency elements This framework provided a strong base for redesigning pedagogy and assessment methods during COVID-19 crisis Practical implicationsThe paper highlights the feasibility and utility of adopting a participatory approach during COVID-19 outbreak The Delphi technique aided by Internet technology was employed to develop a competency-based curriculum Social implicationsThe paper narrates a suitable, feasible and scientific method for rapid transition in academia, following the restrictions and social distancing norms imposed during the COVID-19 outbreak Originality/valueAlthough there is good evidence for use of the Delphi technique in curriculum development, this paper adds value by focusing on a participatory approach in using it The suggested method here shows ways to gain optimum scientific output with minimum resources in constrained situations such as COVID-19 crisis","output":"Adopting a modified Delphi technique for revisiting the curriculum: a useful approach during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE to describe multimodal imaging and electrophysiology of multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS) concomitant with COVID-19 infection in a patient on BRAF (B Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma) and MEK (Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase) inhibitors.

In order to meet these needs, healthcare provision has to be dynamic and reactive to provide the highest standards of safe care.

However, due to the increasing complexity of healthcare, including in community settings, an expanded theoretical informed view of in situ simulation is needed as a form of education that can drive organizational as well as individual learning. MAIN BODY: Cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) provides us with analytical tools to recognize and analyse complex health care systems. Making visible the key elements of an in situ simulation process and their interconnections, CHAT facilitates development of a system-level view of needs of change.

The relation between these measures and moral decision making was assessed. Based on our results, clinicians most important source of stress was the infection of their families. There was a positive correlation between utilitarian responses and clinicians stress level, and number of dead cases they confronted with. Moreover, degree of utilitarian behavior was positively correlated to social distancing. Both age and sex contributed to individual differences in respecting social distancing, stress and utilitarian behavior.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify changes to Californias prison population since the pandemic began and identify risk factors for COVID-19 infection. DESIGN: For California state prisons (March 1COctober 10, 2020), we described residents demographic characteristics, health status, COVID-19 risk scores, room occupancy, and labor participation. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the association between rates of COVID-19 infection and room occupancy and out-of-room labor, respectively. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of California state prisons. MAIN MEASURES: Changes in the incarcerated populations size, composition, housing, and activities. For the risk factor analysis, the exposure variables were room type (cells vs. dormitories) and labor participation (any room occupant participating in the prior 2 weeks) and the outcome variable was incident COVID-19 case rates. KEY RESULTS: The incarcerated population decreased 19.1% (119,401 to 96,623) during the study period. On October 10, 2020, 11.5% of residents were aged 60, 18.3% had high COVID-19 risk scores, 31.0% participated in out-of-room labor, and 14.8% lived in rooms with 10 occupants. Nearly 40% of residents with high COVID-19 risk scores lived in dormitories. In 9 prisons with major outbreaks (6,928 rooms; 21,750 residents), dormitory residents had higher infection rates than cell residents (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 2.51 95% CI, 2.25C2.80) and residents of rooms with labor participation had higher rates than residents of other rooms (AHR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.39C1.74).

One population that has received little attention in terms of medical education are d/Deaf and hard of hearing patients, although there is much evidence to support health care disparities in this population. Several major contributing factors include differing views of deafness between medical professionals and those who are culturally Deaf, a lack of understanding of Deaf Culture and American Sign Language (ASL) by medical professionals, a lack of educational resources in ASL, and poor experiences in health care. To address this need, a Deaf Culture Applied Anatomy session was incorporated into the first-year curriculum at Morehouse School of Medicine while medical students were studying anatomy of the ear and hearing. Panelists, who were culturally Deaf, hard of hearing, and hearing children of deaf adults, shared their experiences in healthcare, including challenges they faced with communication and care. Surveys were provided to students before and after the panel session. Surveys indicated a lack of knowledge prior to this session, while also demonstrating that this 90-minute session improved students' understanding of effective communication with future patients and issues related to deafness.

Suicide is a serious health problem that is shaped by a variety of social and mental health factors. A growing body of research connects the arts to positive health outcomes; however, no previous systematic reviews have examined the use of the arts in suicide prevention and survivorship. This review examined how the arts have been used to address suicide prevention and survivorship in nonclinical settings in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. Design and Setting. Ten bibliographic databases, five research repositories, and reference sections of articles were searched to identify published studies. Articles presenting outcomes of interventions conducted between 2014 and 2019 and written in English, were included. Primary Results. Nine studies met inclusion criteria, including qualitative, quantitative randomized controlled trials, quantitative nonrandomized, quantitative descriptive, and mixed-methods studies. The programs studied used film and television (n = 3), mixed-arts (n = 3), theatre (n = 2), and quilting (n = 1). All nine interventions used the arts to elicit emotional involvement, while seven also used the arts to encourage engagement with themes of health. Study outcomes included increased self-efficacy, awareness of mental health issues, and likelihood for taking action to prevent suicide, as well as decreases in suicidal risk and self-harming behaviors. Conclusions. Factors that influence suicide risk and survivorship may be effectively addressed through arts-based interventions. While the current evidence is promising with regard to the potential for arts programs to positively affect suicide prevention and survivorship, this evidence needs to be supplemented to inform recommendations for evidence-based arts interventions.","output":"Systematic Review of Arts-Based Interventions to Address Suicide Prevention and Survivorship in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The use of negative pressure dressings for open abdominal therapy has made a great impact on strategies for open abdominal treatment. Observed intestinal damage and developement of fistula formation raises questions about safety of commonly used systems (AB-Thera). The most common used system uses foils for shielding intestines directly from negative pressure. As an alternative a system with open pore dressing in double layer film was introduced (Suprasorb CNP) and proved to safe in animal studies. We compared the effects of this two systems on patients requiring open abdominal treatment. Materials and methods: Patients with secondary peritonitis in at least two abdominal quadrants were included in this randomized study. Inclusion criteria were secondary peritonitis (ACS), abdominal compartment syndrome, and abdominal trauma combined with ACS and/or contaminated abdomen. Patients with active bleeding and pancreatitis were not included. We examined Mannheim peritonitis Index (MPI), bloodcount, PCT, amount of fluid collected, and morphological changes on the bowel. Data were collected on day 2, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Primary end point was fascial closure. Examination was terminated in case of death and damage to the abdominal organs. Groups were compared using Mann Whitney U-test and chi square test. Trend evaluation was evaluated using an one way repeated measure analysis of variance. P-values below 0.05 was considered significat. Results: Thirty four patients were included between August 2010 and September 2012. There were no significant difference between two groups in MPI, age, and gender. Mean duration of treatment, WBC, CRP, and abdominal closure rate were not significantly different between groups. Suprasorb CNP System collected twice more fluid than AB-Thera and decreased PCT on significantly faster rate than AB-Thera. Four patients died (11%) and four patients developed enteric fistula (11%). Closure rate was achieved in 27 out of 34 Patients (79.5%). Closure rate was not significantly different between groups. Conclusion: The use of both systems proved to be efficient and safe. The application of well-dosed, moderate negative pressure on contaminated areas of the abdomen seems to have a lot of potential and it is worth directing greater research potential in this direction.","output":"Effect of Negative Pressure Therapy on Open Abdomen Treatments.

We sought to leveraging organic, large-scale discussion on Twitter about social distancing to understand publics beliefs and opinions on this policy. METHODS: Between March 27 and April 10, 2020, we sampled 574,903 English tweets that matched the two most trending social distancing hashtags at the time, #socialdistancing and #stayathome. We used natural language processing techniques to conduct a sentiment analysis that identifies tweet polarity and emotions. We also evaluated the subjectivity of tweets and estimated the frequency of discussion of social distancing rules. We then identified clusters of discussion using topic modeling and compared the sentiment by topic. RESULTS: There was net positive sentiment toward both #socialdistancing and #stayathome with mean sentiment scores of 0.150 (standard deviation [SD], 0.292) and 0.144 (SD, 0.287) respectively. Tweets were also more likely to be objective (median, 0.40; IQR, 0 to 0.6) with approximately 30% of all tweets labeled as completely objective. Approximately half (50.4%) of all tweets primarily expressed joy and one-fifth expressed fear and surprise each (Figure 1). These trends correlated well with topic clusters identified by frequency including leisure activities and community support (i.e., joy), concerns about food insecurity and effects of the quarantine (i.e., fear), and unpredictability of COVID and its unforeseen implications (i.e., surprise) (Table 1).

Investigation of nonsynonymous SNVs of the IGHV cluster in 9335 Japanese subjects identified the C allele of rs6423677, located in IGHV3-66, as the most significant reproducible association (OR = 1.25, P = 6.8  10(?10) in 3603 cases and 5731 controls). We observed highly skewed allelic usage of IGHV3-66, wherein the rs6423677 A allele was nearly abolished in the transcripts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of both KD patients and healthy adults. Association of the high-expression allele with KD strongly indicates some active roles of B-cells or endogenous immunoglobulins in the disease pathogenesis. Considering that significant association of SNVs in the IGHV region with disease susceptibility was previously known only for rheumatic heart disease (RHD), a complication of acute rheumatic fever (ARF), these observations suggest that common B-cell related mechanisms may mediate the symptomology of KD and ARF as well as RHD.","output":"Association of an IGHV3-66 gene variant with Kawasaki disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social capital provides a number of benefits during crisis scenarios, and high social capital communities respond more efficaciously than those with low social capital.

Prior to seroconversion, PBMC transcriptomes did not distinguish symptom severity. In contrast, changes in chromatin accessibility were associated with symptom severity. Furthermore, single-cell analyses revealed evolution of the chromatin accessibility landscape and transcription factor motif occupancy for individual PBMC cell types. The most extensive remodeling occurred in CD14+ monocytes where sub-populations with distinct chromatin accessibility profiles were associated with disease severity.

METHODS: In this study, we have conducted 2 digital surveys immediately before and 2 months after the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We surveyed a validated Dutch questionnaire 'Utrecht Burn-out Scale,' derived from the Maslach Burn-out Inventory, and also collected the 'Utrecht Work Engagement Scale' measuring work engagement. Additionally, we describe the coronavirus disease-care participation of surgical residents, the impact on how they experienced the quality of their surgical training, and the influence on 'Burn-out and Work Engagement' compared with the pre-coronavirus disease 2019 period for surgical residents in the Netherlands.

Hygienic precautions are a key aspect of dialysis care for infection prevention, but they are not sufficient to completely avoid the occurrence of CVC related infections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, hygienic precautions for preventing viral transmission have been markedly reinforced. We evaluated their effects on CVC-related infection rates. METHODS: An observational retrospective study was conducted in two hemodialysis units of the same institution treating 215 chronic hemodialysis patients, 71 of whom are currently (33%) using a CVC. In the CVC cohort, we compared data on catheter-related infection rates during the maximum spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy (February to May 2020) with data from the same period of the previous year and with the whole of 2019. RESULTS: In 2019, we recorded a catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) rate of 1.19 (95% CI 0.81-1.68)/1000 days [2.07 (95% CI 1.12-3.52)/1000 days in the Feb-May 2019 period] and a tunnel and exit-site infection rate of 0.82 (95% CI 0.51-1.24)/1000 days [1.04 (95% CI 0.41-2.15)/1000 days in the Feb-May 2019 period]. Infection rates drastically decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, with just one catheter-related bloodstream infection being recorded. Catheter-related bloodstream infection rates showed a significant reduction to 0.20 (95% CI 0.01-0.9)/1000 days (p < 0.05 and p < 0.005 compared to 2019 and to Feb-May 2019, respectively) and a non-significant reduction in tunnel and exit-site infections to 0.6 (95% CI 0.15-1.6)/1000 days. CONCLUSIONS: The observed 91% reduction in catheter-related bloodstream infections compared to the same period in 2019 [IRR 0.09 (95% CI 0.002-0.64)] and the 83% reduction compared to the whole of 2019 [IRR 0.17 (95% CI 0.004-1.009)] suggest that a stricter implementation of hygienic precautions in the dialysis setting can markedly improve the problem of CVC-related infections.","output":"Targeting COVID-19 prevention in hemodialysis facilities is associated with a drastic reduction in central venous catheter-related infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gitelman syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive salt-losing tubulopathy caused by biallelic inactivating mutations in the SLC12A3 gene.

In the absence of a common approach to ensure access to this essential health service, we sought to describe the variability of abortion policies during the outbreak in Europe in order to identify strategies that improve availability and access to abortion in times of public health crises. METHODS: We collected information from 46 countries/regions: 31 for which country-experts completed a survey and 15 for which we conducted a desk review. We describe abortion regulations and changes to regulations and practice during the pandemic. RESULTS: During COVID-19, abortions were banned in six countries and suspended in one. Surgical abortion was less available due to COVID-19 in 12 countries/regions and services were not available or delayed for women with COVID-19 symptoms in eleven. No country expanded its gestational limit for abortion. Changes during COVID-19, mostly designed to reduce in-person consultations, occurred in 13 countries/regions. Altogether eight countries/regions provided home medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol beyond 9 weeks (from 9 weeks+6 days to 11 weeks+6 days) and 13 countries/regions up to 9 weeks (in some instances only misoprostol could be taken at home).

METHODS: We report the results of our quality improvement intervention at Duke University Hospital, in which pharmacists were involved in the discharge medication reconciliation process on select high-risk general medicine patients over 2 years (2018C2020). Pharmacists performed traditional discharge medication reconciliation which included a review of medications for clinical appropriateness and affordability. A total of 1569 patients were identified as high risk for hospital readmission using the Epic readmission risk model and had a clinical pharmacist review the discharge medication reconciliation. RESULTS: This intervention was associated with a significantly lower 7-day readmission rate in patients who scored high risk for readmission and received pharmacist support in discharge medication reconciliation versus those patients who did not receive pharmacist support (5.8% vs 7.6%). There was no effect on readmission rates of 14 or 30 days. The clinical pharmacists had at least one intervention on 67% of patients reviewed and averaged 1.75 interventions per patient. CONCLUSION: This quality improvement study showed that having clinical pharmacists intervene in the discharge medication reconciliation process in patients identified as high risk for readmission is associated with lower unplanned readmission rates at 7 days. The interventions by pharmacists were significant and well received by ordering providers. This study highlights the important role of a clinical pharmacist in the discharge medication reconciliation process.","output":"Inpatient pharmacists using a readmission risk model in supporting discharge medication reconciliation to reduce unplanned hospital readmissions: a quality improvement intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mass vaccination campaigns have significantly reduced the COVID-19 burden. However, vaccine hesitancy has posed significant global concerns. The purpose of this study was to determine the characteristics that influence perceptions of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy, acceptability, hesitancy and decision making to take vaccine among general adult populations in a variety of socioeconomic and cultural contexts. METHODS: Using a snowball sampling approach, we conducted an online cross-sectional study in 20 countries across four continents from February to May 2021. RESULTS: A total of 10,477 participants were included in the analyses with a mean age of 3614.3 years. The findings revealed the prevalence of perceptions towards COVID-19 vaccines effectiveness (78.8%), acceptance (81.8%), hesitancy (47.2%), and drivers of vaccination decision-making (convenience [73.3%], health providers advice [81.8%], and costs [57.0%]). The county-wise distribution included effectiveness (67.8C95.9%; 67.8% in Egypt to 95.9% in Malaysia), acceptance (64.7C96.0%; 64.7% in Australia to 96.0% in Malaysia), hesitancy (31.5C86.0%; 31.5% in Egypt to 86.0% in Vietnam), convenience (49.7C95.7%; 49.7% in Austria to 95.7% in Malaysia), advice (66.1C97.3%; 66.1% in Austria to 97.3% in Malaysia), and costs (16.0C91.3%; 16.0% in Vietnam to 91.3% in Malaysia). In multivariable regression analysis, several socio-demographic characteristics were identified as associated factors of outcome variables including, i) vaccine effectiveness: younger age, male, urban residence, higher education, and higher income; ii) acceptance: younger age, male, urban residence, higher education, married, and higher income; and iii) hesitancy: male, higher education, employed, unmarried, and lower income. Likewise, the factors associated with vaccination decision-making including i) convenience: younger age, urban residence, higher education, married, and lower income; ii) advice: younger age, urban residence, higher education, unemployed/student, married, and medium income; and iii) costs: younger age, higher education, unemployed/student, and lower income.

Football is the most popular sport worldwide, and recreational football training leads to broad-spectrum health effects. Football is, however, deemed a contact sport with frequent close contact important to consider during COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated time spent with close contact (danger zone (DZ) within 1.5 m), number of contacts and time per contact, and compared game formats in recreational small-sided football games for young and adult male football players. METHODS: Movement analyses were performed on 10 Hz Global Positioning System (GPS) data collected during various small-sided football games prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: Time spent in the DZ was 4.3C7.9 s/h per per cent infected players, corresponding to 34.3C114.8 s/h if one player was infected. Number of contacts with one infected player was 23.5C87.7 per hour, with an average contact time of 1.1C1.4 s, and a total number of contacts of 311C691 per hour with all players. 53%C65% of all contacts were shorter than 1 s and 77%C85% shorter than 2 s. Trivial to small effects were found for number of participants and area per player, whereas standard of play and playing with/without boards had no effect. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that during small-sided football limited time is spent within DZ and that player contacts are brief.

After the state of emergency was lifted in Japan, schools have reopened, and teachers are conducting face-to-face classes while maintaining safety precautions. This study aimed to assess the factors contributing to infection-related anxiety and educational anxiety among teachers conducting face-to-face classes during the COVID-19 pandemic after schools reopened. METHODS: This questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted with 263 primary and middle school teachers in the Shinagawa area of Tokyo (October 10C30, 2020). The questionnaire assessed the type of school (primary or middle school), sex, age, and factors contributing to infection-related anxiety and educational anxiety that arose from the pandemic. The levels of anxiety and the factors contributing to anxiety were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very anxious). RESULTS: In an analysis of the data of 237 participants excluding the missing data, many teachers reported feeling infection- and education-related anxiety. A majority of the participants were women (n = 152, 64.1%), and the mean age of the participants was 39.8  11.3 years. A stepwise multiple regression analysis identified six factors for infection-related anxiety as significant (R(2) = 0.61, p < 0.001). Among these variables, the largest partial regression coefficient value was reported for the following reason: I feel anxious because we cannot ensure the safety of teachers themselves or of their families ( = 0.37, p < 0.001). For educational anxiety, four of six reasons were identified as significant (R(2) = 0.64, p < 0.001). Among these, anxiety about the students home situations ( = 0.41, p < 0.001) and delay in education (students side) ( = 0.27, p < 0.001) had stronger associations with anxiety compared to the others. CONCLUSION: In-person education during the COVID-19 pandemic has caused teachers to experience anxiety. This report provides useful information by highlighting the reasons for infection-related anxiety and educational anxiety that teachers experience in face-to-face classes during a pandemic. Even if the coverage of a COVID-19 vaccine becomes widespread worldwide, we will still be combating COVID-19 infections for at least a few years. Given concerns regarding such infections, to ensure students right to education, it is essential to understand why teachers feel anxious and to determine appropriate measures to decrease such anxiety.","output":"Causes of anxiety among teachers giving face-to-face lessons after the reopening of schools during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) sequencing can identify resistance mechanisms and guide next-line therapy in ALK+ non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the clinical significance of other rebiopsy findings remains unclear.

However, it is ineffective without appropriate public acceptance. In Poland, 53% of the countrys population is vaccinated, which puts us in the last position among the EU countries. Therefore, this study aims to assess the main concerns regarding vaccination in the unvaccinated population of Poland. The study was based on an original questionnaire that was distributed online. There were three phases of the study: Phase 1before the preventive vaccination plan, Phase 22 months after implementation of the programme, Phase 3after 4 months when the immunisation rate in Poland was 42%. A total of 4459 individuals participated in the study. As many as 1943 participants were excluded from the analysis due to lack of consent (30 subjects) or COVID-19 vaccination (1913 subjects). Out of the remaining 2516 unvaccinated individuals, 463 were participants in the first phase of the study, 1137 in the second phase of the study, and 916 in the third phase. As the preventive vaccination plan in Poland continued, concerns about vaccine adverse events, safety and efficacy were raised. The only lower concern was that about the vaccine transportation rules. Moreover, as the vaccination programme continued, there was an increase in the percentage of individuals declaring their full reluctance towards vaccination against COVID-19. Conclusions: The Internet is the main source of knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccination, so it should be focused on during vaccination campaigns. The public is primarily concerned about adverse events of vaccines and the lack of appropriate tests of the products used.

This study aimed to investigate if enhanced hygienic measures, including the systematic use of personal protective equipment (PPE), determined a decrease in HAI during the recent COVID-19 outbreak in COVID-free neurological units. METHODS: Patients hospitalized in neurology and stroke units of Policlinico Umberto I Hospital in Rome from March 8, 2020 and discharged prior to May 31, 2020 were included in the study and compared with patients hospitalized during the same period in 2019. RESULTS: A total of 319 patients were included in the study (n = 103 in 2020, n = 216 in 2019). Among patients hospitalized in 2019, the incidence of HAIs was 31.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25C0.38), compared with 23.3% (95% CI: 0.15C0.32) in 2020 (p = 0.12). Multivariable logistic regression showed that hospitalization during 2020 was independently associated with a lower risk of HAIs (odds ratio: 0.34, 95% CI:0.16C0.71, p = 0.004).

In addition to the pharmacological activities, in the 1980s, an interaction and uptake of these molecules by the liver was verified, which was later confirmed by other studies through the discovery of specific receptors in the hepatocytes. The presence of these specific receptors in the liver led to vectorization and delivery of drugs, by the introduction of glycyrrhizic acid or glycyrrhetinic acid on the surface of nanosystems, for the treatment of liver diseases. This review describes experimental evidence of vectorization by conjugating glycyrrhizic acid or glycyrrhetinic acid to nanosystems and delivery of antitumor drugs for the treatment of liver cancer and also describes the techniques used to perform this conjugation. We have shown that due to the existence of specific receptors for these molecules, in addition to the targeting of nanosystems to hepatocytes, nanosystems having glycyrrhizic acid or glycyrrhetinic acid on their surface had the same therapeutic effect in a significantly lower dose compared to the free drug and unconjugated nanosystems, with consequent reduction of side effects and toxicity.","output":"Glycyrrhizic Acid and Its Hydrolyzed Metabolite 18-Glycyrrhetinic Acid as Specific Ligands for Targeting Nanosystems in the Treatment of Liver Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Secure Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is becoming increasingly important with the ever-growing number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in our daily life. To achieve secure D2D communication, the key agreement between different IoT devices without any prior knowledge is becoming desirable. Although various approaches have been proposed in the literature, they suffer from a number of limitations, such as low key generation rate and short pairing distance. In this paper, we present InaudibleKey, an inaudible acoustic signal-based key generation protocol for mobile devices. Based on acoustic channel reciprocity, InaudibleKey exploits the acoustic channel frequency response of two legitimate devices as a common secret to generating keys. InaudibleKey employs several novel technologies to significantly improve its performance. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed system in different real environments. Compared to state-of-the-art works, InaudibleKey improves key generation rate by 3-145 times, extends pairing distance by 3.2-44 times, and reduces information reconciliation counts by 2.5-16 times. Security analysis demonstrates that InaudibleKey is resilient to a number of malicious attacks. We also implement InaudibleKey on modern smartphones and resource-limited IoT devices.

Schools are a logical setting for youth suicide prevention activities, with universal, selective and indicated approaches all demonstrating efficacy. Given that international best practice recommends suicide prevention programmes combine these approaches, and that to date this has not been done in school settings, this study aims to evaluate a suicide prevention programme incorporating universal, selective and indicated components in schools. METHODS: This study is a trial of a multimodal suicide prevention programme for young people. The programme involves delivering universal psychoeducation (safeTALK) to all students, screening them for suicide risk, and delivering internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (Reframe IT) to those students identified as being at high risk for suicide. The programme will be trialled in secondary schools in Melbourne, Australia, and target year 10 students (15 and 16 year-olds). safeTALK and screening will be evaluated using a single group pre-test/post-test case series, and Reframe IT will be evaluated in a Randomised Controlled Trial. The primary outcome is change in suicidal ideation; other outcomes include help-seeking behaviour and intentions, and suicide knowledge and stigma. The programmes cost-effectiveness will also be evaluated. DISCUSSION: This study is the first to evaluate a suicide prevention programme comprising universal, selective and indicated components in Australian schools. If the programme is found to be efficacious and cost-effective, it could be more widely disseminated in schools and may ultimately lead to reduced rates of suicide and suicidal behaviour in school students across the region.

It is important to first consider the question of whether or not the \\"duty to treat\\" might be subject to contextual constraints. The purpose of this study was to investigate the opinions and beliefs held by both physicians and dentists regarding the occupational risks of infectious diseases, and to analyze the argument that the notion of \\"presumed consent\\" on the part of professionals may be grounds for supporting the duty to treat. METHODS: For this cross-sectional survey, the study population was selected from among physicians and dentists in Ankara. All of the 373 participants were given a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 79.6% of the participants said that they either had some degree of knowledge about the risks when they chose their profession or that they learned of the risks later during their education and training. Of the participants, 5.2% said that they would not have chosen this profession if they had been informed of the risks. It was found that 57% of the participants believed that there is a standard level of risk, and 52% of the participants stated that certain diseases would exceed the level of acceptable risk unless specific protective measures were implemented. CONCLUSION: If we use the presumed consent argument to establish the duty of the HCW to provide care, we are confronted with problems ranging over the difficulty of choosing a profession autonomously, the constant level of uncertainty present in the medical profession, the near-impossibility of being able to evaluate retrospectively whether every individual was informed, and the seemingly inescapable problem that this practice would legitimize, and perhaps even foster, discrimination against patients with certain diseases. Our findings suggest that another problem can be added to the list: one-fifth of the participants in this study either lacked adequate knowledge of the occupational risks when they chose the medical profession or were not sufficiently informed of these risks during their faculty education and training. Furthermore, in terms of the moral duty to provide care, it seems that most HCWs are more concerned about the availability of protective measures than about whether they had been informed of a particular risk beforehand. For all these reasons, the presumed consent argument is not persuasive enough, and cannot be used to justify the duty to provide care. It is therefore more useful to emphasize justifications other than presumed consent when defining the duty of HCWs to provide care, such as the social contract between society and the medical profession and the fact that HCWs have a greater ability to provide medical aid.","output":"Can \\"presumed consent\\" justify the duty to treat infectious diseases?

Although socioeconomic disparities in acoustically measured and geospatially estimated noise have been established, less is known about disparities in noise complaints, one of the most common sources of distress reported to local municipalities. Furthermore, although some studies have posited urban quieting during the COVID-19 pandemic, little empirical work has probed this and probed noise complaints during the pandemic. OBJECTIVES Using over 4 million noise complaints from the New York City (NYC) 311 database, we quantified census tract-level socioeconomic disparities in noise complaints since 2010 and examined how such disparities changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Using data from January 2010 through February 2020, we fit linear mixed-effects models, estimating monthly tract-level noise complaints by the proportion of residents who were low-income, time in months since January 2010, categorical month, their interactions, and potential confounds, such as total population and population density. To estimate COVID-19 pandemic effects, we included additional data from March 2020 through February 2021 and additional interactions between proportion low-income, month of year, and an indicator variable for COVID-19 pandemic onset in March 2020. RESULTS Census tracts with a higher proportion of low-income residents reported more monthly noise complaints and this increased over time (time  month  proportion low-income interaction p-values < .0001 for all months), particularly in warmer months. Socioeconomic disparities in noise complaints were exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic (month  proportion low-income  pandemic era interaction p-values < .0001 for March through November), also in a seasonal manner. DISCUSSION Since 2010, noise complaints have increased the most in the most economically distressed communities, particularly in warmer seasons. This disparity was particularly exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, contrary to some theories of urban quieting.

Tracking case numbers over time allows us to determine speed of spread and the effectiveness of interventions. Changing case definitions during an epidemic can affect these inferences. MethodsWe examined changes in the case definition for COVID-19 in mainland China during the first epidemic wave. We used simple models assuming exponential growth and then exponential decay to estimate how changes in the case definitions affected the numbers of cases reported each day. We then inferred how the epidemic curve would have appeared if the same case definition had been used throughout the epidemic. FindingsFrom January through to early March 2020, seven versions of the case definition for COVID-19 were issued by the National Health Commission in China. As of February 20, there were 55,508 confirmed cases reported in mainland China. We estimated that when the case definitions were changed from version 1 to 2, version 2 to 4 and version 4 to 5, the proportion of infections being detected as cases were increased by 7.1-fold (95% credible interval (CI): 4.8, 10.9), 2.8-fold (95% CI: 1.9, 4.2) and 4.2-fold (95% CI: 2.6, 7.3) respectively. If the fifth version of the case definition had been applied throughout the outbreak, we estimated that by February 20 there would have been 232,000 (95% CI: 161,000, 359,000) confirmed cases. InterpretationThe case definition was initially narrow, but was gradually broadened to allow detection of more cases as knowledge increased, particularly milder cases and those without epidemiological links to Wuhan or other known cases. This should be taken into account when making inferences on epidemic growth rates and doubling times, and therefore on the reproductive number, to avoid bias.

Advances in cognitive psychology have led to the development of adaptive learning systems that make vocabulary learning more efficient. One way these computer-based systems optimize learning is by measuring learning performance in real time to create optimal repetition schedules for individual learners. While such adaptive learning systems have been successfully applied to word learning using keyboard-based input, they have thus far seen little application in word learning where spoken instead of typed input is used. Here we present a framework for speech-based word learning using an adaptive model that was developed for and tested with typing-based word learning. We show that typing- and speech-based learning result in similar behavioral patterns that can be used to reliably estimate individual memory processes. We extend earlier findings demonstrating that a response-time based adaptive learning approach outperforms an accuracy-based, Leitner flashcard approach in learning efficiency (demonstrated by higher average accuracy and lower response times after a learning session). In short, we show that adaptive learning benefits transfer from typing-based learning, to speech based learning.

METHODS A systematic review of all published data: a total of 5293 records were screened, 18 articles were assessed in full text and 12 studies met inclusion criteria. No controlled trials were identified. RESULTS Most studies (11 of 12, 92%) were retrospective chart reviews, and one was both a cross-sectional and cohort study.

Eleven biopsy-site melanomas developed across three of the studies, six among observed lesions (039%) and five among re-excised lesions (044%). CONCLUSIONS Based upon the available evidence the rates of biopsy-site primary melanoma were similarly low among observed lesions and re-excised lesions.

The patients with viral panel positivity had significantly lower lymphocyte count (1.05109/l versus 3.09109/l; P=0.013). During follow-up, 20 patients (80%) were diagnosed with pneumonia. Patients with concurrent bacterial or fungal infections were more likely to have pneumonia (100% versus 68%; P=0.023). 10 patients (40%) died due to pneumonia and related complications. Lower lymphocyte counts and higher C-reactive protein levels at the time of viral panel positivity were risk factors for mortality (1.5109/l versus 0.39109/l, P=0.007; 74.2 versus 199.7, P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS The viral panel was positive in 64% of patients with acute URI symptoms. Lower lymphocyte count was detected in CRV-positive patients. The onset of concomitant bacterial or fungal infections increased the risk of lower respiratory infection disease. Indeed, prospective studies should be designed for risks and outcomes of CRVs in allo-HSCT recipients.","output":"Upper respiratory viral infections in patients with haematological malignancies after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a retrospective study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic was first detected in late-December 2019. So far, it has caused 203,815,431 confirmed cases and 4,310,623 deaths in the world. We collected sequences from 150,659 COVID-19 patients. Based on the previous phylogenomic analysis, we found three major branches of the virus RNA genomic mutation located in Asia, America, and Europe which is consistent with other studies. We selected sites with high mutation frequencies from Asia, America, and Europe. There are only 13 common mutation sites in these three regions. It infers that the viral mutations are highly dependent on their location and different locations have specific mutations. Most mutations can lead to amino acid substitutions, which occurred in 3/5UTR, S/N/M protein, and ORF1ab/3a/8/10. Thus, the mutations may affect the pathogenesis of the virus. In addition, we applied an ARIMA model to predict the short-term frequency change of these top mutation sites during the spread of the disease. We tested a variety of settings of the ARIMA model to optimize the prediction effect of three patterns.

Although the mortality rate is clearly higher than for influenza, the rate does seem to vary from country to country, possibly reflecting differences in how rapidly local health authorities respond to isolate and effectively care for the affected population. Drugs are urgently needed for both prophylaxis and the treatment of severely ill patients; however, no proven effective therapies for SARS-CoV-2 currently exist. A number of drugs that have been approved for other diseases are being tested for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, but there is an absence of data from appropriately designed clinical trials showing that these drugs, either alone or in combination, will prove effective. There is also a global urgency to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, but development and appropriate testing will take at least a year before such a vaccine will be globally available.

Inflammation being a significant influencer in COVID-19 patients, it drives our focus onto the signaling cascades of the JAK/STAT pathway. JAK phosphorylation mediated by cytokine receptor activation leads to phosphorylation of STATs that translocate into the nucleus to translate for inflammatory mediators. The SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins like spike, nucleocapsid, membrane and envelope proteins along with the non- structural proteins 1-16 including proteases like 3CL (pro) and PL(pro) promote its entry and survival in hosts. The SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers inflammation via the JAK/STAT pathway leading to recruitment of pneumocytes, endothelial cells, macrophages, monocytes, lymphocytes, natural killer cells and dendritic cells progressing towards cytokine storm. This produces various inflammatory markers in the host that determine the disease severity. The JAK/STAT signaling also mediates immune responses via B cell and T cell differentiation.With an attempt to reduce excessive inflammation, JAK/STAT inhibitors like Ruxolitinib, Baricitinib, Tofacitinib have been employed that mediate its actions via suppressors of cytokine signaling, cytokine inducible SH2 containing protein, Protein inhibitor of activated STAT and protein tyrosine phosphatases. Even though they are implicated with multiple adverse effects, the regulatory authorities have supported its use, and numerous clinical trials are in progress to prove their safety and efficacy.

Yet, the lifecycles of many organisms intersect. Additional evolutionary and genetic causes of ageing, external to a focal species/organism, may thus be overlooked. Here, we introduce the phrase and concept of age-distorters and its evidence. Age-distorters carry ageing interfering genes, used to manipulate the biological age of other entities upon which the reproduction of age-distorters relies, e.g. age-distorters bias the reproduction/maintenance trade-offs of cells/organisms for their own evolutionary interests. Candidate age-distorters include viruses, parasites and symbionts, operating through specific, genetically encoded interferences resulting from co-evolution and arms race between manipulative non-kins and manipulable species. This interference results in organismal ageing when age-distorters prompt manipulated organisms to favor their reproduction at the expense of their maintenance, turning these hosts into expanded disposable soma. By relying on reproduction/maintenance trade-offs affecting disposable entities, which are left ageing to the reproductive benefit of other physically connected lineages with conflicting evolutionary interests, the concept of age-distorters expands the logic of the Disposable Soma theory beyond species with fixed germen/soma distinctions. Moreover, acknowledging age-distorters as external sources of mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropic genes expands the scope of the mutation accumulation and of the antagonistic pleiotropy theories.","output":"Interspecific interactions that affect ageing: age-distorters manipulate host ageing to their own evolutionary benefits."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Provide a timely, rigorous and continuously updated summary of the evidence on the role of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Methods Eligible studies were randomized trials evaluating the effect of remdesivir versus placebo or no treatment. We conducted searches in the special LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs regular searches in databases, trial registries, preprint servers and websites relevant to COVID-19. All the searches covered the period until 25 August 2020. No date or language restrictions were applied. Two reviewers independently evaluated potentially eligible studies according to predefined selection criteria, and extracted data on study characteristics, methods, outcomes, and risk of bias, using a predesigned, standardized form. We performed meta-analyses using random-effect models and assessed overall certainty in evidence using the GRADE approach. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Our search strategy yielded 574 references. Finally, we included three randomized trials evaluating remdesivir in addition to standard care versus standard care alone. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of remdesivir on mortality (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.05; very low certainty evidence) and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.24; very low certainty evidence). On the other hand, remdesivir likely results in a large increase in the incidence of adverse effects in patients with COVID-19 (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.84; moderate certainty evidence).

DESIGN Ongoing, prospective, observational cohort study. SETTING 16 centres that perform endovascular treatment in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS 1488 patients included in the Multicentre Randomised Controlled Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischaemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) Registry who had received endovascular treatment, including stent retriever thrombectomy, aspiration, and all alternative methods for acute ischaemic stroke within 6.5 hours from onset of symptoms between March 2014 and June 2016. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death) at 90 days after the onset of symptoms. Secondary outcomes were excellent functional outcome (mRS score 0-1), good functional outcome (mRS score 0-2), and favourable functional outcome (mRS score 0-3) at 90 days; score on the extended thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scale at the end of the intervention procedure; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 24-48 hours after intervention; and complications that occurred during intervention, hospital admission, or three months' follow up period. Outcomes and safety variables in the MR CLEAN Registry were compared with the MR CLEAN trial intervention and control arms. RESULTS A statistically significant shift was observed towards better functional outcome in patients in the MR CLEAN Registry compared with the MR CLEAN trial intervention arm (adjusted common odds ratio 1.30, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.67) and the MR CLEAN trial control arm (1.85, 1.46 to 2.34). The reperfusion rate, with successful reperfusion defined as a score of 2B-3 on the extended thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score, was 58.7%, the same as for patients in the MR CLEAN trial. Duration from onset of stroke to start of endovascular treatment and from onset of stroke to successful reperfusion or last contrast bolus was one hour shorter for patients in the MR CLEAN Registry. Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage occurred in 5.8% of patients in the MR CLEAN Registry compared with 7.7% in the MR CLEAN trial intervention arm and 6.4% in the MR CLEAN trial control arm.

DESIGN: Exploratory, qualitative design, using in-depth individual telephone interviews, and analyzed using thematic analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Ten family members of adult COVID-19 patients in the ICU. RESULT: Seven key themes represented family members experiences: (a) reactions to the COVID-19 diagnosis, (b) COVID-19 as a destabilizing force on the family unit, (c) COVID-19s effects on bereavement outcomes, (d) desperately seeking information, (e) family member needs, (f) conflicting feelings about video calls, and (g) appreciation of care. Family members feelings about the patients diagnosis and how the virus was contracted exacerbated their stress and anxiety. They struggled to feel informed about care that they could not witness and had difficulty understanding information. Family members reported that video calls were unhelpful. While these experiences made them question the quality of care, they expressed their appreciation of the frontline healthcare providers taking care of their loved ones. CONCLUSION: The stress and uncertainty of family members of critically ill patients with COVID-19 were influenced by their inability to feel connected to the patient and informed about care.

This genus includes emerging and economically significant viruses such as those associated with Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Disease, for which diagnostic tools are needed to prevent dispersion and new introductions. Five real-time PCRs with an internal tomato reporter gene were developed for accurate detection and quantification of monopartite begomoviruses, including two strains of the Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV; Mld and IL strains), the Tomato leaf curl Comoros virus-like viruses (ToLCKMV-like viruses) and the two molecules of the bipartite Potato yellow mosaic virus. These diagnostic tools have a unique standard quantification, comprising the targeted viral and internal report amplicons. These duplex real-time PCRs were applied to artificially inoculated plants to monitor and compare their viral development. RESULTS Real-time PCRs were optimized for accurate detection and quantification over a range of 2  10(9) to 2  10(3) copies of genomic viral DNA/L for TYLCV-Mld, TYLCV-IL and PYMV-B and 2  10(8) to 2  10(3) copies of genomic viral DNA/L for PYMV-A and ToLCKMV-like viruses. These real-time PCRs were applied to artificially inoculated plants and viral loads were compared at 10, 20 and 30 days post-inoculation. Different patterns of viral accumulation were observed between the bipartite and the monopartite begomoviruses. Interestingly, PYMV accumulated more viral DNA at each date for both genomic components compared to all the monopartite viruses. Also, PYMV reached its highest viral load at 10 dpi contrary to the other viruses (20 dpi). The accumulation kinetics of the two strains of emergent TYLCV differed from the ToLCKMV-like viruses in the higher quantities of viral DNA produced in the early phase of the infection and in the shorter time to reach this peak viral load. CONCLUSIONS To detect and quantify a wide range of begomoviruses, five duplex real-time PCRs were developed in association with a novel strategy for the quantification standard.

Most policies included objective triage criteria, specified inapplicable criteria, separated triage and clinical decision making, detailed reassessment plans, offered an appeals process, and addressed palliative care. All but 1 policy referenced a sequential organ failure assessment score as a triage criterion, and 10 policies categorically excluded patients. Six policies were almost identical, tracing their origins to influenza planning. This sample of policies reflects organizational strategies of exemplar-based policy development and the use of objective criteria in triage decisions, either before or instead of clinical judgment, to support ethical distribution of resources. Future guidance is warranted on how to adapt policies across disease type, choose objective criteria, and specify processes that rely on clinical judgments.","output":"US Ventilator Allocation and Patient Triage Policies in Anticipation of the COVID-19 Surge."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of plants as biofactories for the production of medical products and vaccines has a long history, but the recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused this set of technologies, for their potential to contribute to the development of innovative solutions for tackling pandemic spread worldwide, to rise in prominence. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the global innovation scenario of plant-based vaccine production. Methods: Patent search using a specific set of technical classification codes and keywords was performed using the Questel-Orbit database, with a final output of 180 patent families, corresponding to 1397 single patents. Results: Plant-based vaccines production is an innovation sector with positive development especially in the last five-year period (30% growth). Fifty percent of the patents were registered in the United States, standing out as the most attractive patent system worldwide. The inventive activity was led by private firms owning the 49% of the patent families, and the key-players group includes the companies that successfully developed plant-based COVID-19 vaccine candidates, indicating a strong connection between the expertise in innovation production and the capacity to adapt inventions to the current pandemic vaccine demand. Virus-like particles technology has increased in importance over the past few years. Conclusion: Patent data confirm their relevant role as indicators of innovation and technological evolution. Plant-based vaccines are expected to acquire an increasing role over the next few years as the current pandemic acts as an innovation catalyst.","output":"Global Innovation Trends for Plant-Based Vaccines Production: A Patent Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present online retrospective study aimed at evaluating the perceived sleep quality before the start of the lockdown measures and during the lockdown in a sample of Italian university students (N = 307) Participants were administered the Italian translation of the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 36-item version (PID-5-36) in order to assess the relationships between sleep, dysfunctional personality domains and internalizing symptomatology Latent difference factor (LDF) model was used to estimate latent change in PSQI scores;all analyses on the relationships between the PSQI and the dysfunctional personality domain measures and internalizing symptoms were carried out using latent factor scores Our findings showed that selected dysfunctional personality traits were significantly associated with changes in perceived quality of sleep among adult university students during the lockdown in Italy The relationship between PID-5-36 Negative Affectivity and changes in the perceived quality of sleep was only partially mediated by the severity of self-reported depression The assessment of perceived depressive symptom severity and Negative Affectivity may prove clinically useful for carrying out preventive interventions on sleep quality","output":"Latent Changes in Perceived Quality of Sleep Related to the COVID-19 Quarantine Measures in Italian University Students: Understanding the Role of Personality and Internalizing Symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, the interaction of seven potential inhibitors in complex with SARS-CoV-2s M protease (M pro) is modelled and optimized using ONIOM (Own N-layered Integrated molecular Orbital and molecular Mechanics; QM/MM) approach.

The lockdown measures for CoViD-19 allowed to simulate on a large scale the massive and prolonged reduction of road traffic (the main source for NO(2) in urban environment). This work aims to selectively assess the maximum impact that total traffic blocking measures can have on NO(2). For this reason, three megacities (London, Milan and Paris) were chosen that had similar characteristics in terms of climatic conditions, population, policies of urban traffic management and lockdown measures. 52 air quality control units have been used to compare data measured in lockdown and in the same periods of previous years, highlighting a significant decrease in NO(2) concentration due to traffic (London: 71.1 % - 80.8 %; Milan: 8.6 % - 42.4%; Paris: 65.7 % - 79.8 %). In 2020 the contribution of traffic in London, Milan and Paris was dropped to 3.3  1.3 g m(-3), 6.1  0.8 g m(-3), and 13.4  1.5 g m(-3), respectively. Despite the significant reduction in the NO(2) concentration, in UT stations average NO(2) concentrations higher than 40 g m(-3) were registered for several days. In order to reduce the pollution, the limitation of road traffic could be not enough, but a vision also aimed at rethink the vehicles and their polluting effects should be developed.","output":"Analysis of lockdown for CoViD-19 impact on NO(2) in London, Milan and Paris: What lesson can be learnt?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 epidemic has swept the world for over a year. However, a large number of infectious asymptomatic COVID-19 cases (\\\\textit{ACC}s) are still making the breaking up of the transmission chains very difficult. Efforts by epidemiological researchers in many countries have thrown light on the clinical features of ACCs, but there is still a lack of practical approaches to detect ACCs so as to help contain the pandemic. To address the issue of ACCs, this paper presents a neural network model called Spatio-Temporal Episodic Memory for COVID-19 (\\\\textit{STEM-COVID}) to identify ACCs from contact tracing data. Based on the fusion Adaptive Resonance Theory (\\\\textit{ART}), the model encodes a collective spatio-temporal episodic memory of individuals and incorporates an effective mechanism of parallel searches for ACCs. Specifically, the episodic traces of the identified positive cases are used to map out the episodic traces of suspected ACCs using a weighted evidence pooling method. To evaluate the efficacy of STEM-COVID, a realistic agent based simulation model for COVID-19 spreading is implemented based on the recent epidemiological findings on ACCs. The experiments based on rigorous simulation scenarios, manifesting the current situation of COVID-19 spread, show that the STEM-COVID model with weighted evidence pooling has a higher level of accuracy and efficiency for identifying ACCs when compared with several baselines. Moreover, the model displays strong robustness against noisy data and different ACC proportions, which partially reflects the effect of breakthrough infections after vaccination on the virus transmission.","output":"Who Are the \`Silent Spreaders'?: Contact Tracing in Spatio-Temporal Memory Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first identified in Wuhan, China, has been rapidly spreading around the world.

METHODS: We collected data from medical records of confirmed COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang Province from Jan. 17 to Feb. 7, 2020 and analyzed epidemiological, clinical, and treatment data of those with and without recorded recent exposure in Wuhan. RESULTS: Patients in the control group were older than those in the exposure group ((48.1916.13) years vs. (43.4713.12) years, P<0.001), and more were over 65 years old (15.95% control vs. 5.60% exposure, P<0.001). The rate of clustered onset was also significantly higher in the control group than in the exposure group (31.39% vs. 18.66%, P<0.001). The symptom of a sore throat in patients in the exposure group was significantly higher than that in the control group (17.30% vs. 10.89%, P=0.01); however, headache in the exposure group was significantly lower than that in the control group (6.87% vs. 12.15%, P=0.015). More patients in the exposure group had a significantly lower level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than those in the control group.

Technological solutions are a complement that can help citizens to be informed about the risk in their environment. Although measures such as contact traceability have been successful in some countries, their use raises society's resistance. This paper proposes a variation of the consensus processes in directed networks to create a risk map of a determined area. The process shares information with trusted contacts: people we would notify in the case of being infected. When the process converges, each participant would have obtained the risk map for the selected zone. The results are compared with the pilot project's impact testing of the Spanish contact tracing app (RadarCOVID). The paper also depicts the results combining both strategies: contact tracing to detect potential infections and risk maps to avoid movements into conflictive areas. Although some works affirm that contact tracing apps need 60% of users to control the propagation, our results indicate that a 40% could be enough. On the other hand, the elaboration of risk maps could work with only 20% of active installations, but the effect is to delay the propagation instead of reducing the contagion. With both active strategies, this methodology is able to significantly reduce infected people with fewer participants.

Valid instruments to assess patients' knowledge of CKD and kidney transplantation are needed. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS Using a sample of 977 patients with stages 3-5 CKD in the Kaiser Permanente health system, we developed the Knowledge Assessment of Renal Transplantation (KART) 2.0 instrument. We conducted cognitive interviews followed by item response theory (IRT) to reduce 48 candidate items. Construct validity was tested by examining differences in scores between patients who spent <1 and 1 hour receiving CKD and transplant education. RESULTS Cognitive interviews modified four items and omitted 11. IRT analyses resulted in two scales: the KART 2.0-Transplant Knowledge Scale (16 items; Cronbach's =0.8) and the KART 2.0-CKD Knowledge Scale (nine items; Cronbach's =0.79). Differential item functioning showed that the scales were unbiased to capture knowledge across self-identified race, primary language, CKD stage, and sex. Both scales distinguished patients who had spent <1 and 1 hour speaking with health professionals (effect size [ES]=0.33 [transplant], 0.54 [CKD]; P<0.001 for both), reading about kidney disease (ES=0.45 [transplant], 0.62 [CKD]; P<0.001), reading about kidney transplantation (ES=0.67 [transplant], 0.69 [CKD]; P<0.001), and reading about living donor kidney transplant (ES=0.76 [transplant], 0.62 [CKD]; P<0.001).

RESULTS We found differences in reading fluency between narrative and expository texts, the expository text being read with a more marked prosody (pauses and melodic contour) suggesting that readers rely on this for their understanding. In addition, we also found a relationship between reading fluency and reading comprehension, with a greater relationship of prosodic variables with the expository text than with the narrative one.

PURPOSE Quality indicators are crucial for assessing the performance of any health care system. To allow efficiency, effectiveness, and patient-centeredness, there is a need for prompt acquisition of up-to-date information. Among the available quality indicators, process indicators have the highest sensitivity to frequent changes and could better reflect the implementation outcomes of novel ideas and technology. This study aimed to map the available information regarding process quality indicators in glaucoma care, identify the current development stage of these indicators, and systematically synthesize them. METHODS We performed a scoping review of four electronic bibliographic databases for studies reporting on process quality indicators in glaucoma. We retrieved 7502 references and created a domain list reflecting the core idea underlying each indicator. RESULTS We summarized information from 18 documents and listed 20 domains. The most mentioned domains were follow-up, optic nerve head assessment, visual field test, and intra-ocular pressure. Indicators regarding quality of life assessment, patient assistance, or presence of written protocols were less frequently mentioned.

Group differences in COVID-19 impact on families were also examined based on race and ethnicity, being medically and/or geographically underserved, and insurance status. METHODS: Participants (na?=a?131) included children with epilepsy and their families from two clinical trials. The Impact of COVID-19 on Pediatric Epilepsy Management (ICPEM) measure was developed and administered to caregivers online from April 2020 to September 2020 across four large pediatric hospitals. Administration of the ICPEM occurred both during routine study assessments and an additional acute time point to obtain information early in the pandemic (e.g., April and May 2020). Descriptive statistics and t-tests were used for analyses. RESULTS: Data indicate minor to moderate impact of COVID-19 on pediatric epilepsy management. Caregivers of children with epilepsy reported the most impact on education and social functioning. Adherence to CDC guidelines was reported to be high. Those having public insurance reported greater difficulties obtaining daily anti-seizure medications compared to those with private insurance.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic alcohol consumption on lung injury and clarify the signaling pathways involved in the inhibition of alveolar fluid clearance (AFC). In order to produce rodent models with chronic alcohol consumption, wild-type C57BL/6 mice were treated with alcohol. A2a adenosine receptor (AR) small interfering (si)RNA or A2bAR siRNA were transfected into the lung tissue of mice and primary rat alveolar type II (ATII) cells. The rate of AFC in lung tissue was measured during exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) expression was determined to investigate the mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced regulation of AFC. In the present study, exposure to alcohol reduced AFC, exacerbated pulmonary edema and worsened LPS-induced lung injury. Alcohol caused a decrease in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and inhibited -ENaC, -ENaC and -ENaC expression levels in the lung tissue of mice and ATII cells. Furthermore, alcohol decreased -ENaC, -ENaC and -ENaC expression levels via the A2aAR or A2bAR-cAMP signaling pathways in vitro. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that chronic alcohol consumption worsened lung injury by aggravating pulmonary edema and impairing AFC. An alcohol-induced decrease of -ENaC, -ENaC and -ENaC expression levels by the A2AR-mediated cAMP pathway may be responsible for the exacerbated effects of chronic alcohol consumption in lung injury.","output":"Alcohol inhibits alveolar fluid clearance through the epithelial sodium channel via the A2 adenosine receptor in acute lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been much discussion on the general principle of \\"naturally-acquired immunity arising from recovery from SARS CoV 2infection, and this recovery state contributing to the prevalence of immunity to reinfection, often referred to as Herd Immunity.

Methods Between January 2015 and September 2018, 42 patients underwent elective aortic aneurysm repair requiring an open distal anastomosis and at least a hemiarch replacement via hypothermic circulatory arrest by 2 surgeons. All distal reconstructions were performed at moderate hypothermia (22C-26C) with direct cannulation of the innominate artery (IA) using a pediatric arterial cannula to allow ACP at 10-15 mL/kg/min. Data were collected by retrospective chart review. Results Thirty-one of the 42 patients (74%) were male. The mean patient age was 65  13 years, and the mean body surface area was 2.1  0.3 m2. Proximal repairs included a modified Bentall with a valve-graft composite (n = 17), valve-sparing root replacement (n = 2), and aortic valve replacement (n = 15).

Design, Setting, and Participants: A population-based analysis of home BP data from 72,706 participants enrolled in a digital health hypertension control program. Data was compared before (January 2019 to March 2020) and during (April 2020 to August 2020) COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Monthly mean home BP readings, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were quantified before and during the pandemic. Multivariable adjustments were made for age, sex, race, region, and months enrolled. Home BP readings were also classified based on monthly averages and highest home BP readings into risk groups: Stage 2 HTN: BP>=135 or DBP>=85; Uncontrolled HTN: SBP>=145 or DBP>= 95; or Severely uncontrolled HTN: SBP>=160 or DBP>=100). Results: Overall, 72,706 participants were enrolled in a digital health hypertension program between 1/1/2019 and 8/31/2020. Compared with participants pre-COVID-19 (n= 33,440), those during COVID-19 (n=39,266) were of similar age (mean 53.0  10.7 years vs 53.310.8 years); sex (46% vs 50.6% female) and race (29.1% vs 34.2% non-white). Relative to pre-Covid (Apr-Aug 2019) the mean monthly number of home BP readings rose during COVID-19 (Apr-Aug, 2020), from 7.3 to 9.3 per month (p < 0.001). During COVID-19, participants had higher monthly adjusted mean SBP (131.6 mmHg vs. 127.5 mmHg, p <0.001); DBP (80.2 mmHg vs. 79.2 mmHg, p <0.001); and MAP (97.4 mmHg vs. 95.3 mmHg; p < 0.001). Relative to the pre-pandemic period, during COVID-19 the proportion of participants with a mean monthly BP classified as uncontrolled or severely uncontrolled hypertension also rose, 15% vs 19% and 4% vs 5%, respectively.

To gain SMR control, stroke survivors are usually instructed to engage in motor imagery (MI) or to attempt moving the paralyzed fingers resulting in task- or event-related desynchronization (ERD) of SMR (SMR-ERD). However, as these tasks are cognitively demanding, especially for stroke survivors suffering from cognitive impairments, BCI control performance can deteriorate considerably over time. Therefore, it would be important to identify biomarkers that predict decline in BCI control performance within an ongoing session in order to optimize the man-machine interaction scheme. APPROACH Here we determine the link between BCI control performance over time and heart rate variability (HRV). Specifically, we investigated whether HRV can be used as a biomarker to predict decline of SMR-ERD control across 17 healthy participants using Granger causality. SMR-ERD was visually displayed on a screen. Participants were instructed to engage in MI-based SMR-ERD control over two consecutive runs of 8.5 minutes each. During the second run, task difficulty was gradually increased. MAIN RESULTS While control performance (p = .18) and HRV (p = .16) remained unchanged across participants during the first run, during the second run, both measures declined over time at high correlation (performance: -0.61%/10s, p = 0; HRV: -0.007ms/10s, p < .001). We found that HRV exhibited predictive characteristics with regard to within-session BCI control performance on an individual participant level (p < .001).

METHODS: Secondary analysis of 947 HNSCC patients enrolled on XXX (N=410), XXX (N=203), and XXX (N=334) undergoing surgery and post-operative radiation +/- systemic therapy. Multivariable models were constructed for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local-regional relapse (LRR), and distant metastases (DM). Restricted cubic splines were used to model the nonlinear relationship between +LN and outcomes. RESULTS: In multivariable analysis, OS and DFS decreased with each +LN without plateau, most pronounced up to 5 (OS: hazard ratio [HR], 1.19 per +LN; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.29; P<0.001; DFS: HR per +LN 1.17, 95% CI 1.08-1.26; P<0.001), and more gradually beyond this (OS: HR per +LN, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05; P<0.001; DFS: HR per +LN, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.05; P<0.001). In contrast to LRR risk, which increased sharply up to 5 +LNs (HR per +LN, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.11-1.39, P<0.001) but plateaued beyond this (HR per +LN, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.967-1.04; P=0.91), DM risk increased continuously with increasing +LN (5 +LN: HR per +LN, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.28; P=0.04; >5 +LN, HR per +LN, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.07; P=0.002).

This study investigated whether CL and subcutaneous F of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in humans can be separately estimated from subcutaneous injection data only. METHODS: First, the geometric mean of linear pharmacokinetic parameters (CL, intercompartmental CL [Q], volume of distribution in the central compartment [Vc], and volume of distribution in the peripheral compartment [Vp]) after intravenous injection for mAbs in humans that have been reported in public data sources was estimated from 103 mAbs with linear pharmacokinetics and 44 mAbs with nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Next, we estimated the CL and F of 25 mAbs with linear pharmacokinetics from plasma/serum mAb concentration-time profiles after subcutaneous injection in humans by fixing the geometric mean of Q, Vc, and Vp based on the public data. Moreover, the plasma/serum concentration-time profile of 25 mAbs after intravenous injection was simulated using the estimated CL and the geometric mean of Q, Vc, and Vp. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in parameters among subclasses (immunoglobulin [Ig] G1, 2, and 4) or in linearity (derivation from linear and nonlinear pharmacokinetics). Using only subcutaneous injection data, we successfully estimated the CL of 23/25 mAbs (92%) and F of all 25 mAbs (100%) within 1.5-fold of the observed value. Moreover, overall, the simulated concentration-time profiles were largely consistent with observed data (90.8% within 1.5-fold of the observed values).

Significant efforts have been made to develop useful methods for leachate disposition and treatment. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are one of the most promising methods, because they can rapidly degrade diverse pollutants and significantly improve the biodegradability of leachate. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a fascinating conjugated polymer, has become a hot topic in AOP research due to its metal-free benefits and high photosensitivity. Thus, combining AOPs with g-C3N4 achieves excellent degradation of refractory pollutants in leachate. Since the composition of leachate is complex in the practical conditions, the information reported by current studies of using g-C3N4 as a remediator is still incomplete and fragmented. Thus, in this review, the recent status of leachate treatment and approaches for its disposal has been summarized and some conclusions have been drawn. In addition, a brief introduction to g-C3N4 and its application in AOPs for leachate treatment have been critically discussed and with its future outlook assessed. Although the development of g-C3N4 in AOPs for leachate treatment is highly efficient and practical, comprehensive study about its application and technology expansion is urgently needed, based on the complex operating conditions. Perspectives on the treatment of leachate using g-C3N4-AOPs are also included. The information and perspectives provided in this review will provide guidance and novel understanding to accelerate the development of g-C3N4-based AOPs for leachate treatment.","output":"Graphitic nitride-catalyzed advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for landfill leachate treatment: A mini review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within the theoretical framework of psychological reactance and impression management, this study conducted in Sydney, Australia, in 2020C2021, explores the acceptance by men of alternatives to animal-based foods. Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 36 men who have visited a vegan restaurant and have eaten a plant-based burger. The findings from the study show that, despite the increasing popularity of these novel food options, men are unlikely to include the plant-based alternatives as a permanent feature of their diets as explained by the theory of psychological reactance. However, the studys male participants acknowledged the importance of women for their visit to the vegan restaurant which can be explained by impression management theory. Using excerpts from the interviews, mens experience is highlighted, particularly as it relates to concerns linked to masculinity, dietary identity and social perception by others. The analysis reveals the complexity of transitioning to more sustainable food choices within a gender-constructed social environment. Whether the new plant-based alternatives to meat are going to be a short-lived trend or a more lasting option in the mens diets is also discussed. Practical implications for social marketing as a tool to influence collective behaviour are drawn.

However, few models developed from single cohorts can perform consistently well at population level where diverse prognoses exist (such as the SARS-CoV2 pandemic). This study aims at tackling this challenge by synergising prediction models from the literature using ensemble learning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study we selected and reimplemented seven prediction models for COVID-19, which were derived from diverse cohorts and used different implementation techniques. A novel ensemble learning framework was proposed to synergise them for realising personalised predictions for individual patients. Four diverse international cohorts (2 from the UK and 2 from China; total N=5,394) were used to validate all eight models on discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness. RESULTS: Results showed that individual prediction models could perform well on some cohorts while poorly on others. Conversely, the ensemble model achieved the best performances consistently on all metrics quantifying discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness. Performance disparities were observed in cohorts from the two countries: all models achieved better performances on the China cohorts. DISCUSSION: When individual models were learned from complementary cohorts, the synergised model will have the potential to achieve synergised performances. Results indicate that blood parameters and physiological measurements might have better predictive powers when collected early, which remains to be confirmed by further studies. CONCLUSIONS: Combining a diverse set of individual prediction models, ensemble method can synergise a robust and well-performing model by choosing the most competent ones for individual patients.","output":"Ensemble learning for poor prognosis predictions: a case study on SARS-CoV2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the late-2000s, Canada has admitted an increasing number of foreign workers with various temporary work permits to meet local labour shortages and growing labour market demands. The rise of temporary migrants has accompanied with a policy shift, from one-step to two-step immigration, to facilitate the retention of former temporary foreign workers and international graduates who had obtained Canadian work experience and credentials. Imposing specific regulations, the policies have created a relatively privileged class of high-skilled workers who have more labour rights and transition pathways than their low-skilled counterparts. Using the analytical framework of regulated and flexible temporariness, this paper examines how unequal regulations are applied to govern the labour market participation and transition of these two groups of migrant workers. Based on secondary sources, the analysis assesses how different notions of temporariness are produced within the Canadian temporary migration programme and the two-step immigration model.

There is an urgent need for clinically valuable, generalizable, and parsimonious triage tools assisting the appropriate allocation of hospital resources during the pandemic. We aimed to develop and extensively validate a machine learning-based tool for accurately predicting the clinical outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: CODOP was built using modified stable iterative variable selection and linear regression with lasso regularisation. To avoid generalization problems, CODOP was trained and tested with three time-sliced and geographically distinct cohorts encompassing 40 511 blood-based analyses of COVID-19 patients from more than 110 hospitals in Spain and the USA during 2020-21. We assessed the discriminative ability of the model using the Area Under the Receiving Operative Curve (AUROC) as well as horizon and Kaplan-Meier risk stratification analyses. To reckon the fluctuating pressure levels in hospitals through the pandemic, we offer two online CODOP calculators suited for undertriage or overtriage scenarios. We challenged their generalizability and clinical utility throughout an evaluation with datasets gathered in five hospitals from three Latin American countries. Findings: CODOP uses 12 clinical parameters commonly measured at hospital admission and associated with the pathophysiology of COVID-19. CODOP reaches high discriminative ability up to nine days before clinical resolution (AUROC: 0.90-0.96, 95% CI 0.879-0.970), it is well calibrated, and it enables an effective dynamic risk stratification during hospitalization. The two CODOP online calculators predicted the clinical outcome of the majority of patients (73-100% sensitivity and 84-100% specificity) from the distinctive Latin American evaluation cohort. Interpretation: The high predictive performance of CODOP in geographically disperse patient cohorts and the easiness-of-use, strongly suggest its clinical utility as a global triage tool, particularly in resource-limited countries.","output":"Development and evaluation of a machine learning-based in-hospital COvid-19 Disease Outcome Predictor (CODOP): a multicontinental retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Last December 2019, a new virus, named novel Coronavirus (COVID\\\\2019) causing many cases of severe pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China.

INTRODUCTION: The global crisis of COVID-19 has highlighted how the health care system needs to adapt. With the announcement of a partial lockdown, cardiac rehabilitation centers in Israel were closed and patients were left without regular training and risk factor management. However, the Remote Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs (RCRP), which had been previously developed, continued to function. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of RCRP during the pandemic. METHODS: We compared retrospective cohort data on the performance of RCRP patients and care teams over two time periods: (P1) nine weeks before lockdown; and (P2) seven weeks during the lockdown. Included in the analysis were parameters of exercise adherence, objective training efficacy, and satisfaction. RESULTS: The analysis included 38 patients, 92% male, age 58  11 enrolled in the RCRP predominantly following myocardial infarction or coronary interventions (57%). Patient activity during the lockdown period increased with higher average exercise minutes per week as well as higher exercise minutes performed at the designated target heart rate (all P for trend < 0.05). In a mid-study survey, over 86% of patients responded that they felt safe and satisfied with the RCRP. CONCLUSIONS: The RCRP has proven to be reliable and effective in maintaining the mental and physical health of patients in the face of a national crisis, even with a substantial reduction in staff.

As patients with acute pain may include those who have limited prior exposure to opioids, this phase 1, open-label, randomized, multiple ascending-dose study was conducted to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of multiple doses of fentanyl sublingual spray in opioid-na?ve participants. This article primarily reports the pharmacokinetics results. METHODS Study drugs were administered in four dosing cohorts: every 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 h for a maximum of three doses per cohort. Eight fasted individuals per cohort were randomized to either fentanyl sublingual spray (100, 200, or 400 g) or fentanyl citrate IV 50 g (6:2 ratio). Blood samples were collected pre-dose through 24 h post first dose. RESULTS A total of 98 healthy adults were enrolled and 96 completed the study. Mean plasma fentanyl concentrations increased with increasing doses of fentanyl sublingual spray administered every 0.5-4 h. With multiple doses, systemic exposure increased relative to the first dose; shorter dosing intervals resulted in higher concentrations. Analysis of dose proportionality suggested that systemic exposure increased in a linear but slightly greater than dose-proportional manner. Accumulation between the first and last doses of fentanyl sublingual spray was more pronounced with shorter dosing intervals.

One of the CBIR applications is Content Based Medical Image Retrieval (CBMIR). The image retrieval system retrieves the most similar images from the historical cases, and such systems can only support the physician's decision to diagnose a disease. To extract the useful features from the query image for linking similar types of images is the major challenge in the CBIR domain. The Convolution Neural Network (CNN) can overcome the drawbacks of traditional algorithms, dependent on the low-level feature extraction technique. Objective: The objective of the study is to develop a CNN model with a minimum number of convolution layers and to get the maximum possible accuracy for the CBMIR system. The minimum number of convolution layers reduces the number of mathematical operations and the time for the model's training. It also reduces the number of training parameters, like weights and bias. Thus, it reduces the memory requirement for the model storage. This work mainly focused on developing an optimized CNN model for the CBMIR system. Such systems can only support the physicians' decision to diagnose a disease from the images and retrieve the relevant cases to help the doctor decide the precise treatment. Methods: The deep learning-based model is proposed in this paper. The experiment is done with several convolution layers and various optimizers to get the maximum accuracy with a minimum number of convolution layers. Thus, the ten-layer CNN model is developed from scratch and used to derive the training and testing images' features and classify the test image. Once the image class is identified, the most relevant images are determined based on the Euclidean distance between the query features and database features of the identified class. Based on this distance, the most relevant images are displayed from the respective class of images. The general dataset CIFAR10, which has 60,000 images of 10 different classes, and the medical dataset IRMA, which has 2508 images of 9 various classes, have been used to analyze the proposed method. The proposed model is also applied for the medical x-ray image dataset of chest disease and compared with the other pre-trained models. Results: The accuracy and the average precision rate are the measurement parameters utilized to compare the proposed model with different machine learning techniques. The accuracy of the proposed model for the CIFAR10 dataset is 93.9%, which is better than the state-of-the-art methods. After the success for the general dataset, the model is also tested for the medical dataset. For the x-ray images of the IRMA dataset, it is 86.53%, which is better than the different pre-trained model results. The model is also tested for the other x-ray dataset, which is utilized to identify chest-related disease. The average precision rate for such a dataset is 97.25%. Also, the proposed model fulfills the major challenge of the semantic gap. The semantic gap of the proposed model for the chest disease dataset is 2.75%, and for the IRMA dataset, it is 13.47%. Also, only ten convolution layers are utilized in the proposed model, which is very small in number compared to the other pre-trained models. Conclusion: The proposed technique shows remarkable improvement in performance metrics over CNN-based state-of-the-art methods. It also offers a significant improvement in performance metrics over different pre-trained models for the two different medical x-ray image datasets.","output":"Content Based Medical Image Retrieval for Accurate Disease Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global pandemic.

Since there have been uncertainties to develop a new drug against COVID-19, there is an urgent need for repurposing drugs that can target key proteins of both SARS-CoV-2 and GC. The SARS-CoV-2-RdRp protein contains the NiRAN domain, which is known to have kinase-like folds. A docking study of the FDA approved drugs against GC was performed using AutoDock 4.2 and Glide Schrodinger suite 2019 against SARS-CoV-2-RdRp protein. MMGBSA and MD simulation studies were performed to investigate the binding and stability of the inhibitors with the target protein. In this study, we have found 12 kinase inhibitors with high binding energies namely Baricitinib, Brepocitinib, Decernotinib, Fasudil, Filgotinib, GSK2606414, Peficitinib, Ruxolitinib, Tofacitinib, Upadacitinib, Pamapimod and Ibrutinib.

METHOD Twelve TCM prescriptions of herbal drugs (orally or i.v.) were used to treat 16 cases of SARS without using glucocorticoids, anti-viral agents, immune-regulators or antibiotics (in case there was no definite bacterial infections). The symptoms, signs, chest roentgenograms and lab examinations were carefully monitored and recorded for evaluation of the effectiveness. RESULTS The average fever abatement time was 4.44 +/- 1.46 days and the mean absorption time of gross pulmonary infiltration was 10.87 +/- 2.92 days. No exacerbation occurred during the treatment.

Autophagosomes can assemble in specialized cup-shaped regions of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) known as omegasomes, which are characterized by the presence of the ER protein DFCP1/ZFYVE1. The function of DFCP1 is unknown, as are the mechanisms of omegasome formation and constriction. Here, we demonstrate that DFCP1 is an ATPase that dimerizes in an ATP-dependent fashion. Whereas depletion of DFCP1 had a minor effect on bulk autophagic flux, DFCP1 was required to maintain the autophagic flux of p62 under both fed and starved conditions, and this was dependent on its ability to bind and hydrolyse ATP. While DFCP1 mutants defective in ATP binding or hydrolysis localized to forming omegasomes, these omegasomes failed to constrict. Consequently, the release of nascent autophagosomes from omegasomes was markedly delayed. DFCP1 was found to associate with ubiquitinated proteins, and degradation of ubiquitinated cargoes such as protein aggregates, mitochondria and micronuclei was strongly inhibited when DFCP1 was knocked out or mutated. Thus, DFCP1 mediates ATPase-driven constriction of omegasomes to release autophagosomes for selective autophagy.","output":"ATPase activity of DFCP1 controls selective autophagy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 outbreak has become a worldwide public health emergency The renal histopathological features of acute tubular necrosis or thrombotic microangiopathy have been previously reported in adults with severe COVID-19 infections In children, the renal manifestations associated with COVID-19 disease are not widely reported Here we describe a case report of a child with new-onset nephrotic syndrome associated with COVID-19 infection Case Presentation: An 8-year-old boy with no previous significant medical history presented with bilateral eyelid and facial swelling soon after his parents were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection He had diarrhea but no fever or shortness of breath At 1 week after the onset of swelling, the boy tested positive for the COVID-19 virus Based on clinical findings of significant proteinuria (urine protein and creatinine ratio of 11 4), hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin of 2 g/dl), and hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol of 384 mg/dl), he was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome He responded well to standard-dose prednisone treatment for nephrotic syndrome At 1 week after starting the prednisone treatment, he went into clinical remission Lymphopenia continued to be present for 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms There were no complications related to clot formation or secondary infections with this presentation Conclusion: COVID-19 can be associated with new-onset nephrotic syndrome in children The patient responded well to the standard-dose prednisone treatment that is typically used for new-onset nephrotic syndrome Summary: We describe the unique presentation of COVID-19 in a child as new-onset nephrotic syndrome We offer insight on the success of standard treatment of nephrotic syndrome with COVID-19","output":"New-Onset Nephrotic Syndrome in a Child Associated With COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing restrictions where implemented in France, which could have led to social isolation. This is expected to have affected the mental health situation, including increasing risk of symptoms of anxiety and depression in the general population. Persons with prior mental health difficulties could be an especially vulnerable group, however, few studies have tested this empirically considering preexisting mental health difficulties. We examine the association between preexisting symptoms of anxiety/depression and anxiety/depression during lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in a longitudinal community sample. METHODS: A longitudinal follow-up during lockdown (data collection MarchCJune 2020) was implemented among participants of the TEMPO cohort. Prior knowledge of anxiety/depression was included from prior waves of data collection. Generalized estimation equations models were used to estimate the association between preexisting symptoms of anxiety/depression and symptoms of anxiety/depression during lockdown among 662 mid-aged individuals. RESULTS: Individuals with symptoms of anxiety/depression measured prior to lockdown had 6.73 higher odds [95% CI = 4.45C10.17] of symptoms of anxiety/depression during lockdown. Additionally, the likelihood of symptoms of anxiety/depression during lockdown was elevated among women (OR = 2.07 [95% CI = 1.32C3.25]), subjects with low household income (OR = 2.28 [1.29C4.01]) and persons who reported being lonely (OR = 3.94 [95% CI = 2.47C6.28]). CONCLUSIONS: Our study underlines the role of preexisting symptoms of anxiety/depression as a vulnerability factor of anxiety/depression during lockdown. Interventions focusing on individuals with mental health difficulties as well as people feeling lonely should be considered, to reduce the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As E is essential for the production of infectious progeny but dispensable for assembly and release of virus-like particles, it probably mediates virus entry into cells, putatively in concert with the GP2b/GP3/GP4 complex. The E protein contains a central hydrophobic domain and a conserved potential site for N-terminal myristoylation, a hydrophobic modification usually pivotal for membrane targeting of the modified protein. Here, it was shown by radiolabelling that E is myristoylated at glycine-2, both in transfected cells as a fusion protein with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and in virus particles. Biochemical fractionation revealed that E-YFP with an inactivated acylation site was still completely membrane-bound, indicating that the putative transmembrane domain of E mediates membrane targeting. Confocal microscopy showed that both myristoylated and non-myristoylated E-YFP were localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, the membranes from which EAV buds. The presence of a myristoylation inhibitor during replication of EAV, whilst completely blocking E acylation, reduced virus titres by 1.5 log(10). Similarly, a mutant EAV with non-myristoylatable E grew to a titre five- to sevenfold lower than that of the wild-type virus and exhibited a reduced plaque size. Western blotting of cell-culture supernatants showed that N and M, the major structural proteins of EAV, are released in similar amounts by cells transfected with wild-type and mutant genomes. Thus, E myristoylation is not required for budding of particles and probably has a function during virus entry.","output":"Myristoylation of the arterivirus E protein: the fatty acid modification is not essential for membrane association but contributes significantly to virus infectivity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Paris Agreement prioritised international bottom-up climate negotiations.

To assess its long-term prospects against Paris-consistent pathways, we couple the energy-economy model REMIND to an empirical coalition accession model and demonstrate a novel scenario analysis technique, Dynamic Policy Evaluation (DPE). Capturing co-evolutionary feedbacks between policy uptake and global energy markets, we simulate nationally-and-temporally-fragmented PPCA accession and analyse its sensitivity to coalition growth, sectoral ambition, and Covid-19-related uncertainty. Surprisingly, we find that virtually-global PPCA participation achieves <3% of 1.5oC-consistent coal declines, as non-electric consumption remains unregulated. In contrast, our median-estimate scenario (82% accession) assuming economy-wide coverage achieves ~53% efficacy (virtually-global: ~85%), suggesting that the PPCA should prioritise policy ambition over coalition expansion.","output":"Dynamic Evaluation of Policy Feasibility, Feedbacks and the Ambitions of COALitions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Virtual Reality (VR) gaming is considered a safe and effective alternative to standard pain alleviation in the hospital, we advocate for its use during repeated redressing at home. Objective: This study will address the effectiveness and feasibility of the Virtual Reality Pain Alleviation Tool (VR-PAT) that was developed by the research team for repeated at-home burn dressing changes. Design, Setting and Participants: Randomized clinical trial among patients recruited at the Nationwide Childrens Hospital (NCH) outpatient burn clinic between September 2019 and June 2021. We included English-speaking burn patients 5-17 years old requiring daily dressing changes for at least one week after first outpatient dressing change. Interventions: One group played an interactive VR-PAT game during dressing changes, while the other utilized standard distraction techniques available in the home for a week. Both child and caretaker were later asked to assess perceived pain. Those in the intervention group were asked to evaluate convenience and enjoyment of the VR-PAT game. Outcomes: Patients were asked to rate perceived pain on a scale of 1-10, and caregivers were asked to rate observed pain on a scale of 1-10. For the VR-PAT group, patients were also asked to rate various aspects of the VR game on a scale of 1-10 and caregivers were asked questions assessing ease of use. Conclusions: Subjects found the VR-PAT to be a useful distraction during home dressing changes and reported it be easy to implement. In the VR-PAT group, child and caregiver reported pain decreased as the week of dressing changes progressed and was lower than those in the control group after the fourth dressing change. Children playing the VR-PAT reported consistent happiness and fun as the week went on and increased realism and engagement, which means our results were not just due to the novel experience of VR-PAT.","output":"Mobile Phone Virtual Reality Game for Pediatric Home Burn Dressing Pain Management, a Randomized Clinical Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is the second of a two-part profile on mental healthcare in Bangladesh.

As of 27 May 2021, there were over 169 million cases and over 3.5 million deaths notified since the start of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic takes variable shapes and forms in different regions and countries of the world. The objective of this study is to analyse the COVID-19 pandemic so that lessons can be learned towards an effective public health emergency response. Methods: : We conducted a mixed-methods study to understand the heterogeneity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Correlation analysis and scatter plot were employed for the quantitative data. We used Spearmans correlation analysis. Thematic analysis was conducted on the qualitative data to explain the findings from the quantitative data. Results: : We have found that regions and countries with high human development index are most affected by COVID-19 due to international connectedness and mobility of their population related to trade and tourism, and their vulnerability related to older populations and higher rates of non-communicable diseases. The pattern of the pandemic is also variable among high- and middle-income countries due to differences in the governance of the pandemic, fragmentation of health systems, and socio-economic inequities. Conclusion: The aspiration towards a healthier and safer society requires that countries develop and implement a coherent and context-specific national strategy, improve governance of public health emergencies, build the capacity of their (public) health systems, minimize fragmentation, and tackle upstream structural issues, including socio-economic inequities. This is possible through a primary health care approach, which ensures provision of universal and equitable promotive, preventive and curative services, through whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches.","output":"Analysis of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons for a Contextualized and Effective Response to Public Health Emergencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ŀ Ƚ30͹״(COVID-19)ߺ62Է(CAP)߲ͬʱڵزCTͼ,߶COVID-19CAPӰѧЧ  Ƚ30COVID-19(COVID-19)62CAP(CAP)ͬʱ(ڡչڡ)زCTӰ  :COVID-19ΪĥܶӰ෢ĥܶӰʵĥܶӰʵֱΪ12512,CAPֱΪ2131235,鵥ĥܶӰʱȽ,P&gt;0 05;ָȽ,P&lt;0 05 COVID-19СҶ񡢿֧֧ܱѪֱַΪ910022,CAPֱΪ49108,Ƚ,P&lt;0 05 չ:COVID-19鲡Ŀ22(73 33),CAP9(14 52),Ƚ,P&lt;0 05 COVID-19ĥܶӰʵ䡢ʸı䡢/·ʯֱΪ232217112,CAPֱΪ9415613,Ƚ,P&lt;0 05 :COVID-19鲡ΪĥܶӰʵӰĥܶӰӰʸıֱΪ731824,CAPֱΪ44596,Ƚ,P&lt;0 05  ,COVID-19 زCT ӰѧҪΪ1/3 ҰĤ¶෢Ƭ״ĥܶӰ,CAPҪΪҰдҶĥܶӰϲʵ;չ,COVID-19ۼҶĶ෢ĥܶӰʵ估ӰΪҪص,CAPԵҶβʵʵΧҰչĶ෢ĥܶӰΪҪ;,COVID-19ԼʸıϲĥܶӰӰΪҪ,CAPҪΪƬʵӰӰ","output":"30COVID-19ߺ62Է׻߲ͬʱڵزCTͼԱȹ۲"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this letter, we find a Simpsons paradox in the association between GDP and COVID-19 transmission in Chinese cities stratified by location.

DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-six (56) subjects (112 eyes) with a diagnosis of glaucoma or glaucoma suspect METHODS: The three-dimensional shape of the eyeball on 3D-MRI scans was classified according to the dimension of the longest diameter: axial dimension (prolate sphere), group 1; horizontal dimension (horizontally oblate sphere), group 2; and vertical dimension (vertically oblate sphere), group 3. The deviation of the CRVT, as a surrogate of lamina cribrosa (LC) shift, was measured from the center of the Bruch's membrane opening (BMO) demarcated by OCT imaging, with the horizontal midline as 0 and the superior location as a positive value. The angular location of the longest EOB was also measured. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Positions of CRVT and EOB according to the three-dimensional shape of an eyeball RESULTS: Among 112 eyes, 54 (48%) had a prolate shape (group 1), 23 (21%) a horizontally oblate shape (group 2), and 35 (31%) a vertically oblate shape (group 3). The angular deviation of the CRVT differed among the groups: to the nasal side in group 1, to the temporal side in group 2, and along the vertical meridian in group 3. In cases of asymmetric eyeball shape, the CRVT was deviated toward the undergrown side from the overgrown side, regardless of grouping. The angular location of the longest EOB was in the direction opposite to the CRVT position (P < 0.001). A generalized estimating equation analysis revealed that the temporal location of the CRVT was associated with older age (P = 0.001), nasal location of the longest EOB (P < 0.001), and oblate shape of the eyeball (P <0.001, group 2; P = 0.007, group 3). CONCLUSIONS: The position of the CRVT and EOB were associated with the three-dimensional eyeball shape.

This article illuminates the significant roles played by documentation within the context of the coronavirus pandemic. It centres, what it terms as, COVID-19 signage as essential extensions of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) into society. It posits that this signage helps materialize, mediate and articulate the pandemic from an unseen phenomenon into tangible objects with which people see and interact.Design/methodology/approachThis article presents a documentary typology of COVID-19 signage to provide a conceptual framework in which to situate, approach and analyse this diverse documentation and its implications for social life and traffic. Further, this article offers a case study of Malta's COVID-19 signage that helped materialize, mediate and articulate the pandemic across the European island nation during its national lockdown in the first half of 2020. This case study helps contextualize these signs and serves as a dual contemporary and historical overview of their creation, implementation and use.FindingsThe coronavirus pandemic cannot be seen with the naked eye. It is, in many respects, an abstraction. Documents enable the virus to be seen and the pandemic to be an experienced reality. Specifically, COVID-19 signage materializes the disease and pandemic into tangible items that individuals interact with and see on a daily basis as they navigate society. From personal to environmental to community signs, these documents have come to mediate social life and articulate COVID-19 during this extraordinary health crisis. A material basis of a shared pandemic social culture is consequently established by and through this signage and its ubiquity.Research limitations/implicationsThis article can serve as a point of departure for analyses of other kinds of COVID-19 signage in various contexts. It can serve as an anchor or example for other investigations into what other signs were used, including why, when and how they were produced, designed, formatted, implemented, enforced, altered and/or removed. For instance, it could be used for comparative studies between different NPIs and their associated signage, or of the signage appearing between different cities or countries or even the differences in signage at various political and socio-temporal points of the pandemic.Social implicationsIt is dually hoped that this article's documentary typology, and historical snapshot, of COVID-19 signage could help inform how current and future NPIs into society are or can be used to mitigate the coronavirus or other potential health crises as well as serve as both a contemporary and historical snapshot of some of the immediate and early responses to the pandemic.Originality/valueThis documentary typology can be applied to approaches and analyses of other kinds of COVID-19 signage and related documentation. By serving as a conceptual framework in which situate, approach and analyse these documents, it is hoped that this article can help create a sense of clarity in reflections on sign-saturated environments as well as be practically employed for examining and understanding the effective implementation of NPIs in this pandemic and other health crises.","output":"The nonpharmaceutical interventionist (NPI) signs of the coronavirus pandemic: a documentary typology and case study of COVID-19 signage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MIS-C is a newly defined post-viral myocarditis and inflammatory vasculopathy of children following COVID-19 infection.

The purpose of this study is to examine the online complaints raised against participation banks during the Covid 19 pandemic process. For this purpose, complaints submitted to the website www.sikayetvar. com which is one of the largest online complaint platforms in the World, by customers to the Participation Banks operating in Turkey, during February 2021. A total of300 online customer complaints were analyzed by content analysis, one of the qualitative research methods. Complaints were analyzed under two main themes, namely services and products offered by participation banks, and complaints originating from customer representatives, and sub-categories determined based on these themes. According to the analysis findings, it has been determined that the complaints of the participation bank customers mainly stem from investment transactions, card transactions, account transactions and ATM services, which are included in the product and services category. It is expected that the study will contribute to the literature and participation banking sector due to the limited number of studies on the effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic on participation banks and online customer complaints.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemi Srecinde Kat?l?m Bankalar?na Y?nelik Yap?lan ?evrimi?i M?teri ?ikayetleri zerine Bir nceleme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction La pandmie de Covid-19 est apparue comme un rvlateur des ingalits sociales de sant.

Casearia sylvestris is a plant used topically in different communities in Brazil, to treat wounds or promote cutaneous healing. To evaluate the topical anti-inflammatory activity for the crude hydroalcoholic extract of Casearia sylvestris (HCE-CS) in the models of single or multipe administration of chroton oil to induce ear edema in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental study using male Swiss mice (25-35g) kept under constant conditions in the Laboratory of Experimental Neuroscience (LaNEx)-UNISUL. Edema was induced in both models, respectively, by the single or multiple application of croton oil (CO, 2.5%, in 20l) on the external surface of the ear. The different groups of animals (n= 8) received different treatments: vehicle, dexamethasone (DEXA) or different doses of HCE-CS. Edema was evaluated macroscopically for 6 h (early edema) or 8 days (late edema) after the first application of the CO and immediately after the animals were submitted to euthanasia for the collection of the samples (treated ears). For early edema, the tissue was biochemically evaluated for myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) and levels of nitrite/nitrate. In the late edema model, the ears were histologically evaluated for general morphometry, degranulated and non-degranulated mast cells, as well as acanthosis. RESULTS Topic treatment with HCE-CS significantly reduced the early and late edema, as well as MPO activity and tissue levels of nitrite/nitrate. Finally, in the late edema model there was a lower density of degranulated mast cells in relation to the vehicle treated group and decreased thickness of the epidermis (acanthosis). CONCLUSION These results suggest a possible benefit of topical treatment with HCE-CS in inflammatory conditions of the skin.","output":"Macroscopic, biochemical and hystological evaluation of topical anti-inflammatory activity of Casearia sylvestris (Flacourtiaceae) in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevalence of childhood obesity has been trending upwards over the last few decades.

METHODOLOGY We prospectively analyzed the clinical records of 170 patients who underwent hepatic resection by suprahilar-extrafascial pedicle isolation and stapling technique in our clinic for emergency surgery in Belgrade. Patients who underwent hilar extrahepatic intrafascial dissection were excluded from the study. RESULTS We performed 102 minor liver resections and 68 major hepatectomies. The minor liver resections were associated with significantly shorter surgery duration (95.131.1 vs. 186.656.5) and transection time (35.914.5 vs. 65.317.2) than major hepatectomies (P<0.001 for all). The mean blood loss was 255.6129.9 mL in minor resection and 385.7200.1 mL in major resection (P=0.003). The mean blood transfusion requirement was 300.899.5 mL for the patients with minor hepatectomy and 450.989.6 mL for those with major liver resection (P=0.067). There was no significant difference in morbidity and mortality between the groups (P=0.989; P=0.920). Major as well as minor liver resection were a superior oncologic operation with no significant difference in the 3-year overall survival rates. CONCLUSIONS Extrafascial dissection of Glissonean pedicle with vascular stapling represents both an effective and safe surgical technique of anatomical liver resection.

Various private and government sectors of different countries allocated funding for research in multiple capacities. A significant portion of efforts has been devoted to information technology and service infrastructure development, including research on developing intelligent models and techniques for alerts, monitoring, early diagnosis, prevention, and other relevant services. As a result, many information resources have been created globally and are available for use. However, a defined structure to organize these resources into categories based on the nature and origin of the data is lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to organize COVID-19 information resources into a well-defined structure to facilitate the easy identification of a resource, tracking information workflows, and to provide a guide for a contextual dashboard design and development. METHODS: A sequence of action research was performed that involved a review of COVID-19 efforts and initiatives on a global scale during the year 2020. Data were collected according to the defined structure of primary, secondary, and tertiary categories. Various techniques for descriptive statistical analysis were employed to gain insights into the data to help develop a conceptual framework to organize resources and track interactions between different resources. RESULTS: Investigating diverse information at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels enabled us to develop a conceptual framework for COVID-19-related efforts and initiatives. The framework of resource categorization provides a gateway to access global initiatives with enriched metadata, and assists users in tracking the workflow of tertiary, secondary, and primary resources with relationships between various fragments of information. The results demonstrated mapping initiatives at the tertiary level to secondary level and then to the primary level to reach firsthand data, research, and trials. CONCLUSIONS: Adopting the proposed three-level structure allows for a consistent organization and management of existing COVID-19 knowledge resources and provides a roadmap for classifying future resources. This study is one of the earliest studies to introduce an infrastructure for locating and placing the right information at the right place.

METHODS To study lymphatic flow, C57BL/6 mice underwent lymphadenectomy (n = 5), sham lymphadenectomy (n = 5), or no intervention (n = 5), followed by methylene blue injection. Mice were dissected to determine whether methylene blue traveled to the iliac LN. To study host response to skin transplantation, C57BL/6 mice underwent allogeneic skin transplantation with LN excision (n = 6), allogeneic skin transplantation alone (n = 6), or syngeneic skin transplantation (n = 4). Skin grafts were placed distal to the popliteal fossa and mice were euthanized at day 10. Grafts were stained for endothelial cell and proliferation markers (CD31 and Ki67, respectively). Secondary lymphoid tissues (spleen, ipsilateral axillary LN, and contralateral inguinal LN) were removed and rechallenged with BALB/c alloantigen in vitro with subsequent assay of interferon- and interleukin 4 cell expression using ELISPOT technique. RESULTS Mice that underwent LN excision had no evidence of methylene blue in the iliac nodes; mice without surgical intervention or with sham LN excision consistently had methylene blue visible in the ipsilateral iliac nodes. Mice treated with allogeneic skin transplantation and LN excision had lower expression of interferon- and interleukin 4 in the secondary lymphoid tissues.

Influenza A(H1N1), commonly called 'swine flu', is a novel influenza virus made up of porcine, avian and human genes, and preferentially infects younger people. Although Influenza A(H1N1) does not appear to be likely to cause as many fatalities as previous influenza pandemics, attempts to contain it are necessary because people whose health is already compromised through underlying chronic medical conditions are at risk of death if they contract the virus. In addition, pregnant women who become infected are at increased risk of complications. This paper provides figures on the number of cases of Influenza A(H1N1) and deaths associated with this virus in Australia (using World Health Organization and Australian Government figures) and discusses infection control measures that optometrists should put in place for themselves, their staff and their patients, in the event that there is suspicion of Influenza A(H1N1) infection. Measures include isolating those who display symptoms indicative of influenza, use of surgical masks (P2 [N95]) by the infected person, frequent hand-washing, appropriate cough and sneeze etiquette, disposal of used tissues and rescheduling of non-urgent appointments for those thought to be infected. Any staff members who need to be closer than one metre to the infected person should also use personal protective equipment (for example, surgical masks, goggles or safety spectacles, gowns and gloves).

Viruses are only identified in the context of the epidemic that they induce as a result of transmission from one host to another. By breaking down the viral particle, the host cell appears to resurrect the metabolic function of the nucleic acid, which synthesises its components without any form of control. Viral products undergo self-assembly and are exported by either exocytosis or cytolysis. In the absence of cells, viruses appear to be inert. However, intracellular contamination of a virus does not always result in replication: the viral genome can disappear, remain latent, wake up, remain embedded in the cellular genome, become an oncogene or induce auto-immunity. The presence of endogenous retroviruses in eukaryotic cells raises the question of their possible role in evolution.","output":"Viruses and viral epidemics in the metabolic theory of evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Problem: With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many public health measures were put into place todecrease the spread of the illness Initiation of these recommendations resulted in the shutting down of manybusinesses and the large majority of the public wanting confine at home Our community noted an increase inpatient anxiety about coming into clinic for in-person visits which led to decreased clinic productivity anddecreased access to care, as telehealth services were not currently being offered by the general pediatricsdepartment Goal: Our general pediatrics clinics rapidly initiated the use of telehealth services via phone and avideo telecommunication platform in order to increase access to care for our patients and promote continuedclinical productivity Our goal was to increase telehealth services to account for at least 25% of total visits overa 6-week period Interventions: Telehealth was initiated institution wide after the state of Texas providedrelaxed restrictions on services An initial email was provided by Texas Tech Physicians regardingimplementation of telehealth services and was complete with cheat sheets for using these services Our department also created generic email accounts for each clinic to aid in the scheduling of visits Our residentclinic was also included and the residents were provided with a specific lecture regarding workflow oftelehealth visits One general pediatrics clinic also advertised the new services through a generic phonemessage and scheduled a meeting with nurses and patient service specialists to address questions andworkflow regarding telehealth The number of telehealth visits by provider and clinic were measured weekly Results: After initiation of telehealth, all clinics showed an uptake of this service All but one providerparticipated in the use of telehealth The percentage of total telehealth visits across all clinics peaked at 7 8%the week of 4/6/2020 and then plateaued The single largest percentage of telehealth visits reached was 12 9the week of 4/6 by the Pavilion clinic For the resident clinic, there was an increased use in services after theirlecture on telehealth Continued intervention showed sustaining telehealth visit numbers Conclusions: Whilewe were able to quickly initiate telehealth at all of our clinics, the percentage of telehealth visits only reached7 8% of total The advertisement of services did not appear to help with patient access as the number of visitsscheduled slightly decreased the week the phone message was sent Creation of the generic email helped withease in scheduling visits There still appears to be some barriers to implementation and usage of telehealthservices Continued investigation can look at telehealth use between insurance types and patient location aswell as attitudes of patients regarding this service","output":"Implementation and usage of telemedicine in general pediatricsduring the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, lineage B.1.617.2, exhibit faster initial infection with a higher viral load than prior variants, and pseudotyped particles bearing the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant spike protein induce a faster initial infection rate of target cells compared to those bearing other SARS-CoV-2 variant spikes.

In our DSNet, we design a novel Selective Detailed Representation Fusion Module to reconstruct the detailed representation to alleviate the small size of lung nodules images. In addition, the adversarial training framework with Soft Mask is proposed to further improve the accuracy of segmentation. Extensive experiments validate that our DSNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for accurate lung nodules segmentation.

We aimed to evaluate the characteristics of a large population of pediatric patients with severe COVID-19 and compare them with patients with severe cases of influenza and other respiratory viruses (ORV). METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of Brazilian data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Information System, gathered from January 1st to July 14th, 2020. The sample included 4,784 patients (2,570 with confirmed COVID-19, 659 with influenza, 1,555 with ORV). Outcome measures included clinical features, preexisting comorbidities, pediatric intensive care unit admissions, need for ventilatory support, and death. RESULTS: Compared with the influenza and ORV groups, the COVID-19 group had a higher proportion of newborns and adolescents, as well as lower frequencies of fever, cough, dyspnea, respiratory distress, and desaturation. Although use of invasive ventilatory support was similar among groups, death rate was highest for COVID-19 (15.2% vs. 4.5% vs. 3.2%, p&lt;0.001), with death risk more than three times the other groups (adjusted OR=3.7 [95% CI 2.5-5.6]). The presence of two or more comorbidities further increased this risk (OR=4.8 [95% CI 3.5-6.6]). Preexisting comorbidities were reported in 986 patients with severe COVID-19 (38%). Mortality rate among COVID-19 patients was significantly higher for almost all comorbidities reported.

In France, more than 52% people reported being physically active in urban parks. Based on the GREENH-City research carried out in cities of the French network of WHO healthy cities, this presentation aims to show that UGS, depending on different drivers, can support a wide variety of physical activities, but also offer multiple other functions that contribute more or less directly to the health of the population. METHODS: A qualitative survey was conducted among users of 3 different parks in each of the 6 selected cities with both observations and semi-directive interviews and a thematic analyzes were performed. Observed activities were classified into 8 groups including physical activity (non-sport, sports). Interview's analysis aimed to describe the reasons for coming and the type of activity made. RESULTS: 186 observations and 591 recorded and unrecorded interviews with individuals or groups were conducted in the 18 parks. 24 types of physical activity have been described as possible uses of UGS. The most important, regardless of UGS location, is children activities in playgrounds. The most common activities are walking (with a social function) and jogging (individual function). Proximity and the accessibility are two reasons for use. CONCLUSIONS: UGS are an open access amenity for physical activities. From a social justice perspective, policy makers should ensure that every neighborhood is sufficiently close to an UGS. In addition to promoting physical activity, UGS also serve an important social function and impact the collective physical and mental health of the population in many other ways (e.g., as environmental risk regulators). Their coping role during crisis for population would worth to be studied further. KEY MESSAGES: Proximity and accessibility should shape local policies related to UGS renewal towards more equity.

The large droplet route has been commonly believed to be dominant for most respiratory infections since the early 20th century, and the associated droplet precaution is widely known and practiced in hospitals and in the community. The mechanism of exposure to droplets expired at close contact, however, remains surprisingly unexplored. In this study, the exposure to exhaled droplets during close contact (< 2 m) via both the short-range airborne and large droplet sub-routes is studied using a simple mathematical model of expired flows and droplet dispersion/deposition/inhalation, which enables the calculation of exposure due to both deposition and inhalation. The short-range airborne route is found to dominate at most distances studied during both talking and coughing. The large droplet route only dominates when the droplets are larger than 100 m and when the subjects are within 0.2 m while talking or 0.5 m while coughing. The smaller the exhaled droplets, the more important the short-range airborne route.

Traditionally, in-person hands-on courses have been the most common means for surgeons to gain exposure to new techniques and procedures. The COVID19 pandemic caused a cessation in these courses and left surgeons with limited opportunities to continue their professional development. Thus, SAGES elected to create an innovative hands-on course that could be completed at home in order to provide surgeons with opportunities to learn new procedures during the pandemic. METHODS: This course was initially planned to be taught as an in-person hands-on course utilizing the Acquisition of Data for Outcomes and Procedure Transfer(ADOPT) method 1. We identified a virtual telementoring platform, Proximie Ltd(London, UK), and a company that could create a model of an abdominal wall in order to perform a Transversus Abdominis Release, KindHeart&#8482;(Chapel Hill, NC, USA). The course consisted of pre-course lectures and videos to be reviewed by participants, a pre-course call to set learning goals, the hands-on telementoring session from home, and monthly webinars for a year. RESULTS: The ADOPT hands-on hernia course at home was successfully completed on October 23rd of 2020. All participants and faculty were successfully able to set up their model and utilize the telementoring platform, but 15% required assistance. Post course-surveys showed that participants felt that the course was successful in meeting their educational goals and felt similar to prior in-person courses. CONCLUSIONS: SAGES was successfully able to transition and in-person hands-on course to a virtual at-home format. This innovative approach to continuing professional development will be necessary during the times of the COVID19 pandemic, but may be a helpful option for rural surgeons and others with travel restrictions in the future to continue their professional development without the need to travel away from their practice.","output":"At-home hands-on surgical training during COVID19: proof of concept using a virtual telementoring platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to provide some thoughts on the prevention and treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the perspective of JingFang Medicine (Classical Chinese Formula).

Amid the active usage of social networks and micro-blogs, notably during the COVID-19 pandemic, we may glean insights into any product or service through users' feedback and opinions. Thus, it is often difficult and time consuming to go through all the reviews and analyse them in order to recognize the notion of the overall goodness or badness of the reviews before making any decision. To overcome this challenge, sentiment analysis has been used as an effective rapid way to automatically gauge consumers' opinions. Large reviews will possibly encompass both positive and negative opinions on different features of a product/service in the same review. Therefore, this paper proposes an aspect-oriented sentiment classification using a combination of the prior knowledge topic model algorithm (SA-LDA), automatic labelling (SentiWordNet) and ensemble method (Stacking). The framework is evaluated using the dataset from different domains. The results have shown that the proposed SA-LDA outperformed the standard LDA. In addition, the suggested ensemble learning classifier has increased the accuracy of the classifier by more than ~3% when it is compared to baseline classification algorithms.

The data is stored in vertices while the edges model the interactions or relationships between these data. They offer flexibility in handling data that is strongly connected to each other. The analysis of a big graph generally involves exploring all of its vertices. Thus, this operation is costly in time and resources because big graphs are generally composed of millions of vertices connected through billions of edges. Consequently, the graph algorithms are expansive compared to the size of the big graph, and are therefore ineffective for data exploration. Thus, partitioning the graph stands out as an efficient and less expensive alternative for exploring a big graph. This technique consists in partitioning the graph into a set of k sub-graphs in order to reduce the complexity of the queries.

Integrity of hemoglobin is a crucial determining factor for the overall health functions. Nutrient repletion therapy should be a fundamental strategy to restore the healthy properties of blood. A unique patent-pending iron-free VMP35 formulation was engineered by our laboratory to restore iron-dependent hemoglobin in anemic cells using a proprietary Prodosome(?) absorption technology. This formulation, containing an array of nano-emulsified botanical ingredients rich in bioflavonoids, strengthens the structural integrity of connective tissues, and potentiates immune competence, cellular aerobic metabolism, and enhances efficient regulation of inflammatory events. We discuss the intricate aspects of strong vs. fragile immunity and consequential inflammatory responses to convey a deeper understanding of the varied and overly complex sequela of immunological behaviors and events. The effect of the VMP35 is mediated through highly absorbable nutritional/nutrigenomic repletion enabling improvements in the systemic set of functional behaviors. In fact, the iron-free VMP35 facilitates a Systems Biology Approach which restores hemoglobin status, reverses anaerobic hypoxia, improves competent immune responsivity, and regulates appropriate and controlled activation of general and neuro-inflammatory sequela. Under these pathogenic circumstances, iron-deficiency anemia has been misconceptualized, and a new nosological term, Chronic Anemia Syndrome, is proposed. The comparative therapeutic rationale of Reductionist vs. Systems Biology approaches is also explained in detail. METHODS: The efficacy of the novel therapeutic iron-free VMP35 liquid nutraceutical is detailed in restoring iron-dependent hemoglobin to RBCs and boosting cellular morphology, viability, and immune competence, thereby reducing the need for prolonging inflammatory sequela. RESULTS: This was demonstrated in a previous IRB approved multi-subject human study. In addition, two recent case studies report dramatic restorative benefits of nutrient repletion therapy of the VMP35 on subjects having experienced near-fatal events, which confirmed the findings explained in this manuscript. CONCLUSIONS: This novel iron-free VMP35 modulates an array of homeostatic biological parameters such as enhanced hemoglobinization, aerobic metabolism, viral immuno-competence, and inflammatory regulation. Further research, examining mechanistic and beneficial effects in athletic performance, is in progress. Importantly, during these troubled immune challenging times, modulating an array of homeostatic immunological and inflammatory dysfunctions are tantamount to improved population outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The Clinical investigation in a total of 38 subjects was conducted under an Institutional Review Board (IRB) from the Path Foundation in New York, NY (#13-009 April 25, 2013).

I discuss tolerance thresholds and the role of CD8 T cells to limit pathological immune responses, the problems posed by tolerant superspreaders and the signature coronavirus evasion strategy of eliciting only short\\\\lived neutralizing antibody responses. Pinpointing and targeting the mechanisms responsible for varying pathology and short\\\\lived antibody were beyond reach in previous zoonoses, but this time we are armed with genomic technologies and more knowledge of immune checkpoint genes.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The current study included all consecutive NSTEMI patients who visited the emergency department in Fuwai Hospital from February 1 to March 31, 2020 and all the NSTEMI patients in the same period of 2019 as a historical control. Very-high-risk patients were defined as clinical presentation of heart failure, cardiac shock, cardiac arrest, recurrent chest pain, and life-threatening arrhythmias. The primary outcome was in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as a composite of all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction, or heart failure. A total of 115 NSTEMI patients were enrolled since the outbreak of COVID-19, and a total of 145 patients were included in the control group.

METHODS: We used nationally representative survey data from the 2017C2018 Longitudinal Ageing Study in India to estimate the proportion of adults aged 45 years or older identified with hypertension and who had not been diagnosed with hypertension despite having visited a health facility during the previous 12 months. We estimated ageCsex adjusted proportions of missed opportunities to diagnose hypertension, as well as actual and potential proportions of diagnosis, by sociodemographic characteristics and for each state. FINDINGS: Among those identified as having hypertension, 22.6% (95% confidence interval, CI: 21.3 to 23.8) had not been diagnosed despite having recently visited a health facility. If these opportunities had been realized, the prevalence of diagnosed hypertension would have increased from 54.8% (95% CI: 53.5 to 56.1) to 77.3% (95% CI: 76.2 to 78.5). Missed opportunities for diagnosis were more common among individuals who were poorer (P = 0.001), less educated (P < 0.001), male (P < 0.001), rural (P < 0.001), Hindu (P = 0.001), living alone (P = 0.028) and working (P < 0.001). Missed opportunities for diagnosis were more common at private than at public health facilities (P < 0.001) and varied widely across states (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Opportunistic screening for hypertension has the potential to significantly increase detection of the condition and reduce sociodemographic and geographic inequalities in its diagnosis. Such screening could be a first step towards more effective and equitable hypertension treatment and control.","output":"Missed opportunities for hypertension screening: a cross-sectional study, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditional phylogenetic analysis is based on multiple sequence alignment. With the development of worldwide genome sequencing project, more and more completely sequenced genomes become available. However, traditional sequence alignment tools are impossible to deal with large-scale genome sequence. So, the development of new algorithms to infer phylogenetic relationship without alignment from whole genome information represents a new direction of phylogenetic study in the post-genome era. In the present study, a novel algorithm based on BBC (base-base correlation) is proposed to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of HEV (Hepatitis E virus). When 48 HEV genome sequences are analyzed, the phylogenetic tree that is constructed based on BBC algorithm is well consistent with that of previous study. When compared with methods of sequence alignment, the merit of BBC algorithm appears to be more rapid in calculating evolutionary distances of whole genome sequence and not requires any human intervention, such as gene identification, parameter selection. BBC algorithm can serve as an alternative to rapidly construct phylogenetic trees and infer evolutionary relationships.","output":"A novel feature-based method for whole genome phylogenetic analysis without alignment: application to HEV genotyping and subtyping."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Joint replacement surgery is a highly effective treatment option for patients with severe osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and knee when other treatments have failed. Unfortunately, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a temporary suspension of non-urgent elective surgery was implemented. Thousands of patients currently awaiting hip and knee replacements have been affected. Many of these patients will present to their general practitioners for symptom management during this interim period. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to summarise current recommendations for the non-operative management of patients with symptomatic OA. DISCUSSION: Non-operative treatment modalities for OA include education, lifestyle modification and exercise, mass reduction, physiotherapy, orthoses, psychology, pharmaceuticals and injections. Multimodal therapy is required for patients with severe symptoms.

However, few models developed from single cohorts can perform consistently well at population level where diverse prognoses exist (such as the SARS-CoV2 pandemic). This study aims at tackling this challenge by synergising prediction models from the literature using ensemble learning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study we selected and reimplemented seven prediction models for COVID-19, which were derived from diverse cohorts and used different implementation techniques. A novel ensemble learning framework was proposed to synergise them for realising personalised predictions for individual patients. Four diverse international cohorts (2 from the UK and 2 from China; total N=5,394) were used to validate all eight models on discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness. RESULTS: Results showed that individual prediction models could perform well on some cohorts while poorly on others. Conversely, the ensemble model achieved the best performances consistently on all metrics quantifying discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness. Performance disparities were observed in cohorts from the two countries: all models achieved better performances on the China cohorts. DISCUSSION: When individual models were learned from complementary cohorts, the synergised model will have the potential to achieve synergised performances. Results indicate that blood parameters and physiological measurements might have better predictive powers when collected early, which remains to be confirmed by further studies.

One potential contribution are differences in the glycosylation of target human cells, particularly as SARS-CoV-2 has the capacity to bind sialic acid which is a common, and highly variable, terminal modification of glycans. The viral spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 and the human cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are both densely glycosylated. We therefore sought to investigate whether the glycosylation state of ACE2 impacts the interaction with SARS-CoV-2 viral spike. We generated a panel of engineered ACE2 glycoforms which were analyzed by mass spectrometry to reveal the site-specific glycan modifications. We then probed the impact of ACE2 glycosylation on S binding and revealed a subtle sensitivity with hypersialylated or oligomannose-type glycans slightly impeding the interaction. In contrast, deglycosylation of ACE2 did not influence SARS-CoV-2 binding. Overall, ACE2 glycosylation does not significantly influence viral spike binding. We suggest that any role of glycosylation in the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 will lie beyond its immediate impact of receptor glycosylation on virus binding.","output":"Subtle Influence of ACE2 Glycan Processing on SARS-CoV-2 Recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An excessive inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be a major cause of disease severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19.

of In Vitro Diagnostics EUAsexternal icon Antigen tests are immunoassays that detect the presence of a specific viral antigen, which implies current viral infection Antigen tests are currently authorized to be performed on nasopharyngeal or nasal swab specimens placed directly into the assays extraction buffer or reagent The currently authorized antigen tests are not restricted to use on persons of a certain age See Table 1 for additional information about antigen tests Antigen tests are relatively inexpensive, and most can be used at the point of care Most of the currently authorized tests return results in approximately 15 minutes Antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 are generally less sensitive than real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and other nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for detecting the presence of viral nucleic acid However, RT-PCR can detect levels of viral nucleic acid that cannot be cultured, suggesting that the presence of viral nucleic acid does not always indicate contagiousness Proper interpretation of both antigen test results and confirmatory testing when indicated is important for accurate clinical management of patients with suspected COVID-19, or for identification of infected persons when used for screening The clinical performance of antigen diagnostic tests largely depends on the circumstances in which they are used Both antigen tests and NAATs perform best when the person is tested when viral load is generally highest They also may be informative in diagnostic testing situations in which the person

Europe. The study included 6720 parents (2002 parents with a child with a mental health condition and 4718 without) from seven European countries: the United Kingdom (n=508), Sweden (n=1436), Spain (n=1491), Belgium (n=508), the Netherlands (n=324), Germany (n=1662) and Italy (n=794). Many parents found homeschooling to be of poor quality, with insufficient support from schools and general negative effects on both children and parents. In most countries, online teaching was uncommon, leaving parents with primary responsibility for managing their childs schooling. Parents also reported increased levels of stress, worry, social isolation, and domestic conflict. A small number of parents reported increased parental alcohol/drug use. Some differences were found between countries and some effects were more pronounced in families with a child with a mental health condition. However, group differences were generally small, indicating that negative effects were present in many families across countries. It should also be noted that some parents reported positive effects of homeschooling for their child or themselves. The adverse effects of homeschooling will likely have a long-term impact and contribute to increased inequalities. Given that school closures have been argued to be less effective than other social distancing interventions, policymakers need to carefully consider the negative consequences of homeschooling during a possible second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.","output":"Psychosocial effects of homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic: Differences between seven European countries and between children with and without mental health conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, I use autoethnography to examine time spent on an acute psychiatric ward during the COVID-19 lockdown.

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarise the performances of the existing models. METHODS: Prognostic models of diabetic microvascular complications were retrieved from PubMed and Scopus up to 31 December 2020. Studies were selected, if they developed or internally/externally validated models of any microvascular complication in type 2 diabetes (T2D). RESULTS: In total, 71 studies were eligible, of which 32, 30 and 18 studies initially developed prognostic model for diabetic retinopathy (DR), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) with the number of derived equations of 84, 96 and 51, respectively. Most models were derived-phases, some were internal and external validations. Common predictors were age, sex, HbA1c, diabetic duration, SBP and BMI. Traditional statistical models (i.e. Cox and logit regression) were mostly applied, otherwise machine learning. In cohorts, the discriminative performance in derived-logit was pooled with C statistics of 0.82 (0.73-0.92) for DR and 0.78 (0.74-0.83) for CKD. Pooled Cox regression yielded 0.75 (0.74-0.77), 0.78 (0.74-0.82) and 0.87 (0.84-0.89) for DR, CKD and ESRD, respectively.

Another challenge is that in most cases, the information to share does not have parallel data in multiple languages. To this end, we propose a novel framework which incorporates (unsupervised) translation alignment to learn as pseudo-parallel data. Then we train multilingual question-answering mapping and generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared against a series of competitive baselines.

METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in Qingdao, China in 2019-2021, which enrolled 301 obesity cases and 307 controls. Based on the candidate gene selection method, 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 7 olfactory pathway genes were selected. Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was isolated and purified from the peripheral blood leukocytes by using DNA extraction kits and was genotyped by the MassArray system. The weighted genetic score of each gene was calculated to analyze the effect of whole gene. The effect of gene scores on obesity and the gene-environment interaction were estimated by logistic regression.

SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks human alveoli and causes severe lung infection and damage. To better understand the molecular basis of this disease, we sought to characterize the responses of alveolar epithelium and its adjacent microvascular endothelium to viral infection under a co-culture system. SARS-CoV-2 infection caused massive virus replication and dramatic organelles remodeling in alveolar epithelial cells, alone. While, viral infection affected endothelial cells in an indirect manner, which was mediated by infected alveolar epithelium. Proteomics analysis and TEM examinations showed viral infection caused global proteomic modulations and marked ultrastructural changes in both epithelial cells and endothelial cells under the co-culture system. In particular, viral infection elicited global protein changes and structural reorganizations across many sub-cellular compartments in epithelial cells. Among the affected organelles, mitochondrion seems to be a primary target organelle. Besides, according to EM and proteomic results, we identified Daurisoline, a potent autophagy inhibitor, could inhibit virus replication effectively in host cells.

Qualitative studies examining clinician telemedicine perspectives during the pandemic identified challenges with physical examination, workflow concerns, burnout, and reduced personal connection with patients. However, these studies only included a relatively small number of physicians or were limited to a single specialty, and few assessed perspectives on integrating trainees into workflows, an important area to address to support the clinical learning environment. As telemedicine use continues, it is necessary to understand a range of clinician perspectives. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to survey pediatric and adult medicine clinicians at the University of Chicago Medical Center to understand their telemedicine benefits and barriers, workflow impacts, and training and support needs. METHODS: In July 2020, we conducted an observational cross-sectional study of University of Chicago Medical Center faculty and advanced practice providers in the Department of Medicine (DOM) and Department of Pediatrics (DOP). RESULTS: The overall response rate was 39% (200/517; DOM: 135/325, 42%; DOP: 65/192, 34%); most respondents were physicians (DOM: 100/135, 74%; DOP: 51/65, 79%). One-third took longer to prepare for (65/200, 33%) and conduct (62/200, 32%) video visits compared to in-person visits. Male clinicians reported conducting a higher percentage of telemedicine visits by video than their female counterparts (P=.02), with no differences in the number of half-days per week providing direct outpatient care or supervising trainees. Further, clinicians who conducted a higher percentage of their telemedicine by video were less likely to feel overwhelmed (P=.02), with no difference in reported burnout. Female clinicians were more overwhelmed with video visits compared to males (41/130, 32% vs 12/64, 19%; P=.05). Clinicians 50 years or older were less overwhelmed than those younger than 50 years (30/85, 35% vs 23/113, 20%; P=.02). Those who received more video visit training modalities (eg, a document and webinar on technical issues) were less likely to feel overwhelmed by the conversion to video visits (P=.007) or burnt out (P=.009). In addition, those reporting a higher ability to technically navigate a video visit were also less likely to feel overwhelmed by video visits (P=.02) or burnt out (P=.001). The top telemedicine barriers were patient-related: lack of technology access, lack of skill, and reluctance. Training needs to be focused on integrating learners into workflows. Open-ended responses highlighted a need for increased support staff. Overall, more than half enjoyed conducting video visits (119/200, 60%) and wanted to continue using video visits in the future (150/200, 75%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite positive telemedicine experiences, more support to facilitate video visits for patients and clinicians is needed. Further, clinicians need additional training on trainee education and integration into workflows. Further work is needed to better understand why gender and age differences exist. In conclusion, interventions to address clinician and patient barriers, and enhance clinician training are needed to support telemedicines durability.","output":"Clinician Perspectives on Telemedicine: Observational Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Water pollution caused by oil leakage or oily sewage has seriously threatened the ecological environment and human health.

The objectives of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of interferon alfa-2b and LPV/r plus interferon alfa-2b for SARS-CoV-2 infection in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 123 patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR on nasopharyngeal swab and symptoms between Jan. 13 and Apr. 23, 2020. All patients received standard supportive care and regular clinical monitoring. Patients were assigned to standard care group (n = 12), interferon alfa-2b group (n = 44), and combination LPV/r plus interferon alfa-2b group (n = 67). The primary endpoints were duration of required oxygen support and virus clearance time. Associations between therapies and these outcomes were assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Baseline clinical characteristics were not significantly different among the three groups (P > 0.05). No significant associations were observed between LPV/r/interferon alfa-2b and faster SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance (HR, 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45C1.61]; P = 0.61 in interferon alfa-2b group vs HR, 0.59 [95% CI 0.32C1.11]; P = 0.10 in LPV/r plus interferon alfa-2b group). Individual therapy groups also showed no significant association with duration of required oxygen support. There were no significant differences among the three groups in the incidence of adverse events (P > 0.05).

Their professional identity may affect whether they can actively participate and be competent in care tasks during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To examine the level of and changes in professional identity of Chinese emergency and intensive care unit nurses as the COVID-19 pandemic builds. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey composed of the Professional Identity Scale for Nurses plus 2 open-ended questions was administered to Chinese emergency and intensive care unit nurses through an online questionnaire. RESULTS: Emergency and intensive care unit nurses had a medium level of professional identity. Participants' total and item mean scores in 5 professional identity dimensions were higher than the professional identity norm established by Liu (P < .001). The greatest mean item score difference was in the dimension of professional identity evaluation (3.57 vs 2.88, P < .001). When asked about their feelings witnessing the COVID-19 situation and their feelings about participating in frontline work, 68.9% and 83.9%, respectively, reported positive changes in their professional identity. CONCLUSIONS: The professional identity of emergency and intensive care unit nurses greatly improved during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this paper, such novel 3,7-diacylquercetin, quercetin 6''-acylgalactoside, and quercetin 2'',6''-diacylgalactoside analogues of lead compound 1 were prepared to assess their target specificities and preferences in bacteria. The significant enzymatic inhibition of both Escherichia coli DNA gyrase and Staphylococcus aureus topoIV suggest that these compounds are dual inhibitors. Most of the investigated compounds exhibited pronounced inhibition with MIC values ranging from 0.13 to 128 g/mL toward the growth of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin sensitive S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), vancomycin intermediate S. aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterial strains. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed that the acyl moiety was absolutely essential for activity against Gram-positive organisms. The most active compound 5i was 512-fold more potent than vancomycin and 16-32-fold more potent than 1 against VRE strains.

However, the existing literature generally neglects the role of actors' behaviour and agency within property market shifts, and how market shifts affect cities. In response, we establish a framework that systematically unpacks the role, characteristics and behaviour of property investors in investment market shifts within urban development. We consider market shifts as modifications to established economic and regulatory processes and argue that a multidimensional approach is required to understand property investors and their role within property investment markets that shapes the urban built environment. Our main contribution is a novel approach and methodology to read changing property investor landscapes by linking wider economic and regulatory changes to investment actors and their investment strategies. Empirically, we focus on Amsterdam's changing investor landscape over the last 15 years. We investigate how crises, represented by far-reaching institutional disruptions of economic and regulatory systems, relate to Amsterdam's landscape of property investors. Correspondingly, we define three distinct periods of analysis, based on transaction volumes and regulatory interventions at national and local levels: the pre-global financial crisis (GFC) period from 2005 to 2008, the post-GFC recovery period from 2009 to 2013, and the pre-Covid19 boom period from 2014 to 2020. We reveal how Amsterdam's investor landscape changed over the course of these periods through a mixed methods analysis, including quantitative investment transaction analysis, mapping, and in-depth interviews with investors. We ultimately suggest that reading property market shifts through multidimensional characteristics would enable more targeted policy solutions, moving away from empirically ill-supported stereotypes of property actor behaviours.","output":"After the crisis is before the crisis: Reading property market shifts through Amsterdam's changing landscape of property investors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension are some of the main Chronic Noncommunicable Diseases, representing a big challenge for global health. In this context, Telehealth programs are presented as a tool with exciting potential to complement and support health care. This paper aimed to analyze the effectiveness of the use of Telehealth programs in the care of individuals with Hypertension and/or Diabetes Mellitus. METHODS: A systematic review with meta-analysis was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol methodology. The following databases were used: PubMed, EMBASE, SciELO, ScienceDirect and Cochrane Library. Papers were included if they addressed the use of technologies that allow two-way communication at a distance between health professionals and patients affected by Hypertension and/or Diabetes Mellitus, type 1 or type 2. Experimental, cross-sectional, caseCcontrol, cohort, and clinical trials were included in the review. RESULTS: We included 164 papers in the review and 45 in the meta-analysis final synthesis. The systematic review results showed a prevalence of telemonitoring as the main form of Telehealth. The study showed a reduction in expenses with the use of Telehealth, both for the users and for the health systems providers, followed by greater satisfaction. Our meta-analysis showed that Telehealth is an effective tool in the care of diabetic patients, providing a 0.353% reduction in HbA1c compared to traditional care.

We tested the hypothesis that FDA-approved antiretrovirals, antibiotics, and antimalarials will effectively inhibit COVID-19 two major drug targets, coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (NP) and hemagglutinin-esterase (HE). To test this hypothesis, we carried out a phylogenic analysis of coronavirus genome to understand the origins of NP and HE, and also modeled the proteins before molecular docking, druglikeness, toxicity assessment, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) and ligand-based pharmacophore modeling of the selected FDA-approved drugs. Our models for NP and HE had over 95% identity with templates 5EPW and 3CL5 respectively in the PDB database, with majority of the amino acids occupying acceptable regions. The active sites of the proteins contained conserved residues that were involved in ligand binding. Lopinavir and ritonavir possessed greater binding affinities for NP and HE relative to remdesivir, while levofloxacin and hydroxychloroquine were the most notable among the other classes of drugs. The Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF), Radius of gyration (Rg), and binding energy values obtained after 100 ns of MDS revealed good stability of these compounds in the binding sites of the proteins while important pharmacophore features were also identified. The study showed that COVID-19 likely originated from bat, owing to the over 90% genomic similarity observed, and that lopinavir, levofloxacin, and hydroxychloroquine might serve as potential anti-COVID-19 lead molecules for additional optimization and drug development for the treatment of COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Methods We searched four databases from inception to February 2020 for relevant literature. Main findings were extracted. Results 3,343 citations were screened and 19 included in the review. Activities and social contacts appeared to decrease during closures but contact was still common. All studies reported children leaving the house or being looked after by non-household members. There was some evidence that older child age and parental disagreement with closure were predictive of children leaving the house, and mixed evidence regarding the relationship between infection status and leaving the home. Parental agreement with closure was generally high, but some parents disagreed due to perceived low risk of infection and practical issues regarding childcare and financial impact. Conclusions Evidence suggests that many children continue to leave the house and mix with others during school closures despite public health recommendations to avoid social contact.

The demographic details and detailed clinical history of the patient, including history of loss of smell and taste was taken at the time of presentation. The patients were divided into 2 groups, group A: COVID-19 patients with OTD; group B: COVID-19 patients without OTD. 100 contiguous patients were recruited in each group. The COVID-19 test by RT-PCR was done and Ct value of the 3 genes: E (Envelope encoding) gene, N (Nucleocapsid encoding) gene, and RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) gene, was used for data analysis. The Ct values of each of the three genes were compared between groups A and B. RESULTS: Group A and B did not differ significantly in terms of basic demographics. The differences in the Ct values of the 3 genes E gene, N gene and RdRp gene, of group A and B were found to be statistically significant (p = 0.005, p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). CONCLUSION: The patients with OTD had a lower Ct value at diagnosis, and hence, a higher viral load than those without OTD.

COVID-19 main protease represents a major target for drug treatment to inhibit viral function. The present study sought to evaluate medicinal plant compounds as potential inhibitors of the COVID-19 main protease using molecular docking and molecular dynamic analysis. The PDB files of COVID-19 main protease and some medicinal plant compounds were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org) and Pubchem server, respectively. The Gromacs software was used for simulation studies, and molecular docking analysis was done using Autodock 4.2. The COVID-19 main protease simulation, compared with some phytochemicals docked to the COVID-19 main protease, were analyzed. Glabridin, catechin, and fisetin had the greatest tendency to interact with the COVID-19 main protease by hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. Docking of these phytochemicals to COVID-19 main protease led to an increase in the radius of gyration (Rg), decrease in the Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and induced variation in COVID-19 main protease secondary structure. The high tendency interaction of glabridin, catechin, and fisetin to COVID-19 main protease induced conformational changes on this enzyme. These interactions can lead to enzyme inhibition.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between vitamin D status at admission and different markers of inflammation, coagulation, and sepsis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective study on 137 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and available data on serum 25(OH)D levels, who were admitted to our Institution between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups: survivors (n = 78; 57%) and non-survivors (n = 59; 43%). RESULTS: At admission, all patients showed hypovitaminosis D. Median total serum 25(OH)D levels at admission were significantly higher in survivors than non-survivors (12 ng/mL vs 8 ng/mL; p < 0.01). Non-survivors exhibited significantly higher median levels of white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte count ratio (NLR), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), ferritin, interleukin 6 (IL-6), D-dimer, fibrinogen, and procalcitonin (PCT) compared to survivors at three different time points during hospitalization. In a multivariate analysis performed by a logistic regression model, serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly inversely associated with risk of COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.85C0.98; p = 0.01). According to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, hsCRP, NLR, ferritin, and D-dimer were the best predictive biomarkers for poor prognosis of COVID-19, whereas IL-6, PCT, fibrinogen, 25(OH)D, WBC count, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) may serve as supportive biomarkers for worse clinical course of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: We found a markedly high prevalence (100%) of hypovitaminosis D in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, suggesting a possible role of low vitamin D status in increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent hospitalization. The inverse association between serum 25(OH)D levels and risk of in-hospital mortality observed in our cohort suggests that a lower vitamin D status upon admission may represent a modifiable and independent risk factor for poor prognosis in COVID-19.","output":"Low Vitamin D Status at Admission as a Risk Factor for Poor Survival in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19: An Italian Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Built heritage resources (BHRs) are multidimensional assets that need to be conceived under a sustainability and circular economy framework Whereas it is essential that their conservation, management, and enjoyment are sustainable, it is also necessary that the environmental, cultural, and socio-economic contexts in which they are integrated are sustainable too Like other amenities, BHRs can improve the quality of the urban environment and generate externalities;additionally, they may influence sectors such as real estate, hospitality, and tourism In this framework, this contribution aims to identify spatial relationships occurring between BHRs and short-term rentals (STRs), i e , a recent economic phenomenon facilitated by platforms such as Airbnb Through the application of Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis techniques and taking Turin (Italy) as a case study, this article provides evidence that spatial correlation patterns between BHRs and STRs exist, and that the areas most affected by STRs are the residential neighborhoods located in the proximity of the historic center of the city Relations with other sets of socio-economic variables are highlighted too, and conclusions suggest that future studies are essential not only to monitor sustainability issues and reflect on new housing models and sustainable uses of buildings, but also to understand the evolution of the phenomenon in light of the pandemic Covid-19","output":"Identifying Spatial Relationships between Built Heritage Resources and Short-Term Rentals before the Covid-19 Pandemic: Exploratory Perspectives on Sustainability Issues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The tuberculosis vaccine, Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), also affords protection against non-tuberculous diseases attributable to heterologous immune mechanisms such as trained innate immunity, activation of non-conventional T-cells, and cross-reactive adaptive immunity. Aerosol vaccine delivery can target immune responses toward the primary site of infection for a respiratory pathogen. Therefore, we hypothesised that aerosol delivery of BCG would enhance cross-protective action against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and be a deployable intervention against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Immune parameters were monitored in vaccinated and unvaccinated rhesus macaques for 28 days following aerosol BCG vaccination. High-dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge was applied by intranasal and intrabronchial instillation and animals culled 6C8 days later for assessment of viral, disease, and immunological parameters. Mycobacteria-specific cell-mediated immune responses were detected following aerosol BCG vaccination, but SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular- and antibody-mediated immunity was only measured following challenge. Early secretion of cytokine and chemokine markers associated with the innate cellular and adaptive antiviral immune response was detected following SARS-CoV-2 challenge in vaccinated animals, at concentrations that exceeded titres measured in unvaccinated macaques. Classical CD14+ monocytes and V2 æ T-cells quantified by whole-blood immunophenotyping increased rapidly in vaccinated animals following SARS-CoV-2 challenge, indicating a priming of innate immune cells and non-conventional T-cell populations. However, viral RNA quantified in nasal and pharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and tissue samples collected at necropsy was equivalent in vaccinated and unvaccinated animals, and in-life CT imaging and histopathology scoring applied to pulmonary tissue sections indicated that the disease induced by SARS-CoV-2 challenge was comparable between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. Hence, aerosol BCG vaccination did not induce, or enhance the induction of, SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive adaptive cellular or humoral immunity, although an influence of BCG vaccination on the subsequent immune response to SARS-CoV-2 challenge was apparent in immune signatures indicative of trained innate immune mechanisms and primed unconventional T-cell populations. Nevertheless, aerosol BCG vaccination did not enhance the initial clearance of virus, nor reduce the occurrence of early disease pathology after high dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge. However, the heterologous immune mechanisms primed by BCG vaccination could contribute to the moderation of COVID-19 disease severity in more susceptible species following natural infection.","output":"Influence of Aerosol Delivered BCG Vaccination on Immunological and Disease Parameters Following SARS-CoV-2 Challenge in Rhesus Macaques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study determined the psychometric validation of the English version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S).

Incidence estimates were pooled by using random effects meta-analyses. Heterogeneity was evaluated by using the I2 statistic, and publication bias was assessed by using the Begg and Egger tests. RESULTS: The pooled incidence was 17.0% (95% CI, 13.4-20.9) for VTE, 12.1% (95% CI, 8.4-16.4) for DVT, 7.1% (95% CI, 5.3-9.1) for pulmonary embolism (PE), 7.8% (95% CI, 2.6-15.3) for bleeding, and 3.9% (95% CI, 1.2-7.9) for major bleeding. In subgroup meta-analyses, the incidence of VTE was higher when assessed according to screening (33.1% vs 9.8% by clinical diagnosis), among patients in the ICU (27.9% vs 7.1% in the ward), in prospective studies (25.5% vs 12.4% in retrospective studies), and with the inclusion of catheter-associated thrombosis/isolated distal DVTs and isolated subsegmental PEs. The highest pooled incidence estimate of bleeding was reported for patients receiving intermediate- or full-dose anticoagulation (21.4%) and the lowest in the only prospective study that assessed bleeding events (2.7%).

Here we introduce NanoSPC, a scalable, portable and cloud compatible pipeline for analyzing Nanopore sequencing data. NanoSPC can identify potentially pathogenic viruses and bacteria simultaneously to provide comprehensive characterization of individual samples. The pipeline can also detect single nucleotide variants and assemble high quality complete consensus genome sequences, permitting high-resolution inference of transmission. We implement NanoSPC using Nextflow manager within Docker images to allow reproducibility and portability of the analysis. Moreover, we deploy NanoSPC to our scalable pathogen pipeline platform, enabling elastic computing for high throughput Nanopore data on HPC cluster as well as multiple cloud platforms, such as Google Cloud, Amazon Elastic Computing Cloud, Microsoft Azure and OpenStack.

Complications associated with extracranial-intracranial bypass surgeries are ischemic strokes caused by bypass failure, wound-healing disorders, and further issues from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. CSF leakage can provide pathways for infection. It is well known in general neurosurgery that watertight closure of the dura mater is necessary to prevent such complications. OBJECTIVE To provide a technical description of TachoSil dural reconstruction in standard STA-MCA bypasses and their follow-up analyses. METHODS In this technical report with observational follow-up, the dura mater was closed partially by adaptive sutures, and the perforation site of the donor vessel was sealed with TachoSil. TachoSil is a collagen sponge covered with clotting factors that provides hemostatic and sealing effects. RESULTS Our study included eight cases of standard STA-MCA bypasses that had been operated between July 2015 and September 2016. Follow-up examinations were completed for all patients at 1 month and 6 months after surgery. Duplex and Doppler ultrasound demonstrated regular bypass patency in all patients without increased flow velocity at the perforation sites, which is a possible sign of stenosis. No wound-healing disorders or CSF leakage occurred. No cerebrovascular stroke events were observed. CONCLUSION Duraplasty with TachoSil enables the elastic reconstruction of the dura perforation gap in standard extracranial-intracranial bypass surgeries.","output":"TachoSil Dural Reconstruction in Extracranial-Intracranial Bypass Surgeries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the situation of lockdown implemented because of the COVID-19 virus, there is a need to study the sociodemographic variables and risk factors associated with psychological problems and greater difficulty with adapting to the situation, which could in turn help in the development of psychological treatment offered during and after isolation.

On the contrary, remdesivir, though its FDA approval, and favipiravir are least likely to benefit COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we recommend that the RECOVERY dexamethasone should only be considered for critical hospitalized COVID-19 patients and we urge physicians in developing countries to avoid using it in mild-moderate COVID-19 cases.

Historical, practical and theoretical reasons for this exclusion continue to deter some researchers from work with this underserved population. We discuss why these reasons are neither convincing nor ethical, and provide strategies for dealing with practical issues. As part of a randomised controlled trial of an intervention for children with profound autism, we reflected as a multi-disciplinary team on what we had learnt from these children, their families and each other. We provide 10 strategies to overcome what appeared initially to be barriers to collecting data with this population. These hurdles and our solutions are organised by theme: interacting physically with children, how to play and test, navigating difficult behaviours, selecting suitable outcome measures, relating with parents, managing siblings, involving stakeholders, timing interactions, the clinicians role in managing expectations, and recruitment. The aim of this article is to provide researchers with the tools to feel motivated to conduct research with children with profound autism and their families, a difficult but worthwhile endeavour. Many of these lessons also apply to conducting research with non-autistic children with intellectual disabilities. LAY ABSTRACT: Autistic children who speak few or no words or who have an intellectual disability are the most in need of new understandings and treatments, but the most often left out of the research that can bring these benefits. Researchers perceive difficulties around compliance with instructions, testing, challenging behaviours and family stress. Although research with these children can indeed be difficult, their continuing exclusion is unethical and unacceptable. Drawing on our experiences testing a possible treatment for children with profound autism, we provide 10 practical guidelines related to (1) interacting physically, (2) combining play and testing, (3) responding to challenging behaviour, (4) finding suitable tests, (5) relationships with parents, (6) relationships with siblings, (7) involving stakeholders, (8) planning the testing times, (9) the role of the clinical supervisor and (10) recruiting and retaining participants. We hope that these guidelines will prepare and embolden other research teams to work with profoundly autistic children, ending their historical exclusion from research. These guidelines also could be useful for conducting research with children with intellectual disabilities.","output":"Overcoming hurdles to intervention studies with autistic children with profound communication difficulties and their families"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, mankind is fighting against an invisible enemy. The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been spreading at a rapid rate across the world, which made the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it as pandemic disease. COVID-19 is an acute respiratory tract infection that was first reported in December 2019, initially presented as pneumonia of un-known etiology in a group of patients in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. Sometimes, animals infected with coronavirus infect humans and spread further via human-to-human transmission similar to the case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously referred to as 2019-nCoV (COVID-19). SARS--CoV-2 is an extremely pathogenic virus and is crushing the well-equipped health systems of devel-oped countries. According to the WHO situation report updated on October 25, 2020 over 42 million cases and 1.1 million deaths have been reported globally. Since the figure of cases continues to increase, these viruses create a threat to global public health. This review summarizes an overview of the study of the novel coronavirus, including origin, epidemiology, etiology, targets for viral en-try, and describes the clinical manifestation, diagnosis, and therapeutics used in clinical settings. Furthermore, our review focuses on the most up-to-date clinical information for the effective man-agement, prevention, and counseling to control COVID-19 worldwide. ? 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.","output":"Understanding the dynamics of covid-19 outbreak: Structure, diagno-sis, prevention and treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Repurposing of approved antiviral drugs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a promising strategy to treat Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Previously we reported our hypothesis that the antiviral drugs with high lung distributions might benefit COVID-19 patients by reducing viral loads. So far, chloroquine, lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, favipiravir, ribavirin, darunavir, remdesivir, and umifenovir have been tested in COVID-19 clinical trials. Here we validated our hypothesis by comparing the pharmacokinetics profiles of these drugs and their capabilities of reducing viral load in clinical trials. According to bulk RNA and single cell RNA sequencing analysis, we found that high expression of both angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) makes the lung and intestine vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and favipiravir, which were highly distributed to the lung, were reported to reduce viral loads in respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients. Conversely, drugs with poor lung distributions, including lopinavir/ritonavir, umifenovir and remdesivir, were insufficient to inhibit viral replication. Lopinavir/ritonavir might inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the GI tract according to their distribution profiles. We concluded here that the antiviral drugs should be distributed straight to the lung tissue for reducing viral loads in respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients. Additionally, to better evaluate antiviral effects of drugs that target the intestine, the stool samples should also be collected for viral RNA test in the future.","output":"Tissue distributions of antiviral drugs affect their capabilities of reducing viral loads in COVID-19 treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The nature and timing of the host immune response during infections remain uncertain and most knowledge is derived from critically ill sepsis patients. We aimed to test the hypothesis that community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with concurrent immune suppression and systemic inflammation. METHODS: Blood was collected from 79 CAP patients within 24 h after hospitalization and 1 month after discharge; 42 age- and sex-matched subjects without acute infection served as controls. Blood leukocytes were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Klebsiella pneumoniae, and cytokines were measured in supernatants. Fifteen plasma biomarkers reflective of key host response pathways were compared between CAP patients with the strongest immune suppression (lowest 25% blood leukocyte tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- production in response to LPS) and those with the least immune suppression (highest 25% of LPS-induced TNF- production). RESULTS: Blood leukocytes of CAP patients (relative to control subjects) showed a reduced capacity to release TNF-, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and IL-10 upon stimulation with LPS or K. pneumoniae, with a concurrently enhanced ability to release the anti-inflammatory mediator IL-1 receptor antagonist, irrespective of the presence of sepsis (18.9% of cases). Low (relative to high) TNF- producers displayed higher plasma levels of biomarkers reflecting systemic inflammation, neutrophil degranulation, endothelial cell activation, a disturbed vascular barrier function and coagulation activation. CONCLUSION: CAP replicates a common feature of immune suppression in sepsis. The coexistence of immune suppression and hyperinflammation in CAP argues against the theory of two distinct phases during the host response to sepsis.","output":"Concurrent Immune Suppression and Hyperinflammation in Patients With Community-Acquired Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to analyse the survival of patients admitted to Brazilian hospitals due to the COVID-19 and estimate prognostic factors.

METHODS: Our institution hosted 25 students for 4-week VSI rotations. We held two sessions, one in July 2020 and another in August 2020. The students participated in a curriculum centered around Zoom? and phone interactions with residents and faculty. The curriculum included selected readings, surgical videos, group didactics and 1-on-1 mentorship. Anonymous pre-rotation and post-rotation self-assessments were used to ascertain achievement of learning objectives and utility of educational tools implemented during the rotation. Faculty and resident mentors were also surveyed to assess their experience. RESULTS: With the exception of knot tying techniques (p=0.67), students reported significant improvement in their understanding vascular surgery concepts after the virtual elective (p < 0.05). The highest ranked components of the course were interpersonal including interaction with faculty, mentorship, and learning the program culture. The lowest ranked components of the course were simulation training and research opportunities. Rating of utility for aspects of the course were consistent with ranking of components, with faculty interaction having the highest average rating. The ideal number of hours for daily virtual interaction reported by students ranged from 3 to 6 with a median of 4. Overall, the majority of mentors were satisfied with virtual course. However, they did report limited ability to assess student personality and fit for the program. The number of hours per week spent by mentors on the virtual vascular surgery rotation ranged from 2 to 7 with a median of 4. Fourteen out of seventeen mentors reported that having a virtual student was significant addition to their existing workload. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our student and mentor feedback were positive. Several challenges inherent to the virtual environment still need to be refined, however the goals of a VSI are distinct and should be explored by training programs.

METHODS: Using cross-sectional data from the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series, collected between March 29 and April 3, 2020, among Canadian adults (N=4455), we assessed prevalence of not working from home, social distancing in public, or practicing frequent handwashing, according to age, sex, marital status, immigration, education, chronic disease presence, and source of COVID-19 information. Multivariate regression, population attributable fraction estimation, and generalized product mediation analysis were applied. RESULTS: Absence of frequent handwashing and distancing was more common among those working outside than within the home (prevalence differences of 7% (95% CI: 4, 10) and 7% (95% CI: 3, 10), respectively). Inequalities in handwashing and distancing were observed across education and immigration status. Over 40% of the prevalence of non-uptake of handwashing and distancing was attributable to populations not being able to work from home. If all worked from home, over 40% (95% CI: 8, 70) of education-based inequalities in handwashing and distancing could be eliminated, but differences by immigration status would likely remain.

We adapted an established cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) intervention as an online version for use during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) crisis. Methods: Development and adaptation procedure of the internet-based CBT-I (iCBT-I) prevention and early intervention training is described. Sessions and topics are shown in detail. The Online Sleep Prevention and Treatment Acceptance questionnaire (OSTA) and the Online Sleep Prevention and Treatment Feedback questionnaire (OSTF) were used to assess acceptance. Sleep problems of university staff members were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire (PSQI). Results: The online-adapted version consisted of seven modules. Contents of sessions and topics were implemented based on video clips. Drawings were added to information regarding sleep and sleep hygiene as well as addressing stress and cognitions. In all, 15 individuals participated in this pilot study. The new iCBT-I self-learning prevention training was well accepted.

The global burden of food-borne diseases for 31 selected hazards was estimated by the World Health Organization at 33 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2010 with 40% of this burden concentrated among children under 5 years of age. The highest burden per population of food-borne diseases is found in Africa, followed by Southeast Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean sub-regions. Unsafe water used for the cleaning and processing of food is a key risk factors contributing to food-borne diseases. The role of quality and quantity of water to the general burden of infectious diseases deserves attention, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, as its effects go beyond the food chain. Water-related infectious diseases are a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, and climate change effects will exacerbate the challenges for the public health sector for both food-borne and water-borne diseases. Selected case studies from Africa and Asia show that (i) climate change extreme events, such as floods, may exacerbate the risks for infectious diseases spreading through water systems, and (ii) improvements related to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene could result in a significant reduction of intestinal parasitic infections among school-aged children.

This will likely lead to most placebo volunteers crossing over to the vaccine arm, thus complicating the assessment of long term durability. We show how to analyze durability following placebo crossover and demonstrate that the VE profile that would be observed in a placebo controlled trial is recoverable in a trial with placebo crossover. This result holds no matter when the crossover occurs and with no assumptions about the form of the efficacy profile. We only require that the VE profile applies to the newly vaccinated irrespective of the timing of vaccination. We develop different methods to estimate efficacy within the context of a proportional hazards regression model and explore via simulation the implications of placebo crossover for estimation of VE under different efficacy dynamics and study designs.

Methods A nationwide cohort study was conducted using the validated Korean national health insurance claim data of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1 and April 8, 2020. Asthma comorbidity was determined using a diagnosis code assigned by the physician and the prescription of asthma-related medications. The clinical course of COVID-19 was classified into three severity grades according to the requirements for oxygen supply and mechanical ventilation. We also evaluated the association of asthma with overall and in-hospital mortality of COVID-19. Results Asthma morbidity was a significant risk factor for severe COVID-19 (grade 2 requiring oxygen supply) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=1.341, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.051?1.711, P=0.018) and grade 3 requiring mechanical ventilation or leading to death (aOR=1.723, 95% CI: 1.230?2.412, P=0.002) multinomial logistic regression adjusting co-risk factors. Asthma was also significantly associated with mortality of COVID-19 (aOR=1.453, 95% CI: 1.015?2.080, P=0.041) and was revealed to have a shorter time to in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 (P<0.001). Patients with recent asthma exacerbation showed more severe COVID-19 of grade 3 (OR=7.371, 95% CI: 2.018?26.924, P=0.003) and higher mortality (OR=9.208, 95% CI: 2.597?32.646, P<0.001) in univariable analysis, but the statistical significance was not found in multivariable analysis.

Seeking remedies for this problem, test positivity was explored between the first 60 to 90 epidemic days in six countries that reported their first COVID-19 case between February and March 2020: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, and Uruguay. Test positivity (TP) is the percentage of test-positive individuals reported on a given day out of all individuals tested the same day. To generate both country-specific and multi-country information, this study was implemented in two stages. First, the epidemiologic data of the country infected last (Uruguay) were analyzed. If at least one TP-related analysis yielded a statistically significant relationship, later assessments would investigate the six countries. The Uruguayan data indicated (i) a positive correlation between daily TP and daily new cases (ra?=a?0.75); (ii) a negative correlation between TP and the number of tests conducted per million inhabitants (TPMI, ra?=a?-0.66); and (iii) three temporal stages, which differed from one another in both TP and TPMI medians (pa?<a?0.01) and, together, revealed a negative relationship between TPMI and TP. No significant relationship was found between TP and the number of active or recovered patients. The six countries showed a positive correlation between TP and the number of deaths/million inhabitants (DMI, ra?=a?0.65, pa?<a?0.01). With one exception -a country where isolation was not pursued-, all countries showed a negative correlation between TP and TPMI (ra?=a?0.74). The temporal analysis of country-specific policies revealed four patterns, characterized by: (1) low TPMI and high DMI, (2) high TPMI and low DMI; (3) an intermediate pattern, and (4) high TPMI and high DMI.

Our work considers the importance of FAFH in the overall economy, and we also consider changes in agricultural production and trade that have occurred because of COVID-19. We gather data on actual changes to these components, as well as similar shocks to non-agricultural sectors, and employ a simulation model to estimate the impacts on gross domestic product (GDP). Results indicate that changes from agriculture due to COVID-19 have had a larger effect on the overall U.S. economy than the share of agriculture in the economy at the beginning of COVID-19. But the non-agricultural shocks still outweigh the impacts from agriculture by a magnitude of 3. Breaking the results down along the components, we find that the loss in FAFH expenditures is the largest contributor to the change in GDP resulting from shocks to agricultural markets and conclude that agricultural production/trade markets have been very resilient during the pandemic.

This paper makes a case for a biocultural approach to pandemics such as COVID-19. It then uses this biocultural framework to examine the anthropogenic dynamics that influenced and continue to shape the COVID-19 pandemic, both during its initial phase and during critical intersections of the pandemic. Through this understanding of biocultural interactions between people, animals and pathogens, a broader societal and political dimension is drawn as a function of population level and international cultures, to reflect on the culturally mediated differential burden of the pandemic. Ultimately, it is argued that a biocultural perspective on infectious disease pandemics will allow for critical reflection on how culture shapes our behaviours at all levels, and how the effects of these behaviours are ultimately foundational to pathogen ecology and evolution.","output":"Sociocultural, behavioural and political factors shaping the COVID-19 pandemic: the need for a biocultural approach to understanding pandemics and (re)emerging pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is an urgent need to identify therapies to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

A significantly higher rate of COVID-19 cases were employed as essential workers (45% vs 19%, p=3x10-11). COVID-19 cases reporting a fever were more likely to require hospitalization (categorized as severe; OR = 4.6 [95% CI: 1.7-13.0, p=0.004]) whereas respondents reporting rhinorrhea was less likely to require hospitalization (categorized as mild-to-moderate; OR = 0.16 [95% CI: 0.04-0.70, p=0.016]).

In this review, we propose a procedure for CPR in the ICU that minimizes the number of personnel in the immediate vicinity of the patient and conserves the use of scarce personal protection equipment (PPE). Highlighting the low likelihood of successful resuscitation in high risk patients may prompt them to decline CPR. We recommend the preemptive placement of central venous lines in high risk patients with intravenous tubing extensions that allow medication delivery from outside the patients rooms. During CPR, this practice can be used to deliver critical medications without delay. The use of a mechanical compression system for CPR further reduces the risk of infectious exposure to health care providers. ECMO should be reserved for patients with few comorbidities and a single failing organ system.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The main outcome was a composite outcome of mortality and orotracheal intubation in subjects with diabetes compared with subjects without diabetes, after adjustment for confounding variables and according to age categories. RESULTS: Diabetes was recorded in 39% of subjects. Main outcome was higher in patients with diabetes, independently of confounding variables (HR 1.13 [1.03-1.24]) and increased with age in individuals without diabetes, from 23% for those <50 to 35% for those >80 years but reached a plateau after 70 in those with diabetes.

In this review, 335 research articles were referred from the popular scientific database (e.g., Scopus and Web of Science) to elaborate on the importance of quercetin in addressing human ailments and the health-protective role imparted. Being a valuable bioactive compound within the circular economy context, the source for obtaining quercetin has been extended for food industrial wastes/byproducts (mainly of fresh produce). Further, the establishment of the molecular mechanism, antioxidant potential, oxidative stress, metabolic process, myocardial damage, anti neurogenerative potential, enzymatic expression, and ROS inhibition renders quercetin an ideal phytochemical that can provide protective benefits against cardiac and neurodegenerative diseases. ABSTRACT: Quercetin, a bioactive secondary metabolite, holds incredible importance in terms of bioactivities, which has been proved by in vivo and in vitro studies. The treatment of cardiovascular and neurological diseases by quercetin has been extensively investigated over the past decade. Quercetin is present naturally in appreciable amounts in fresh produce (fruits and vegetables). However, today, corresponding to the growing population and global demand for fresh fruits and vegetables, a paradigm shift and focus is laid towards exploring industrial food wastes and/or byproducts as a new resource to obtain bioactive compounds such as quercetin. Based on the available research reports over the last decade, quercetin has been suggested as a reliable therapeutic candidate for either treating or alleviating health issues, mainly those of cardiovascular and neurological diseases. In the present review, we have summarized some of the critical findings and hypotheses of quercetin from the available databases foreseeing its future use as a potential therapeutic agent to treat cardiovascular and neurological diseases. It is anticipated that this review will be a potential reference material for future research activities to be undertaken on quercetin obtained from fresh produce as well as their respective processing wastes/byproducts that rely on the circular concept.","output":"Quercetin: A Bioactive Compound Imparting Cardiovascular and Neuroprotective Benefits: Scope for Exploring Fresh Produce, Their Wastes, and By-Products"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stressful events can cause a significant impact on education;however, it is not yet clear how the interplay between anxiety, work, and social dysfunction relates to learning impairments.

We collected data from 28 Psychology undergraduate students at the University of S?o Paulo, Brazil. We used pre- and post-test multiple-choice questions to obtain a quantitative measure of learning. Students completed an online survey to report demographic information, functional impairment (Work and Social Adjustment scale;WSAS), generalized anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale;GAD-7), coronavirus anxiety (Brazilian adapted version of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale;CAS-BR), and self-perception with the remote lectures methodology. In our sample, 42.9% of respondents experienced symptoms of generalized anxiety disorders (GAD-7  15), and 53.6% had moderate to severe functional impairment (WSAS >20). We also observed an overlapping profile of highly anxious and dysfunctional students. A chi-square test of independence revealed a relation between pairs of multiple-choice questions answers and GAD-7 scores, indicating that less anxious students were more likely to perform better in pairs of pre- and post-tests. Intriguingly, the correlational analysis suggested that students with moderate to severe functional impairment (WSAS scores >20) were less likely to change from an incorrect to a correct answer to pairs of pre- and post-tests. This data suggests that psychological distress and anxiety states might influence students ability to coordinate social and work activities and performance during remote learning.

Significant changes were observed across time on several edges. Greater connectivity between the affective and social isolation nodes at lockdown was observed. Depression symptoms have become more tightly coupled across individuals, and so were the anxiety symptoms. Depression symptoms have also become slightly decoupled from those of anxiety.

METHODS: This is a retrospective multicenter cross-sectional study evaluating medical consultations, urgent hospitalizations, and deaths in S?o Paulo, the largest city of the Americas. Changes in the medical visit profile according to demographic data and diagnoses were assessed. The change in mortality was also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 462,412 emergency medical visits were registered from January 2019 to July 2020. Of these emergency medical visits, only 4.7% (21,653) required hospitalization. Of all visits, 592 resulted in deaths, equivalent to 0.1% of the sample.

The search terms we used were \\"COVID -19 and encephalitis, encephalopathy, neuroimaging or neuroradiology\\" and \\"SARS-CoV-2 and encephalitis, encephalopathy, neuroimaging or neuroradiology\\". Results: Neuroimaging abnormalities are common in old age and patients with comorbidities. Neuroimaging abnormalities are largely vascular in origin. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy results in large vessel occlusion and cerebral venous thrombosis. COVID-19-associated intracerebral hemorrhage resembles anticoagulant associated intracerebral hemorrhage. On neuroimaging, hypoxic-ischemic damage along with hyperimmune reaction against the SARS-COV-2 virus manifests as small vessel disease. Small vessel disease appears as diffuse leukoencephalopathy and widespread microbleeds, and subcortical white matter hyperintensities. Occasionally, gray matter hyperintensity, similar to those observed seen in autoimmune encephalitis, has been noted. In many cases, white matter lesions similar to that in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis have been described. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in COVID-19 seems to be a parainfectious event and autoimmune in origin. Many cases of acute necrotizing encephalitis resulting in extensive damage to thalamus and brain stem have been described; cytokine storm has been considered a pathogenic mechanism behind this.

Methods: A cross sectional descriptive study was undertaken among low-income earners in South Western Uganda. Data were collected from two hundred and fifty-three (253) participants using a structured closed ended questionnaire. Anxiety, anger and depression were assessed using a modified generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7), Spielbergers State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 (STAXI-2) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) item tools respectively. Result: Most respondents were single male individuals with secondary level. Respondents with tertiary level of education and those with partners had higher score (71.7% and 70.28% respectively) for awareness on mental healthcare. Respondents with primary education level and individuals that were single had higher score (46.98% and 43.72% respectively) for anxiety. Respondents with primary education level and those living with partners had higher mean score (56.44% and 56.21% respectively) for anger. Respondents with no formal education and those who had lost partners had higher mean score (32.11% and 30.50% respectively) for depression. Individuals without formal educational and primary education were observed to have a negative correlation (r 2 = 47.4 and 6.4% respectively) with awareness on mental healthcare, and the no formal group had positive correlation with anger and depression (r 2 =1.9 and 0.3% respectively), while other groups were negatively correlated (r 2 =10.1%).

We investigated students' perspectives on Q fever prevention using a One Health approach combining animal, human and environmental health. Animal science and veterinary students enrolled at the University of Adelaide in 2019 were invited to participate in an online survey to explore their perceptions about Q fever and prevention strategies. We undertook descriptive analysis and logistic regression. Overall, 46% of students reported little to no knowledge of Q fever. Over three-quarters of students reported transmission of Q fever via aerosol inhalation and animal culling, whilst other modes including sexual transmission between humans (7%) was poorly identified. The majority of students reported exposure to cattle, sheep and goats. Of those who reported vaccination status, 5% veterinary and 61% animal science students were unvaccinated for Q fever. Challenges concerning vaccination included cost, time and access to healthcare with strategies aimed at promoting awareness, improving healthcare access and subsidized and mass vaccination. Knowledge of Q fever among respondents, particularly about disease transmission was suboptimal. As a key principle to One Health approach, adherence to biosecurity guidelines during contact with animals could potentially reduce zoonoses including Q fever transmission. Improving access to Q fever vaccine for unvaccinated students is a priority. Findings underscore that university policy for Q fever vaccination needs to consider subsidized vaccination for both animal science and veterinary students.","output":"Q fever vaccination: Australian animal science and veterinary students' One Health perspectives on Q fever prevention."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the present study was to understand if the course of the disease of patients suffering from dust mite allergy could have been negatively affected by the COVID-19 restrictions, which have been certainly important to fight the pandemic, but forced patients to stay at home for a long time.","output":"COVID-19: When dust mites and lockdown create the perfect storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hizentra? (IGSC 20 %) is a 20 % liquid IgG product approved for subcutaneous administration in adults and children 2 years of age and older who have primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD). There is limited information about the use of IGSC 20 % in very young children including those less than 5 years of age. METHODS: A retrospective chart review involved 88 PIDD infants and children less than 5 years of age who received Hizentra?. RESULTS: The mean age at the start of Hizentra? was 34 months (range 2 to 59 months). IGSC 20 % was administered weekly to 86 infants (two additional infants received twice weekly and three times weekly infusions, respectively) and included an average of 63 infusions (range 6C182) for an observation period up to 45.5 months. Infusion by manual delivery occurred in 15 patients. The mean dose was 674 mg/kg/4 weeks. The mean IgG level was 942 mg/dL while on IGSC 20 %, compared to a mean trough IgG level of 794 mg/dL (p < 0.0001) during intravenous or subcutaneous IgG administration prior to IGSC 20 %. Average infusion time was 47 (range 5C120) minutes, and the median number of infusion sites was 2 (range 1C4). Local reactions were mostly mild and observed in 36/88 (41 %) children. No serious adverse events were reported. A significant increase in weight percentile (7 %  19.2, p = 0.0012) among subjects was observed during IGSC 20 % administration.

Using the experience from a high-volume health system in New York City, we aimed to describe patterns of care after resumption of elective TJA. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 7,699 TJAs performed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Perioperative characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared between TJAs based on time period of performance: 1) pre-pandemic (PP, June 8th - December 8th, 2019), 2) initial period post-resumption of elective surgeries (IR, June 8th - September 8th, 2020), and 3) later period post-resumption (LR, September 9th - December 8th, 2020). RESULTS: LOS >2 days (83%, 67%, 70% for PP, IR, LR periods respectively) and discharge rates to post-acute care (PAC) facilities were lower during the pandemic periods (OR(IR vs. PP): 0.48, 95% CI: 0.40 - 0.59, p < 0.001; OR(LR vs. PP): 0.63, 95% CI: 0.53 - 0.75, p < 0.001). Compared to the pre-pandemic period, the risk for 30-day readmission was lower during the IR period (OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.40 - 0.98, p = 0.041) and similar during the LR period (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.65 - 1.41, p = 0.832). CONCLUSIONS: Despite decreased LOS and discharge to PAC for TJAs performed during the pandemic, 30-day readmissions did not increase. Given the increased costs and lack of superior functional outcomes associated with discharge to PAC, these findings suggest that discharge to PAC facilities need not return to pre-pandemic levels.","output":"Comparison of Total Joint Arthroplasty Care Patterns Prior to the Covid-19 Pandemic and After Resumption of Elective Surgery During the Covid-19 Outbreak: A Retrospective, Large Urban Academic Center Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The notion that the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may lead to adverse outcomes upon acquisition of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) should be discredited with a review of the real-life evidence.

Here, we examined subsequent disease activity and flares among SLE patients who received teleconsultation vs in-person consultation. To discern differences in physicians prescription behaviour during both forms of consultations, we compared corticosteroid dose adjustments. METHODS: We studied adult SLE patients who were seen between 1 February 2020 and 1 February 2021. At each patient-visit, rheumatologists utilized phone/video teleconsultation or physical consultation at their discretion. Disease activity was assessed with SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) and flares were defined by the SELENA-SLEDAI Flare Index (SFI). We derived a propensity score for patients who were chosen for physical consultation. Multivariable generalized estimation equations were used to analyse SLEDAI-2k and flare at the next visit, adjusted for the propensity score. RESULTS: A total of 435 visits were recorded, of which 343 (78.9%) were physical visits and 92 (21.1%) were teleconsultations. The modality of consultation did not predict flare [OR for physical consultation (95% CI) 0.42 (0.04, 5.04), P =0.49] or SLEDAI-2k at the next visit [estimate of coefficient for physical consultation (95% CI) ?0.19 (?0.80, 0.43), P =0.55].

METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats (120  10 g) were classified as control received the vehicle, C. aronia (200 mg/kg), and C. aronia (2,000 mg/kg)-treated rats. After treatments for consecutive 7 days, hematological and molecular experiments were conducted to detect alterations in platelet aggregation, thromboxane B2 (THXB2) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) content; protein levels of P2Y12, p-Akt, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), phosphorylated vasodilator-stimulated-phosphoprotein (p-VASP), nuclear factor &#954;B (NF-&#954;B), P-selectin, and etc. in platelets were determined by Western blot; mRNA expressions of P2Y12 and some inflammatory markers were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: At a concentration of 200 mg/kg, C. aronia inhibited platelet aggregation through multiple interconnected mechanisms including downregulation P2Y12 synthesis and expression, stimulating intracellular cAMP levels and protein levels of p-VASP, inhibiting platelets THXB2 release and protein levels of P-selectin. Also, it inhibited platelets level of ROS and of NF-&#954;B, a major signaling pathway that stimulates the expression of P2Y12 and THXA2 synthesis. Opposite findings were seen in platelets of rats received C. aronia at a concentration of 2,000 mg/kg. Interestingly, co-administration of N-acetylcysteine prevented all hematological and molecular alterations exerted by the high dose of the extract and inhibited platelet aggregation. CONCLUSION: Oral administration of C. aronia at low dose inhibits platelet aggregation by reducing THXB2 release, expression of P-selectin and activating cAMP and Akt signaling through two major mechanisms including downregulation of P2Y12 and inhibition of ROS-induced activation of NF-&#954;B, an effect that is observed to be in the opposite direction with its high dose.","output":"Opposite Modulatory Effects of Crataegus aronia Aqueous Extract on Platelet Aggregation in Rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background This study aimed to describe the population at risk of severe COVID-19 due to underlying health conditions across the United Kingdom in 2019.

A total of 434 HIV mono-infected and 143 TB/ HIV co-infected patients were randomly selected for the study. The data were collected using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. The health-related quality of life of patients was measured using the World Health Organization quality of life HIV instrument which contains physical, psychological, social relationships, environmental, level of independence, and spiritual domains. The validated version of the Kessler scale was used to assess depressive symptoms. Linear regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the outcome variables, and a p-value < 0.05 with 95% CI was used to measure the degree of association between health-related quality of life and independent variables. RESULTS: The mean scores of health-related quality of life among HIV mono-infected patients in terms of thephysical, psychological, level of independence, social relationships, environmental, and spiritual health domains were 63.9, 65.0, 60.5, 59.0, 56.4, and 63.9, respectively; whereas the mean scores among TB/HIV co-infected patients were 46.6, 48.5, 42.7, 43.5, 39.3, and 51.3, respectively.

We sought to determine whether racial and insurance based disparities existed in the treatment of carotid artery stenosis. METHODS Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, hospitalizations for carotid artery stenting and carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis from 2005 to 2011 were identified. We calculated (2) tests, and bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were fit to assess differences in the characteristics of patients receiving carotid revascularization for asymptomatic compared with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Demographic characteristics studied included race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander) and primary payer status (Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, self-pay and no charge). RESULTS Between 2005 and 2011, 890 680 patients underwent carotid revascularization for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis (92.1% asymptomatic and 7.9% symptomatic). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that Medicaid (OR=0.87, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.92, p<0.0001) and self-pay patients (OR=0.48, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.51, p<0.0001) had a lower odds of being revascularized for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis compared with private insurance patients.

CONCLUSIONS Minorities and self-pay/Medicaid patients were less likely to receive carotid revascularization when asymptomatic-rather they were more likely to have treatment only after symptoms had developed.

Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is associated with adverse neurodevelopment. Individualized management utilizing targeted neonatal echocardiography (TnECHO) may enhance care. METHODS: We evaluated the influence of TnECHO programs on cardiovascular practices in HIE/TH patients utilizing a 77-item REDCap survey. Nominated representatives of TnECHO (n = 19) or non-TnECHO (n = 96) sites were approached. RESULTS: Seventy-one (62%) sites responded. Baseline neonatal intensive care unit characteristics and HIE volume were comparable between groups. Most centers monitor invasive blood pressure; however, we identified 17 unique definitions of hypotension. TnECHO centers were likelier to trend systolic/diastolic blood pressure and request earlier echocardiography. TnECHO responders were less likely to use fluid boluses; TnECHO responders more commonly chose an inotrope first-line, while non-TnECHO centers used a vasopressor. For HRF, TnECHO centers chose vasopressors with a favorable pulmonary vascular profile. Non-TnECHO centers used more dopamine and more extracorporeal membrane oxygen for patients with HRF. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular practices in neonates with HIE differ between centers with and without TnECHO. Consensus regarding the definition of hypotension is lacking and dopamine use is common. The merits of these practices among these patients, who frequently have comorbid pulmonary hypertension and RV dysfunction, need prospective evaluation. IMPACT: Cardiovascular care following HIE while undergoing therapeutic hypothermia varies between centers with access to trained hemodynamics specialists and those without. Because cardiovascular dysfunction is associated with brain injury, precision medicine-based care may be an avenue to improving outcomes.

To cope with this shortage, the government introduced a severity scoring system for patients with COVID-19 and designed a new type of quarantine facility for treating and isolating patients with mild symptoms out of the hospital, namely, the Residential Treatment Center (RTC). A patient with mild symptoms was immediately isolated in the RTC and continuously monitored to detect changes in symptoms. If the symptoms aggravate, the patient was transferred to a hospital. RTCs were designed by creating a quarantine environment in existing lodging facilities capable of accommodating > 100 individuals. The facilities were entirely divided into a clean zone (working area) and contaminated zone (patient zone), separating the space, air, and movement routes, and the staff wore level D personal protective equipment (PPE) in the contaminated zone. The staffs consisted of medical personnel, police officers, soldiers, and operation personnel, and worked in two or three shifts per day. Their duty was mainly to monitor the health conditions of quarantined patients, provide accommodations, and regularly collect specimens to determine if they can be released. For the past two months, RTCs secured approximately 4,000 isolation rooms and treated approximately 3,000 patients with mild symptoms and operated stably without additional spread of the disease in and out of the centers.

The simulation results show the effect of these parameters, and their role in spreading the COVID-19. The results also show that by keeping a high medication factor and a low contact factor, the spreading of COVID-19 will slow down. The medication health factor depends on the infrastructure of a country, and it is difficult to improve it instantly. On the other hand, the contact factor can be easily controlled. Enforcing the physical social distancing, drastically decreases the contact factor. Hence, slow down the spreading of the virus.

The current study was designed to select NS3 and NS5A antigenic sites, amplified, cloned, and expressed in order to find out better assays for diagnosis or drug and vaccine development. The antigenic sites within NS3 and NS5A genes were selected and confirmed through sequencing and were cloned. The antigenic recombinant proteins were expressed in bacterial strain E. coli BL21ply*, and the expression was confirmed by western blotting by using gene-specific and vector-specific antibodies.

We show that the QML estimator performs consistently when the covariance matrix of the pre- or post-break factor loading, or both, is singular. When the loading matrix undergoes a rotational type of change while the number of factors remains constant over time, the QML estimator incurs a stochastically bounded estimation error. In this case, we establish an asymptotic distribution of the QML estimator. The simulation results validate the feasibility of this estimator when used in finite samples.

The epidemiological and clinical data were compared between non-T2DM and T2DM or between survivors and non-survivors. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to explore the effect of T2DM and complications on in-hospital death. RESULTS: A total of 1105 inpatients with COVID-19, 967 subjects with without T2DM (n=522 male, 54.0%) and 138 subjects with pre-existing T2DM (n=82 male, 59.4%) were included for baseline characteristics analyses. The complications were also markedly increased in patients with pre-existing T2DM, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (48.6% vs 32.3%, p<0.001), acute cardiac injury (ACI) (36.2% vs 16.7%, p<0.001), acute kidney injury (AKI) (24.8% vs 9.5%, p<0.001), coagulopathy (24.8% vs 11.1%, p<0.001), and hypoproteinemia (21.2% vs 9.4%, p<0.001). The in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with pre-existing T2DM compared with those without T2DM (35.3% vs 17.4%, p<0.001). Moreover, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with T2DM, ARDS and coagulopathy were the main causes of mortality, with an HR of 7.96 (95% CI 2.25 to 28.24, p=0.001) for ARDS and an HR of 2.37 (95% CI 1.08 to 5.21, p=0.032) for coagulopathy.

A demanding physical environment involves the allocation of additional attentional resources and an increase in psycho-physical stress. This study illustrates the process of a research-intervention aimed at designing a workplace, using a participatory design approach, and considering the beneficial effect of restorative environments in reducing stressful elements and improving well-being at work. Stressful situations occur daily, compromising proper functioning while causing the occurrence of physiological and/or psychological disorders. To be able to safeguard their psycho-physical well-being, people normally adopt coping strategies, i.e., remedies that allow them to cope and manage situations that generate stress. One of these strategies is the exposure to natural environments, which promotes recovery and sustains psycho-physical well-being. The restorative properties of natural environments have been scientifically proven. However, even built spaces can be thought of as restorative environments, in particular when certain conditions are granted. An applied science, known as biophilic design, provides useful indications from this perspective. This project involved 57 employees of the Italian site of an international non-governmental organization, in the transition from a site no longer adequate to a new site requiring renovation. In a first phase, a survey was conducted, to verify the perceived quality of the current workplace and to detect the unmet workers' needs, and to assess some other important psychological constructs connected with perception of restorativeness and well-being.

By reprogramming cellular signaling pathways, viruses encoded protein that can regulate altered control of cell cycle events. Viruses can interact with a superfamily of membrane bound protein, receptor tyrosine kinase to modulate their activity in order to increase virus entrance into cells and promotion of viral replication within the host. Therefore, our study aimed at screening of inhibitors of tyrosine kinase using natural compounds from olive. Protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) is an important factor for cancer progression and can be linked to coronavirus. It is evident that over expression of Protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) enhance viral endocytosis and proliferation and the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors reduced the period of infection period. Functional network studies were carried out using two major PTKs viz. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and B-lymphocytic kinase (BTK). They are associated with coronavirus in regulation of cell signaling proteins for cellular processes. We virtually screened for 161 library of natural compounds from olive found overexpressed in ALK and BTK in metastatic as well as virus host cells. We have employed both ligand and target-based approach for drug designing by high throughput screening using Multilinear regression model based QSAR and docking. The QSAR based virtual screening of 161 olive nutraceutical compounds has successfully identified certain new hit; Wedelosin, in which, the descriptor rsa (ratio of molecular surface area to the solvent accessible surface area) plays crucial role in deciding Wedelosins inhibitory potency.

However, individual studies are usually inconclusive, thus, a comparison of different tests is needed. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv. We used the bivariate method for meta-analysis of diagnostic tests pooling sensitivities and specificities. We evaluated IgM and IgG tests based on Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassays (CLIA), Fluorescence Immunoassays (FIA), and the Lateral Flow Immunoassays (LFIA).

IgG tests perform better compared to IgM ones and show better sensitivity when the samples were taken longer after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, a combined IgG/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody alone.

METHOD: Children with a supracondylar fracture of the humerus (Gartland 2 or 3) were included in this study. Standards from BOAST 11 were selected and the orthopaedic department were audited against these over a period of 2 years. After the first audit cycle, an information booklet was created and distributed to all doctors within the department. At the end of 2020, the department was re-audited, comparing pre-COVID results (2019) with COVID results (2020). RESULTS: Compliance improved within five BOAST 11 domains assessed on re-audit.

Intensive interventions implemented since 2004 have reduced prevalence, but progress has stalled in recent years. A challenge for elimination has been malaria infections in residents acquired during travel to mainland Equatorial Guinea. We quantify how off-island contributes to remaining malaria prevalence on Bioko Island, and investigate the potential role of a pre-erythrocytic vaccine in making further progress towards elimination. Methods: We simulated malaria transmission on Bioko Island using a model calibrated based on data from the Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS) from 2015-2018, including detailed travel histories and malaria positivity by rapid-diagnostic tests (RDTs), as well as geospatial estimates of malaria prevalence. Mosquito population density was adjusted to fit local transmission, conditional on importation rates under current levels of control and within-island mobility. We evaluated the impact of two pre-erythrocytic vaccine distribution strategies: mass treat and vaccinate, and prophylactic vaccination for off-island travelers. We propagated uncertainty through the model through an ensemble of simulations fit to the Bayesian joint posterior probability distribution of the geospatial prevalence estimates. Results: The simulations suggest that in Malabo, an urban city containing 80% of the population, there are some pockets of residual transmission, but a large proportion of prevalence is attributable to malaria importation by travelers. Outside of Malabo, prevalence was mainly attributable to local transmission. We assess the uncertainty in the local transmission vs. importation to be lowest within Malabo and highest outside. Using a pre-erythrocytic vaccine to protect travelers would have larger benefits than using the vaccine to protect residents of Bioko Island from local transmission. In simulations, mass treatment and vaccination had short-lived benefits, as malaria prevalence returned to current levels as the vaccine's efficacy waned. Prophylactic vaccination of travelers resulted in longer-lasting reductions in prevalence. These projections were robust to underlying uncertainty in prevalence estimates. Conclusions: The modeled outcomes suggest that the volume of malaria cases imported from the mainland is a partial driver of continued endemic malaria on Bioko Island, and that continued elimination efforts on must account for human travel activity.","output":"Quantifying malaria acquired during travel and its role in malaria elimination on Bioko Island"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-pharmaceutical interventions to combat COVID-19 transmission have worked to slow the spread of the epidemic but can have high socio-economic costs. It is critical we understand the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions to choose a safe exit strategy. Many current models are not suitable for assessing exit strategies because they do not account for epidemic resurgence when social distancing ends prematurely (e.g., statistical curve fits) nor permit scenario exploration in specific locations. We developed an SEIR-type mechanistic epidemiological model of COVID-19 dynamics to explore temporally variable non-pharmaceutical interventions. We provide an interactive tool and code to estimate the transmission parameter, , and the effective reproduction number, [Formula: see text]. We fit the model to Santa Clara County, California, where an early epidemic start date and early shelter-in-place orders could provide a model for other regions. As of April 22, 2020, we estimate an R(E) of 0.982 (95% CI: 0.849 C 1.107) in Santa Clara County. After June 1 (the end-date for Santa Clara County shelter-in-place as of April 27), we estimate a shift to partial social distancing, combined with rigorous testing and isolation of symptomatic individuals, is a viable alternative to indefinitely maintaining shelter-in-place. We also estimate that if Santa Clara County had waited one week longer before issuing shelter-in-place orders, 95 additional people would have died by April 22 (95% CI: 7 C 283). Given early life-saving shelter-in-place orders in Santa Clara County, longer-term moderate social distancing and testing and isolation of symptomatic individuals have the potential to contain the size and toll of the COVID-19 pandemic in Santa Clara County, and may be effective in other locations.","output":"The impact of long-term non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 epidemic dynamics and control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an essential enzyme for the viral replication process, catalyzing the viral RNA synthesis using a metal ion-dependent mechanism.

Metabolic regulation of body weight centres around the 'body weight set point', which is programmed by energy balance circuitry in the hypothalamus and other specific brain regions. The metabolic body weight set point has a genetic basis, but exposure to an obesogenic environment may elicit allostatic responses and upward drift of the set point, leading to a higher maintained body weight. However, an elevated steady-state body weight may also be achieved without an alteration of the metabolic set point, via sustained hedonic over-eating, which is governed by the reward system of the brain and can override homeostatic metabolic signals. While hedonic signals are potent influences in determining food intake, metabolic regulation involves the active control of both food intake and energy expenditure. When overweight is due to elevation of the metabolic set point ('metabolic obesity'), energy expenditure theoretically falls onto the standard energy-mass regression line. In contrast, when a steady-state weight is above the metabolic set point due to hedonic over-eating ('hedonic obesity'), a persistent compensatory increase in energy expenditure per unit metabolic mass may be demonstrable.

Sixty-five percent reported that they would not receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with lower interactive vaccine literacy score (1.60.8 vs 2.0, p = 0.002), skepticism regarding COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and safety (73.8% vs 38.5%, p < 0.001) and believing that health authorities will not be able to vaccinate the majority of the population (71,2% vs 55.7% p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among cancer patients is high. Mass media campaigns for vaccine promotion should be enhanced. Physicians and health care workers play a key role in increasing acceptance and uptake of COVID-19 vaccine among high risk patients. KEY MESSAGES: Majority of cancer patients were unwilling to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

Due to the time dynamic of antibodies, the antibody concentration of the same patient varies greatly at different times during the course of the disease. Therefore, our study used IgM/T or IgG/T (the ratio of serum antibody concentration to days after symptom onset) to reflect the patient's humoral immune status, and analyzed their correlation with COVID-19 development and outcome. METHODS Clinical data of 50 non-critical COVID-19 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Time-resolved fluorescence immunochromatography was used to quantitatively detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG. Correlation analysis was performed. RESULTS IgM antibody was positive on day 5 of symptom onset, increased within 2 weeks, and then gradually decreased. However, IgG antibody was positive on week 2 of symptom onset and continued to increase since. Additionally, IgM/T, but not IgG/T of recovery period (Spearman =0.17; P=0.283), was negatively correlated with disease course in 2 weeks of symptom onset (Spearman =-0.860; P=0.000). IgG/T of recovery period was positively correlated with clinical classification (Spearman =0.432; P=0.004), number of involved lung lobes (Spearman =0.343; P=0.026), and lung lesions (Spearman =0.472; P=0.002).

Utilizing data mining methods on electronic resources data might provide a better insight into the COVID-19 outbreak to manage the health crisis in each country and worldwide. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to predict the incidence of COVID-19 in Iran. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Google Trends website. Linear regression and long short-term memory (LSTM) models were used to estimate the number of positive COVID-19 cases. All models were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, and root mean square error (RMSE) was used as the performance metric. RESULTS: The linear regression model predicted the incidence with an RMSE of 7.562 (SD 6.492). The most effective factors besides previous day incidence included the search frequency of handwashing, hand sanitizer, and antiseptic topics. The RMSE of the LSTM model was 27.187 (SD 20.705).

METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 individuals attending the Galway-Roscommon Mental Health Services with an International Classification of Diseases diagnosis of an anxiety disorder to determine the impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on anxiety and mood symptoms, social and occupational functioning and quality of life. RESULTS: Twelve (40.0%) participants described COVID-19 restrictions as having a deleterious impact on their anxiety symptoms. Likert scale measurements noted that the greatest impact of COVID-19 related to social functioning (mean = 4.5, SD = 2.9), with a modest deleterious effect on anxiety symptoms noted (mean = 3.8, SD = 2.9). Clinician rated data noted that 8 (26.7%) participants had disimproved and 14 (46.7%) participants had improved since their previous clinical review, prior to commencement of COVID-19 restrictions. Conditions associated with no 'trigger', such as generalised anxiety disorder, demonstrated a non-significant increase in anxiety symptoms compared to conditions with a 'trigger', such as obsessive compulsive disorder.

After the first report of PCV3 infection in the United States, its prevalence was determined in pigs suffering from clinical digestive or respiratory diseases in several other regions, including the Sichuan and Gansu provinces of China. In this study, we describe the frequency of PCV3 detection in Tibetan pigs inhabiting three different provinces surrounding the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. METHODS A total of 316 samples from diarrheic animals and 182 samples from healthy animals were collected in a randomized manner. Conventional PCR was applied for PCV3 DNA detection. The conserved regions of the PCV3 gene were analyzed with MEGA 7.1 software to design specific primers to sequence entire Cap genes in PCV3 strains, and the sequences were then used to confirm the subtypes of PCV3 in the positive samples. Prediction of the amino acid sequences by nucleotide sequence translation was also performed to compare the point mutations in the entire Cap protein. Twenty PCV3 whole-genomic sequences were used for genome phylogenetic analyses of PCV3 and sequence alignments with 22 other reference strains. RESULTS We found that the prevalence of the virus was significantly higher in samples from pigs with diarrhoea than that in samples from healthy pigs. Phylogenetic analysis of Cap proteins demonstrated that the 20 PCV3 strains formed three clades, including PCV3a (8/20, 40.00%), PCV3b (5/20, 25%) and PCV3c (7/20, 35.00%). The complete genome sequence revealed that these strains formed one branch in the phylogenetic tree. Sequence analysis showed that the Cap proteins of the 20 different viral strains shared between 95.84 and 99.18% nucleotide identity. Cap protein sequence analyses showed that the positivity rate of PCV3a was highest in the samples from pigs with diarrhoea. In comparison, PCV3c was the most elevated subtype in the healthy samples. There was no mutation at a specific site in the amino acid sequences of the entire Cap protein from different PCV3 subtype strains from heathy samples. There was a mutation at site 113 in PCV3a, site 129 in PCV3b, and site 116 in PCV3c. CONCLUSION Our present data provide evidence that PCV3 is prevalent in Tibetan pigs at high altitudes in China, and the higher prevalence rates of the PCV3a and PCV3b subtypes in samples from pigs with diarrhoea further indicate that the genotypes should not be neglected during surveys of the pathogenicity of PCV3. Phylogenetic and genetic diversity analyses suggested that the continuous evolution, adaptation and mechanisms of pathogenicity of PCV3 in Tibetan pigs living in this special environment should be further studied.","output":"Molecular detection and phylogenetic analysis of porcine circovirus type 3 in Tibetan pigs on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research investigates the impacts of the novel coronavirus disease, also referred to as COVID-19 pandemic, on the food and beverage industry.

In these patients, the sub-umbilical abdominal and pubic regions are often characterized by redundant skin, creating aesthetic and functional discomfort. Monsplasty is an important step in abdominoplasty or bodylift procedures. We report on an original technique used to correct deformity in the pubic region following weight loss. METHODS All interventions were performed by the same surgeon between April and December 2015. On stretched skin, we drew two lines 5 cm lateral to the median line on both sides and connected them with the arc of a circle placed 7 cm from the vulvar fork. Then, monsplasty marks extend to abdominal fold. During lower abdominal contouring, we performed monsplasty with three separate stitches between the camper fascia and aponeurosis of the abdominal muscle. The aim was to bring tension to the pubic region without additional surgical procedure. RESULTS We report on 21 consecutive cases of monsplasty following lower trunk contouring. No reoperation was performed due to complication or aesthetic demand (no under- or over-correction occurred). No complication (e.g. edema, seroma, disturbance of sensibility) was observed in the pubic area. The results were stable 1 year after surgery. CONCLUSIONS We report on a simple, rapid, and reproducible monsplasty technique for all stages of Pittsburgh classifications, which achieved favorable results with no complication.

METHODS: We conducted a 10-year retrospective analysis of VNS implantations at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Relevant data were collected within 12a?months of VNS implantation and at six months, one, two, and four years after VNS implantation. RESULTS: This analysis included 99 patients ages 0-3 (na?=a?40) and 4-6 (na?=a?59) at first VNS implantation. Eighty-six patients followed up for &#8805;4a?years. There were no significant differences between age at VNS implant (0-3 vs. 4-6) and seizure etiology or most seizure semiologies. Patients took an average of 3.01a?a?1.29 AEDs prior to VNS and 3.84a?a?1.68 AEDs at their latest follow-up. The overall response to VNS therapy (&#8805;50% seizure reduction) at one year, two years, and four years after VNS implantation was 55%, 60%, and 52%, respectively.

A time-dependent Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) model was proposed and applied to fit and then predict the time series of COVID-19 evolution observed over the last three months (up to 3/22/2020) in China. The model results revealed that 1) the transmission, infection and recovery dynamics follow the integral-order SEIR model with significant spatiotemporal variations in the recovery rate, likely due to the continuous improvement of screening techniques and public hospital systems, as well as full city lockdowns in China, and 2) the evolution of number of deaths follows the time FDE, likely due to the time memory in the death toll. The validated SEIR model was then applied to predict COVID-19 evolution in the United States, Italy, Japan, and South Korea. In addition, a time FDE model based on the random walk particle tracking scheme, analogous to a mixing-limited bimolecular reaction model, was developed to evaluate non-pharmaceutical strategies to mitigate COVID-19 spread. Preliminary tests using the FDE model showed that self-quarantine may not be as efficient as strict social distancing in slowing COVID-19 spread. Therefore, caution is needed when applying FDEs to model the coronavirus outbreak, since specific COVID-19 kinetics may not exhibit nonlocal behavior.

Anesthesia machines have been used as alternatives to traditional ICU mechanical ventilators. However, the outcomes for patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure cared for with Anesthesia Machines is currently unknow. We hypothesized that COVID-19 patients receiving care with Anesthesia Machines would have worse outcomes compared to standard practice. METHODS: We designed a retrospective study of patients admitted with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis at a large tertiary urban hospital in northern Italy. Two care units were included: a 27-bed standard ICU and a 15-bed temporary unit emergently opened in an operating room setting. Intubated patients assigned to Anesthesia Machines (AM group) were compared to a control cohort treated with standard mechanical ventilators (ICU-VENT group). Outcomes were assessed at 60-day follow-up. A multivariable Cox regression analysis of risk factors between survivors and non-survivors was conducted to determine the adjusted risk of death for patients assigned to AM group. RESULTS: Complete daily data from 89 mechanically ventilated patients consecutively admitted to the two units were analyzed. Seventeen patients were included in the AM group, whereas 72 were in the ICU-VENT group. Disease severity and intensity of treatment were comparable between the two groups. The 60-day mortality was significantly higher in the AM group compared to the ICU-vent group (12/17 vs. 27/72, 70.6% vs. 37.5%, respectively, p = 0.016). Allocation to AM group was associated with a significantly increased risk of death after adjusting for covariates (HR 4.05, 95% CI: 1.75-9.33, p = 0.001). Several incidents and complications were reported with Anesthesia Machine care, raising safety concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that care associated with the use of Anesthesia Machines is inadequate to provide long-term critical care to patients with COVID-19. Added safety risks must be considered if no other option is available to treat severely ill patients during the ongoing pandemic.

METHODS: Stratified random sampling was adopted to select qualified medical staff from each clinical department of a large general hospital in Shenzhen, China, at a physician-to-nurse ratio of 1:1.5. The medical staff were surveyed using the Distributive Justice Scale, the Organizational Commitment Scale, the Work Engagement Scale, and the Turnover Intention Scale from May to July 2020. Of the 500 medical staff sampled, 480 responded (response rate: 96.00%), and 457 were finally included for analysis (effective response rate: 95.21%).

RESULTS: There were significant positive correlations among distributive justice, organizational commitment, and work engagement and significant negative correlations among distributive justice, organizational commitment, work engagement, and turnover intention. Distributive justice directly and negatively affected the turnover intention of physicians and nurses, but there were occupational differences in the underlying mechanism between distributive justice and turnover intention. Distributive justice indirectly affected turnover intention among physicians mainly through the mediating effect of organizational commitment, and indirectly among nurses through three different pathways: the mediating effect of organizational commitment, the mediating effect of work engagement, and the chain mediating effect of organizational commitment and work engagement.

We showed recently that spinal cord astrocytes in mice lacking RGC-32 display an immature phenotype reminiscent of progenitors and radial glia, with an overall elongated morphology, increased proliferative capacity, and increased expression of progenitor markers when compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts that make them incapable of undergoing reactive changes during the acute phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Here, in order to decipher the molecular networks underlying RGC-32's ability to regulate astrocytic maturation and reactivity, we performed next-generation sequencing of RNA from WT and RGC-32 knockout (KO) neonatal mouse brain astrocytes, either unstimulated or stimulated with the pleiotropic cytokine TGF-?. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that RGC-32 is critical for the TGF-?-induced up-regulation of transcripts encoding proteins involved in brain development and tissue remodeling, such as axonal guidance molecules, transcription factors, extracellular matrix (ECM)-related proteins, and proteoglycans. Our next-generation sequencing of RNA analysis also demonstrated that a lack of RGC-32 results in a significant induction of WD repeat and FYVE domain-containing protein 1 (Wdfy1) and stanniocalcin-1 (Stc1). Immunohistochemical analysis of spinal cords isolated from normal adult mice and mice with EAE at the peak of disease showed that RGC-32 is necessary for the in vivo expression of ephrin receptor type A7 in reactive astrocytes, and that the lack of RGC-32 results in a higher number of homeodomain-only protein homeobox (HOPX)+ and CD133+ radial glia cells.

Because of inadequate imaging follow-up in 12 patients, only 82 lesions were analyzed (CT scans, n = 82; (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans, n = 62). The median follow-up was 25 mo (range, 12-66 mo). A baseline study was defined as (18)F-FDG PET/CT performed no more than 3 mo before RFA. The first postablation scan was defined as PET/CT performed between 1 and 4 mo after RFA; additional follow-up studies were obtained in some cases between 6 and 12 mo after RFA. The unidimensional maximum diameter of the lesion was recorded on a pretherapy diagnostic CT scan or on the CT component of a pretherapy (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan, whichever was obtained most recently, using lung windows. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVs) were recorded for all lesions imaged by (18)F-FDG PET/CT. (18)F-FDG uptake patterns on post-RFA scans were classified as favorable or unfavorable. Survival and recurrence probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Uni- and multivariate analyses were also performed. RESULTS Before RFA, factors predicting greater local recurrence-free survival included initial lesion size less than 3 cm (P = 0.01) and SUV less than 8 (P = 0.02), although the latter was not an independent predictor in multivariate analysis. Treated metastases recurred less often than treated primary lung cancers (P = 0.03). Important post-RFA factors that related to reduced recurrence-free survival included an unfavorable uptake pattern (P < 0.01), post-RFA SUV (P < 0.01), and an increase in SUV over time after ablation (P = 0.05).

However, sediments with a smaller grain size showed higher concentrations than the bigger grain size counterparts for elements such as Fe, S, Cu and As.

Results suggest that the 95th percentile-method was the most appropriate for this type of mountainous systems. Using the selected methodology, three different geochemical backgrounds were calculated: 1) Yerba Loca basin, 2) Molina basin, and 3) Mapocho Upper basin. When the generated background levels were compared with the Consensus-Based (CB) Sediment Quality Guidelines; Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb, Cu, Cr, Ni and As showed background values that were consistently higher than the values set by the CB Threshold Effect Concentration and, even higher than the CB Probable Effect Concentration for Fe (MUBBackground: 6.78 wt% vs CB PEC: 4.00 wt%; and Cu (MUBBacground: 3387 mg kg-1 vs CB PEC: 149 mg kg-1).

Traditionally, screen time has been associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes, and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at increased risk of these outcomes. The primary objectives of this study were to (1) characterize the change in screen time during COVID-19 school closures for children with ASD, and (2) examine the parent perceived impact of screen time on mental health and quality of life of children and their families. Canadian parents and caregivers of children 19 years of age and younger were eligible to participate in an anonymous, online survey study. This survey was available in English, consisted of 28 questions, took ~10-min to complete, and was available for 6 weeks (May 22 through July 6, 2020). The total sample consisted of 414 responses (ASD: n = 127, mean age = 11.7  4.06 years; community sample: n = 287, mean age = 9.4  4.26 years). Seventy-one respondents were missing responses to our primary question and removed from the analyses (final sample n = 344). Compared to the community sample, the ASD group had a significantly higher screen time use before and during the COVID-19 pandemic school closures [weekdays: difference = 1.14 (SE = 0.18), t = 6.56, p < 0.0001; weekends: difference = 1.41 (SE = 0.20), t = 6.93, p < 0.0001]. Mean total screen time during the pandemic was 6.9 h (95% CI 6.49, 7.21) on weekdays and 6.3 h (95% CI 5.91, 6.63) on weekends for the ASD group, and 5.6 h (95% CI 5.28, 5.92) on weekdays and 5.0 h (95% CI 4.70, 5.34) on weekends for the community sample. There was a significant increase in screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to before the pandemic period in the ASD group [weekdays: mean difference = 3.8 h (95% CI 3.35C4.25), p < 0.0001; weekends: mean difference = 1.5 h (95% CI 1.17C1.92), p < 0.0001]. Gender was a significant predictor of parent perceived mental health and quality of life, with male gender associated with a higher likelihood of negative impact [quality of life (child/family) OR = 1.8 (95% CI 1.1C2.9), corrected p = 0.040; mental health OR = 1.9 (95% CI 1.1C3.1), corrected p = 0.0028]. Parents' most frequently endorsed emotions toward screen time were guilt, frustration, and worry. Results of this survey study revealed that children with ASD were less likely to benefit from screen time to cope with social isolation, and screen time resulted in significantly more lost time on social interactions than the community sample, which may exacerbate difficulties in social domains. Given the unprecedented circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and the novel context of technology use, the findings of this study highlight the need for revision of screen time recommendations to reflect the current needs of children and families.","output":"Characterizing Changes in Screen Time During the COVID-19 Pandemic School Closures in Canada and Its Perceived Impact on Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A total of 336 newborn pigs (DNA 241  600, initially 1.75  0.05 kg bodyweight [BW]) from 28 litters were used in a 63-d study evaluating the effects of increasing injectable Fe dose on suckling and subsequent nursery pig performance and blood Fe status. GleptoForte (Ceva Animal Health, LLC., Lenexa, KS) contains gleptoferron which is a Fe macro-molecule complex that is commercially used as an injectable Fe source for suckling piglets. On the day of processing (d 3 after birth), all piglets were weighed and six barrows and six gilts per litter were allotted within sex to 1 of 6 treatments in a completely randomized design. Treatments consisted of a negative control receiving no Fe injection and increasing injectable Fe to achieve either 50, 100, 150, 200 mg, or 200 mg plus a 100 mg injection on d 11 after birth. Pigs were weaned (~21 d of age) and allotted to nursery pens based on BW and corresponding treatment in a completely randomized design. During lactation, increasing injectable Fe up to 100 mg improved (quadratic; P < 0.05) average daily gain (ADG) and d 21 BW with no further improvement thereafter. There was no evidence of differences (P > 0.10) observed between the 200 mg and 200 mg + 100 mg treatments for growth. For the nursery period, increasing Fe dosage increased (linear; P < 0.05) ADG, average daily feed intake (ADFI), and d 42 BW. There was no evidence of differences (P > 0.10) between the 200 mg and 200 mg + 100 mg treatments for nursery growth. For blood criteria, significant treatment  day interactions (P = 0.001) were observed for hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct). The interactions occurred because pigs that had less than 150 mg of injectable Fe had decreased values to d 21 and then increased to d 63 while pigs with 150 or 200 mg of injectable Fe had increased values to d 21 then stayed relatively constant to d 63. In summary, piglet performance during lactation was maximized at 100 mg while nursery growth performance and blood Fe status were maximized with a 200 mg Fe injection at processing. Providing an additional 100 mg of Fe on d 11 of age increased Hb, and Hct values at weaning and 14 d into the nursery but did not provide a growth performance benefit in lactation or nursery. These results indicate that providing 200 mg of injectable Fe provided from GleptoForte is sufficient to optimize lactation and subsequent nursery growth performance and blood Fe status.","output":"Effects of increasing Fe dosage in newborn pigs on suckling and subsequent nursery performance and hematological and immunological criteria."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Neuroinvasion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is well documented and, given the similarities between this virus and SARS-CoV-2, it seems that the neurological impairment that is associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is due to SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion Hypothalamic circuits are exposed to the entry of the virus via the olfactory bulb and interact centrally with crucial respiratory nuclei Hypothalamic microRNAs are considered as potential biomarkers and modulators for various diseases and future therapeutic targets The present study aims to investigate the microRNAs that regulate the expression of hypothalamic angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), essential elements for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry METHODS: To determine potential hypothalamic miRNAs that can directly bind to ACE2 and TMPRSS2, multiple target bioinformatics prediction algorithms were used, including miRBase, Target scan, and miRWalk2 029 RESULTS: Our in silico analysis has revealed that, although there are over 5000 hypothalamic miRNAs, around 31 miRNAs and 29 miRNAs have shown binding sites and strong binding capacity against ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively CONCLUSION: These novel potential hypothalamic miRNAs can be used to identify new therapeutic targets to treat neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients via regulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression","output":"Identification of Novel Hypothalamic MicroRNAs as Promising Therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 by Regulating ACE2 and TMPRSS2 Expression: An In Silico Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Renal involvement is frequent in COVID-19 (4C37%).

Methodology: This study represents a prospective cohort in a public and tertiary university hospital in S?o Paulo, Brazil, during the first 90 days of the COVID-19 pandemic, with patients followed up until the clinical outcome (discharge or death). Results: There were 101 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, of which 51.9% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The overall AKI incidence was 50%; 36.8% had hematuria or proteinuria (66.6% of those with AKI), 10.2% had rhabdomyolysis, and mortality was 36.6%. Of the ICU patients, AKI occurred in 77.3% and the mortality was 65.4%. The mean time for the AKI diagnosis was 6  2 days, and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 3 AKI was the most frequent (58.9%). Acute renal replacement therapy was indicated in 61.5% of patients. The factors associated with AKI were obesity [odds ratio (OR) 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04C2.76, p < 0.05] and the APACHE II score (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.08C2.64, p < 0.05).

Occupational health professionals must deal with these challenges, but it is unclear how well they have been prepared for this task by their academic training programmes. AIMS: To explore content and learning objectives related to these challenges in the curricula of Occupational Medicine (OM) and Occupational Safety, Industrial Hygiene and Ergonomics (OSH), we conducted an online survey among academic leaders of these programmes in universities of several European countries. In addition, related programmes in Human Resource Management (HRM) training were included. METHODS: Selected study programmes were explored in terms of the main topics and learning objectives related to the challenges for promoting good and sustainable work in universities in Europe. The study programmes were identified through contacts with professional associations and a website search. Given the exploratory, non-representative study design, data analysis was limited to description. RESULTS: OM and OSH programmes addressed the above challenges to a very limited extent, except for their disciplinary approach to work-related diseases and injuries. In contrast, HRM programmes were dealing more extensively with globalization, climate change and digitisation. CONCLUSIONS: Significant limitations of knowledge and competences in dealing with the key challenges of the modern world of work were identified.

Examining the holobiont, the question of boundaries and individuality is challenging because it is both an assemblage of organisms with physiological cohesive aspects. I discuss the concept of immunity and the immune system function from the holobiont perspective. Because of the host-microbial close relations of codependence and interdependence, the holobiont is more often than not confused with the host, as the host is the domain in which this entity exists. I discuss the holobiont unique ecological characteristics of microbial assemblages connected to a host in a network of interactions in which the host is one of the organisms in the community but also its landscape. Therefore, I suggest viewing the holobiont as a host-ecosystem and discuss the implication of such a view on the concept of immunity and the meaning of protection. Furthermore, I show that viewing the holobiont as a host ecosystem opens the possibility of using the same ecological definition of boundaries and immunity dealing with an ecological system. Thus, the holobionts boundaries and immunity are defined by the persistence of its complex system of interactions integrating existing and new interactions. This way of thinking presents a notion of immunity that materializes as the result of the complex interdependence relations between the different organisms composing the holobiont similar to that of an ecosystem. Taking this view further, I discuss the notion of immunogenicity that is ontologically heterogeneous with various causal explanations of the processes of tolerance and targeted immune response. Finally, I discuss the possible conceptualization of already existing and new biomedical practices.","output":"The holobiont self: understanding immunity in context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid detection of group A rotavirus was performed by using ImmunoCardStat!

G6PD deficient individuals are at high risk of severe hemolysis when given anti-malarial drugs such as primaquine, quinine, other sulphonamide-containing medicines, and chloroquine, which has recently been shown to be potent for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We evaluated the geographical accessibility to POC testing for G6PD deficiency in Ghana, a malaria-endemic country. Methods: We obtained the geographic information of 100 randomly sampled clinics previously included in a cross-sectional survey. We also obtained the geolocated data of all public hospitals providing G6PD deficiency testing services in the region. Using ArcGIS 10.5, we quantified geographical access to G6PD deficiency screening test and identified clinics as well as visualize locations with poor access for targeted improvement. The travel time was estimated using an assumed speed of 20 km per hour. Findings: Of the 100 clinics, 58% were Community-based Health Planning and Services facilities, and 42% were sub-district health centers. The majority (92%) were Ghana Health Service facilities, and the remaining 8% were Christian Health Association of Ghana facilities. Access to G6PD deficiency screening test was varied across the districts, and G6PD deficiency screening test was available in all eight public hospitals. This implies that the health facility-to-population ratio for G6PD deficiency testing service was approximately 1:159,210 (8/1,273,677) population. The spatial analysis quantified the current mean distance to a G6PD deficiency testing service from all locations in the region to be 34  14 km, and travel time (68  27 min). The estimated mean distance from a clinic to a district hospital for G6PD deficiency testing services was 15  11 km, and travel time (46  33 min). Conclusion: Access to POC testing for G6PD deficiency in Ghana was poor. Given the challenges associated with G6PD deficiency, it would be essential to improve access to G6PD deficiency POC testing to facilitate administration of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine to pregnant women, full implementation of the malaria control program in Ghana, and treatment of COVID-19 patients with chloroquine in malaria-endemic countries.

In severe cases, it can induce cardiovascular disease and even life-threatening. In particular, pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that broke out at the end of 2019 has seriously affected the health of people in all countries. In recent years, it has been treated with the combination of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (such as Reduning injection) and Western medicine, and its mortality has decreased significantly. But their efficacy has not been scientifically and systematically assessed. Accordingly, it is essential to provide a systematized review program to estimate the efficacy and safety of Reduning injection combined with Western medicine to treat pneumonia. METHODS: The following databases are retrieved from start to September 2020: Pubmed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang database, the Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP) databases, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), and other databases, which are absorbed into clinical RCTs of pneumonia using western medicine alone or plus Reduning injections. The selection of studies, data extraction, and assessment of risk of bias will be performed independently by 2 reviewers. At the same time, Review Manager V.5.3.5 (Rev Man V.5.3.5) was used for bias risk assessment and data synthesis. RESULTS: The efficacy and safety of Reduning injection combined with western medicine in the treatment of pneumonia were evaluated in terms of overall effective rate, the patient's antipyretic time, antitussive time, rales disappearing time, X-ray recovery time, and the incidence of adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides reliable evidence-based support for the clinical application of Reduning injection combined with western medicine for pneumonia.

Challenges in the development of this approach are the relatively poor systemic AO delivery and inefficient dystrophin correction in affected non-skeletal muscle tissues, including the heart. We have previously reported impressive heart activity including high-splicing efficiency and dystrophin restoration following a single administration of an arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide (CPPs) conjugated to a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO): Pip5e-PMO.

Here, we report studies involving single dose administration (12.5 mg/kg) of derivatives of Pip5e-PMO, consecutively assigned as Pip6-PMOs. These peptide-PMOs comprise alterations to the central hydrophobic core of the Pip5e peptide and illustrate that certain changes to the peptide sequence improves its activity; however, partial deletions within the hydrophobic core abolish its efficiency. Our data indicate that the hydrophobic core of the Pip sequences is critical for PMO delivery to the heart and that specific modifications to this region can enhance activity further.

Additionally, some classic antiviral drugs used for other viral infections are also reproposed for the potentials for management of COVID-19. In the management of COVID-19, there are several pharmacological actions. An important consideration in antiviral therapy is the management of oxidative stress, which plays important roles in viral infections including to COVID-19.

Data from electron acceptor and donor calculation for each drug is used for further estimating overall antioxidative characteristic. Based on the present study, all studied drugs have overall antioxidative properties. Hence, the advantage of molnupiravir, favipiravir and other antiviral drugs with proposed potentials for the management of COVID-19 is their direct action on viral molecule via binding-blocking process as well as antixodiative process.

Further classification depends on a mixture of phenomenological, neurophysiological, pathological and aetiological parameters. The temporal evolution of symptoms divides polyneuropathy (PN) into acute or chronic. Acute PN e.g. Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) is rare but an important entity to recognise because whilst at times severe, it is treatable. Most PN are chronic and usually develop over several months. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell or taste. Neurological complications have been reported in the context of COVID-19 infection both in the acute and subacute phase, as part of the post-COVID syndrome or as a result of the vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. In the acute phase, it has been reported that GBS prevalence is 15 cases per 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 infections. Demyelinating GBSs variant in particular is the most prevalent. Although not necessarily directly caused by SARS-CoV-2, prolonged stay in ICUs is associated with increased risk of ICU related neuro-myopathy. In the chronic phase, preliminary results of ongoing prospective observational studies suggest that patients suffered from COVID-19 have increased risk of developing mild axonal peripheral neuropathy that shows evidence of length dependency. Interestingly, it has been reported that-even in the absence of electrophysiologically confirmed PN-1 in 5 patients reported deterioration of pre-existing neuropathic symptoms or development of new neuropathic symptoms, particularly pain, after COVID-19. Such symptoms tend to persist for months. Further studies are needed to describe the natural history of the PNS involvement during and after COVID-19 infection.

Given a fixed number of treatment sessions, planners thus face the problem of finding a dosing sequence that achieves this goal. This is called the fractionation problem, and has received steady attention over a long history in the clinical literature. Mathematical formulations of the resulting optimization problem utilize the linear-quadratic (LQ) framework to characterize radiation dose-response of tumors and OAR. This yields a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program. The optimal dosing plan in this forward problem crucially depends on the parameters of the LQ model. Unfortunately, these parameters are difficult to estimate via {it{in vitro}} or {it{in vivo}} studies, and as such, their values are unknown to treatment planners. The clinical literature is thus replete with debates about what parameter values will make specific dosing plans effective. This manuscript formulates this as an inverse optimization problem. The LQ dose-response parameters appear in the objective function, the left hand side, and the right hand side of the forward problem, and none of the existing generic methods can provide an exact solution of the inverse problem. This manuscript exploits the structure of the problem and identifies all possible parameter values that render the given dosing plan optimal, in closed-form.

To reduce the morbidity and mortality rate in COVID-19 patients undergoing orthopedic procedures, we aimed to increase the threshold for surgical planning. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, COVID-19 patients who underwent elective or emergent orthopedic surgery in three orthopedic surgery centers from February 2020 to September 2020 were included. In this period, 6751 patients were scheduled for orthopedic surgery. To increase surgical threshold planning, all patients with grade 5 of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification and patients with COVID-19 related moderate to severe pulmonary involvement were identified as high-risk patients and were excluded. RESULTS: 35 deaths occurred during the study. The frequency of deaths was significantly higher in patients with COVID-19, 6 (9.4%) than patients without COVID-19, 29 (0. 43%). The average hospitalization stay was 12.8  12.1 days. The odds ratio (OR) for death was significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 than patients without COVID-19.

Each face of icosahedron is composed of a single-layer closest packing of protein globules, which can have different orientation relative to the edges of icosahedron. If the lines of globules are parallel to the edges of icosahedron, then the capsid has a point symmetry group Ih (with symmetry planes), if they are not parallel - the symmetry group I (without planes). From a mathematical point of view, in both symmetry groups there are series that unite equally (up to similarity) arranged capsids. They are connected pairwise by transitions to dual forms (homologous series). A hypothesis is formulated that the largest spherical viruses can have even more diverse and complex capsid structures. Along with icosahedron, their basic forms can be any simple shapes, allowed in Ih and I symmetry groups (8 in total). A suggestion is made that transitions within similarity series and between homologous series have a phylogenetic significance. There are known spherical viruses of both symmetry groups. For example, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has a symmetry group Ih and belongs to a well-known series.

Vaccines were rolled out as an emergency measure, with an expedited approval process. The available clinical trial data reveals the fact that vaccines mostly produce mild adverse events following immunization (AEFIs). Since the experiences are relatively new, it is important to monitor safety in a real-world setting. With this background, this survey was conducted. Methods This cross-sectional study was approved by the institutional ethics committee (IEC) of Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre. This was conducted over a period of four months at select apartment complexes around Whitefield, Bangalore. The participants were invited to fill up data through online Google Forms (Google, Mountain View, CA, USA). They were requested to provide demographic details, information related to vaccination, and AEFIs. Eligibility to participate included recipients of vaccines who received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in India. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.00 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Results The total number of participants in the study was 322. Out of this, 37.6% (121) were males and 62.4% (201) were females. The mean age of the participants was 34.9  12.4 (mean  standard deviation (SD) years. About 30% (96) of the study participants had comorbidities. Overall, 67.4% (217) of the participants suffered from AEFI. Of them, immediate reactions were reported by 18.3% (59) and 10.2% (32) of the participants after the first and second doses, respectively. A total of 0.9% (3) of the participants had immediate allergic reactions. The most common local and systemic AEFIs were pain at the injection site and extreme tiredness. AEFIs were found to be mild and with a probable association with vaccination as per the WHO scale. The number of females experiencing AEFIs was found to be higher when compared with males for both local and systemic reactions. There was a statistically significant increase in the number of individuals experiencing general adverse effects following the first dose of CovishieldTM (Serum Institute of India Private Limited, Pune, India) when compared with CovaxinTM (Bharat Biotech Limited, Hyderabad, India) (P < 0.05). Of the participants, 5.9% (19) were diagnosed with COVID-19 post-vaccination. Among them, 15.8% (3) required hospitalization, with 10.5% (2) of them requiring an oxygen bed. It was observed that 76.5% (166) of the participants did not report their reactions to concerned authorities. Conclusion Based on our sample, the study reflects that COVID-19 vaccination causes mild AEFI in most vaccine recipients. It also provides an insight that reporting of AEFI is very low.

Data treatment combined proportional redistribution of the missing data and ill-defined causes, and the application of coefficients for under-registration correction. The local empirical Bayesian estimator was used to calculate municipal mortality rates. RESULTS Rates for the set of chronic diseases decreased in Brazil between the three-year periods. The mean rates for total NCDs declined in the South, Southeast and Central-West regions, remained stable in the North and increased in the Northeast. Mortality rates due to cardiovascular diseases were the highest in all regions but showed the greatest declines between the periods. Cancers were the second leading cause of death.

Some companies -- in the case of their default -- can trigger significant cascades of shock in the supply-chain network and are thus systemically risky.

So far, economic shocks are typically studied in the framework of input-output analysis on the industry-level that can't relate risk to individual firms. Exact firm-level supply networks based on tax or payment data exist only for very few countries. Here we explore to what extent telecommunication data can be used as an inexpensive, easily available, and real-time alternative to reconstruct national supply networks on the firm-level.

METHODS: An outbreak investigation involving 394 residents and 70 staff, was carried out in 4 nursing homes affected by COVID-19 outbreaks in central London. Two point-prevalence surveys were performed one week apart where residents underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and had relevant symptoms documented. Asymptomatic staff from three of the four homes were also offered SARS-CoV-2 testing. RESULTS: Overall, 26% (95% CI 22-31) of residents died over the two-month period. All-cause mortality increased by 203% (95% CI 70-336) compared with previous years. Systematic testing identified 40% (95% CI 35-46) of residents as positive for SARS-CoV-2, and of these 43% (95% CI 34-52) were asymptomatic and 18% (95% CI 11-24) had only atypical symptoms; 4% (95% CI -1 to 9) of asymptomatic staff also tested positive.

Communities were driven to support each other and those perceived as vulnerable. Community support and social capital are key for strengthening resilience, and an important contributor to population health. The aim was to explore what factors enabled community-led action in response to need amongst the most deprived areas in Wales during COVID-19. METHODS: Mixed-methods approach, with a strong focus on qualitative research with a systems-lens. Quantitative data was collected through a survey of 2500 adults >18 years; living, working or volunteering in Wales engaged in community action, and analysed descriptively. Outcomes were motivation, benefits, current and past activities, barriers, socio-economic characteristics [age, education, employment, postcode], digital volunteerism, resilience [RRC-ARM 12], and health and wellbeing [WEMWBS-14]. Qualitative data was collected in two communities in South Wales from 46 semi-structured interviews with recipients, volunteers, and strategic leads and analysed thematically. This explored determinants and experience of community-led action, levers and drivers, and integration with the wider system. RESULTS: Results are preliminary. They include individual-level factors underlying volunteerism and pro-social behaviour across different categories of volunteer (unstructured, informal, formal) and across national area-level deprivation indicators (WIMD), and perspectives across the system on community-led response and its role in community empowerment in supporting the vulnerable within communities. CONCLUSIONS: Improved understanding of the role of community-led action as a protective factor against widening health inequalities during, and in recovery from COVID-19, was brought together to develop and coproduce a framework to empower community-led action and support sustainable integration with existing services.

Understanding community-led action during COVID-19 will inform how this can best supported to help protect against the longer-term differences in the health, social and economic impact.","output":"Learning lessons from the community response to COVID-19 in Wales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On the first day of the UK vaccination campaign with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine there were reports of 2 cases of anaphylaxis within minutes of administration of the Pfizer/BioNTech messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine and a third case of an allergic reaction not requiring adrenaline (epinephrine). This was alarming, as anaphylaxis to vaccines is rare; in the order of 1 case per million doses (1), and therefore likely to injure public confidence. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued precautionary advice restricting access to the vaccine (2), which was subsequently relaxed in line with the Summary of Product Characteristics. The cause of these vaccine anaphylaxis cases is unclear, but polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a candidate allergen (3,4).

Viral antibodies are known to develop upon initial infection; however, it is unclear the amount of protection this confers against reinfection. Additionally, COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) is a well-documented phenomenon; however, there are no high-quality studies to support the treatment of outpatients beyond standard indications of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis. This case describes a patient with either COVID-19 reinfection or prolonged course of CAC resulting in pulmonary embolism (PE). CASE SUMMARY: A 40-year-old healthy man presented with fever and cough. He tested positive for COVID-19 and was sent home to self-quarantine. His symptoms resolved and repeat COVID-19 testing returned negative. Two months later, he developed dyspnoea on exertion and syncope. Computed tomography with PE protocol demonstrated acute bilateral PE, and repeat COVID-19 testing returned positive. He was escalated to catheter-directed thrombolysis, but prior to the procedure went into cardiopulmonary arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated and full-dose systemic alteplase was administered. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for consideration of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; however, return of spontaneous circulation was unable to be achieved. DISCUSSION: This case raises the question of COVID-19 reinfection and prolonged risk of VTE due to CAC. We believe the patient was reinfected with COVID-19 provoking his PE; however, a single COVID-19 infection causing a prolonged course of CAC is possible. Until better data exists, decisions regarding outpatient prophylaxis must be individualized to weigh the risks of bleeding against the risk of thrombosis.","output":"Acute submassive pulmonary embolism after SARS-CoV-2 infection: a case report of reinfection or prolonged hypercoagulable state"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To evaluate the social distance effect on the daily frequency of possible SARS-CoV-2 cases in Primary Care, in relation to the predictive model Kermack-McKendrick. METHODS: Longitudinal retrospective study in 2 rural populations of Aragon (13,579h). A time series evaluation with a t-Student analysis was carry on, during the first 70 days of the pandemic. A simple Kermack-McKendrick predictive model was compared with the possible COVID-19 cases. Complementary ANOVA analysis to assess the before-after number of daily cases, follow-up days and days from symptoms onset to first contact with Primary Health Care. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-nine cases were detected (53.4% women; 70.7% under 60). Primary Care followed 95.3% of cases. The number of cases during the first social distancing strategies was higher in comparison with the model (P=.004, P=.006 and P=.004) with a media of decreases of 6.7 possible cases by series. In relation to the lockdown period the model and cases are close (P=.608 and P=.093), with an average decrease of 1.8 cases per series. During post-containment, the number of cases per day (P<.001) and days of follow-up (P<.001) increased.

This was a quality improvement project prompted by an adverse event after a telemedicine visit. METHODS We reviewed all completed telemedicine and conventional visits from March 26 to June 1 of 2020 and 2019 to identify patients who required an ED visit or hospital admission within eight weeks after the visit. RESULTS In 2020, the overall rate of ED visits of hospital admission within eight weeks of a neurology visit was less than 5%. Comparing 2020 with 2019: (1) cohorts were similar for age, payor, state of residence, medical complexity, recommendation for close follow-up, new medications, or new tests ordered; (2) it took longer to present to the ED (by 10 days) or to be hospitalized (by three days); (3) planned admissions were approximately 50% lower; (4) on multivariate analysis, risk factors for any ED/admission included a patient call within seven days before the ED/admission (P = 0.0004) or being seen by an epilepsy specialist (P = 0.02); (5) a presenting complaint of worsening symptoms had a lower odds ratio of subsequent ED visit/admission (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine is safe, with a similar likelihood of ED or hospital admission during the pandemic in 2020 versus before the pandemic in 2019.

However, the reported prevalence of olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction varies widely, and the reason for the inter-study differences is unclear. Hence, in this meta-analysis, we performed subgroup analyses to investigate the factors that contribute to the inter-study variability in the prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction. METHODS: Out of 943 citations, we included 55 eligible studies with 13,527 patients with COVID-19 for a meta-analysis. Calculating the data extracted from each study, the weighted summary prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction was estimated using a Freeman-Tukey transformation with models based on random-effects assumptions. A meta-analysis of variance compared the prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction according to regional, chronological, demographic, and methodologic factors, respectively. RESULTS: The overall pooled prevalence rates of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction were 51.4% and 47.5%, respectively, in the random-effect model. In subgroup analyses, the prevalence rates of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction were significantly different among four geographical regions (both P < 0.001, respectively). Although the prevalence rates of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction did not significantly differ according to the time of enrollment, the subgroup analyses including only studies from the same geographical region (Europe) revealed a significant difference in olfactory dysfunction according to the time of enrollment.

We aim to describe the geographical distributions of blood-sucking mites and mite-borne agents and to assess their ecological niches in China. METHODS: We mapped 549 species of blood-sucking mites belonging to 100 genera at the county level and eight mite-associated agents detected from 36 species of blood-sucking mites in China during 1978C2020. Impacts of climatic and environmental factors on the ecology of 21 predominant vector mites and a leading pathogen, Orientia tsutsugamushi, were assessed using boosted regression tree (BRT) models, and model-predicted risks were mapped. We also estimated the model-predicted number, area and population size of affected counties for each of the 21 mite species in China. RESULTS: Laelaps echidninus is the leading mite species that potentially affects 744 million people, followed by La. jettmari (517 million) and Eulaelaps stabularis (452 million). Leptotrombidium scutellare is the mite species harboring the highest variety of mite-borne agents including four Rickettsia species and two viruses, followed by Eu. stabularis (2 agents), L. palpale (2) and La. echidninus (2). The top two agents that parasitize the largest number of mite species are O. tsutsugamushi (28 species) and hantavirus (8). Mammalian richness, annual mean temperature and precipitation of the driest quarter jointly determine the ecology of the mites, forming four clusters of major mite species with distinct geographic distributions. High-risk areas of O. tsutsugamushi are mainly distributed in southern and eastern coastal provinces where 71.5 million people live. CONCLUSIONS: Ecological niches of major mite species and mite-borne pathogens are much more extensive than what have been observed, necessitating expansion of current filed surveillance.

A meta-analysis of eligible studies comparing the occurrence of severe and fatal COVID-19 in infected patients who were under treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) vs no treatment or other antihypertensives was conducted. Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Library, MedRxiv and BioRxiv were searched for relevant studies. Fixed-effect models or random-effect models were used depending on the heterogeneity between estimates. Results: a total of fifteen studies with 21,614 patients were included. The use of RAS inhibitors was associated with a non-significant 20% decreased risk of the composite outcome (death, admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation requirement or progression to severe or critical pneumonia): RR 0.81 (95%CI: 0.63-1.04), p=0.10, I2=82%.

(2) Challenges remain in securing the integrity of the process, including addressing ways to scale the review process, avoiding attempts to misinform or confuse the dissemination of results, and ensuring fairness and broad participation in the process itself. Based on these findings, we recommend: (1) Regularly polling members of the computing research community, including program and general conference chairs, journal editors, authors, reviewers, etc., to identify specific challenges they face to better understand these issues. (2) An influential body, such as the Computing Research Association regularly issues a\\"State of the Computing Research Enterprise\\"report to update the community on trends, both positive and negative, impacting the computing research enterprise.

Few studies unpack the risk and protective factors associated with mental ill-health and addictions that might inform future preparedness. METHODS: Cross-sectional on-line survey with 37,810 Catalan residents aged 16+ years from 21 April to 20 May 2020 reporting prevalence of mental ill-health and substance use and associated coping strategies and behaviours. RESULTS: Weighted prevalence of reported depression, anxiety and lack of mental well-being was, respectively, 23, 26, and 75%, each three-fold higher than before confinement. The use of prescribed hypnosedatives was two-fold and of non-prescribed hypnosedatives ten-fold higher than in 2018. Women, younger adults and students were considerably more likely, and older and retired people considerably less likely to report mental ill-health. High levels of social support, dedicating time to oneself, following a routine, and undertaking relaxing activities were associated with half the likelihood of reported mental ill-health. Worrying about problems living at home, the uncertainty of when normality would return, and job loss were associated with more than one and a half times the likelihood of mental ill-health. With the possible exception of moderately severe and severe depression, length of confinement had no association with reported mental ill-health. CONCLUSIONS: The trebling of psychiatric symptomatology might lead to either to under-identification of cases and treatment gap, or a saturation of mental health services if these are not matched with prevalence increases. Special attention is needed for the younger adult population. In the presence of potential new confinement, improved mental health literacy of evidence-based coping strategies and resilience building are urgently needed to mitigate mental ill-health.","output":"Mental ill-health during COVID-19 confinement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the increasing incidence of skin cancer, many noninvasive technologies to detect its presence have been developed. This review focuses on reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), optical coherence tomography (OCT), high-frequency ultrasound (HFUS), electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), pigmented lesion assay (PLA), and Raman spectroscopy (RS) and discusses the basic principle, clinical applications, advantages, and disadvantages of each technology. RCM provides high cellular resolution and has high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of skin cancer. OCT provides lower resolution than RCM, although its evaluable depth is deeper than that of RCM. RCM and OCT may be useful in reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies, evaluating the tumor margin, and monitoring treatment response. HFUS can be mainly used to delineate tumor depths or margins and monitor the treatment response. EIS provides high sensitivity but low specificity for the diagnosis of skin malignancies. PLA, which is based on the genetic information of lesions, is applicable for the detection of melanoma with high sensitivity and moderate-to-high specificity. RS showed high accuracy for the diagnosis of skin cancer, although more clinical studies are required.

Retrospective analysis of patients admitted to the GO service at a single academic institution in 2019 showed that compliance with recommendations for ACP documentation was suboptimal. We initiated a quality improvement initiative from January through September 2020 to improve our compliance. Patients admitted to the GO service were given ACP packets with a letter-based advance directive (AD) worksheet modeled after the Stanford Letter Project. In January and February 2020, patients who were interested in learning more about ACP were visited by medical students trained to lead ACP conversations. From March through September 2020, students were unavailable to facilitate in-person ACP conversations due to COVID-19 restrictions. Pre and post-intervention ACP documentation of patients admitted to the GO service were analyzed. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and associations between sociodemographic characteristics and ACP documentation were analyzed using logistic regression. Since implementation of the letter-based ACP intervention, 98 patients were admitted to the GO service. The majority of those admitted had cancer (n=60, 61%). Only 16 patients (16%) had an AD on admission, and 65 patients (66%) reported never having an ACP conversation. Of 82 patients without ADs, 71 (87%) received an ACP packet. Of those receiving packets, 8 (11%) requested more information about ACP and 6 (8%) participated in an ACP conversation with a student. At 9-month follow-up among patients receiving a packet, 9 patients added an AD to their EMR (13%), and 2 updated their AD (3%). After the intervention, AD completion in our population went from 16% to 26%. Among those receiving ACP packets, increasing age was associated with increased post-admission AD completion (OR 1.1, p=0.01). Completion of AD among patients continues to be low. Barriers to AD completion include patient and provider reluctance surrounding discussing these issues and difficulty with uploading these documents into the EMR. Letter-based ADs offer a unique method for introducing ACP earlier in cancer care and may lead to increased conversations about patient values and goals of care. More work is needed to improve occurrence and documentation of ACP conversations.

Many variants of FL have been known, appearing as sub-problems in many applications in computer science, management science, and operations research. Most FL models studied thus far assume that clients need to be served by connecting each to one facility. To overcome facility failures and provide a robust solution, we investigate in this paper FL problems that require each client to be connected to multiple facilities, represented by an additional input parameter. The aim of the algorithm is then to provide a robust service to all clients while minimizing the total connecting and facility purchasing costs. This is known as the Multi-Facility Location problem (MFL) and has been studied in the offline setting, in which the entire input sequence is given to the algorithm at once. In this paper, we study MFL in the online setting, in which client requests are not known in advance but are revealed to the algorithm over time. We refer to it as the online multi-facility location problem (OMFL) and study its metric and non-metric variants. We propose the first online algorithms for these variants and measure their performance using the standard notion of competitive analysis. The latter is a worst-case analysis that compares the cost of the online algorithm to that of the optimal offline algorithm that is assumed to know all demands in advance. We further study OMFL in the leasing setting, in which facilities are leased, rather than bought, for different durations and prices, and each arriving client needs to be connected to multiple facilities leased at the time of its arrival. The aim is to minimize the total connecting and facility leasing costs.","output":"Algorithmic Study of Online Multi-Facility Location Problems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As a result of the growing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for treating malignancy, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have been increasingly reported. Higher body mass index (BMI) has been highlighted as a potential risk factor for the development of irAEs. However, there are no meta-analyses summarizing the association between BMI and irAEs in patients on ICI therapies. METHODS: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and grey literature were searched up to January 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) 95% and confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity test, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (number registration: CRD42020168790). RESULTS: Five studies (n = 1937) met eligibility criteria for inclusion. Being overweight or obese was associated with an increased odds of developing irAEs (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.70-4.03, P &#8804; 0.00001, I2 = 53%). In subgroup analyses, higher BMI was associated with irAEs in patients using anti-CTLA-4 single agents or in combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.17-2.98, P = 0.009, I2 = 0%) and in patients using anti-PD-1/PD-L1 (OR 3.22, 95% CI 2.06-5.01, P = 0.00001, I2 = 32%) monotherapy.

Body mass and body height were assessed in 174 Lebanese physical education students immediately before and at the end of COVID-19 lockdown. Their training routine was assessed using by questionnaire. Wilcoxon signed-rank order assessed the effects of lockdown on body mass, while Chi square test tested the differences in distribution of underweight, normal weight, and overweight/obese status before and after the lockdown. In general, there was a significant (p < 0.001) small increase in body mass. However, about 27% of participants had a moderate to major increase in body mass. This was reflected in a significant shift in nutritional status as the number of overweight/obese students increased by 5.2%. In addition, students who reduced their training frequency due to lockdown were three times more likely to increase body mass than those who remained active (i.e., 38 vs. 5 with moderate to major increase). Given that an increase in body mass increases all health risks, remaining physically active is of high importance for health prevention, especially considering all other positive effects of physical activity on cardio-respiratory and muscle function.","output":"Effects of a Three-Month COVID-19 Lockdown on Body Mass and Nutritional Status of Lebanese Students Who Study Physical Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Developing green and highly efficient water disinfection technique is of great importance to public health. Herein, a near-infrared (NIR) light-triggerable thermo-sensitive defective molybdenum oxide-nitrogen doped carbon (MoO3-x/NCNs) composite was fabricated and applied to water disinfection. With the synergy of photodynamic and photothermal effects, the MoO3-x/NCNs achieve a rapid and effective inactivation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) as compared to photocatalytic treatment or thermal catalytic alone. Particularly, MONC-3 with optimal ratio can completely inactivate 7.6 log of E. coli and S. aureus within 60 min and 100 min, respectively. The MONC-3 hybrid exhibits efficient charge separation and migration ability due to the formation of Schottky heterojunction, resulting in the highly enhanced O2C (11.3410-10 M) generation activity. Meanwhile, excellent NIR light absorption and photothermal conversion efficiency (52.6%) of MONC-3 can generate local high temperature to promote photocatalytic reaction rate and destruct the bacterial integrity. The monitoring of cell damage process confirmed the irreversible death of bacteria.

However, data regarding myeloid cell expansion have been collected in Europe, where the mortality rate by COVID-19 is greater than those in other regions including Japan. Thus, characteristics of COVID-19-induced myeloid cell subsets remain largely unknown in the regions with low mortality rates. Here, we analyzed cellular dynamics of myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) subsets and examined whether any of them correlate with disease severity and prognosis, using blood samples from Japanese COVID-19 patients. We observed that polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs, but not other MDSC subsets, transiently expanded in severe cases but not in mild or moderate cases. Contrary to previous studies in Europe, this subset selectively expanded in survivors of severe cases and subsided before discharge, but such transient expansion was not observed in non-survivors in Japanese cohort. Analysis of plasma cytokine/chemokine levels revealed positive correlation of PMN-MDSC frequencies with interleukin 8 (IL-8) levels prior to the cell expansion, indicating the involvement of IL-8 on recruitment of PMN-MDSCs to peripheral blood following the onset of severe COVID-19. Thus, our data indicates that transient expansion of the PMN-MDSC subset results in improved clinical outcome.

PATIENTS/METHODS In this retrospective file review of 292 blepharoplasty patients, we excluded 14 who were lost to follow-up or had missing data; among the 278 enrolled patients, we recorded operative time, a surgeon panel's score for edema and ecchymosis on the third postoperative day, patients' scores of their satisfaction and inconvenience, and postoperative complications. RESULTS One hundred thirty-nine patients were included in the m-ESU and b-ESU group. Overall, 105 patients underwent upper blepharoplasty, 77 underwent lower blepharoplasty, and 96 underwent combined blepharoplasty. The total mean operative time in the m-ESU and b-ESU was 67.94 and 62.82 minutes, respectively. This difference was not significant (P > .05). The panel's edema and patient satisfaction and inconvenience scores were significantly better in the b-ESU group (P < .05). There were no significant differences in the panel's ecchymosis score and frequency as well as nature of complications between the m-ESU and b-ESU group (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS In this cohort of blepharoplasty patients, minimally invasive b-ESUs were efficient in obtaining reliable surgical results with higher satisfaction and lower inconvenience rates of patients than m-ESUs.

OBJECTIVE The aim was to characterize the pathway of COVID-19 outpatients in Primary Care and establish the risk factors that mostly influences the need for hospitalization or death during the follow-up. METHODS A retrospective cohort study was established, based on the official Portuguese dataset of the first wave between March 2nd and June 30th 2020. The predictive effects of variables, including age, gender, residency and clinical features, were analysed using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS A total of 38,545 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 was included for analysis (56.3% female), with a median age of 47 years old. There were 4,327 hospitalized patients, 253 in intensive care units and 1,153 deaths. Females present lower risk of hospitalization (HR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.73-0.82; P < 0.001) and age is associated with higher risk (HR = 7.08; 95% CI: 6.68-7.50; P < 0.001), as well as the presence of at least one comorbidity (HR = 7.03; 95% CI: 6.43-7.69; P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that cardiovascular disease, diabetes, smoking, obesity, chronic kidney disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV and other immunodeficiencies, transplant or immunosuppression, haematological disorders, neurological disorders and liver disease increased the risk of hospitalization. CONCLUSION Male gender, age and the presence of comorbidities are the main determinants for hospitalization and death.

Still, its assessment is often neglected both by patients and healthcare professionals. There is increasing interest in conducting pain assessment and monitoring via physiological signals that promise to overcome the limitations of state-of-the-art pain assessment tools. This systematic review aims to evaluate existing experimental studies to identify the most promising methods and results for objectively quantifying cancer patients' pain experience. METHODS: Four electronic databases (Pubmed, Compendex, Scopus, Web of Science) were systematically searched for articles published up to October 2020. RESULTS: Fourteen studies (528 participants) were included in the review. The selected studies analyzed seven physiological signals. Blood pressure and ECG were the most used signals. Sixteen physiological parameters showed significant changes in association with pain. The studies were fairly consistent in stating that heart rate, the low-frequency to high-frequency component ratio (LF/HF), and systolic blood pressure positively correlate with the pain. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence supports the hypothesis that physiological signals can help objectively quantify, at least in part, cancer patients' pain experience. While there is much more to be done to obtain a reliable pain assessment method, this review takes an essential first step by highlighting issues that should be taken into account in future research: use of a wearable device for pervasive recording in a real-world context, implementation of a big-data approach possibly supported by AI, including multiple stratification factors (e.g., cancer site and stage, source of pain, demographic and psychosocial data), and better-defined recording procedures.

Dissection after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) remains a significant clinical problem and untreated may cause acute occlusion or later restenosis. Stents are used to manage dissections, which is often followed by in-stent restenosis and occasionally stent fracture. Tack (Intact Vascular, Wayne, Pa) implants have minimal metal and low radial force and are specifically designed for dissection repair. This study evaluated Tack implants for treatment of dissections resulting from standard balloon PTA for femoral-popliteal arterial disease. Twelve-month outcomes after Tack treatment of post-PTA dissections are described. METHODS This prospective, single-arm study evaluated patients with ischemia (Rutherford clinical category 2-4) caused by lesions of the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. Patients were treated with standard balloon angioplasty, and post-PTA dissections were treated with Tacks. The primary end points were core laboratory-adjudicated device technical success, defined as the ability of the Tack implants to resolve post-PTA dissection, and device safety, defined as the absence of new-onset major adverse events. Patients were followed up to 12 months after implantation. RESULTS Tacks were used in 130 patients with post-PTA dissections (74.0%  grade C). Technical success was achieved in 128 (98.5%) patients with no major adverse events at 30 days. The 12-month patency was 76.4%, and freedom from target lesion revascularization was 89.5%. Significant improvement from baseline was observed in Rutherford clinical category (82.8% with grade 1) and ankle-brachial index (0.68  0.18 to 0.94  0.15; P < .0001).

Serial measurements of serum IgG-anti-SARS-CoV-2 were obtained at baseline (April-May,2020), and in 2 follow-up visits. Linear mixed models were used to investigate antibody kinetics and associated factors. RESULTS: A total of 306 seropositive subjects (median age: 44.7years;69.9% female) were included in the final analysis. After a median follow-up of 274 days between baseline and final measurement, 235(76.8%) maintained seropositivity. Antibody titers decreased in 82.0%, while remained stable in 13.1%. Factors associated with stability of antibodies over time included age&#8805;45 years, higher baseline titers, severe/moderate infection and high-grade exposure to COVID-19 patients.

However, they are still largely reserved for uncomplicated elective cases. To determine whether laparoscopic groin hernia repair can achieve similar results for acute strangulated hernias as laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis, we analyzed and compared the results of emergency laparoscopic surgery and open repair for strangulated groin hernias performed by our team over the past 4 years. METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. We analyzed the results of patients admitted between January 2007 and January 2011 who were diagnosed with acute strangulated groin hernia and underwent emergency open or laparoscopic hernia repair during the same admission. Patients' demographic details, mode of presentation, type of hernia, intraoperative findings, operative time, postoperative course and complications were compared. RESULTS In total, 188 patients fulfilled the criteria for emergency surgical repair of strangulated groin hernias; 57 received laparoscopic and 131 received open repairs. The mean operative time was 79.82  29.571 min and 80.75  35.161 min, respectively. More laparotomies were performed in the open group (19 vs 0). The wound infection rate was significantly higher in the open group (12 vs 0). The mean hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopic group (4.39 days vs 7.34 days). There was no mesh infection in either group. Recurrence occurred one case in the laparoscopic group and in three cases in the open group. CONCLUSIONS Emergency laparoscopic repair for strangulated groin hernias is feasible and appears to have a lower morbidity relative to open repair.

Some predictors of treatment outcome are suggested, but the evidence is limited. The primary aim of this study was to explore if selected pre-treatment characteristics of the participants in a recently conducted randomized controlled trial were associated with treatment outcome. Methods In this study secondary analysis of data collected in a randomized trial were conducted. The participants were women with chronic pelvic pain randomized to two different physical therapy treatments. Analyses in this study were performed for the whole group as a cohort. The primary outcome measure was change in pain intensity from baseline to 12 months, measured with the numeric rating scale (0-10). The women were asked to rate their mean pelvic pain intensity during the last 7 days. Based on previous research and on available variables from the randomized controlled trial four potential predictive factors were derived from the baseline data and assessed one by one in a linear regression model, adjusted for age and treatment group. The variables with strongest association (p < 0.10) with the primary outcome were further included in a multivariable linear regression model with backward selection, adjusted for age and treatment group. Results Fifty women (mean age 38.1, SD = 12.2) were included in the analysis. For these women the mean change in pain intensity was -1.2 points (95% CI -1.8 to -0.7) from baseline to 12 months. The multivariable regression model showed that pelvic pain duration of 6 years or more was associated with less decrease in pain intensity with a regression coefficient of 1.3 (95% CI 0.3-2.4). Baseline pain intensity was associated with higher pain reduction after PT treatment with a regression coefficient per SD increase in baseline pain of -0.6 (95% CI -1.1 to -0.1). None of the women with main pain site other places than in the pelvis reported any pain reduction after physical therapy treatment, but due to the small numbers the predictor was not included in the regression analysis. Conclusions We identified that pelvic pain duration of 6 years or more was associated with less pain reduction, and that higher baseline pain intensity was associated with higher pain reduction after physical therapy treatment in this sample of women with chronic pelvic pain. For the variable main pain site other places than the pelvis the results are unsure due to small numbers. Implications Based on our finding of long pain duration as a negative predictor for pain reduction, we emphasize that early intervention is important. Many of the participants in our RCT reported pelvic surgeries or other treatments prior to referral for PT, and we suggest that referral to a non-invasive intervention such as PT should be considered at an earlier stage. In order to tailor interventions to the individual women's needs, thorough baseline assessments, preferably in a multidisciplinary setting, should be performed.","output":"Baseline pain characteristics predict pain reduction after physical therapy in women with chronic pelvic pain.

It has been 3 months, since we had the first cluster in China and we felt the need to look into certain regional patterns of transmission of the virus with respect to some distinctive living conditions, incidence of malaria, the genomics of different strains, and its impact on severity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data for 107 countries was compiled and correlation analysis was done between incidence of malaria and number of SARS-CoV-2 cases. Possibility of genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and reported zoonotic RNA viruses found associated previously with some Plasmodium species was explored by utilizing NCBI database. RESULTS: We found a significant inverse correlation between SARS-CoV-2 disease burden and incidence of Malaria. Our analysis also showed that a 12 base pair region encoding a part of surface glycoprotein of SARS- CoV-2 aligned with the Plasmodium associated zoonotic viral genome.

While several studies have reported the association between frailty and COVID-19 mortality or length of hospital stay, there have been no community-based studies on the association between frailty and risk of severe infection. Considering that different definitions have been identified to assess frailty, this study aimed to compare the association between frailty and severe COVID-19 infection in UK Biobank using two frailty classifications: the frailty phenotype and the frailty index. METHODS: A total of 383,845 UK Biobank participants recruited 2006-2010 in England (211,310 [55.1%] women, baseline age 37-73 years) were included. COVID-19 test data were provided by Public Health England (available up to 28 June 2020). An adapted version of the frailty phenotype derived by Fried et al. was used to define frailty phenotype (robust, pre-frail, or frail). A previously validated frailty index was derived from 49 self-reported questionnaire items related to health, disease and disability, and mental wellbeing (robust, mild frailty, and moderate/severe frailty). Both classifications were derived from baseline data (2006-2010). Poisson regression models with robust standard errors were used to analyse the associations between both frailty classifications and severe COVID-19 infection (resulting in hospital admission or death), adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: Of UK Biobank participants included, 802 were admitted to hospital with and/or died from COVID19 (323 deaths and 479 hospitalisations). After analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, a higher risk of COVID-19 was observed for pre-frail (risk ratio (RR) 1.47 [95% CI 1.26; 1.71]) and frail (RR 2.66 [95% CI 2.04; 3.47]) individuals compared to those classified as robust using the frailty phenotype. Similar results were observed when the frailty index was used (RR mildly frail 1.46 [95% CI 1.26; 1.71] and RR moderate/severe frailty 2.43 [95% CI 1.91; 3.10]). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection resulting in hospital admission or death, irrespective of how it was measured and independent of sociodemographic and lifestyle factors.

Their distress may potentially affect their adherence to the childhood immunization schedule and the acceptance of other recommended vaccines by physicians. OBJECTIVE: The study primarily aimed to assess the feasibility of using immersive virtual reality (VR) during immunization in children in primary care. The secondary aim was to determine the effectiveness of immersive VR in alleviating pain and anxiety among children, reduction of anxiety of their parents and attending nurses during immunization compared to usual care without VR. METHODS: A pilot open-label randomized control trial was conducted at a public primary care clinic in Singapore. Thirty children, aged 4C10 years were randomized to an intervention group (n = 15) using VR and a control group (n = 15) without VR during immunization. Feasibility was assessed by the response rate to the use of VR. The Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) and the Childrens Fear Scale (CFS) were used to determine their pain and anxiety, respectively. The anxiety level of their accompanying parents and attending nurses were evaluated using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) prior and post-immunization of these children. The FPS-R and CFS scores, and anxiety assessment for parents and nurses were assessed using Mann-Whitney U test. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to assess the difference in the nurses experience of using the VR application. RESULTS: One child refused to use the VR equipment, constituting a rejection rate of 6.7% (1/15) but no adverse event occurred in the intervention arm. The overall response rate of 88% (30/34) when the parents were approached to participate in the study, indicating feasibility of using VR in childhood immunization. In the intervention group compared to the control group, the change in scores for CFS (median ?1, IQR ?2 to 0; P = 0.04), parental VAS (median ?4, IQR ?5 to ?1; P = 0.04) were significantly decreased. After immunization, nurses scored favorably for VR, in terms of simplicity (median 9.5, IQR 5.72 to 10; P = 0.01), acceptability (median 10, IQR 5 to 10; P = 0.005) and willingness to use VR in the future (median 10, IQR 5 to 10; P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Immersive VR is feasible, safe and effective in alleviating anxiety among the children and parents. Nurses viewed the application of VR in childhood immunization favorably.

The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system has successfully been demonstrated to excise or inactivate integrated HIV-1 provirus from infected cells by targeting the long terminal repeat (LTR) region. However, the guide RNAs (gRNAs) have classically avoided transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) that are readily observed and known to be important in human promoters. Although conventionally thought unfavorable due to potential impact on human promoters, our computational pipeline identified gRNA sequences that were predicted to inactivate HIV-1 transcription by targeting the nuclear factor &#954;B (NF-&#954;B) binding sites (gNFKB0, gNFKB1) with a high safety profile (lack of predicted or observed human edits) and broad-spectrum activity (predicted coverage of known viral sequences).

Health facility management has been studied in high-income countries, but there are significant measurement gaps about facility management and primary health care performance in low and middle-income countries. A primary health care facility management evaluation tool (PRIME-Tool) was initially piloted in Ghana where better facility management was associated with higher performance on select primary health care outcomes such as essential drug availability, trust in providers, ease of following a providers advice, and overall patient-reported quality rating. In this study, we sought to understand health facility management within Uganda's decentralized primary health care system. METHODS: We administered and analyzed a cross-sectional household and health facility survey conducted in Uganda in 2019, assessing facility management using the PRIME-Tool. RESULTS: Better facility management was associated with better essential drug availability but not better performance on measures of stocking equipment. Facilities with better PRIME-Tool management scores trended towards better performance on a number of experiential quality measures. We found significant disparities in the management performance of primary health care facilities. In particular, patients with greater wealth and education and those living in urban areas sought care at facilities that performed better on management. Private facilities and hospitals performed better on the management index than public facilities and health centers and clinics. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that investments in stronger facility management in Uganda may strengthen key aspects of facility readiness such as essential drug availability and potentially could affect experiential quality of care. Nevertheless, the stark disparities demonstrate that Uganda policymakers need to target investments strategically in order to improve primary health care equitably across socioeconomic status and geography.

Having shown that each of the TCLs were antigen-specific and antigen-reactive, single cell mRNA analyses demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S and M proteins drive strikingly distinct molecular signatures. Whereas the S-specific responses are virtually indistinguishable from those responses induced by other viral antigens (e.g. CMV), the M protein-specific CD4+ TCLs have a transcriptomic signature that indicate a marked suppression of interferon signaling, characterized by a downregulation of the genes encoding ISG15, IFITM1, IFI6, MX1, STAT1, OAS1, IFI35, IFIT3 and IRF7 (a molecular signature which is not dissimilar to that found in severe COVID-19).

Expert commentary: Cerebral oximetry provides a noninvasive measure of cerebral oxygenation, which when persistently declining, can serve as a warning sign of hemodynamic or metabolic compromise intraoperatively or a predictor of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Although useful, the cerebral oximetry readings must be interpreted in the context of other clinical information. When cerebral desaturation is confirmed, an algorithm should be followed in an attempt to increase oxygen delivery to the brain and/or decrease cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen.","output":"Cerebral perfusion monitoring in acute care surgery: current and perspective use."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The large-scale epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has triggered unprecedented physical and psychological stress on health professionals. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of burnout syndrome, and the relationship between burnout and depressive symptoms among frontline medical staff during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. METHODS: A total of 606 frontline medical staff were recruited from 133 cities in China using a cross-sectional survey. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was used to assess the level of burnout. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-9). RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 36.5% of the medical staff experienced burnout. Personal and work-related factors were independently associated with burnout, including age (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.52C0.89, p = 0.004), family income (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.53C0.99, p = 0.045), having physical diseases (OR = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.42C3.28, p < 0.001), daily working hours (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.03C1.77, p = 0.033), and profession of nurse (OR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.12C4.10, p = 0.022). The correlation coefficients between the scores of each burnout subscale and the scores of depressive symptoms were 0.57 for emotional exhaustion, 0.37 for cynicism, and ?0.41 for professional efficacy (all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the prevalence rate of burnout is extremely high among medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is associated with other psychological disorders, such as depression. Psychological intervention for medical staff is urgently needed. Young and less experienced medical staff, especially nurses, should receive more attention when providing psychological assistance.","output":"Burnout and Its Relationship With Depressive Symptoms in Medical Staff During the COVID-19 Epidemic in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A white-rot basidiomycete Ganoderma spp. has long been used as a medicinal mushroom in Asia, and it has an array of pharmacological properties for immunomodulatory activity.

Methods: A cross-sectional study for postpartum women was conducted in October 2020 (N = 600). The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to measure postpartum depression. The prevalence ratios were estimated by log-binomial regression models, adjusting for age, education, household income, residence area, parity, the timing of delivery, and a prior history of depression. Results: The prevalence of postpartum depression was 28.7% (EPDS []), 18.6% ([]11), and 13.1% ([]13). Social restrictions including cancellation of home visits by health care professionals, or cancellation of infant checkups or vaccinations, loss of support during pregnancy or after delivery including loss of opportunities to consult with health care professionals or friends, or cancellation of parents or other family member visits to support, and loss of autonomy about delivery or breastfeeding, were associated with postnatal depression. Conclusion: About 30% of women who delivered and raised a baby during the COVID-19 pandemic had postpartum depression, which is much higher than a pre-pandemic meta-analysis. COVID-19 related social restrictions or loss of social support from healthcare professionals, family, and friends were significantly associated with postpartum depression. Also, loss of maternal autonomy in delivery and breastfeeding is associated with postpartum depression. The results indicate that both formal and informal support should not be limited to prevent postpartum depression during the pandemic.","output":"The effect of social restrictions, loss of social support, and loss of maternal autonomy on postpartum depression in 1 to 12-months postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inhibition of host-encoded targets, such as the cyclophilins, provides an opportunity to generate potent, high barrier to resistance antivirals for the treatment of a broad range of viral diseases.

Therefore, early identification of poor outcome could improve care. Genetic research has identified regions of the genome associated with AN. Patients with anorexia nervosa were identified via the Swedish eating disorder quality registers Stepwise and Riks?t and invited to participate in the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative. First, we associated genetic information longitudinally with eating disorder severity indexed by scores on the Clinical Impairment Assessment (CIA) in 2843 patients with lifetime AN with or without diagnostic migration to other forms of eating disorders followed for up to 16 years (mean = 5.3 years). Second, we indexed the development of a severe and enduring eating disorder (SEED) by a high CIA score plus a follow-up time 5 years. We associated individual polygenic scores (PGSs) indexing polygenic liability for AN, schizophrenia, and body mass index (BMI) with severity and SEED. After multiple testing correction, only the BMI PGS when calculated with traditional clumping and p value thresholding was robustly associated with disorder severity (?PGS = 1.30; 95% CI: 0.72, 1.88; p = 1.2  10-5) across all p value thresholds at which we generated the PGS. However, using the alternative PGS calculation method PRS-CS yielded inconsistent results for all PGS. The positive association stands in contrast to the negative genetic correlation between BMI and AN. Larger discovery GWASs to calculate PGS will increase power, and it is essential to increase sample sizes of the AN GWASs to generate clinically meaningful PGS as adjunct risk prediction variables.

We sought to determine the utility of point\\\\of\\\\care ultrasound (POCUS) for characterizing lung involvement and, thereby, clinical risk determination in COVID\\\\19 pneumonia. METHODS: This multicenter, prospective, observational study included patients with COVID\\\\19 who received 12\\\\zone lung ultrasound and chest computed tomography (CT) scanning in the emergency department (ED). We defined lung disease severity using the lung ultrasound score (LUS) and chest CT severity score (CTSS). We assessed the association between the LUS and poor outcome (ICU admission or 30\\\\day all\\\\cause mortality). We also assessed the association between the LUS and hospital length of stay. We examined the ability of the LUS to differentiate between disease severity groups. Lastly, we estimated the correlation between the LUS and CTSS and the interrater agreement for the LUS. We handled missing data by multiple imputation with chained equations and predictive mean matching. RESULTS: We included 114 patients treated between March 19, 2020, and May 4, 2020. An LUS 12 was associated with a poor outcome within 30 days (hazard ratio [HR], 5.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26C24.80; P = 0.02). Admission duration was shorter in patients with an LUS <12 (adjusted HR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.47C3.40; P < 0.001). Mean LUS differed between disease severity groups: no admission, 6.3 (standard deviation [SD], 4.4); hospital/ward, 13.1 (SD, 6.4); and ICU, 18.0 (SD, 5.0). The LUS was able to discriminate between ED discharge and hospital admission excellently, with an area under the curve of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.75C0.91). Interrater agreement for the LUS was strong:  = 0.88 (95% CI, 0.77C0.95). Correlation between the LUS and CTSS was strong:  = 0.60 (95% CI, 0.48C0.71).

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) inflicts severe complications to the infected host, including cough, dyspnoea, fever, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs), and multiple organ failure. These manifestations are the consequence of the dysregulated immune system, which gives rise to excessive and unattended production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Elevated circulatory cytokine and chemokine levels are accompanied by spontaneous haemorrhage, thrombocytopenia and systemic inflammation, which are the cardinal features of life-threatening cytokine storm syndrome in advanced COVID-19 diseases. Coronavirus hijacked NF-kappa B (NF-B) is responsible for upregulating the expressions of inflammatory cytokine, chemokine, alarmins and inducible enzymes, which paves the pathway for cytokine storm. Given the scenario, the systemic approach of simultaneous inhibition of NF-B offers an attractive therapeutic intervention. Targeted therapies with proteasome inhibitor (VL-01, bortezomib, carfilzomib and ixazomib), bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (acalabrutinib), nucleotide analogue (remdesivir), TNF- monoclonal antibodies (infliximab and adalimumab), N-acetylcysteine and corticosteroids (dexamethasone), focusing the NF-B inhibition have demonstrated effectiveness in terms of the significant decrease in morbidity and mortality in severe COVID-19 patients.

We have previously shown the clinical potential of (64)Cu-DOTATATE in a small first-in-human feasibility study. The aim of the present study was, in a larger prospective design, to compare on a head-to-head basis the performance of (64)Cu-DOTATATE and (111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-octreotide ((111)In-DTPA-OC) as a basis for implementing (64)Cu-DOTATATE as a routine. METHODS We prospectively enrolled 112 patients with pathologically confirmed NETs of gastroenteropancreatic or pulmonary origin. All patients underwent both PET/CT with (64)Cu-DOTATATE and SPECT/CT with (111)In-DTPA-OC within 60 d. PET scans were acquired 1 h after injection of 202 MBq (range, 183-232 MBq) of (64)Cu-DOTATATE after a diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT scan. Patients were followed for 42-60 mo for evaluation of discrepant imaging findings. The McNemar test was used to compare the diagnostic performance. RESULTS Eighty-seven patients were congruently PET- and SPECT-positive. No SPECT-positive cases were PET-negative, whereas 10 false-negative SPECT cases were identified using PET. The diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy of (64)Cu-DOTATATE (97% for both) were significantly better than those of (111)In-DTPA-OC (87% and 88%, respectively, P = 0.017). In 84 patients (75%), (64)Cu-DOTATATE identified more lesions than (111)In-DTPA-OC and always at least as many. In total, twice as many lesions were detected with (64)Cu-DOTATATE than with (111)In-DTPA-OC. Moreover, in 40 of 112 cases (36%) lesions were detected by (64)Cu-DOTATATE in organs not identified as disease-involved by (111)In-DTPA-OC. CONCLUSION With these results, we demonstrate that (64)Cu-DOTATATE is far superior to (111)In-DTPA-OC in diagnostic performance in NET patients. Therefore, we do not hesitate to recommend implementation of (64)Cu-DOTATATE as a replacement for (111)In-DTPA-OC.","output":"64Cu-DOTATATE PET for Neuroendocrine Tumors: A Prospective Head-to-Head Comparison with 111In-DTPA-Octreotide in 112 Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Although general principles related to vaccination hesitancy have been well researched, reports on reluctance to be vaccinated for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States are somewhat surprising, given the disease's substantive disruption of everyday life. However, the landscape in which people are making COVID-19 vaccination decisions has recently evolved with releases of encouraging vaccine-related data and changes to official messaging about the virus. Therefore, this study sought to identify factors associated with reported likelihood to get vaccinated for COVID-19 among US adults in late January 2021. STUDY DESIGN: We used the Prolific online research panel to survey a nationally representative sample of 1017 US adults. METHODS: Respondents were asked about their behavioral intentions toward COVID-19 vaccination, trust in science, perceptions related to COVID-19, and selected sociodemographic factors. We computed associations between those 11 independent variables and likelihood to get vaccinated for COVID-19 using multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Around 73.9% of respondents indicated at least some likelihood to get vaccinated for COVID-19. Trust in science and perceived seriousness of COVID-19 were positively associated with intention to get vaccinated, and identifying as Black or African American was negatively associated with intention to get vaccinated. Other factors were moderately, weakly, or not at all associated with intention. CONCLUSIONS: Building trust in science and truthfully emphasizing the seriousness of catching COVID-19 should be further researched for their potential to support campaigns to encourage COVID-19 vaccination.

The question remains: how can we conduct diverse trials without exposing sub-groups of populations to potentially harmful drug exposure levels? The aim of this study was to build a knowledge-base of the effect of intrinsic/extrinsic factors on the disposition of several repurposed COVID-19 drugs. METHODS: PBPK models were used to study the change in PK of drugs repurposed for COVID-19 in geriatric patients, different race groups, organ impairment, DDI risks. These models were also used to predict epithelial lining fluid (ELF) exposure which is relevant for COVID-19 patients under elevated cytokine levels. RESULTS: The simulated PK profiles suggest no dose adjustments are required based on age and race for COVID-19 drugs; however, dose adjustments may be warranted for COVID-19 patients also exhibiting hepatic/renal impairment. PBPK model simulations suggest ELF exposure to attain a target concentration was adequate for most drugs, except for hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, atazanavir and lopinavir/ritonavir. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that systematically collated data on the ADME, human PK parameters, DDIs, and organ impairment can be used to verify simulated plasma and lung tissue exposure for drugs repurposed for COVID-19, justifying broader patient recruitment criteria. In addition, the PBPK model developed was used to study the effect of age and ethnicity on the PK of repurposed drugs, and to assess the correlation between lung exposure and relevant potency values from in vitro studies for SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Pharmacokinetics under the COVID-19 Storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

Local asymptotic stability is proved for both cases. Stability analysis shows that the orders of the fractional-order differential equation model can significantly affect the equilibriums in the two cells model. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the conclusions. Next, the sensitivity of model parameters is calculated, and the calculation results show that different parameters have different sensitivities. The most and least sensitive parameters in the two cells model and the 60 cells model are verified by numerical simulations. What is more, we compare the fractional-order model with the integer-order model by simulations, and the results show that the orders can significantly affect the dynamic and the phenotypes.","output":"Analysis of an improved fractional-order model of boundary formation in the Drosophila large intestine dependent on Delta-Notch pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Metagenomic next-generation sequencing has transformed the discovery and diagnosis of infectious disease, with the power to characterize the complete infectome (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites) of an individual host organism. However, the identification of novel pathogens has been complicated by widespread microbial contamination in commonly used laboratory reagents. Using total RNA sequencing (metatranscriptomics) we documented the presence of contaminant viral sequences in multiple libraries of blank negative control sequencing libraries that comprise a sterile water and reagent mix. Accordingly, we identified 14 viral sequences in 7 negative control sequencing libraries. As in previous studies, several circular replication-associated protein encoding (CRESS) DNA virus-like sequences were recovered in the blank libraries, as well as contaminating sequences from the RNA virus families Totiviridae, Tombusviridae and Lentiviridae. These data suggest that the contamination of common laboratory reagents is likely widespread and can comprise a wide variety of viruses. 3.

In this paper, we propose an augmented two-index formulation to find least cost vehicle routes to satisfy the set of customer requests under the constraints of time windows of the pickup and delivery locations along with the capacity constraints of the fleet of vehicles. We use branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the benchmark problem instances. The proposed formulation and the problem specific valid inequalities lead to more efficient solution performance as against the existing formulations.

Programmed cell death marker-1(PD-1) expression, a critical checkpoint for T cell exhaustion, can be modulated by interleukin-10, which also mediates apoptotic T cell cytopenia. We aimed to measure the level of PD-1 expression and to investigate its correlation with IL-10 serum levels in modulating T cell effector function, correlating the results with the level of severity of the disease. This study involved 40 patients with COVID-19 and 20 healthy controls. Using flow cytometry, the expression of PD-1 was determined on CD8+ T lymphocytes and CD4+ T lymphocytes. ELISA was used to determine the levels of IL-10 in the serum. We found a remarkable decrease in T cell counts with functionally exhausted surviving T cells in the patient groups, especially in patients with severe disease. PD-1 expression increased significantly in CD4+, CD8+, and total T cells, showing a higher expression in CD8+ T cells. The patient groups had significantly higher serum IL-10 levels than the control group. The ROC analysis demonstrated the predictive role of IL-10 levels in disease severity (65% sensitivity, 80% specificity, and AUC = 0.806). IL-10 serum levels and PD-1 expression in total T cells were positively correlated, suggesting that IL-10 participates in T cell exhaustion.

The R(0) of COVID-19 was estimated using the serial interval distribution and the number of incidence cases. The 30-day probable incidence and cumulative incidence were predicted using the assumption that daily incidence follows a Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Data analysis was done using earlyR and projections packages in R software. The maximum-likelihood value of R(0) was 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1?3.4) for the COVID-19 epidemic in the early 14 days and decreased to 1.13 (95% CI 1.03C1.25) by the end of day 42. The expected average number of new cases in Shahroud was 9.0  3.8 cases/day, which means an estimated total of 271 (95% CI: 178C383) new cases for the period between 02 April to 03 May 2020. By day 67 (27 April), the effective reproduction number (R(t)), which had a descending trend and was around 1, reduced to 0.70. Based on the R(t) for the last 21 days (days 46C67 of the epidemic), the prediction for 27 April to 26 May is a mean daily cases of 2.9  2.0 with 87 (48C136) new cases.

While most approaches to therapy are using repurposed drugs that were developed for other diseases, it is thought that targeting the biology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, can result in an effective therapeutic treatment. The coronavirus RNA cap structure is methylated by two viral methyltransferases that transfer methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). The proper methylation of the virus depends on the level of methionine in the host to form SAM. Herein, we propose to restrict methionine availability by treating the patient with oral recombinant methioninase, aiming to treat Covid-19. By restricting methionine we not only interdict viral replication, which depends on the viral RNA cap methyaltion, but also inhibit the proliferation of the infected cells, which have an increased requirement for methionine. Most importantly, the virally-induced T-cell- and macrophage-mediated cytokine storm, which seems to be a significant cause for Covid-19 deaths, can also be inhibited by restricting methionine, since T-cell and macrophrage activation greatly increases the methionine requirement for these cells. The evidence reviewed here suggests that oral recombinant methioninase could be a promising treatment for coronavirus patients.","output":"Oral Methioninase for Covid-19 Methionine-restriction Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biomonitoring wearable sensors based on two-dimensional nanomaterials have lately elicited keen research interest and potential for a new range of flexible nanoelectronic devices.

Real-time population screening and identification of groups in whom positivity is highest could help monitor spread and inform public health messaging and strategy. Methods: To develop a real-time screening process, we included results from nose and throat swabs and questionnaires taken 19 July 2020-17 July 2021 in the UK's national COVID-19 Infection Survey. Fortnightly, associations between SARS-CoV-2 positivity and 60 demographic and behavioural characteristics were estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders, considering multiple testing, collinearity, and reverse causality. Findings: Of 4,091,537 RT-PCR results from 482,677 individuals, 29,903 (0.73%) were positive. As positivity rose September-November 2020, rates were independently higher in younger ages, and those living in Northern England, major urban conurbations, more deprived areas, and larger households. Rates were also higher in those returning from abroad, and working in healthcare or outside of home. When positivity peaked December 2020-January 2021 (Alpha), high positivity shifted to southern geographical regions. With national vaccine roll-out from December 2020, positivity reduced in vaccinated individuals. Associations attenuated as rates decreased between February-May 2021. Rising positivity rates in June-July 2021 (Delta) were independently higher in younger, male, and unvaccinated groups. Few factors were consistently associated with positivity. 25/45 (56%) confirmed associations would have been detected later using 28-day rather than 14-day periods. Interpretation: Population-level demographic and behavioural surveillance can be a valuable tool in identifying the varying characteristics driving current SARS-CoV-2 positivity, allowing monitoring to inform public health policy.

This investigation aimed to longitudinally evaluate food procurement patterns, concern of virus exposure in grocery retailers, and food access challenges over the pandemic among a sample of households in Quebec, Canada. METHODS: Online surveys were collected at three time points of the pandemic: first wave in spring 2020 (lockdown period), summer 2020 (deconfinement period), and second wave in winter 2021 (curfew period). Respondents were the household's primary grocery shopper (n = 491). Non-parametric tests and multivariable logistic regression were conducted to compare responses over time and to evaluate characteristics of respondents who regularly used no-contact grocery methods (store pick-up or home delivery). RESULTS: Frequency of in-store grocery shopping was lowest during the lockdown (once per week or less), and significantly increased over time to resemble pre-pandemic frequency. Concern of virus exposure in grocery retailers and disinfection/discarding of food packaging was highest during the lockdown, but significantly decreased over time. At all time points, use of public transit, walking or cycling for grocery shopping was associated with regular use of no-contact grocery methods (curfew odds ratio (OR): 3.13 (95% confidence interval 1.60, 6.14).

In order to contain cost, we used conventional instruments and three transfascial ports placed in an umbilical incision, but we noted significant instrument clashes that originated at the port platforms. Therefore, we modified our technique by omitting ports for the working instruments. The technique allowed us to exchange instruments as necessary, maximized ergonomics, and prevented collisions from the bulky port platforms. Finally, the puncture left by the instrument alone did not require fascial closure at the termination of the procedure. Conclusion.

METHODS: We analyzed data from practices enrolled in RISE between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017. Eight quality measures in the areas of RA disease management, cardiovascular risk reduction, and patient safety were examined. Variability in performance was evaluated at the practice level. Multivariate linear models were used to predict change in measure performance by year and determine the effect of practice characteristics on change in performance over time. RESULTS: Data from 59,986 patients from 54 practices was examined. Mean age was 6214 years, 77% were female, 69% were Caucasian, and most patients were seen in a single-specialty group practice (46%). Average performance on measures related to RA treatments was consistently high (>90%) across the study period. Measures related to RA functional status and disease activity assessment had the greatest improvements over time (8.4% and 13.0% increase per year, respectively; p<0.001). Single-specialty group practices had the fastest rates of improvement over time across all measures. CONCLUSIONS: Among practices participating in RISE between 2015 to 2017, performance on most RA quality measures improved. Single specialty group practices saw the fastest rates of improvement over time. Identification of workflow patterns leading to dramatic improvements in quality of care will help guide process redesign to address gaps in priority areas, such as TB screening and blood pressure control.","output":"Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness (RISE) Practices See Significant Gains in Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality Measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe purpose of this systematic review is to highlight some of the business model changes restaurants, bars and beverage producers undertook to modify their operations in order to not only stay in business but also to better serve their employees and communities during the COVID-19 crisis.Design/methodology/approachAn analysis was conducted on 200 industry articles and categorized into three major themes: expansion of take-out/delivery, innovative practices, and community outreach/corporate support, each are further subdivided into additional themes.

Increased carbon dioxide re-inhalation and breathing resistance may result thereof and, in turn, may negatively impact metabolism and performance. OBJECTIVES: To deduce the impact of the surgical mask and filtering face piece type 2 (FFP2) or N95 respirator application on gas exchange (pulse-derived oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), carbon dioxide partial pressure (PCO(2)), carbon dioxide exhalation (VCO(2)) and oxygen uptake (VO(2))), pulmonary function (respiratory rate and ventilation) and physical performance (heart rate HR, peak power output W(peak)). METHODS: Systematic review with meta-analysis. Literature available in Medline/Pubmed, the Cochrane Library and the Web of Knowledge with the last search on the 6(th) of May 2021. Eligibility criteria: Randomised controlled parallel group or crossover trials (RCT), full-text availability, comparison of the acute effects of  1 intervention (surgical mask or FFP2/N95 application) to a control/comparator condition (i.e. no mask wearing). Participants were required to be healthy humans and > 16 years of age without conditions or illnesses influencing pulmonary function or metabolism. Risk of bias was rated using the crossover extension of the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool II. Standardised mean differences (SMD, Hedges' g) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated, overall and for subgroups based on mask and exercise type, as pooled effect size estimators in our random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Of the 1499 records retrieved, 14 RCTs (all crossover trials, high risk of bias) with 25 independent intervention arms (effect sizes per outcome) on 246 participants were included. Masks led to a decrease in SpO(2) during vigorous intensity exercise (6 effect sizes; SMD = ? 0.40 [95% CI: ? 0.70, ? 0.09], mostly attributed to FFP2/N95) and to a SpO(2)-increase during rest (5 effect sizes; SMD = 0.34 [95% CI: 0.04, 0.64]); no general effect of mask wearing on SpO(2) occurred (21 effect sizes, SMD = 0.34 [95% CI: 0.04, 0.64]). Wearing a mask led to a general oxygen uptake decrease (5 effect sizes, SMD = ? 0.44 [95% CI: ? 0.75, ? 0.14]), to slower respiratory rates (15 effect sizes, SMD = ? 0.25 [95% CI: ? 0.44, ? 0.06]) and to a decreased ventilation (11 effect sizes, SMD = ? 0.43 [95% CI: ? 0.74, ? 0.12]). Heart rate (25 effect sizes; SMD = 0.05 [95% CI: ? 0.09, 0.19]), W(peak) (9 effect sizes; SMD = ? 0.12 [95% CI: ? 0.39, 0.15]), PCO(2) (11 effect sizes; SMD = 0.07 [95% CI: ? 0.14, 0.29]) and VCO(2) (4 effect sizes, SMD = ? 0.30 [95% CI: ? 0.71, 0.10]) were not different to the control, either in total or dependent on mask type or physical activity status. CONCLUSION: The number of crossover-RCT studies was low and the designs displayed a high risk of bias. The within-mask- and -intensity-homogeneous effects on gas exchange kinetics indicated larger detrimental effects during exhausting physical activities. Pulse-derived oxygen saturation was increased during rest when a mask was applied, whereas wearing a mask during exhausting exercise led to decreased oxygen saturation. Breathing frequency and ventilation adaptations were not related to exercise intensity. FFP2/N95 and, to a lesser extent, surgical mask application negatively impacted the capacity for gas exchange and pulmonary function but not the peak physical performance.

At a time of limited capacity, it is important to match available EEG resources to children who are most likely to benefit. In this study we evaluated a prospective triage tool for estimating the likelihood of epileptiform abnormality in children's first out-patient EEG. METHODS: We prospectively triaged 1865 out-patient referrals to the largest Paediatric EEG laboratory in Ireland. Based on a structured algorithm, we dichotomized first EEG referrals into priority and non-priority groups and assigned one of 5 sub-levels based on anticipated EEG yield. EEGs were reported by a single Consultant in Clinical Neurophysiology. RESULTS: Triage designated 757 (41 %) EEG referrals as non-priority. Priority exceeded non-priority referrals for all age groups except children between 18 months and 3.5 years. EEGs showed a two-fold higher incidence of interictal epileptiform abnormalities for priority referrals (36 % vs 18 %, p < 0.001). Rates of interictal epileptiform abnormality correlated with the 5 sub-levels of triage (p < 0.01). Epileptiform yield was highest (39 %) for children over 5 years vs 17 % for those under 5 years (p < 0.00001); these rates increased to 49 % and 20 % respectively for priority referrals. CONCLUSION: Structured pre-test triage of EEG referrals can identify children who have the greatest likelihood of epileptiform abnormality. In a mixed population of Paediatric referrals, the epileptiform yield of first time EEG is 49 % for children over 5 years who are referred with an appropriate EEG indication. This is subject to much variability with epileptiform yields as low as 13 % in younger children with non-priority referrals. The use of a structured triage algorithm can help to optimise utility of EEG in situations of limited laboratory capacity.","output":"Measuring the effects of pre-test probability on out-patient first EEG investigation in children - A guide to evidence-based EEG triage in a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the importance of health literacy (HL) was addressed by public health researchers. We longitudinally examined the changes in general HL and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) between immediately before the COVID-19 outbreak and 1 year later, and how general HL before the outbreak was related to changes in HRQOL in the Japanese general population. METHODS: Among the Japanese residents aged 20C79 years who participated in our previous study in 2017, 826 were followed-up via self-administered questionnaires in January 2020 and February 2021, for the purposes of this study. The HRQOL was measured using the SF-8, a short version of the SF-36 Health Survey, and general HL was measured using the short form of the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HL-SF12) in the 2020 and 2021 surveys. RESULTS: The physical and mental dimensions of HRQOL as well as general HL declined significantly from immediately before the COVID-19 outbreak to 1 year later (p = .010, p < .001 and p < .001, respectively). The decline in HRQOL, especially the mental dimension, was more significant among women. A lower economic status was also related to a greater decline in HRQOL (p = .026 for the physical dimension and p = .012 for the mental dimension). Higher general HL before the COVID-19 outbreak was associated with a lesser decline in HRQOL in both the physical and mental dimensions (p = .040 and p < .001, respectively) after controlling for possible confounding variables such as gender and economic status. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare support is crucial for vulnerable populations during and after the pandemic. General HL may be important for attenuating the decline in HRQOL, by enabling effective use of health information and adaptive behaviors toward health threats.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Competency-based assessment tools should be supported by robust validity evidence to be used reliably for evaluation of operative skills. The contemporary framework of validity relies on five sources of evidence: content, response process, internal structure, relation to other variables, and consequences. METHODS A systematic search of 8 databases was conducted for studies containing procedure-specific operative assessment tools in general surgery. The validity evidence supporting each tool was assessed and scored in alignment with the contemporary framework of validity. Methodological rigour of studies was assessed with the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI). The educational utility of each tool was assessed with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) framework. RESULTS There were 28 studies meeting inclusion criteria and 23 unique tools were assessed. Scores for validity evidence varied widely between tools, ranging from 3 - 14 (maximum 15). MERSQI scores assessing the quality of study methodology were also variable (8.5-15.5, maximum 16.5). Direct reporting of educational utility criteria was limited. CONCLUSIONS This study has identified a small group of procedure-specific operative assessment tools in general surgery. Many of these tools have limited validity evidence and have not been studied sufficiently to be used reliably in high-stakes summative assessments. As general surgery transitions to competency-based training, a more robust library of operative assessment tools will be required to support resident education and evaluation.","output":"Validity Evidence for Procedure-Specific Competence Assessment Tools in General Surgery: A Scoping Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic disease named Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) of epochal dimension.

The era of transplantation (log7.378/9.657; p < 0.0001) and indication of acute liver failure (log = 1.944/2.667; HR = 2.015/1.772; p = 0.0114/0.002) impairs patient/graft survival significantly in the multivariate analysis. Furthermore, patient survival is worsened by re-transplantation (log = 1.755; HR = 1.744; p = 0.0176) and prolonged waiting times in high-urgency status (log = 2.588; HR = 1.073; p = 0.0026), whereas the indication of biliary atresia improved outcome (log = 1.502; HR = 0.575; p = 0.0315). Graft survival was additionally impaired by pre-existing portal vein thrombosis (log = 1.482; HR = 2.016; p = 0.0330). (4) Conclusions: Despite more complex indications, patient and graft survival after pLTx continue to improve.. Acute liver failure remains the indication with poorest outcome, and listing for high urgency liver transplantation should be considered carefully and early to keep waiting time on HU list short. Furthermore, pre-transplant portal vein thrombosis should be prevented whenever possible to improve graft survival.","output":"Recipient-Specific Risk Factors Impairing Patient and Graft Outcome after Pediatric Liver TransplantationAnalysis of 858 Transplantations in 38 Years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 is a very serious deadly disease that has been announced as a pandemic by the world health organization (WHO).

Methods and approaches to support the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test have begun to take place in the literature. In this study, chest X-ray images, which can be accessed easily and quickly, were used because the covid-19 attacked the respiratory systems. Classification performances with support vector machines have been obtained by using the features extracted with residual networks (ResNet-50), one of the convolutional neural network models, from these images. While Covid-19 detection is obtained with support vector machines (SVM)-quadratic with the highest sensitivity value of 9635% with the 5 -fold cross-validation method, the highest overall performance value has been detected with both SVM-quadratic and SVM-cubic above 99%.

Methods: The clinical significance of TET2 expression in endometrial carcinoma was analyzed from TCGA public database. Eighty-eight patients with endometrial cancer and 20 patients with normal proliferative endometrium were enrolled in this study. TET2 and 5hmC were respectively detected by Immunohistochemistry and ELISA in endometrial tissues. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyze relationships between TET2 and 5hmC and the overall survival of EC patients. Endometrial cell proliferation was assessed after TET2 gene knockdown. Western blotting and real-time PCR were used to detect the effect of metformin on TET2 expression and to explore whether AMPK is involved in metformin-mediated TET2 regulation. Results: The clinical significance of expression of TET2 in endometrial cancer from TCGA public database confirmed that TET2 expression was significantly down-regulated in cancer samples and TET2 expression was also significantly different among different histopathological samples and TET2 is down-regulated in advanced, high-grade, and relapsed endometrial carcinoma tissues(P<0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that TET2 and 5hmC levels were significantly lower in endometrial adenocarcinoma(P<0.05). TET2 expression was correlated with the degree of EC differentiation (P < 0.05). 5hmC levels were associated with clinical stage, differentiation, the depth of myometrial invasion, and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). The mean survival time of patients with negative staining for TET2 and 5hmC was shorter than that of patients with positive staining for both markers (P<0.05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that TET2 expression was an independent risk factor for prognosis in patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma (HR = 14.520, 95% CI was 1.From 060 to 198.843, P = 0.045). siRNA-mediated TET2 knockdown increased the proliferation of EC cells. Metformin increased the levels of TET2 and 5hmC in EC cells. AMPK was involved in the regulation of TET2 by metformin. Conclusions: TET2 may play an important role in EC development and may be a prognostic marker.

Based on an optical simulation, the rectangular cavity-type QD cap was designed with an opening window on the top surface. Red QD caps were fabricated using a typical injection molding technique and CdSe/ZnS QDs with a core/shell structure whose average size was ~6 nm. Red QD caps were applied to conventional 6-inch, 15-W white LED downlighting consisting of 72 LEDs arrayed concentrically. The red QD caps placed over white LEDs enhanced the red components in the long-wavelength range resulting in the increase of the color rendering index (CRI) from 82.9 to 94.5. The correlated color temperature was tuned easily in a wide range by adopting various configurations consisting of different QD caps. The spatial and angular homogeneities were secured on the emitting area because QD caps placed over the white LEDs did not exhibit any substantial optical path length difference.

To investigate the significance of this intraleader ORF (ILO), an expression plasmid was generated carrying a DNA copy of the subgenomic mRNA7 behind a T7 promoter. Capped RNA transcribed from this construct was shown to direct, in an in vitro translation system, the synthesis of leader peptide as well as N protein. Site-directed mutations aimed to either optimize or weaken the sequence context of the ILO start codon affected leader peptide synthesis as predicted; no peptide was detected when the initiation codon was incapacitated. Translation of the downstream N gene was inversely affected by leader peptide production, consistent with a ribosomal leaky scanning mechanism. To investigate the role of the leader peptide in the EAV replication life cycle we generated, using an infectious EAV cDNA clone, two mutant viruses in one of which the ILO start codon was in an optimal Kozak context for translation initiation while in the other the codon was again incapacitated. Surprizingly, both mutant viruses were equally viable and exhibited similar phenotypes in BHK-21 cells. However, their replication kinetics and viral yields were reduced relative to that of the wild-type parental virus, as were their plaque sizes. Importantly, the mutations introduced into the viruses appeared to be rapidly and precisely repaired upon passaging. Already after one viral passage a significant fraction of the viruses had regained the wild-type sequence as well as its phenotype. The results demonstrate that EAV replication is not dependent on the synthesis of the intraleader peptide. Rather, the leader peptide does not seem to have any function in the EAV life cycle. As we discuss, the available data indicate that the ILO 5( nucleotide sequence per se, not its functioning in translation initiation, is of critical importance for EAV replication.","output":"The Intraleader AUG Nucleotide Sequence Context is Important for Equine Arteritis Virus Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The genomes of umbraviruses differ from those of most other viruses in that they do not encode a coat protein, and thus no virus particles are formed in infected plants. Protection of umbraviral RNA outside the host plant, during vector transmission, utilizes the coat protein of an assistor luteovirus, but this review focuses on the mechanisms that compensate for the lack of a coat protein in processes within the host plant. As well as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, umbravirus genomes encode two other proteins from almost completely overlapping open reading frames. One of these is a cell-to-cell movement protein that can mediate the transport of homologous and heterologous viral RNAs through plasmodesmata without the participation of a coat protein. The other, the ORF3 protein, binds to viral RNA to form filamentous ribonucleoprotein particles that have elements of helical structure. It serves to stabilize the RNA and facilitates its transport through the vascular system of the plant. It may also be involved in protection of the viral RNA from the plant's defensive RNA-silencing response, although it is not a suppressor of silencing. The ORF3 protein also enters the cell nucleus, specifically targeting the nucleolus. Although the function of this localization is unknown, the ORF3 protein may provide a valuable tool for investigating plant nucleolar function.","output":"Molecular biology of umbraviruses: phantom warriors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to extract phylogenetic information from DNA sequences, the new normalized k-word average relative distance is proposed in this paper.

Without any clear indications of abatement, the disease has become a major healthcare threat across the globe, owing to prolonged incubation period, high prevalence, and absence of existing drugs or vaccines. Development of COVID-19 vaccine is being considered as the most efficient strategy to curtail the ongoing pandemic. Following publication of genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, globally extensive research and development work has been in progress to develop a vaccine against the disease. The use of genetic engineering, recombinant technologies, and other computational tools has led to the expansion of several promising vaccine candidates. The range of technology platforms being evaluated, including virus-like particles, peptides, nucleic acid (DNA and RNA), recombinant proteins, inactivated virus, live attenuated viruses, and viral vectors (replicating and non-replicating) approaches, are striking features of the vaccine development strategies. Viral vectors, the next-generation vaccine platforms, provide a convenient method for delivering vaccine antigens into the host cell to induce antigenic proteins which can be tailored to arouse an assortment of immune responses, as evident from the success of smallpox vaccine and Ervebo vaccine against Ebola virus.

Pre-pandemic sera tested on the Abbott, in-house ELISA, cPASS and Euroimmun S1 protein assays were from healthy volunteers and patients with respiratory infections and/or symptoms (n=113). Pre-pandemic sera tested on the Euroimmun N protein, EDI IgG and Roche assays were archived blood bank sera (n=40). Pandemic samples from patients at Auckland City Hospital and Middlemore Hospital, March to May 2020, were tested on all platforms (n=103), with the exception of the Euroimmun N protein and EDI assays on which only Auckland City Hospital samples were tested (n=90). Due to volume constraints, all pandemic samples were not tested on the Abbott assay. This evaluation demonstrates that the IgG, total antibody (IgG plus IgM) and surrogate viral neutralisation assays are broadly comparable with sensitivities between 77.8-100% and specificities of 94.2-100%. In contrast, the IgA and IgM assays demonstrated poor specificity and sensitivity, respectively. This study presents a local evaluation of nine serological assays, with results specific to the epidemiological context of New Zealand. The IgG, the total antibody and surrogate viral neutralisation assays demonstrated high specificity and reasonable sensitivity. The application of these assays needs to incorporate local laboratory workflow and logistics, with respect to anticipated testing volume.

Methods: From January 25 to March 31, 2020, 581 callers with COVID-19 related psychological problems (COVID-19 callers) and 695 callers without COVID-19 related psychological problems (non-COVID-19 callers) to the Beijing Psychological Support Hotline were recruited. The demographic characteristics, primary concerns, suicidal ideation, depression and other psychological problems were compared between the two groups of callers. Results: Both groups of the callers were predominantly female and highly educated. The primary concerns reported by the COVID-19 callers were depression (38.4%) and family relationship problems (26.0%). As compared to the non-COVID-19 callers, COVID-19 callers reported more financial (7.4%) and work related problems (4.1%), but revealed lower prevalence of suicidal ideation (47.9% v 71.3%), lower degrees of psychological distress (74.3 v 79.1), intensity of suicidal ideation (0 v 50), severity of depression (57.9 v 65.1), and higher degree of hopefulness (41.1 v 33.6) (all p values < 0.01). Additionally, a lower proportion of COVID-19 callers met the criteria of depressed mood (51.6% v 61.4%) and other 4 symptoms than the non-COVID-19 callers (p values < 0.01).

The solution of multiple RdRp structures has been one of the main axes of research in the race against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Several hypotheses of the mechanism of inhibition of RdRp by remdesivir have been proposed, although open questions remain. This work uses molecular dynamics simulations to explore the impact of remdesivir and two analogues as incoming nucleotides and of up to four incorporations of remdesivir along the primer strand on RdRp. The simulation results suggest that the overall structure and the dynamical behavior of RdRp are destabilized by remdesivir and the two analogues in the incoming position. The incorporation of remdesivir along the primer strand impacts specific non-bonded interactions between the nascent RNA and the polymerase subunit, as well as the overall dynamical networks on RdRp. The strongest impact on the structure and dynamics are observed after three incorporations, when remdesivir is located at position -A3, in agreement with previously reported experimental and computational results.

The quality scores of literature are different, and the incidence of clinical manifestations and laboratory tests results vary greatly. Therefore, a systematic retrospective meta-analysis is needed to determine the incidence of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from databases, such as PubMed, Web of science, EMBASE, Johns Hopkins University, and Chinese databases were analysed from January 31, 2020 to October 20, 2020. High-quality articles were selected for analysis based on a quality standard score. A meta-analysis of random effects was used to determine the prevalence of comorbidities and subgroup meta-analysis to examine the changes in the estimated prevalence in different subgroups. RESULTS: Seventy-one articles involving 11,671 children were included in the study. The incidence of fever, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, asymptomatic patients, nervous system symptoms, and chest tightness was 55.8%, 56.8%, 14.4%, 21.1%, 6.7%, and 6.1%, respectively. The incidence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome was 6.2%. Laboratory examination results showed that lymphocytes decreased in 12% and leukocytes decreased in 8.8% of patients, whereas white blood cells increased in 7.8% of patients. Imaging showed abnormalities in 66.5%, and ground-glass opacities were observed in 36.9% patients. Epidemiological history was present in 85.2% cases; severe disease rate was 3.33%. The mortality rate was 0.28%. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in children are mild, and laboratory indicators and imaging manifestations are atypical. While screening children for COVID-19, in addition to assessing patients for symptoms as the first step of screening, the epidemiological history of patients should be obtained.","output":"Epidemiological features of coronavirus disease 2019 in children: a meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ambient intelligence plays a crucial role in healthcare situations. It provides a certain way to deal with emergencies to provide the essential resources such as nearest hospitals and emergency stations promptly to avoid deaths. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, several artificial intelligence techniques have been used. However, situation awareness is a key aspect to handling any pandemic situation. The situation-awareness approach gives patients a routine life where they are continuously monitored by caregivers through wearable sensors and alert the practitioners in case of any patient emergency. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a situation-aware mechanism to detect Covid-19 systems early and alert the user to be self-aware regarding the situation to take precautions if the situation seems unlikely to be normal. We provide Belief-Desire-Intention intelligent reasoning mechanism for the system to analyze the situation after acquiring the data from the wearable sensors and alert the user according to their environment.

Limited research in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have assessed healthcare worker stances towards genomics. This study aimed to assess healthcare workers knowledge and attitudes on genetic testing. A cross-sectional study was conducted among healthcare workers practicing in either public or private hospitals or clinics as pharmacists, nurses, physicians, managers, and allied health. Participants were recruited randomly and via snowball techniques. Surveys were collected between April and September 2019; out of 552 respondents, 63.4% were female, the mean age was 38 (9.6) years old. The mean knowledge score was 5.2 (2.3) out of nine, which shows a fair level of knowledge. The scores of respondents of pharmacy were 5.1 (2.5), medicine 6.0 (2.0), and nursing 4.8 (2.1). All participants exhibited a fair knowledge level about genetic testing and pharmacogenomics. Of the respondents, 91.9% showed a positive attitude regarding availability of genetic testing. The top identified barrier to implementation was the cost of testing (62%), followed by lack of training or education and insurance coverage (57.8% and 57.2%, respectively). Building upon the positive attitudes and tackling the barriers and challenges will pave the road for full implementation of genetic testing and pharmacogenomics in the UAE. We recommend empowering healthcare workers by improving needed and tailored competencies related to their area of practice.

In the current COVID-19 pandemic, surprisingly though, most of the current research concentrates on the control by drugs and vaccines, while comparatively little scientific inquiry focuses on future prevention. Already in 2012, the World Bank recommended to engage in a systemic One Health approach for zoonoses control, considering integrated surveillance-response and control of human and animal diseases for primarily economic reasons. First examples, like integrated West Nile virus surveillance in mosquitos, wild birds, horses and humans in Italy show evidence of financial savings from a closer cooperation of human and animal health sectors. Provided a zoonotic origin can be ascertained for the COVID-19 pandemic, integrated wildlife, domestic animal and humans disease surveillance-response may contribute to prevent future outbreaks. In conclusion, the earlier a zoonotic pathogen can be detected in the environment, in wildlife or in domestic animals; and the better human, animal and environmental surveillance communicate with each other to prevent an outbreak, the lower are the cumulative costs.","output":"Towards integrated surveillance-response systems for the prevention of future pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous study reported that preadmission insulin treatment in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and concurrent diabetes was associated with a significantly increased odds of mortality.

There are many ways to achieve this, but with current circumstances, certain modalities stand out as being the most valid and are certainly worth greater consideration. Here we review the effects that particular immuno-strengthening activities can have on limiting the severity of COVID-19 disease as well as preventing virus infection. Physical activity, in particular, should not be discounted as an important method of prevention of viral diseases as it triggers many biological processes within the human body which in turn lead to heightened natural defences against viral infections. When exercise is performed in forested areas, these protective health benefits may be increased since many plant species emit biogenic volatile compounds (VOCs) which, when inhaled, have many protective properties. These VOCs have been shown in particular to have immunostimulatory effects on the human body and, thus, they could be of use in the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19. Being amongst trees may also help to alleviate stress and anxiety, lowering cortisol levels and consequently helping the proper functioning of the immune system. In the following work, we have performed an analysis of the available scientific literature which looks at the effects of physical exercise as well as forest-bathing on the immune systems ability to fight disease, especially of course as it relates to COVID-19.

Study Design Trends in whether prenatal care visits were conducted in-person or via telehealth were analyzed by week for a 5-week period from March 9 to April 12 at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC)-affiliated prenatal practices in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic. Visits were analyzed for maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) and general obstetrical faculty practices, as well as a clinic system serving patients with public insurance. The proportion of visits that were telehealth was analyzed by visit type by week. A survey and semistructured interviews of providers were conducted evaluating resources and obstacles in the uptake of telehealth. Results During the study period, there were 4,248 visits, of which approximately one-third were performed by telehealth ( n = 1,352, 31.8%). By the fifth week, 56.1% of generalist visits, 61.5% of MFM visits, and 41.5% of clinic visits were performed via telehealth. A total of 36 providers completed the survey and 11 were interviewed. Accessing technology and performing visits, documentation, and follow-up using the telehealth electronic medical record were all viewed favorably by providers. In transitioning to telehealth, operational challenges were more significant for health clinics than for MFM and generalist faculty practices with patients receiving public insurance experiencing greater difficulties and barriers to care. Additional resources on the patient and operational level were required to optimize attendance at in-person and video visits for clinic patients. Conclusion Telehealth was rapidly implemented in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic and was viewed favorably by providers. Limited barriers to care were observed for practices serving patients with commercial insurance. However, to optimize access for patients with Medicaid, additional patient-level and operational supports were required. Key Points: Telehealth uptake differed based on insurance.

HUC-MSCs differentiate, among others, into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes and have the ability to secrete cytokines. The possibility of noninvasive harvesting and low immunogenicity of HUC-MSCs give them a unique advantage in clinical applications. In recent years, HUC-MSCs have been widely used in clinical practice, and some progress has been made in their use for therapeutic purposes. MAIN BODY: This article describes two aspects of the clinical therapeutic effects of HUC-MSCs. On the one hand, it explains the benefits and mechanisms of HUC-MSC treatment in various diseases. On the other hand, it summarizes the results of basic research on HUC-MSCs related to clinical applications. The first part of this review highlights several functions of HUC-MSCs that are critical for their therapeutic properties: differentiation into terminal cells, immune regulation, paracrine effects, anti-inflammatory effects, anti-fibrotic effects, and regulating non-coding RNA. These characteristics of HUC-MSCs are discussed in the context of diabetes and its complications, liver disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, arthritis, brain injury and cerebrovascular diseases, heart diseases, spinal cord injury, respiratory diseases, viral infections, and other diseases. The second part emphasizes the need to establish an HUC-MSC cell bank, discusses tumorigenicity of HUC-MSCs and the characteristics of different in vitro generations of these cells in the treatment of diseases, and provides technical and theoretical support for the clinical applications of HUC-MSCs.

METHODS: Outbreak investigations were triggered by recognition of case clusters in the VL surveillance system established for the elimination program. Investigations included ascertainment of all VL cases by date of fever onset, household mapping and structured collection of risk factor data. RESULTS: VL outbreaks were investigated in 13 villages in 10 blocks of 7 districts. Data were collected for 20,670 individuals, of whom 272 were diagnosed with VL between 2012 and 2019. Risk was significantly higher among 10C19 year-olds and adults 35 or older compared to children younger than 10 years. Outbreak confirmation triggered vector control activities and heightened surveillance. VL cases strongly clustered in tolas (hamlets within villages) in which > 66% of residents self-identified as scheduled caste or scheduled tribe (SC/ST); 79.8% of VL cases occurred in SC/ST tolas whereas only 24.2% of the population resided in them. Other significant risk factors included being an unskilled non-agricultural laborer, migration for work in a brick kiln, living in a kuccha (mud brick) house, household crowding, habitually sleeping outside or on the ground, and open defecation.

The COVID-19 is one of the deadliest pandemics in history due to its high mortality rate in a short period. Many approaches have been adopted for disease minimization and eradication. In this paper, we studied the impact of various constant and time-dependent variable control measures coupled with vaccination on the dynamics of COVID-19. The optimal control theory is used to optimize the model and set an effective control intervention for the infection. Initially, we formulate the mathematical epidemic model for the COVID-19 without variable controls. The model basic mathematical assessment is presented. The nonlinear least-square procedure is utilized to parameterize the model from actuals cases reported in Pakistan. A well-known technique based on statistical tools known as the Latin-hypercube sampling approach (LHS) coupled with the partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) is applied to present the model global sensitivity analysis. Based on global sensitivity analysis, the COVID-19 vaccine model is reformulated to obtain a control problem by introducing three time dependent control variables for isolation, vaccine efficacy and treatment enhancement represented by [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] , respectively. The necessary optimality conditions of the control problem are derived via the optimal control theory. Finally, the simulation results are depicted with and without variable controls using the well-known RungeCKutta numerical scheme.

In this article, publicly available data are used to track the nature of innovation across all forms of ventilators submitted under the EUA pathway. We found that the EUA encouraged innovation in the ventilator industry, as indicated by new entrants to the medical device industry, a shift in the types of ventilators submitted for approval, and a wide variety of innovations. It also promoted new management practices to facilitate innovation, such as frugal design, a broader range of collaboration, and the use of open-source designs; these practices can be more widely used by industry to reduce costs, increase innovation, and serve traditionally underserved markets.","output":"Can Regulatory Efforts Motivate Innovation?

We show that these vaccine formulations elicit high antibody titres in mice that were immunised on Days 0, 21 and 42; and that these antibodies neutralise SARS-CoV-2 variants VIC31 (with Spike: D614G mutation), Delta and Omicron (BA.1.1) VOC. Compared to VIC31, there was an average 14.4-fold reduction in neutralisation against BA.1.1 for the three monomeric, and 16.5-fold reduction for the three trimeric antigen-adjuvant combinations; the corresponding values against Delta were 2.5 and 3.0. Our findings suggest that monomeric formulations are suitable for the upcoming Phase I human clinical trials, and that there is potential for improving efficacy with vaccine matching to improve responses against emerging variants. These findings are consistent with in silico modelling and AlphaFold predictions which show that while oligomeric presentation can be generally beneficial, it can make important epitopes inaccessible and elicit unwanted titres against the oligomerisation domain.

METHODS: One hundred forty patients referred for FDG PET/CT during February and March 2021 after first or second vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna were retrospectively included. FDG-avidity of ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes was measured and compared. Assuming no knowledge of prior vaccination, metastatic risk was analyzed by two readers and the clinical impact was evaluated. RESULTS: FDG PET/CT showed FDG-avid lymph nodes ipsilateral to the vaccine injection in 75/140 (54%) patients with a mean SUV(max) of 5.1 (range 2.0 C 17.3). FDG-avid lymph nodes were more frequent in patients vaccinated with Moderna than Pfizer-BioNTech (36/50 [72%] vs. 39/90 [43%] cases, p < 0.001). Metastatic risk of unilateral FDG-avid axillary lymph nodes was rated unlikely in 52/140 (37%), potential in 15/140 (11%), and likely in 8/140 (6%) cases. Clinical management was affected in 17/140 (12%) cases. CONCLUSIONS: FDG-avid axillary lymph nodes are common after COVID-19 vaccination. The avidity of lymph nodes is more frequent in Moderna compared to that in Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. To avoid relatively frequent clinical dilemmas, we recommend carefully taking the history for prior vaccination in patients undergoing FDG PET/CT and administering the vaccine contralateral to primary cancer. KEY POINTS: ? PET/CT showed FDG-avid axillary lymph nodes ipsilateral to the vaccine injection site in 54% of 140 oncological patients after COVID-19 vaccination. ? FDG-avid lymphadenopathy was observed significantly more frequently in Moderna compared to patients receiving Pfizer-BioNTech-vaccines. ?

MethodsWe enrolled 378 healthcare workers (255 women, 123 men) whose Ab titers 3 and 6 months after the second dose were analyzed in our previous study and whose characteristics and adverse effects were collected previously using a structured self-report questionnaire. ResultsMedian age was 44 years. While injection-site symptoms occurred with almost equal frequency between the first and second doses, systemic adverse effects, such as general fatigue and fever, were significantly more frequent after the second dose than after the first. Multivariate analysis showed that fever was significantly correlated with female sex for the second dose (odds ratio [OR], 2.139; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 1.185-3.859), older age for the first dose (OR, 0.962; 95%CI, 0.931-0.994) and second dose (OR, 0.957; 95%CI, 0.936-0.979), and dyslipidemia for the first dose (OR, 8.750; 95%CI, 1.814-42.20).

This essay looks at how three mainstream bioethics theories (utilitarianism, deontology, Rawlsianism) systematically fail frontline hospital workers who are responsible for rationing medical triage during the COVID-19 pandemic. Taking the pandemic response in New York City hospitals as an example, it then argues that the failures of these theories compounds the sense of unavoidable moral failure that additionally burdens these workers with psychological trauma. I conclude that the bioethics protocols employed in most major hospitals function alongside neoliberal governmentality, as an extension of what feminist bioethicist Shelley Tremain calls the apparatus of disability. Importantly, for Tremain, the apparatus of disability both produces disability (as a social category) and naturalizes impairment (by equating difference with disadvantage).

Previously, we reported the development of human therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) exhibiting very high protective ability. These mAbs recognize epitopes on the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 that is considered to represent the main rout of receptor engagement by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The recent emergence of viral variants emphasizes the notion that efficient antibody treatments need to rely on mAbs against several distinct key epitopes in order to circumvent the occurrence of therapy escape-mutants. Here we report the isolation and characterization of 12 neutralizing mAbs, identified by screening a phage-display library constructed from lymphatic cells collected from severe COVID-19 patients. The antibodies target three distinct epitopes on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2, one of them defining a major site of vulnerability of the virus. Extensive characterization of these mAbs suggests a neutralization mechanism which relies both on amino-acid and N-glycan recognition on the virus, and involvement of receptors other than the hACE2 on the target cell. Two of the selected mAbs, which demonstrated superior neutralization potency in vitro, were further evaluated in vivo, demonstrating their ability to fully protect K18-hACE2 transgenic mice even when administered at low doses and late after infection. The study demonstrates the high potential of the mAbs for therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underlines the possible role of the NTD in mediating infection of host cells via alternative cellular portals other than the canonical ACE2 receptor.","output":"Therapeutic antibodies, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike N-terminal domain, protect lethally infected K18-hACE2 mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY: Here, we describe a case of a patient presenting with adrenocorticotrophic hormone-independent Cushings syndrome in a context of primary bilateral macronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia.

Herein we report development and characterization of a rapidly deployable COVID-19 mouse model. C57BL/6J (B6) mice expressing hACE2 in the lung were transduced by oropharyngeal delivery of the recombinant human adenovirus type 5 that expresses hACE2 (Ad5-hACE2). Mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at Day 4 after transduction and developed interstitial pneumonia associated with perivascular inflammation, accompanied by significantly higher viral load in lungs at Days 3, 6, and 12 after infection compared with Ad5-empty control group. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in pneumocytes in alveolar septa. Transcriptomic analysis of lungs demonstrated that the infected Ad5-hACE mice had a significant increase in IFN-dependent chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl10, and genes associated with effector T-cell populations including Cd3 g, Cd8a, and Gzmb.

This success, however also depends on the evasion of a multitude of antiviral signaling mechanisms. Many viruses are capable of averting antiviral signals through modulation of host cell signaling pathways. Apoptotic inhibition, for example, is a universal intracellular antiviral response, which prolongs cellular survival and allows viruses to complete their life cycle. Ongoing apoptotic inhibition contributes to the establishment of latent and chronic infections, and has been implicated in viral oncogenesis. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway has become recognized as being pivotal to the inhibition of apoptosis and cellular survival. Thus, modulation of this pathway provides viruses with a mechanism whereby they can increase their survival, in addition to other established mechanisms such as expression of viral onco-genes and direct inhibition of proapoptotic proteins. Recent research has revealed that this pathway is up-regulated by a number of viruses during both short-term acute infections and long-term latent or chronic infections. During acute infections PI3K-Akt signaling helps to create an environment favorable for virus replication and virion assembly. In the case of long-term infections, modulation of PI3K-Akt signaling by specific viral products is believed to help create a favorable environment for virus persistence, and contribute to virus-mediated cellular transformation.","output":"The Role of Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase-Akt Signaling in Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance There is limited information on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing and infection among pediatric patients across the United States.

Compared with White patients, those of Black, Hispanic, and Asian race/ethnicity had lower rates of testing (Black: odds ratio [OR], 0.70 [95% CI, 0.68-0.72]; Hispanic: OR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.63-0.67]; Asian: OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.57-0.63]); however, they were significantly more likely to have positive test results (Black: OR, 2.66 [95% CI, 2.43-2.90]; Hispanic: OR, 3.75 [95% CI, 3.39-4.15]; Asian: OR, 2.04 [95% CI, 1.69-2.48]). Older age (5-11 years: OR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.13-1.38]; 12-17 years: OR, 1.92 [95% CI, 1.73-2.12]; 18-24 years: OR, 3.51 [95% CI, 3.11-3.97]), public payer (OR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.31-1.57]), outpatient testing (OR, 2.13 [1.86-2.44]), and emergency department testing (OR, 3.16 [95% CI, 2.72-3.67]) were also associated with increased risk of infection. In univariate analyses, nonmalignant chronic disease was associated with lower likelihood of testing, and preexisting respiratory conditions were associated with lower risk of positive test results (standardized ratio [SR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.73-0.84]). However, several other diagnosis groups were associated with a higher risk of positive test results: malignant disorders (SR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.19-1.93]), cardiac disorders (SR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.05-1.32]), endocrinologic disorders (SR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.31-1.75]), gastrointestinal disorders (SR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.04-1.38]), genetic disorders (SR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.00-1.40]), hematologic disorders (SR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.06-1.47]), musculoskeletal disorders (SR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.07-1.30]), mental health disorders (SR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.10-1.30]), and metabolic disorders (SR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.24-1.61]). Among the 5374 patients with positive test results, 359 (7%) were hospitalized for respiratory, hypotensive, or COVID-19-specific illness. Of these, 99 (28%) required intensive care unit services, and 33 (9%) required mechanical ventilation. The case fatality rate was 0.2% (8 of 5374). The number of patients with a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease in early 2020 was 40% lower (259 vs 433 and 430) than in 2018 or 2019. Conclusions and Relevance In this large cohort study of US pediatric patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were low, and clinical manifestations were typically mild. Black, Hispanic, and Asian race/ethnicity; adolescence and young adulthood; and nonrespiratory chronic medical conditions were associated with identified infection. Kawasaki disease diagnosis is not an effective proxy for multisystem inflammatory syndrome of childhood.","output":"Assessment of 135 794 Pediatric Patients Tested for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Across the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"\\"Societies unveil their entrails during a crisis and hide or conceal them in normal situations\\" is the premise of this essay that offers a propositional critique of the foundations of civilization by characterizing some revelations from the COVID-19 pandemic that seriously compromises the globalized world. Especially the neoliberal myth as the only way of human progress, and technological development as the essence of social progress and main reason for scientific research. Among the significant revelations is the dismantling of the Welfare state and public health services, which render the population's vulnerability in the face of pandemics. Planetary devastation favors its emergence, and the correlation between the despondency of human activities and the (fleeting) improvement of planetary life, which denotes the radical incompatibility between the permanence of neoliberal capitalism that degrades everything and preservation and care of life in its infinite diversity, including human life! Another notion of human progress is proposed: the rise of values involved in the coexistence, and the spiritual, intellectual, and moral growth of the human condition in harmony with the planetary ecosystem. Regarding the deep reasons for the catastrophe, it is argued that it is humanity itself by its way of being, thinking, acting, living together and relating to the planet.

This proteolytic processing, unusually extensive for an enveloped virus entry protein, is mediated by cysteine cathepsins, a family of endosomal/lysosomal proteases. Previous work has shown that cleavage of GP by cathepsin B (CatB) is specifically required to generate a critical entry intermediate. The functions of this intermediate are not well understood. We used a forward genetic strategy to investigate this CatB-dependent step. Specifically, we generated a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus bearing EBOV GP as its sole entry glycoprotein and used it to select viral mutants resistant to a CatB inhibitor. We obtained mutations at six amino acid positions in GP that independently confer complete resistance. All of the mutations reside at or near the GP1-GP2 intersubunit interface in the membrane-proximal base of the prefusion GP trimer. This region forms a part of the \\"clamp\\" that holds the fusion subunit GP2 in its metastable prefusion conformation. Biochemical studies suggest that most of the mutations confer CatB independence not by altering specific cleavage sites in GP but rather by inducing conformational rearrangements in the prefusion GP trimer that dramatically enhance its susceptibility to proteolysis. The remaining mutants did not show the preceding behavior, indicating the existence of multiple mechanisms for acquiring CatB independence during entry. Altogether, our findings suggest that CatB cleavage is required to facilitate the triggering of viral membrane fusion by destabilizing the prefusion conformation of EBOV GP.","output":"A forward genetic strategy reveals destabilizing mutations in the Ebolavirus glycoprotein that alter its protease dependence during cell entry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that led to an unprecedented crisis with significant health, social, and economic repercussions presented more serious concerns for those living with some chronic conditions such as epilepsy.

A cross-sectional study was conducted through telephone interviews, targeting 213 caregivers of pediatric patients with epilepsy, belonging to underserved areas of Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan. A simple questionnaire was designed to record the responses of participants relevant to the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 pandemic and their knowledge about possible ways that can be accessed for the management of epilepsy during an ongoing pandemic. The current study, which holds 77% of the respondents from rural areas and 23% from urban settings, showed that partial measures of lockdown taken to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19 resulted in adverse economic and health outcomes in the said population including cancelation of follow-up visits, worsening of seizures, job loss, burden of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) costs, and discontinuation of medicines. Furthermore, knowledge about alternative ways to access health facilities was found very poor among caregivers. Income sources of poor people disrupted by lockdown can lead to unintentional nonadherence to medication, which is a clear picture of inequitable distribution of resources.

The focus groups involved Juniors (registrar level doctors), Consultants and support staff (clinical and non-clinical). RESULTS: Several themes and subthemes were identified. Key points were that patients were universally in favour of telephone consultations; they find them convenient and enjoy not attending the hospital. All clinicians agreed that although Covid-19 lead us to review New patients via telephone this increased workload as they needed to attend later for an examination and felt it did not provide safe care.

Furthermore, signalling respect and consideration towards others via polite speech or behaviour is more likely to go awry during COVID-19. Additionally, the lack of clarity surrounding norms of politeness may prevent polite acts from helping to mitigate conflict and facilitate cooperative social exchange. Finally, citizens and politicians can exploit disruptions around politeness norms to engage in behaviour that under normal circumstances would be considered impolite.

Background and objective: Olfactory and taste dysfunction (OD,TD) have been considered symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, its presence in certain populations, especially those with mild clinical symptoms, has not been clarified. The objective was to estimate the frequency of OD and TD, and its predictive validity in patients detected in Primary Care. Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in the Spanish National Health System. An epidemiological survey was administered to patients who were requested the PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. Odds Ratio(OR) were estimated to measure the magnitude of the association between OD and TD and the existence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV,NPV) of these symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 infection were calculated. Results: Of 1038 patients screened, 20.1% had SARS-CoV-2 infection. OD and DG were present in 64.4%(95%CI:56.0-72.1) and 56.2%(95%CI:47.9-64.2) of the subjects with infection, respectively. The OR for OD was 12.2 (95%CI: 8.26-18.06) and for TD was 7.95 (95%CI: 5.48-11.53). TD presented a sensitivity of 41.1% (95%CI: 34.4-46.1), a specificity of 91.9% (95%CI: 89.8-93.7), a PPV of 56.2% (95%CI:48.0-64.2) and a NPV of 86.1% (95%CI:83.6-88.3), while the OD showed a sensitivity of 45.0% (95%CI:37.6-51.5), a specificity of 93.7% (95%CI:91.8-95.0), a PPV of 64.4% (95%CI:56.0-72.1) and a NPV of 87.1% (95%CI:84.7-89.2).

The rVSV virions encoded a nano luciferase (NLucP) reporter gene fused to a destabilization domain (PEST), which we used in combination with the live-cell substrate EndurazineTM to monitor viral entry kinetics in real time. Our data indicate that rVSV particles with glycoproteins that require more post-internalization priming typically demonstrate delayed entry in comparison to VSV G.

Weddell seals endure brady-arrythmias during their dives when desaturating to 3.2 kPa and elite breath-hold-divers (BHD), who share metabolic and cardiovascular adaptions including bradycardia with diving mammals, endure similar desaturation during maximum apnea. We hypothesized that hypoxia causes brady-arrythmias during maximum apnea in elite BHD. Hence, this study aimed to define the arterial blood glucose (Glu), peripheral saturation (SAT), heart rhythm (HR), and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of elite BHD during maximum apneas. Methods: HR was monitored with Direct-Current-Pads/ECG-lead-II and MAP and Glu from a radial arterial-catheter in nine BHD performing an immersed and head-down maximal static pool apnea after three warm-up apneas. SAT was monitored with a sensor on the neck of the subjects. On a separate day, a 12-lead-ECG-monitored maximum static apnea was repeated dry (n = 6). Results: During pool apnea of maximum duration (385  70 s), SAT decreased from 99.6  0.5 to 58.5  5.5% (PaO2 4.8  1.5 kPa, P < 0.001), while Glu increased from 5.8  0.2 to 6.2  0.2 mmol/l (P = 0.009). MAP increased from 103  4 to 155  6 mm Hg (P < 0.005). HR decreased to 46  10 from 86  14 beats/minute (P < 0.001). HR and MAP were unchanged after 3-4 min of apnea. During dry apnea (378  31 s), HR decreased from 55  4 to 40  3 beats/minute (P = 0.031). Atrioventricular dissociation and junctional rhythm were observed both during pool and dry apneas. Conclusion: Our findings contrast with previous studies concluding that Glu decreases during apnea diving. We conclude during maximum apnea in elite BHD that (1) the diving reflex is maximized after 3-4 min, (2) increasing Glu may indicate lactate metabolism in accordance with our previous results, and (3) extreme hypoxia rather than hypoglycemia causes brady-arrythmias in elite BHD similar to diving mammals.","output":"Extreme Hypoxia Causing Brady-Arrythmias During Apnea in Elite Breath-Hold Divers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel disease associated with a cytokine-mediated, severe, acute respiratory syndrome.

By making use of the novel method Participatory Value Evaluation (PVE), participants were asked to recommend which out of the eight options they prefer to be relaxed. Participants received information regarding the societal impacts of each relaxation option, such as the impact of the option on the healthcare system. The results of the PVE informed policymakers about peoples preferences regarding (the impacts of) the relaxation options. For instance, we established that participants assign an equal value to a reduction of 100 deaths among citizens younger than 70 years and a reduction of 168 deaths among citizens older than 70 years. We show how these preferences can be used to rank options in terms of desirability. Citizens advised to relax lockdown measures, but not to the point at which the healthcare system becomes heavily overloaded. We found wide support for prioritising the re-opening of contact professions. Conversely, participants disfavoured options to relax restrictions for specific groups of citizens as they found it important that decisions lead to unity and not to division. 80% of the participants state that PVE is a good method to let citizens participate in government decision-making on relaxing lockdown measures. Participants felt that they could express a nuanced opinion, communicate arguments, and appreciated the opportunity to evaluate relaxation options in comparison to each other while being informed about the consequences of each option.

Most guidelines rely on Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores to maximize lives saved, but states have adopted different stances on whether to maximize long-term outcomes (life-years saved) by accounting for patient comorbidities. METHODS: We compared 4 representative state guidelines with varying approaches to comorbidities and analyzed how CSC prioritization correlates with clinical outcomes. We included 27 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs at Brigham and Womens Hospital from March 12 to April 3, 2020. We compared prioritization algorithms from New York, which assigns priority based on SOFA alone; Maryland, which uses SOFA plus severe comorbidities; Pennsylvania, which uses SOFA plus major and severe comorbidities; and Colorado, which uses SOFA plus a modified Charlson comorbidity index. RESULTS: In pairwise comparisons across all possible pairs, we found that state guidelines frequently resulted in tie-breakers based on age or lottery: New York 100% of the time (100% resolved by lottery), Pennsylvania 86% of the time (18% by lottery), Maryland 93% of the time (35% by lottery), and Colorado: 32% of the time (10% by lottery). The prioritization algorithm with the strongest correlation with 14-day outcomes was Colorado (r(s) = ?0.483. p = 0.011) followed by Maryland (r(s) = ?0.394, p =0.042), Pennsylvania (r(s) = ?0.382, p = 0.049), and New York (r(s) = 0). An alternative model using raw SOFA scores alone was moderately correlated with outcomes (r(s) = ?0.448, p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: State guidelines for scarce resource allocation frequently resulted in identical priority scores, requiring tie-breakers based on age or lottery.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of 600 randomly sampled parents aged 18 years or older who had and lived with a child under 10 years old in Hong Kong between 29 May to 16 June 2020. Participants were recruited from a random list of mobile phone numbers of a panel of parents. Of 779 recruited target parents, 600 parents completed the survey successfully via a web-based system after obtaining their online consent for participating in the survey. Results: Income reduction was found significantly associated with severe (OR = 3.29, 95% CI = 1.06, 10.25) and very severe physical assaults (OR = 7.69, 95% CI = 2.24, 26.41) towards children. Job loss or large income reduction were also significantly associated with severe (OR= 3.68, 95% CI = 1.33, 10.19) and very severe physical assaults (OR = 4.05, 95% CI = 1.17, 14.08) towards children. However, income reduction (OR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.15, 0.53) and job loss (OR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.28, 0.76) were significantly associated with less psychological aggression. Exposure to intimate partner violence between parents is a very strong and significant factor associated with all types of child maltreatment. Having higher levels of difficulty in discussing COVID-19 with children was significantly associated with more corporal punishment (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.34), whereas having higher level of confidence in managing preventive COVID-19 behaviors with children was negatively associated with corporal punishment (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.76, 0.99) and very severe physical assaults (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.58, 0.93). Conclusions: Income instability such as income reduction and job loss amplified the risk of severe and very severe child physical assaults but protected children from psychological aggression. Also, confidence in teaching COVID-19 and managing preventive COVID-19 behaviors with children was significantly negatively associated with corporal punishment during pandemic.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Child Maltreatment: Income Instability and Parenting Issues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anthrax is a highly lethal infectious disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, and the associated shock is closely related to the lethal toxin (LeTx) produced by the bacterium. The central role played by the 63 kDa protective antigen (PA63) region of LeTx in the pathophysiology of anthrax makes it an excellent therapeutic target. In the present study, a human/murine chimeric IgG mAb, hmPA6, was developed by inserting murine antibody variable regions into human constant regions using antibody engineering technology. hmPA6 expressed in 293F cells could neutralize LeTx both in vitro and in vivo. At a dose of 0.3 mg/kg, it could protect all tested rats from a lethal dose of LeTx. Even administration of 0.6 mg/kg hmPA6 48 h before LeTx challenge protected all tested rats.

DESIGN: We re-enrolled families from two statewide studies (2017C2020) in an observational cohort (MayCAugust 2020). Caregivers reported on risk of household FI, demographics, pandemic-related hardships, and participation in safety net programmes (e.g. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) stimulus payment, school meals). SETTING: Maryland, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Economically, geographically and racially/ethnically diverse families with preschool to adolescent-age children. Eligibility included reported receipt or expected receipt of the CARES stimulus payment or a pandemic-related economic hardship (n 496). RESULTS: Prevalence of risk of FI was unchanged (pre-pandemic: 22 %, early-pandemic: 25 %, p = 027). Risk of early-pandemic FI was elevated for non-Hispanic Black (adjusted relative risk (aRR) = 21 (95 % CI 11, 40)) and Other families (aRR = 26 (13, 54)) and families earning  300 % federal poverty level. Among pre-pandemic food secure families, decreased income, job loss and reduced hours were associated with increased early-pandemic FI risk (aRR = 21 (12, 36) to 25 (15, 41)); CARES stimulus payment (aRR = 05 (03, 09)) and continued school meal participation (aRR = 02 (01, 09)) were associated with decreased risk. Among families at risk of FI pre-pandemic, safety net programme participation was not associated with early-pandemic FI risk. CONCLUSIONS: The CARES stimulus payment and continued school meal participation protected pre-pandemic food secure families from early-pandemic FI risk but did not protect families who were at risk of FI pre-pandemic. Mitigating pre-pandemic FI risk and providing stimulus payments and school meals may support childrens health and reduce disparities in response to pandemics.","output":"Pre-pandemic to early-pandemic changes in risk of household food insecurity among Maryland families with children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Progressive fibrotic lung disease is one of the possible consequences of COVID-19 pulmonary pneumonia, and it is one of the most worrying long-term complications. Pulmonary fibrosis is associated with non-reversible lung dysfunction.

The aim of this study is the early detection and prediction of patients whom may develop such serious complication, thus giving a chance for early introduction of anti-fibrotic drugs. RESULTS: From April 2020 to December 2020, 80 patients in Cairo, Egypt, who have clinical manifestations and confirmed COVID-19 by PCR, were evaluated by follow-up MDCT. CT image analysis was processed including comparative study using follow-up data (different radiological signs and residual fibrotic changes). Although there was no specific cause for post-COVID-19 lung fibrosis, there were some predicting factors such as old age, cigarette smoking, high CT severity score, and long-term mechanical ventilation.

The role of tracheotomy is debated for the possible risks for patients and staff. We are going to describe here our experience with surgical tracheotomy in COVID-19 positive patients. METHODS: We enrolled all intensive care unit (ICU) patients requiring longer than 10 days of IMV. Demographic, clinical, respiratory, complications, and outcomes data were collected, in a particular length of weaning from sedation and IMV, in-ICU and in-hospital mortality rate. All healthcare operators involved were tested for SARS-CoV2 by pharyngeal swab and blood test (antibody test). RESULTS: 13 out of 68 ICU patients (19.1%) underwent surgical tracheotomy after a median intubation period of 14 days. The mean age was 60 (56-65) years. 85% were male patients. Postoperative mild bleeding was seen in 30.7%, pneumothorax in 7.7%. Mean weaning from sedation required 3 days, 19 days from IMV.

MEASURES: Rates of primary care record access and re-presentation to the emergency department (ED) within 30 days and hospital admission. DESIGN: A retrospective observational study of 77 181 ED presentations over 4 years and 9 months, analysing 8184 index presentations in which patients' primary care records were accessed from the ED. Data were compared with 17 449 randomly selected index control presentations. Analysis included propensity score matching for age and triage categories. RESULTS: 6.3% of overall ED presentations triggered a lookup (rising to 8.3% in year 5); 83.1% of patients were only looked up once and 16.9% of patients looked up on multiple occasions. Lookup patients were on average 25 years older (z=-9.180, p<0.001, r=0.43). Patients with more urgent triage classifications had their records accessed more frequently (z=-36.47, p<0.001, r=0.23). Record access was associated with a significant but negligible increase in hospital admission (&#967;2 (1, n=13 120)=98.385, p<0.001, phi=0.087) and readmission within 30 days (&#967;2 (1, n=13 120)=86.288, p<0.001, phi=0.081). DISCUSSION: Emergency care clinicians access primary care records more frequently for older patients or those in higher triage categories. Increased levels of inpatient admission and re-presentation within 30 days are likely linked to age and triage categories.

Preventing HCWs from getting infected is a priority to maintain healthcare services. The therapeutic and preventive role of ivermectin in COVID-19 is being investigated. Based on promising results of in vitro studies of oral ivermectin, this study was conducted with the aim to demonstrate the prophylactic role of oral ivermectin in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infectionamong HCWs at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bhubaneswar. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at AIIMS Bhubaneswar, which provides both COVID and Non-COVID care since March 2020. All employees and students of the institute who provided written informed consent participated in the study.Uptake of two-doses of oral ivermectin (300 g/kg at a gap of 72 hours) was considered as exposure. The primary outcome of the study was COVID-19 infection in the following month of ivermectin consumption diagnosed by RTPCR as per Government of India testing criteria guidelines.The log-binomial model was used to estimate adjusted relative risk, and the Kaplan-Meier failure plot was used to estimate the probability of COVID-19 infection with follow-up time. Results: Of 3892 employees, 3532 (90.8%) participated in the study. The ivermectin uptake was 62.5% and 5.3% for two-doses and single-dose, respectively. Participants who took ivermectin prophylaxis had a lower risk of getting symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection(6% vs 15%). HCWs who had taken two-doses of oral ivermectin have a significantly lower risk of contracting COVID-19 disease during the following month (ARR 0.17;95% CI, 0.12-0.23).

Live-attenuated yellow fever vaccine YF17D serves as vector for several licensed vaccines and platform for novel vaccine candidates. Based on YF17D, we developed YF-S0 as exceptionally potent COVID-19 vaccine candidate. However, use of such live RNA virus vaccines raises safety concerns, i.e., adverse events linked to original YF17D (yellow fever vaccine-associated neurotropic; YEL-AND, and viscerotropic disease; YEL-AVD). In this study, we investigated the biodistribution and shedding of YF-S0 in hamsters. Likewise, we introduced hamsters deficient in STAT2 signaling as new preclinical model of YEL-AND/AVD. Compared to parental YF17D, YF-S0 showed an improved safety with limited dissemination to brain and visceral tissues, absent or low viremia, and no shedding of infectious virus. Considering yellow fever virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, any inadvertent exposure to the live recombinant vector via mosquito bites is to be excluded. The transmission risk of YF-S0 was hence evaluated in comparison to readily transmitting YFV-Asibi strain and non-transmitting YF17D vaccine, with no evidence for productive infection of vector mosquitoes. The overall favorable safety profile of YF-S0 is expected to translate to other novel vaccines that are based on the same YF17D platform.","output":"Biodistribution and Environmental Safety of a Live-attenuated YF17D-vectored SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Candidate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection triggers thrombotic events.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed patient EHR data in a large clinical research network during 2012-2019. We included CHCs who provided outpatient, older adult primary care to patients age 45 years, with 2 office visits during the study. Our study sample included 1 180 290 patients from 545 CHCs across 22 states. We used diagnosis codes from 39 Chronic Condition Warehouse algorithms to identify chronic conditions from encounter diagnoses only and compared against problem list records. We measured correspondence including agreement, kappa, prevalence index, bias index, and prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa. RESULTS: Overlap of encounter diagnosis and problem list ascertainment was 59.4% among chronic conditions identified, with 12.2% of conditions identified only in encounters and 28.4% identified only in problem lists. Rates of coidentification varied by condition from 7.1% to 84.4%. Greatest agreement was found in diabetes (84.4%), HIV (78.1%), and hypertension (74.7%). Sixteen conditions had <50% agreement, including cancers and substance use disorders. Overlap for mental health conditions ranged from 47.4% for anxiety to 59.8% for depression. DISCUSSION: Agreement between the 2 sources varied substantially.

We hypothesize that PICCs with larger lumen size may be reliable for the cardiac index assessment using the TPTD. METHODS: This is a single-centre, prospective methodCcomparison study that included adult patients admitted in ICU who required a calibrated Pulse Contour hemodynamic monitoring system (VolumeView/EV1000?) for circulatory shock and had both PICC and CICC in place. We compared TPTD measurements via single-lumen 5Fr or triple-lumen 6Fr polyurethane power injectable PICCs with triple-lumen 7Fr CICC (reference standard). To rule out biases related to manual injection, measurements were repeated using an automated rapid injection system. We performed BlandCAltman analysis accounting for multiple observations per patient. RESULTS: A total of 320 measurements were performed in 15 patients. During the manual phase, the cardiac index measured with either single-lumen 5Fr or triple-lumen 6Fr PICCs were comparable with cardiac index measured with triple-lumen 7Fr CICC (3.2  1.04 vs. 3.2  1.06 L/min/m(2), bias 2.2% and 3.3  0.8 vs. 3.0  0.7 L/min/m(2), bias 8.5%, respectively).

Among a total of 133 subjects (91 patients and 42 staff), 87 coagulase-positive Staphylococcus (83 S. aureus/4 S. argenteus) and 162 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) isolates were recovered from 59 (44.4%) and 95 (71.4%) subjects, respectively. Three oral isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (3.6%, 3/83) that were genotyped as ST8-SCCmec-IVl, ST4775(CC1)-SCCmec-IVa and ST6562(CC8)-SCCmec-IVa. Remarkably, the ST6562 isolate harbored PVL genes on Sa2usa and type I ACME (arginine catabolic mobile element). Four methicillin-susceptible isolates were identified as S. argenteus belonging to ST1223 and ST2250, which harbored enterotoxin genes egc-2 and sey, respectively. Among the fourteen CoNS species identified, methicillin-resistant (MR) isolates were detected in five species (11 isolates, 13.3% of CoNS), with S. saprophyticus and S. haemolyticus being the most common.

The study involved senior house officer level surgical trainees that had been redeployed to the (ICU) across all hospitals in London during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was sent to 90 surgical trainees. Thirty-two trainees responded to the questionnaire and were included in the study results. RESULTS: All respondents spent between 4 and 8 weeks working in ICU. Prior to redeployment, 78% of participants had previous experience of ICU or an affiliated specialty, and >90% had attended at least 1 educational course with relevance to ICU. There were statistically significant increases in confidence performing central venous cannulation and peripheral arterial catheterisation (p < 0.05). With regards to clinical skills, respondents reported feeling more confident managing ventilated patients, patients on noninvasive ventilation, dialysis, and circulatory failure patients after working in ICU. Respondents (97%) felt that the experience would be beneficial to their future careers but 53% felt the redeployment had a negative impact on their mental health.

However, this test is not recommended in patients with high baseline hydrogen concentrations (H2B). In addition, breath testing is not recommended in the current situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the potential infectiveness of the samples. The objective is to assess concordance between HBT and lactose tolerance test (LTT) depending on H2B concentrations. Methods: A total of 430 patients (40 years, Q1-Q3 = 28-54 years;66.7% women) suspected of lactose malabsorption were included in the study. Breath and heparinized blood samples were collected at baseline and sequentially after the intake of 50 g of lactose, to measure hydrogen in breath and glycemia in blood, respectively. Results: H2B was <10 ppm in 69.5% of subjects;10-20 ppm in 14.7%;and >20 ppm in 15.8% of subjects. In patients with H2B <20 ppm, concordance between HBT and LTT was moderate and consistently improved when the cut-off in LTT was set at 15 mg/dL. The increase in hydrogen and glucose correlated negatively (r=-0.389;p<0.05). The increase in glycemia during LTT was not influenced by H2B levels obtained in HBT. Conclusions: LTT emerges as an alternative to HBT to assess lactose malabsorption in the presence of high H2B levels or when breath testing is not recommended by the circumstances.

We investigated how IAV may increase the risk for COVID-19 lung disease, focusing on the receptor Angiotensin Convertase Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the protease TMPRSS2, which cooperate to uptake SARS-CoV-2 intracellular. We found, using single cell RNA sequencing of distal human non-diseased lung homogenates, that at baseline, ACE2 is minimally expressed in basal, goblet, ciliated, and secretory epithelial cells populating small airways. We focused on human small airway epithelial cells (SAEC), central to the pathogenesis of lung injury following viral infections. Primary SAEC from non-diseased donor lungs apically infected (at air-liquid interface) with IAV (up to 3105a? pfu; a??1 MOI) markedly (8-fold) boosted the expression of ACE2, paralleling that of STAT1, a transcription factor activated by viruses. IAV increased the apparent electrophoretic mobility of intrac?ellular ACE2 and generated an ACE2 fragment (90a? kDa) in apical secretions, suggesting cleavage of this receptor. IAV also increased the expression of two proteases known to cleave ACE2, sheddase ADAM17 (TACE) and TMPRSS2 and increased the TMPRSS2 zymogen and its mature fragments, implicating proteolytic autoactivation. These results indicate that IAV amplifies the expression of molecules necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection of the distal lung. Further, posttranslational changes in ACE2 by IAV may increase the vulnerability to lung injury such as ARDS during viral co-infections.

We investigated the relationship between cellular immunity and the antibody response to inactivated influenza vaccines. METHODS: 25 patients (age: 2-18 years) undergoing chemotherapy for different malignancies participated in our study. Flow cytometric detection of peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations together with hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers were measured before and 21-28 days after vaccination. We examined the ratio and total numbers of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, activated helper (CD3+CD4+CD25(low)), regulatory (CD3+CD4+CD25(high)), naive (CD3+CD45RA+) and memory (CD3+CD45RO+) T cells, CD56+NK, and CD3+CD56+ (NKT-like) cells. Relationships between specific antibody responses (seroprotection, seroconversion, geometric mean titer (GMT), geometric mean fold increase (GMFI)) and the ratios and counts of lymphocyte subpopulations were evaluated using one-way ANOVA and the paired sample t test after dichotomization according to age-related reference values. RESULTS: Patients with CD4+ lymphocyte levels in the normal age-specific range showed significantly better response regarding postvaccination GMT elevation for H1N1 and H3N2 strains (97.52 vs. 19.2, p=0.019, 80 vs. 14.43, p=0.021, respectively). GMFI results were significant only against B strain (2.69-fold vs. 1.23-fold, p=0.046). Prevaccination CD3+CD56+ (NKT-like) cells above predicted values according to age showed significant associations both in postvaccination GMT elevation (H1N1: 75.11 vs. 14.14, p=0.010; H3N2: 62.18 vs. 11.22, p=0.012; B: 22.69 vs. 6.67, p=0.043) and GMFI against all three strains (H1N1: 3.76-fold vs. 1.06-fold, p=0.015; H3N2: 2.74-fold vs. 1, p=0.013; B: 2.57-fold vs. 1, p=0.008).

We compared comorbidities, clinical features and other predictive factors between COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission for intubation/mechanical ventilation and all other COVID-19 cases in Selangor, Malaysia. METHOD: Field data collected during the COVID-19 outbreak in Selangor, Malaysia, up to 13 April 2020 were used, comprising socio-demographic characteristics, comorbidities and presenting symptoms of COVID-19 cases. ICU admission was determined from medical records. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with ICU admission requiring intubation/mechanical ventilation among COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: A total of 1287 COVID-19-positive cases were included for analysis. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (15.5%) and diabetes (11.0%). More than one third of cases presented with fever (43.8%) or cough (37.1%). Of the 25 cases that required intubation/mechanical ventilation, 68.0% had hypertension, 88.0% had fever, 40.0% had dyspnoea and 44.0% were lethargic. Multivariate regression showed that cases that required intubation/mechanical ventilation had significantly higher odds of being older (aged (3)60 years) [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.9] and having hypertension (aOR = 5.7), fever (aOR = 9.8), dyspnoea (aOR = 9.6) or lethargy (aOR = 7.9) than cases that did not require intubation/mechanical ventilation.

To overcome these two problems, we have prepared a new stealth PEG polymer conjugate containing a terminal 1,1-bisphosphonate (BP) group for strong and stable binding to the surface of ultrasmall-superparamagnetic oxide nanomaterials (USPIOs). This polymer, PEG(5)-BP, can be used to exchange the hydrophobic surfactants commonly used in the synthesis of USPIOs very efficiently and at room temperature using a simple method in 1 h. The resulting nanoparticles, PEG(5)-BP-USPIOs are stable in water or saline for at least 7 months and display a near-zero -potential at neutral pH. The longitudinal (r(1)) and transverse (r(2)) relaxivities were measured at a clinically relevant magnetic field (3 T), revealing a high r(1) of 9.5 mM(-1) s(-1) and low r(2)/r(1) ratio of 2.97, making these USPIOs attractive as T1-weighted MRI contrast agents at high magnetic fields. The strong T1-effect was demonstrated in vivo, revealing that PEG(5)-BP-USPIOs remain in the bloodstream and enhance its signal 6-fold, allowing the visualization of blood vessels and vascular organs with high spatial definition. Furthermore, the optimal relaxivity properties allow us to inject a dose 4 times lower than with other USPIOs. PEG(5)-BP-USPIOs can also be labeled using a radiolabeled-BP for visualization with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and thus affording dual-modality contrast.

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and SCOPUS and included model-based evaluations of RSV vaccinations. Two reviewers performed the selection, data extraction, and quality evaluation with EVIDEM. Cost-effectiveness (CE) estimates were converted to $US purchasing power parity (PPP), year 2018 values. Potential economic and epidemiological outcomes were summarised for maternal, infant, children, and elderly vaccinations. The PROSPERO identifier is CRD42019122570. RESULTS: In total, 22 model-based studies were reviewed. On average, a potential 27% reduction in RSV hospitalisations in infants was projected for maternal vaccination and 50% for direct infant immunisation. The CE of maternal vaccination was $US1766C5857 PPP 2018/disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi)-eligible countries. For England, the maximum cost-effective price of maternal vaccination was estimated at $US81.5 PPP 2018. Infant vaccination was associated with higher CE ratios in low- and high-income settings. Vaccination of neonates born before the RSV season was the most cost effective in high-income settings. Higher values for vaccine effectiveness, duration of protection, and vaccine uptake increased the benefits. Due to indirect effects, the vaccination of school-age children and a cocooning strategy were effective alternatives to protect infants, and the vaccination of children aged < 5 years had a beneficial impact on the elderly. CONCLUSION: RSV vaccines with anticipated characteristics may reduce a sizeable proportion of the RSV burden. The results are subject to uncertainty because of the limited epidemiological and clinical data. Data on RSV incidence and hospitalisation risk for granular age strata should be prioritised to facilitate the evaluation of RSV interventions and decision making.

We also aim to have general practices collect virology and serology specimens and to participate in trials and other interventional research. METHODS: The RCGP RSC network comprises over 1700 general practices in England and Wales. We will extract pseudonymized data twice weekly and are migrating to a system of daily extracts. First, we will collect pseudonymized, routine, coded clinical data for the surveillance of monitored and unexpected conditions; data on vaccine exposure and adverse events of interest; and data on approved research study outcomes. Second, we will provide dashboards to give general practices feedback about levels of care and data quality, as compared to other network practices. We will focus on collecting data on influenza-like illness, upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and suspected COVID-19. Third, approximately 300 practices will participate in the 2020-2021 virology and serology surveillance; this will include responsive surveillance and long-term follow-up of previous SARS-CoV-2 infections. Fourth, member practices will be able to recruit volunteer patients to trials, including early interventions to improve COVID-19 outcomes and point-of-care testing. Lastly, the legal basis for our surveillance with PHE is Regulation 3 of the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002; other studies require appropriate ethical approval. RESULTS: The RCGP RSC network has tripled in size; there were previously 100 virology practices and 500 practices overall in the network and we now have 322 and 1724, respectively. The OxfordCRCGP Clinical Informatics Digital Hub (ORCHID) secure networks enable the daily analysis of the extended network; currently, 1076 practices are uploaded.

For example, the NCCN guidelines suggest that clinical history, examination and blood investigations should be performed every 3-6 months for 5 years and as clinically indicated thereafter. This is essentially a screening programme for an at-risk population that continues based on historical routine rather than due to evidence it is of benefit to the patient. Numerous papers have been published suggesting that routine surveillance scans or bloods such as LDH are not useful in this setting. We sought to analyse whether the screening procedures that are performed in the follow-up setting are useful in the detection of relapse in patients followed up in a single centre. Uniquely, we examined each time point separately rather than group all follow-up events together. Methods Data was obtained retrospectively from electronic patient records for all patients in remission following treatment with frontline chemotherapy for DLBCL at the Royal Marsden Hospital between 2005-2016. Screening assessments analysed were symptoms check, clinical examination, LDH >upper limit of normal, lymphocyte: monocyte ratio (LMR) <2.8, routine CT scans. Time-points for analysis of routine clinic appointments were derived from the British guidelines which advise 3 monthly follow up in the first year, 6 months in year 2 and annually up to 5 years. True positives were defined as patients who had a positive result and relapsed within that specified time period or within 6 months, whereas false negatives were only considered for those patients who had a negative test within the time period that they relapsed. Results Complete data from 262 patients who achieved a CR and were followed up was available. Median age was 63 years (17-94) with 59 patients with stage 1 disease, and 100 with stage 4 disease. The relapse rate was 59/261 (23%), with a median time to relapse of 13 months (2-120). Of the 59, 52 had symptoms they had noted prior to clinic, of whom 28 requested an early appointment to clinic and 22 waited until their routine clinic appointment or sought advice from other health professionals initially. Only 7 patients were picked up only on investigations performed at the hospital, 1 with hypercalcemia and 6 on routine scan with no symptoms, 3 at 3-6months, 2 and 9-12months and 1 at 12-18 months. Of these, 4/7 patients achieved a CR with subsequent therapy. The remaining 202 patients had 2853 clinic appointments, median number per patient 13 (1-44). The negative predictive value of clinical history, examination, LDH, LMR and CT scan was consistently very high (>90%) at all time points. However, the positive predictive value was low for symptoms, 0-35% with the higher values being in the first year. Clinical examination had better PPV due to fewer positive results, including both true and false. LDH and LMR were associated with a poor PPV at all time points. PPV for CT scans was variable (Table 1). Conclusions The screening of patients who are in remission from DLBCL requires considerable health resources and cost and also leads to increased exposure of the patient to hospitals which during the COVID-19 pandemic is being discouraged. Likelihood of relapse (which decreases with time) has an impact on the effectiveness of a screening programme, the relapse rate in this cohort was 23% in keeping with other published data. Importantly, the majority of patients had symptoms suggestive of relapse and so the screening was not required. In the few that were asymptomatic when relapse was diagnosed, there was insufficient data to know whether this earlier detection led to a better outcome, however this has not been seen in other published cohorts. Finally the effectiveness of the screening is dependent on the predictive value of the tests being used and this dataset shows that whilst the negative predictive value is igh, the positive predictive value is very variable and generally poor for all tools used. We propose that educating the patient regarding symptoms of relapse and having patient directed clinical follow-up rather than routine appointments would lead to marked savings in health resources, reduce hospital exposure of patients by eliminating unnecessary visits without compromising the outcome of the patients.

Hundreds of papers have either proposed new feature attribution methods, discussed or harnessed these tools in their work. However, despite humans being the target end-users, most attribution methods were only evaluated on proxy automatic-evaluation metrics (Zhang et al. 2018; Zhou et al. 2016; Petsiuk et al. 2018). In this paper, we conduct the first user study to measure attribution map effectiveness in assisting humans in ImageNet classification and Stanford Dogs fine-grained classification, and when an image is natural or adversarial (i.e., contains adversarial perturbations). Overall, feature attribution is surprisingly not more effective than showing humans nearest training-set examples. On a harder task of fine-grained dog categorization, presenting attribution maps to humans does not help, but instead hurts the performance of human-AI teams compared to AI alone. Importantly, we found automatic attribution-map evaluation measures to correlate poorly with the actual human-AI team performance.

Therefore we felt it essential to determine whether exercise training might injure a systemic right ventricle which is loaded with every heartbeat. Previous studies have shown that short term exercise training is feasible in TGA patients, but its effect on ventricular function is unclear. We demonstrate that systemic right ventricular function is preserved (and may be improved) in TGA patients with exercise training programmes that are typical of recreational and sports participation, with no evidence of injury on biomarker assessment. Stroke volume reserve during exercise correlates with exercise training response in our TGA patients, identifying this as a marker of a systemic right ventricle (SRV) that may most tolerate (and possibly even be improved by) exercise training. ABSTRACT We aimed to assess the haemodynamic effects of exercise training in transposition of the great arteries (TGA) patients with systemic right ventricles (SRVs). TGA patients have limited exercise tolerance and early mortality due to systemic (right) ventricular failure. Whether exercise training enhances or injures the SRV is unclear. Fourteen asymptomatic patients (34  10 years) with TGA and SRV were enrolled in a 12 week exercise training programme (moderate and high-intensity workouts). Controls were matched on age, gender, BMI and physical activity. Exercise testing pre- and post- training included: (a) submaximal and peak; (b) prolonged (60 min) submaximal endurance and (c) high-intensity intervals. Oxygen uptake (V?O2; Douglas bag technique), cardiac output (Q?c, foreign-gas rebreathing), ventricular function (echocardiography and cardiac MRI) and serum biomarkers were assessed. TGA patients had lower peak V?O2, Q?c, and stroke volume (SV), a blunted Q?c/V?O2 slope, and diminished SV response to exercise (SV increase from rest: TGA = 15.2%, controls = 68.9%, P < 0.001) compared with controls. After training, TGA patients increased peak V?O2 by 6  8.5%, similar to controls (interaction P = 0.24). The magnitude of SV reserve on initial testing correlated with Q?c training response (r = 0.58, P = 0.047), though overall, no change in peak Q?c was observed. High-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) and N-terminal prohormone of brain naturetic peptide (NT pro-BNP) were low and did not change with acute exercise or after training. Our data show that TGA patients with SRVs in this study safely participated in exercise training and improved peak V?O2. Neither prolonged submaximal exercise, nor high-intensity intervals, nor short-term exercise training seem to injure the systemic right ventricle.","output":"Cardiovascular response to exercise training in the systemic right ventricle of adults with transposition of the great arteries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Flow-diverting devices now offer a new treatment alternative for cerebral aneurysms. We present the results of a large single-center series of patients treated with the PED, including long-term follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between November 2008 and September 2011, sidewall aneurysms with a wide neck (4 mm) or unfavorable dome-neck ratio (1.5); large/giant, fusiform, dissecting, blister-like, and recurrent sidewall aneurysms; aneurysms at difficult angles; and aneurysms in which a branch was originating directly from the sac were treated with the PED. Patients were premedicated with dual antiplatelet medications. Data, including demographics, aneurysm features, clinical presentation, complications, results, and follow-up information, for up to 2 years are presented. RESULTS Two hundred fifty-one aneurysms in 191 patients were treated. Of these, 96 (38.3%) were large or giant (10 mm). In 34/251 (13.5%), PEDs were used for retreatment. Adjunctive coiling was performed in 11 aneurysms (2.1%). The mean number of devices per aneurysm was 1.3. One aneurysm ruptured in the fourth month posttreatment (0.5%), and symptomatic in-construct stenosis was detected in 1 patient (0.5%) treated with percutaneous transarterial angioplasty. Any event rate was 27/191 (14.1%), with a permanent morbidity of 1% and mortality of 0.5%. Control angiography was available in 182 (95.3%) patients with 239 (95.2%) aneurysms. In 121 aneurysms (48.2%), 1- to 2-year control angiography was available. The aneurysm occlusion rate was 91.2% in 6 months, increasing to 94.6%.

Youth are particularly threatened due to existing barriers to their access to services. CHIEDZA is a community-based integrated SRH intervention for youth being trialled in Zimbabwe. CHIEDZA closed in March 2020, in response to national lockdown, and reopened in May 2020, categorised as an essential service. We aimed to understand the impact of CHIEDZAs closure and its reopening, with adaptations to reduce COVID-19 transmission, on provider and youth experiences. Qualitative methods included interviews with service providers (n = 22) and youth (n = 26), and observations of CHIEDZA sites (n = 10) and intervention team meetings (n = 7). Analysis was iterative and inductive. The sudden closure of CHIEDZA impeded youth access to SRH services. The reopening of CHIEDZA was welcomed, but the necessary adaptations impacted the intervention and engagement with it. Adaptations restricted time with healthcare providers, heightening the tension between numbers of youths accessing the service and quality of service provision. The removal of social activities, which had particularly appealed to young men, impacted youth engagement and access to services, particularly for males. This paper demonstrates how a community-based youth-centred SRH intervention has been affected by and adapted to COVID-19. We demonstrate how critical ongoing service provision is, but how adaptations negatively impact service provision and youth engagement. The impact of adaptations additionally emphasises how time with non-judgemental providers, social activities, and integrated services are core components of youth-friendly services, not added extras.","output":"Other risks don't stop: adapting a youth sexual and reproductive health intervention in Zimbabwe during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: A bidirectional relationship exist between the COVID-19 diagnosed & recovered patient and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. As per the various article available in public domain it has been proved that entry of COVID - 19 virus can lead to a series of pathological changes into a patient's body which may lead to the development of insulin resistance and damage to the pancreas. The patient in our case was a COVID - 19 survivor which was diagnosed with type 2 DM during the treatment. The patient was started with the Glargine insulin when she was undergoing her treatment in the hospital for COVID - 19 Symptoms. Her fasting and postprandial blood sugar level was controlled with the insulin. After her discharged she was started with the Metformin 500 mg twice a day but her blood sugar was not controlled with the Metformin monotherapy, so we started with the triple drug combination Metformin + Glimepiride + Pioglitazone. After 1 month of follow-up, it was seen that the blood sugar level was not controlled, so the Pioglitazone was replaced with the DPP-4 inhibitor drug Vildagliptin and again the patient was asked to come for follow-up after 15 days, it was seen in this follow-up that the patients' blood sugar was dramatically controlled.

More specifically, a compartmental epidemic model has been considered, in which vaccination, social distance measures, and testing of susceptible individuals have been included. Since the application of these mitigation measures entails a degree of uncertainty, the effects of the uncertainty about the application of social distance actions and testing of susceptible individuals on the disease transmission have been quantified, under the assumption of a mass vaccination program deployment. A spectral approach has been employed, which allows the uncertainty propagation through the epidemic model to be represented by means of the polynomial chaos expansion of the output random variables. In particular, a statistical moment-based polynomial chaos expansion has been implemented, which provides a surrogate model for the compartments of the epidemic model, and allows the statistics, the probability distributions of the interesting output variables of the model at a given time instant to be estimated and the sensitivity analysis to be conducted. The purpose of the sensitivity analysis is to understand which uncertain parameters have most influence on a given output random variable of the model at a given time instant.

AIM: To investigate the variation in psychiatric hospitalization rates and differences in sociodemographic and clinical-psychopathological peculiarities at Bologna \\"Maggiore\\" General Hospital Psychiatric Ward (GHPW) between the first two waves SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the same periods of the previous 3 years. The secondary purpose of the study was to suggest a diachronic response pathway to stress by reporting additional literature data on coping strategies. METHODS: This observational and retrospective study collected information on admission to the GHPW at the \\"Maggiore\\" Hospital in Bologna in the index periods defined as follows: the first period between February 24, 2020 and April 30, 2020 (first epidemic wave) and the second period between October 8, 2020, and January 7, 2021 (second pandemic wave). Absolute numbers and proportion of admitted patients, their sociodemographic and clinical-psychopathological characteristics were compared with the same parameters recorded in the two same periods of the previous 3 years. No strict inclusion or exclusion criteria were provided in the data collection to collect information on all patients requiring acute psychiatric hospitalization. RESULTS: During the first wave, there was a significant reduction in hospitalization rates, although there was a simultaneous increase in compulsory hospitalizations and the acute relapse of schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. During the second wave, hospitalization rates reached those recorded during the same period of the previous 3 years, mainly due to the rise of bipolar and related disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, trauma- and stressor-related disorders and suicidal behaviors. CONCLUSION: The coping strategies adopted during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic protected the vulnerable population from the general risk of clinical-psychopathological acute relapse, even if they increased the susceptibility to run into schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder relapses. In the medium-long term (as in the second pandemic wave), the same strategies do not play protective roles against the stress associated with the pandemic and social restriction measures. Indeed, during the second wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an increase in total hospitalization rate, suicidal behaviors and the incidence rate of bipolar and related disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, trauma- and stressor-related disorders was observed.","output":"Psychiatric hospitalization during the two SARS-CoV-2 pandemic waves: New warnings for acute psychotic episodes and suicidal behaviors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The way individuals interpret and reinterpret their experience is central to meaning-making and impacts teaching and learning.

Methods Eligible studies reported on haemoglobin concentration or prevalence of anaemia in a SA pregnant population and were available in full text. Case-control and estimation studies were excluded with no restriction on the date of publication.

Risk of bias was conducted using the Hoy tool and the Doi plot and LFK ratio. Overall study quality was assessed using the GRADE tool. Due to heterogeneity amongst studies subgroup analyses were performed (random effects and quality effects model) using MetaXL addon tool for Microsoft Excel. Results The initial search yielded 7010 articles and 26 were selected for inclusion. Twenty studies were cross-sectional, three were longitudinal and one a randomised control trial. Studies ranged in publication year from 1969 to 2020. The pooled prevalence of anaemia in pregnant women in SA was determined to be 31% (95% CI, 23C40%). Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and low birth weight were associated with anaemia. While iron deficiency was reported as the main cause, other risk factors included HIV and other infections. Discussion Limitations There was limited data reporting on prevalence of anaemia and direct maternal and foetal outcomes. Heterogeneity amongst studies was not explained by subgroup analysis. Majority of cross-sectional study designs reduced the ability to infer causality. Interpretation While the prevalence of anaemia remains high and of concern, risk factors are varied. Iron deficiency is still common but the presence of comorbidities also contributes to anaemia and should not be ignored.

It is imperative to identify the prevalence of vaccination hesitancy for SARS-CoV2 in order to understand the scope of the problem and to identify its motivational roots in order to proactively prepare to address the problem when a vaccine eventually becomes available. OBJECTIVE: To identify (1) the prevalence of vaccination hesitancy for a SARS-CoV2 vaccine, (2) the motivational roots of this hesitancy, and (3) the most promising incentives for improving the likelihood of vaccination uptake when a vaccine does become available. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional sample of 3,674 American and Canadian adults assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES: Measures of vaccination intention (i.e., If a vaccine for COVID-19 was available, would you get vaccinated?), attitudes toward vaccines in general and specific to SARS-CoV2 using the Vaccination Attitudes Examination Scale, and incentives for getting vaccinated for those who reported they would not get vaccinated. RESULTS: Many American (25%) and Canadian (20%) respondents said that they would not get vaccinated against SARS-CoV2 if a vaccine was available. Non-adherence rates of this magnitude would make it difficult or impossible to achieve herd immunity. Vaccine rejection was most strongly correlated with mistrust of vaccine benefit, and also correlated with worry about unforeseen future effects, concerns about commercial profiteering from pharmaceutical companies, and preferences for natural immunity. When asked about incentives for getting vaccinated, respondents were most likely to report that evidence for rigorous testing and safety of the vaccine were of greatest importance. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Vaccination hesitancy is a major looming problem for COVID-19. To improve vaccine uptake, it is imperative that the vaccine is demonstrated to the public to be rigorously tested and not perceived as rushed or premature in its dissemination.","output":"A Proactive Approach for Managing COVID-19: The Importance of Understanding the Motivational Roots of Vaccination Hesitancy for SARS-CoV2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent decades, nano-scale zero valent iron is reported to have plant growth enhancement capacity under laboratory conditions, but till date, there is no report to highlight its effect on the growth and yield of field-grown plants. In this study, we have evaluated the potential of nZVI priming on rice yield. A two-year field study has been conducted with different concentrations (10, 20, 40, and 80 mg l(?1)) of nZVI for seed priming. The efficacy of nanopriming was compared with the hydroprimed control set. Seeds were treated for 72 h and sown in nursery beds and after 30 days seedlings were transplanted in the field. Root anatomy and morphology were studied in 7 days old seedlings where no changes were found. RAPD analysis also confirmed that low doses of nZVI were not genotoxic. Nanoprimed plants also had broader leaves, higher growth, biomass, and tiller number than control plants. Maximum yield was obtained from the 20 mg l(?1) nZVI primed set (3.8 fold higher than untreated control) which is achieved primarily because of the increase in fertile tiller numbers (two fold higher than untreated control). Higher values of other agronomic parameters like growth rate, net assimilation rate proved that nZVI priming enhanced photosynthetic efficiency and helped in the proper storage of photo-assimilates. All these attributed to increased accumulation of phytochemicals like starch, soluble sugar, protein, lipid, phenol, riboflavin, thiamine, and ascorbic acid in the grains. The elemental analysis confirmed that nZVI priming also promoted higher accumulations of macro and micronutrients in grains. Thus, nanoprimed seeds showed better crop performance compared to the traditional hydropimed seeds. Hence, nZVI can be considered as pro-fertilizer and can be used commercially as a seed treatment agent which is capable of boosting plant growth and yield along with minimum interference to the soil ecosystem.

We tested the hypothesis that the combination of sevoflurane and dexmedetomidine is non-inferior to sevoflurane alone as it refers to hemodynamic measurements during diagnostic cardiac catheterization in children with a transplanted heart, one ventricle (Fontan procedure), or normal cardiac physiology. Patients were anesthetized with inhalation of sevoflurane in nitrous oxide/oxygen and, after baseline hemodynamic measurements, successive boluses of dexmedetomidine followed by continuous infusion were administered. In this study, non-inferiority was shown when differences at steady-state (dexmedetomidine + sevoflurane) compared to baseline (sevoflurane alone) and its associated 95% confidence interval fell completely within the range of plus or minus 20%. Forty-one (26 normal physiology, 9 cardiac transplantation, and 6 Fontan) patients were enrolled. Non-inferiority of sevoflurane + dexmedetomidine compared with sevoflurane alone was shown for heart rate, but not for arterial blood pressure in patients with normal and cardiac transplant physiology. In patients with normal cardiac physiology, non-inferiority was demonstrated for bispectral index. Therefore, while the lack of depressive respiratory effects and non-inferiority for heart rate are desirable, the lack of non-inferiority of dexmedetomidine + sevoflurane combination for arterial blood pressure do not justify the routine use of this combination compared with sevoflurane alone for children with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac catheterization.","output":"Dexmedetomidine for patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac procedures: a noninferiority study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The imbalance between the prevalence of patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) and acute-on-chronic respiratory failure and the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds requires new solutions.

Severe disease is characterized by early secretion of proinflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines. This cytokine secretion persisted in patients with severe viral pneumonia and was directly associated with the degree of viral replication in the respiratory tract. Cytokines play important roles in the antiviral defense, but persistent hypercytokinemia may cause inflammatory tissue damage and participate in the genesis of the respiratory failure observed in these patients. An absence of pre-existing protective antibodies was the rule for both mild and severe cases. A role for pathogenic immunocomplexes has been proposed for this disease. Defective T cell responses characterize severe cases of infection caused by the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Immune alterations associated with accompanying conditions such as obesity, pregnancy or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may interfere with the normal development of the specific response to the virus. The role of host immunogenetic factors associated with disease severity is also discussed in this review.

However, there is an increasing amount and complexity of data available that may lend itself to alternative analytic approaches using machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) methods. We performed a systematic review of the current application of ML or AI approaches to the analysis of EHR and AHD in geriatric mental health. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to identify potential studies. We included all articles that used ML or AI methods on topics related to geriatric mental health utilizing EHR or AHD data. We assessed study quality either by Prediction model Risk OF Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) or Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist. Results: We initially identified 391 articles through an electronic database and reference search, and 21 articles met inclusion criteria. Among the selected studies, EHR was the most used data type, and the datasets were mainly structured. A variety of ML and AI methods were used, with prediction or classification being the main application of ML or AI with the random forest as the most common ML technique. Dementia was the most common mental health condition observed. The relative advantages of ML or AI techniques compared to biostatistical methods were generally not assessed. Only in three studies, low risk of bias (ROB) was observed according to all the PROBAST domains but in none according to QUADAS-2 domains. The quality of study reporting could be further improved.

Aside from dementia, there are few studies of other geriatric mental health conditions. The lack of consistent information in the selected studies precludes precise comparisons between them. Improving the quality of reporting of ML and AI work in the future would help improve research in the field. Other courses of improvement include using common data models to collect/organize data, and common datasets for ML model validation.","output":"Use of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Methods in Geriatric Mental Health Research Involving Electronic Health Record or Administrative Claims Data: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To report a pilot experience of telemedicine in ophthalmology in open-care modality (i.e. direct video call), in a confinement period due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

This inconsistency is reflected in public policy, with governments using the term 'public health approach' in contradictory ways. This aim of this study is to clarify what is meant and understood when the term 'public health approach' is used in the context of substance use. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic search of Medline, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts and PAIS Index. Eligible articles will be from peer-reviewed journals, in English, with full text available. There will be no limits on year of publication. Substance use must be the primary topic of the article. Editorials, commentaries and letters to the editor will be included, but not commentaries on other articles, unless the definition of a public health approach is central to the commentary. Data selection and collection will be conducted independently by two researchers, with a third separately resolving any disagreement. To answer the research question, we will extract authors' definitions of a public health approach to substance use as well as any descriptions of the central principles, characteristics and components of such an approach. To synthesise the data, we will employ thematic synthesis. Coding will be conducted by one researcher and verified by a second; two researchers will then group the codes into themes using an inductive process. Finally, the full research team will develop a set of analytic themes, which will be presented as a narrative. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is not needed since the research will only involve published work. Our findings will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and, if possible, at conferences.

In this study we showed that NSG mice engrafted with human lung (HL) tissue (NSG-L) could be infected efficiently by SARS-CoV-2, and that live virus capable of infecting Vero cells was found in the HL grafts and multiple organs from infected NSG-L mice. RNA-seq examination identified a series of differentially expressed genes, which are enriched in viral defense responses, chemotaxis, interferon stimulation, and pulmonary fibrosis between HL grafts from infected and control NSG-L mice. Furthermore, when infecting humanized mice with human immune system (HIS) and autologous HL grafts (HISL mice), the mice had bodyweight loss and hemorrhage and immune cell infiltration in HL grafts, which were not observed in immunodeficient NSG-L mice, indicating the development of anti-viral immune responses in these mice. In support of this possibility, the infected HISL mice showed bodyweight recovery and lack of detectable live virus at the later time. These results demonstrate that NSG-L and HISL mice are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, offering a useful in vivo model for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection and the associated immune response and immunopathology, and testing anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies.","output":"Scrutiny of human lung infection by SARS-CoV-2 and associated human immune responses in humanized mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic is the biggest epidemiological problem of the 21st century.

We aimed to describe the causes of organ failure and mortality related to gastrectomy for gastric cancer and to identify patients with POF who are at a risk of failure to rescue (FTR). METHODS: The study examined patients with POF or in-hospital mortality in Seoul National University Hospital between 2005 and 2014. We identified patients at a high risk of FTR by analyzing laboratory findings, complication data, intensive care unit records, and risk scoring including Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) 3 at ICU admission. RESULTS: Among the 7304 patients who underwent gastrectomy, 80 (1.1%) were identified with ClavienCDindo classification (CDC) grade  IVa. The numbers of patients with CDC grade IVa, IVb, and V were 48 (0.66%), 11 (0.15%), and 21 (0.29%), respectively. Pulmonary failure (43.8%), surgical site complication (27.5%), and cardiac failure (13.8%) were the most common causes of POF and mortality. Cancer progression (100%) and cardiac events (45.5%) showed high FTR rates.

Methods: In the first of two studies, Brown Norway rats underwent laser-induced CNV and were assigned to one of the following groups: daily eye drops of artificial tears (n = 10; control group); daily eye drops of the ?-adrenoreceptor agonist isoproterenol (n = 10); daily eye drops of the ?-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol (n = 10); sympathetic internal carotid nerve (ICN) transection 6 weeks prior to laser-induced CNV (n = 10). In the second study, rats underwent laser-induced CNV followed by ICN transection at different time points: immediately after the laser injury (n = 6), 7 days after the laser injury (n = 6), and sham surgery 7 days after the laser injury (n = 6; control group). All animals were euthanized 14 days after laser application. CNV development was quantified with fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography (in vivo), as well as lesion volume analysis using 3D confocal reconstruction (postmortem). Angiogenic growth factor protein levels in the choroid were measured with ELISA. Results: In the first study, blocking ocular sympathetic activity through pharmacological or surgical manipulation led to a 75% or 70% reduction in CNV lesion volume versus the control group, respectively (P < 0.001). Stimulating ocular sympathetic activity with isoproterenol also led to a reduction in lesion volume, but only by 27% versus controls (P < 0.05). VEGF protein levels in the choroid were elevated in the three treatment groups (P < 0.01). In the second study, fluorescein angiography and CNV lesion volume analysis indicated that surgically removing the ocular sympathetic supply inhibited progression of laser-induced CNV, regardless of whether ICN transection was performed on the same day or 7 days after the laser injury. Conclusion: Surgical and pharmacological block of ocular sympathetic activity can inhibit progression of CNV in a rat model. Therefore, electrical block of ICN activity could be a potential bioelectronic medicine strategy for treating wet AMD.","output":"Blocking Ocular Sympathetic Activity Inhibits Choroidal Neovascularization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although vaccination has been remarkably effective against some pathogens, for others, rapid antigenic evolution results in vaccination conferring only weak and/or short\\\\lived protection.

An unexplored third possibility is to vaccinate individuals with one of a number of qualitatively different vaccines, creating a mosaic of individual immunity in the population.

The primary aim of this single-blind, randomized pilot study was to compare the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of a treadmill walking (TM) versus a total body recumbent stepping (TBRS) exercise program for treatment of PAD. Methods: Participants (n = 19) enrolled in a 12-week SET program and were randomized to either a TM (n = 9) or TBRS (n = 10) exercise group that followed current SET exercise guidelines. Feasibility, safety, and efficacy outcomes were assessed. Results: SET attendance was 86% and 71%, respectively, for TBRS and TM groups (p = 0.07). Session exercise dose (metabolic equivalents of task [MET] minutes) (mean [SD]) for TM was 117.6 [27.4] compared to 144.7 [28.7] in the TBRS group (p = 0.08).

It is in the best interests of patients for care providers to streamline services where possible to maximise the number of cases that can be performed by limited surgical and anaesthetic teams, as well as minimising patient interactions and admission times to reduce potential spread of the virus. There is evidence that wide awake local anaesthetic no tourniquet (WALANT) hand and upper limb surgery can meet this need in a number of ways, including reduced pre-operative work up, the lack of a need for an anaesthetist or ventilator, shorter inpatient stays and improved cost efficiencies. Though updated national guidelines exist that advocate increased use of WALANT surgery in response to the pandemic there are not yet clear protocols to facilitate this. We outline a protocol being developed at one UK Major Trauma Centre tailored to the expansion of WALANT hand and upper limb emergency surgery with particular emphasis on facilitating timely surgical care while minimising healthcare encounters pre and post-operatively. This will serve to reduce potential transmission of the virus and create cost efficiencies to free funding for COVID-19 related care. Our protocol is easily replicable and may be of benefit to other centres dealing with emergency upper limb surgery in the new climate of COVID-19.","output":"A Protocol for Wide Awake Local Anaesthetic No Tourniquet (WALANT) hand surgery in the context of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accumulating evidence shows that microbial co-infection increases the risk of disease severity in humans.

However, a lack of public opinion data on MMR safety collected before/after AW98s publication obscures whether anecdotal accounts are indicative of a potentially-causal effect. METHODS: We address this problem using a regression discontinuity framework to study change in monthly MMR injury claims (N = 74,850; from 1990C2019) from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) to proxy concern about vaccine safety. Additionally, we suggest a potential mechanism for the effect of AW98 on vaccine skepticism, via automated sentiment analyses of MMR-related news stories (N = 674; from 1996C2000) in major television and newspaper outlets. RESULTS: AW98 led to an immediate increase of about 70 MMR injury claims cases per month, averaging across six estimation strategies (meta-analytic effect = 70.44 [52.19, 88.75], p < 0.01). Preliminary evidence suggests that the volume of negative media attention to MMR increased in the weeks following AW98s publication, across four estimation strategies (meta-analytic effect = 9.59% [3.66, 15.51], p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine skepticism increased following the publication of AW98, which was potentially made possible by increased negative media coverage of MMR. SIGNIFICANCE: Childhood vaccine skepticism presents an important challenge to widespread vaccine uptake, and undermines support for pro-vaccine health policies. In addition to advancing our understanding of the previously-obscured origins of US vaccine skepticism, our work cautions that high-profile media attention to inaccurate scientific studies can undermine public confidence in vaccines. We conclude by offering several recommendations that researchers and health communicators might consider to detect and address future threats to vaccine confidence.","output":"Quantifying the effect of Wakefield et al.

Takeover quality only improved when practices were presented in high-fidelity VR. After three times of exposure to transition requests, trust and transition performance of all groups converged to those of the high-fidelity VR group, demonstrating that: a) experiencing takeover transition during the training may reduce costs associated with first critical takeover request in highly automated driving, b) the VR tour with high level of interaction fidelity was superior to other training methods, and c) untrained and less-trained drivers learned about automation after a few trials.

The aim is to accurately estimate the uncertainty in the result of a CFD simulation at a lower computational cost than the standard Monte Carlo (MC) method. The gPC approach is based on the spectral decomposition of the random variables in terms of basis polynomials containing randomness and the unknown deterministic expansion coefficients. As opposed to the mostly used non-intrusive approach, in this work, we use the intrusive variant of the gPC method in the sense that the deterministic equations are modified to directly solve for the (coupled) expansion coefficients. To this end, we have tested the intrusive gPC implementation for both the laminar and the turbulent flow problems in CFD. The results are in accordance with the analytical and the non-intrusive approaches. The stochastic solver thus developed, can serve as an alternative to perform uncertainty quantification, especially when the non-intrusive methods are significantly expensive, which is mostly true for a lot of stochastic CFD problems.","output":"Intrusive Polynomial Chaos for CFD Using OpenFOAM"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a huge increase in the use of gloves, not just in health and care settings but also by the public.","output":"When its time to take the gloves off"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cemeteries are potential environmental reservoirs of pathogenic microorganisms from organic matter decomposition.

HIV incidence was found to be higher among key population groups, especially people who inject drugs. The annual AIDS-related deaths were estimated to be 69 thousand nationally. For all indicators, geographic variation in levels and trends between States existed. Interpretation & conclusions With a slow decline in annual new HIV infections by only 27 per cent from 2010 to 2017 against the national target of 75 per cent by 2020, the national target to end AIDS by 2030 may be missed; although at the sub-national level some States have made better progress to reduce new HIV infection. It calls for reinforcement of HIV prevention, diagnosis and treatment efforts by geographical regions and population groups.","output":"Findings from the 2017 HIV estimation round & trend analysis of key indicators 2010-2017: Evidence for prioritising HIV/AIDS programme in India."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hog producers' operational decisions can be informed by an awareness of risks associated with emergent and endemic diseases. Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) have been re-occurring every year since the first onset in 2013 with substantial losses across the hog production supply chain. Interestingly, a decreasing trend in PEDv incidence is visible. We assert that changes in human behaviors may underlie this trend. Disease prevention using biosecurity practices is used to minimize risk of infection but its efficacy is conditional on human behavior and risk attitude. Standard epidemiological models bring important insights into disease dynamics but have limited predictive ability. Since research shows that human behavior plays a driving role in the disease spread process, the explicit inclusion of human behavior into models adds an important dimension to understanding disease spread. Here we analyze PEDv incidence emerging from an agent-based model (ABM) that uses both epidemiological dynamics and algorithms that incorporate heterogeneous human decisions. We investigate the effects of shifting fractions of hog producers between risk tolerant and risk averse positions. These shifts affect the dynamics describing willingness to increase biosecurity as a response to disease threats and, indirectly, change infection probabilities and the resultant intensity and impact of the disease outbreak. Our ABM generates empirically verifiable patterns of PEDv transmission. Scenario results show that relatively small shifts (10% of the producer agents) toward a risk averse position can lead to a significant decrease in total incidence. For significantly steeper decreases in disease incidence, the model's hog producer population needed at least 37.5% of risk averse. Our study provides insight into the link between risk attitude, decisions related to biosecurity, and consequent spread of disease within a livestock production system. We suggest that it is possible to create positive, lasting changes in animal health by nudging the population of livestock producers toward more risk averse behaviors. We make a case for integrating social and epidemiological aspects in disease spread models to test intervention strategies intended to improve biosecurity and animal health at the system scale.","output":"Risk Attitudes Affect Livestock Biosecurity Decisions With Ramifications for Disease Control in a Simulated Production System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a severe global epidemic in human history. Even though there are particular medications and vaccines to curb the epidemic, tracing and isolating the infection source is the best option to slow the virus spread and reduce infection and death rates. There are three disadvantages to the existing contact tracing system: 1. User data is stored in a centralized database that could be stolen and tampered with, 2. User's confidential personal identity may be revealed to a third party or organization, 3. Existing contact tracing systems [1] [2] only focus on information sharing from one dimension, such as location-based tracing, which significantly limits the effectiveness of such systems. We propose a global COVID-19 information sharing and risk notification system that utilizes the Blockchain, Smart Contract, and Bluetooth. To protect user privacy, we design a novel Blockchain-based platform that can share consistent and non-tampered contact tracing information from multiple dimensions, such as location-based for indirect contact and Bluetooth-based for direct contact. Hierarchical smart contract architecture is also designed to achieve global agreements from users about how to process and utilize user data, thereby enhancing the data usage transparency. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism to protect user identity privacy from multiple aspects. More importantly, our system can notify the users about the exposure risk via smart contracts.

DESIGN: A single-center prospective observational study was carried out. SETTING: ICU of a tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Consecutive adults with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. INTERVENTION: Renal replacement therapy. MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Demographic data, medical history, illness severity, type of oxygen therapy, laboratory data and use of renal replacement therapy to generate a logistic regression model describing independent risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: Of the total of 166 patients, 51% were mechanically ventilated and 26% required renal replacement therapy. The overall hospital mortality rate was 36%, versus 56% for those requiring renal replacement therapy, and 68% for those with both mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy. The logistic regression model identified four independent risk factors for mortality: age (adjusted OR 2.8 [95% CI 1.8C4.4] for every 10-year increase), mechanical ventilation (4.2 [1.7C10.6]), need for continuous venovenous hemofiltration (2.3 [1.3C4.0]) and C-reactive protein (1.1 [1.0C1.2] for every 10 mg/L increase).

More than a billion people smoke, and without major increases in cessation, at least half will die prematurely from tobacco-related complications. In addition, people who smoke have a significant reduction in their quality of life. Neurobiological findings have identified the mechanisms by which nicotine in tobacco affects the brain reward system and causes addiction. These brain changes contribute to the maintenance of nicotine or tobacco use despite knowledge of its negative consequences, a hallmark of addiction. Effective approaches to screen, prevent and treat tobacco use can be widely implemented to limit tobacco's effect on individuals and society. The effectiveness of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions in helping people quit smoking has been demonstrated. As the majority of people who smoke ultimately relapse, it is important to enhance the reach of available interventions and to continue to develop novel interventions.

Thus, SPOs applicability depends on the durability of pushouts after this transition. There is a wide range of work on the question when pushouts exist in categories with partial morphisms starting with the pioneering work of L?we and Kennaway and ending with an essential characterisation in terms of an exactness property (for the interplay between pullbacks and pushouts) and an adjointness condition (w.r.t. inverse image functions) by Hayman and Heindel. Triple graphs and graph diagrams are frameworks to synchronize two or more updatable data sources by means of internal mappings, which identify common sub-structures. Comprehensive systems generalise these frameworks, treating the network of data sources and their structural inter-relations as a homogeneous comprehensive artifact, in which partial maps identify commonalities. Although this inherent partiality produces amplified complexity, Heindels characterisation still yields cocompleteness of the category of comprehensive systems equipped with closed partial morphisms and thus enables computing by SPO graph transformation.","output":"Single Pushout Rewriting in Comprehensive Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The evaluation of the natural history prevalence of adverse local tissue reactions (ALTRs) using MRI has focused only on metal-on-metal (MoM) bearing surfaces without comparison to nonMoM bearing surfaces. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES To determine (1) the longitudinal changes and differences in blood metal ion levels in patients with hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA), ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) THA, and metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) THA compared with those undergoing ceramic-on-polyethylene (CoP) THA; (2) how the longitudinal change of synovial reaction classification in patients with HRA, CoC THA, and MoP THA compares with those undergoing CoP THA, and whether there is an association between the presence of an ALTR or metallosis on MRI with corresponding patient-reported outcomes, or the presence of capsular dehiscence; and (3) differences in blood metal ion levels between patients undergoing HRA with an ALTR or metallosis on MRI and those with HRA without these conditions. METHODS Between March 2014 and February 2019, 22,723 patients underwent primary HRA and THA at one center. Patients received an HRA based on their desired athletic level after surgery and the presence of normal acetabular and proximal femoral bone morphology without osteopenia or osteoporosis. Two percent (342 of 22,723) of patients were contacted to participate, and 71% (243 of 342 hips in 206 patients) were enrolled for analysis at baseline. The patients underwent arthroplasty for degenerative joint disease, and 25 patients withdrew over the course of the study. We included patients who were more than 1 year postarthroplasty. All participants had an MRI examination and blood serum ion testing and completed a Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score survey annually for four years (baseline, year 1, year 2, year 3). Morphologic and susceptibility-reduced MR images were evaluated by a single radiologist not involved in the care of patients for the presence and classification of synovitis (Gwet AC1: 0.65 to 0.97), synovial thickness, and volume (coefficient of repeatability: 1.8 cm3). Linear mixed-effects models were used to compare the mean synovial thickness, synovial volume, and Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score subscales between bearing surfaces at each timepoint and within each bearing surface over time. Marginal Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the time to and the risk of developing ALTR only, metallosis only, and ALTR or metallosis between bearing surfaces. All models were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and length of implantation based on known confounders for hip arthroplasty. Adjustment for multiple comparisons was performed using the Dunnett-Hsu method. RESULTS Patients with unilateral HRA had higher cobalt and chromium serum ion levels (baseline: 1.8  0.8 ppb, year 1: 2.0  1.5 ppb, year 2: 2.1  1.2 ppb, year 3: 1.6  0.7 ppb) than those with unilateral CoP bearings (baseline: 0.0  0.1 ppb, year 1: 0.1  0.3 ppb, year 2: 0.0  0.2 ppb, year 3: 0.0  0.0 ppb) at all timepoints (p < 0.001 for each time point). More patients who received an HRA developed ALTR or metallosis on MRI than did patients with CoP bearings (hazard ratio 4.8 [95% confidence interval 1.2 to 18.4]; p = 0.02). There was no association between the longitudinal change of synovial reaction to ALTR or metallosis on MRI with patient-reported outcomes. In addition, there was no association between the presence of dehiscence at baseline and the subsequent development of ALTR or metallosis, as seen on MRI. There were elevated cobalt (4.7  3.5 ppb) and chromium (4.7  2.6 ppb) serum levels in patients with unilateral HRA who had an ALTR or metallosis present on MRI at year 1 compared with patients without an ALTR or metallosis on MRI (cobalt: 1.8  1.0 ppb, mean difference 4.7 ppb [95% CI 3.3 to 6.0]; p < 0.001; chromium: 2.3  0.5 ppb, mean difference 3.6 ppb [95% CI 2.2 to 5.0]; p < 0.001) as well as for chromium at year 3 (3.9  2.4 ppb versus 2.2  1.1 ppb, mean difference 1.3 ppb [95% CI 0.3 to 2.4]; p = 0.01). CONCLUSION We found a higher proportion of ALTR or metallosis on MRI in patients with HRA compared with patients with CoP, even when patient self-assessed symptomatology of those with an ALTR or metallosis on MRI was not different than the absence of these features. MRI detected ALTRs in high-function patients, emphasizing that an annual clinical assessment dependent on survey or blood ion testing alone may not detect soft tissue complications. The results of this study are in line with prior consensus recommendations of using MRI as part of a routine follow-up protocol for this patient population.

A second COVID-19 surge during December 13, 2020-January 31, 2021, caused incidence to peak at 413 cases per 100 000 community members.

Median time interval from nasopharyngeal specimen collection to both case investigation and contact notification was 0 days (range, 0-5 days and 0-13 days, respectively). Our primary lesson was the importance of cross-trained personnel who integrated tasks along the testing-tracing continuum (eg, in-person interviews, prompt referral for additional testing and evaluation). These successive steps fed forward to identify new cases and their respective contacts.

The aim of this study is to describe a novel hospital capacity versus clinical justification triage score (CCTS) to prioritize patients who require surgery during the \\"new normal state\\" of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY: A consensus study using the Delphi technique was carried out among clinicians from the Orthopaedic Surgery, Neurosurgery, and Anaesthesia departments. Three rounds of consensus were carried out via survey and Webinar discussions. RESULTS: A 50-points score system consisting of 4 domains with 4 subdomains was formed. The CCTS were categorized into the hospital capacity, patient factors, disease severity, and surgery complexity domains. A score between 30 and 50 points indicated that the proposed operation should proceed without delay. A score of less than 20 indicates that the proposed operation should be postponed. A score between 20 and 29 indicates that the surgery falls within a grey area where further discussion should be undertaken to make a joint justification for approval of surgery. CONCLUSION: This study is a proof of concept for the novel CCTS scoring system to prioritize surgeries to meet the rapidly changing demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. It offers a simple and objective method to stratify patients who require surgery and allows these complex and difficult decisions to be unbiased and made transparently among surgeons and hospital administrators.","output":"A novel hospital capacity versus clinical justification triage score (CCTS) for prioritization of spinal surgeries in the \\"new normal state\\" of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study explores the causes and effects of technology usefulness on shopping behavior of consumers in Mexico by measuring inter-relationships between the constructs of shopping with new-normal following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) business shutdown and online retail technology. Design/methodology/approach: This study has been conducted in six online retail stores with the online survey of 342 buyers in Mexico. Data have been analyzed using two regression models with dependent variables, perceived usefulness of technology and buying decision of customers. Multiple correlations across the variables were computed. Findings: Results of this study reveal that as customers found higher ease of use of online shopping, they perceived higher usefulness of online retailing technology. The perceived quality of retailing website positively influences impulsive buying behavior of customers. The study observed that increase in coupon promotions has positively enhanced the perceived buying impulsiveness of consumers in online stores. The perceived usefulness of online redemption of coupons has also positively benefited the attitude of customers toward buying. Research limitations/implications: Online shopping has attracted a large section of customers during the COVID-19 business shutdown, and peer interactions have motivated them to experience the retailing technology of virtual stores. This study offers important insights for managers working in the retailing industries. Online strategies of retailers with unified customer experiences during the pandemic and business shutdown has provided extensive online retail space.

COVID-19 is extremely contagious disease, and it can quickly incapacitate the healthcare systems if infected cases are not handled timely. Several Conventional Neural Networks (CNN) based techniques have been developed to diagnose the COVID-19. These techniques require a large, labelled dataset to train the algorithm fully, but there are not too many labelled datasets. To mitigate this problem and facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19, we developed a self-attention transformer-based approach having self-attention mechanism using CT slices. The architecture of transformer can exploit the ample unlabelled datasets using pre-training. The paper aims to compare the performances of self-attention transformer-based approach with CNN and Ensemble classifiers for diagnosis of COVID-19 using binary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and multi-class Hybrid-learning for UnbiaSed predicTion of COVID-19 (HUST-19) CT scan dataset. To perform this comparison, we have tested Deep learning-based classifiers and ensemble classifiers with proposed approach using CT scan images. Proposed approach is more effective in detection of COVID-19 with an accuracy of 99.7% on multi-class HUST-19, whereas 98% on binary class SARS-CoV-2 dataset.

METHODS AND MEASURES: Data were collected from 933 community-based adults without a previous diagnosis of PTSD in June 2020. The Primary Care PTSD Screen was adapted to assess pandemic-related PTSD symptoms. Participants were asked if alcohol or cannabis use had increased in the past month. Adjusted logistic regression models examined associations between pandemic-related PTSD symptoms and substance use. RESULTS: More women (19%) than men (13%) met criteria for high pandemic-related PTSD symptomology, while a similar percentage (13.4% of women, 13.2% of men) reported significant increases in substance use during the pandemic. Adults 18C35 years; those who believed they would become infected with the virus; and those with low income, education, or pandemic-related job loss were more likely to report PTSD symptoms. High pandemic-related PTSD symptomology was associated with a significant substance use increase among both women (OR = 2.2) and men (OR = 2.3) in adjusted models. Many adults (50% of women, 40% of men) reported they needed help to address these problems. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic-related PTSD symptoms were common among adults during Wave 1 of COVID-19. These symptoms were associated with a significant increase in substance use among women and men. Many adults voiced a need for help with these problems.

Many recent approaches have also extended U-Net with more complex building blocks, which typically increase the number of network parameters considerably. Such complexity makes the inference stage highly inefficient for clinical applications. Towards an effective yet economic segmentation network design, in this work, we propose backward skip connections that bring decoded features back to the encoder. Our design can be jointly adopted with forward skip connections in any encoder-decoder architecture forming a recurrence structure without introducing extra parameters. With the backward skip connections, we propose a U-Net based network family, namely Bi-directional O-shape networks, which set new benchmarks on multiple public medical imaging segmentation datasets. On the other hand, with the most plain architecture (BiO-Net), network computations inevitably increase along with the pre-set recurrence time. We have thus studied the deficiency bottleneck of such recurrent design and propose a novel two-phase Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm, namely BiX-NAS, to search for the best multi-scale bi-directional skip connections. The ineffective skip connections are then discarded to reduce computational costs and speed up network inference. The finally searched BiX-Net yields the least network complexity and outperforms other state-of-the-art counterparts by large margins. We evaluate our methods on both 2D and 3D segmentation tasks in a total of six datasets. Extensive ablation studies have also been conducted to provide a comprehensive analysis for our proposed methods.","output":"Towards Bi-directional Skip Connections in Encoder-Decoder Architectures and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a world disaster. COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus (DM) relationship is double-faced because DM is considered one of the COVID-19 key risk factors causing an increase in COVID-19 related conditions and death rates; at the same time, high stress in patients with COVID-19 can lead to the occurrence of DM. This relationship adversely affects immune functions. Relaxation techniques have been demonstrated to positively affect immune functions, glycemic control, and stress levels. METHODS: A search in Scopus, Web of Science, Medline databases, and EBSCO has been made. The search included clinical trials and systematic and literature reviews on the effects of relaxation techniques on immune functions, glycemic control, and stress levels. RESULTS: This review found that relaxation techniques produce short-term effects on decreasing stress levels through an autonomic regulation, controlling glycemic control through decreasing hyperglycemia, and increasing immune functions through increasing immune cells and immunoglobins A. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes the important role of performing regular relaxation techniques for COVID-19 patients with DM.

Due to the widespread usage of parsers, there exist different tools aimed at automizing their generation. Two of the most common parser generation tools are the classic Lex/Yacc and ANTLR. Even though ANTLR provides more advanced features, Lex/Yacc is still the preferred choice in many university courses. There exist different qualitative comparisons of the features provided by both approaches, but no study evaluates empirical features such as language implementor productivity and tool simplicity, intuitiveness, and maintainability. In this article, we present such an empirical study by conducting an experiment with undergraduate students of a Software Engineering degree.

The efficacy, safety and oral corticosteroid-sparing potential of tezepelumab are being investigated in two ongoing, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (NAVIGATOR [NCT03347279] and SOURCE [NCT03406078]). DESTINATION (NCT03706079) is a long-term extension (LTE) of these studies. METHODS: DESTINATION is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled LTE study in adults (18C80 years old) and adolescents (12C17 years old) with severe, uncontrolled asthma who are receiving treatment with medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus at least one additional controller medication with or without oral corticosteroids. The study population will comprise patients who complete the 52- and 48-week NAVIGATOR and SOURCE studies, respectively. Patients who were randomized to receive tezepelumab 210 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) in either predecessor study will continue to receive this regimen for 1 year; those who were previously randomized to receive placebo will be re-randomized (1:1) to receive either tezepelumab 210 mg Q4W or placebo for 1 year. Patients will receive their prescribed controller medications throughout DESTINATION and study physicians will have the opportunity to down- or up-titrate dosage of these medications, if appropriate. The primary objective is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of tezepelumab over 104 weeks (inclusive of the treatment period of either predecessor study). The secondary objective is to assess the long-term effect of tezepelumab on asthma exacerbations. Patients recruited from SOURCE will be followed up post-treatment for 12 weeks. Patients recruited from NAVIGATOR who complete 100 weeks of tezepelumab treatment will be eligible for either 12 weeks of follow-up or a 36-week extended follow-up during which the clinical benefit of tezepelumab after treatment cessation will be investigated. DISCUSSION: DESTINATION will evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of tezepelumab versus placebo with continued dosing for up to 2 years. DESTINATION will also evaluate the clinical effect of tezepelumab after treatment cessation. This LTE study aims to elucidate the long-term safety implications of receiving tezepelumab and to assess its potential long-term treatment benefits in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma.

The aim of the study was to assess how the tree species of urban agglomerations affect soil quality and enzymatic activity (dehydrogenases DEH, catalase CAT, alkaline AlP and acid AcP phosphatase, protease PR, ?-glucosidase GLU, and urease UR). To this end, soil samples were taken from beneath nine park trees. The risk of soil contamination by selected heavy metals (Pb, Ni, Cd) was also investigated against the background of the selected physicochemical properties. Enzyme activity results were used to calculate multi-parametric indices of soil quality: availability factor (AF), enzymatic pH indicator (AlP/AcP), biological index of fertility (BIF), geometric mean (GMea), alternation index (Al3), biochemical soil activity (BA16 and BA17). The results showed statistically significant differences in physicochemical and enzymatic properties of soil depending on tree species. Correlation analysis showed that the content of total organic carbon (TOC), total nirogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and humus (OM) in soil significantly influenced the activity of the studied enzymes and glomalin content. AF coefficient values (1.84%-18.19%) suggest that the bioavailability of available phosphorus (AP) was sufficient. The Pb, Ni, Cd content results were found to be low and did not exceed the permissible concentrations. DEH, CAT and AlP activity were highest under common hawthorn, and AcP, GLU and PR under northern white cedar. The calculated enzymatic indicators proved to be a sensitive and accurate indicator of the dynamics of changes taking place in the city park soil.

Prior studies have demonstrated that local socioeconomic and built environment characteristics may significantly contribute to viral transmission and incidence rates, thereby accounting for some of the spatial variation observed. Due to uncertainties, non-linearities, and multiple interaction effects observed in the associations between COVID-19 incidence and socioeconomic, infrastructural, and built environment characteristics, we present a structured multimethod approach for analysing cross-sectional incidence data within in an Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) framework at the NUTS3 (county) scale. METHODS: By sequentially conducting a geospatial analysis, an heuristic geographical interpretation, a Bayesian machine learning analysis, and parameterising a Generalised Additive Model (GAM), we assessed associations between incidence rates and 368 independent variables describing geographical patterns, socioeconomic risk factors, infrastructure, and features of the build environment. A spatial trend analysis and Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation were used to characterise the geography of age-adjusted COVID-19 incidence rates across Germany, followed by iterative modelling using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) to identify and measure candidate explanatory variables. Partial dependence plots were derived to quantify and contextualise BART model results, followed by the parameterisation of a GAM to assess correlations. RESULTS: A strong south-to-north gradient of COVID-19 incidence was identified, facilitating an empirical classification of the study area into two epidemic subregions. All preliminary and final models indicated that location, densities of the built environment, and socioeconomic variables were important predictors of incidence rates in Germany. The top ten predictor variables' partial dependence exhibited multiple non-linearities in the relationships between key predictor variables and COVID-19 incidence rates. The BART, partial dependence, and GAM results indicate that the strongest predictors of COVID-19 incidence at the county scale were related to community interconnectedness, geographical location, transportation infrastructure, and labour market structure. CONCLUSIONS: The multimethod ESDA approach provided unique insights into spatial and aspatial non-stationarities of COVID-19 incidence in Germany. BART and GAM modelling indicated that geographical configuration, built environment densities, socioeconomic characteristics, and infrastructure all exhibit associations with COVID-19 incidence in Germany when assessed at the county scale. The results suggest that measures to implement social distancing and reduce unnecessary travel may be important methods for reducing contagion, and the authors call for further research to investigate the observed associations to inform prevention and control policy.","output":"A multimethod approach for county-scale geospatial analysis of emerging infectious diseases: a cross-sectional case study of COVID-19 incidence in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that is responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has rapidly spread across the world, becoming a pandemic.

A total of 1,583 people responded to the survey between October 14 and November 2, 2020. We measured a wide range of demographic and data on mental illness, as well as data on the fear of COVID-19. Data on sense of control, ego-resilience, grit, self-compassion, and indicators of resilience were also collected.Outcomes: Sense of control was negatively associated with mental illness in all four countries. Self-compassion was negatively associated with mental illness (depression, anxiety, and stress) in samples from Japan, China, and the U.S. We also found an interaction effect for sense of control: the lower the sense of control , the stronger the deterioration of mental illness when the fear of COVID-19 was high.

PARTICIPANTS: Ambulance records were obtained from 588 690 attendances during pre-lockdown (prior to 17 February 2020) and from 36 238 records during the lockdown period (23 March to 26 April 2020). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ambulance service utilisation during lockdown was compared with pre-lockdown: (a) descriptive analyses of ambulance events and proportions of event types for each period, (b) absolute rates of ambulance attendance (event types/week) for each period. RESULTS: During lockdown, ambulance patients were more likely to be attended at home and less likely to be aged between 16 and 25 years. There was a significant increase in the proportion of lower acuity patients (Status 3 and Status 4) attended (p<0.001) and a corresponding increase in patients not transported from scene (p<0.001). Road traffic crashes (p<0.001) and alcohol-related incidents (p<0.001) significantly decreased. There was a decrease in the absolute number of weekly ambulance attendances (ratio (95% CI), 0.89 (0.87 to 0.91), p<0.001), attendances to respiratory conditions (0.74 (0.61 to 0.86), p=0.01), and trauma (0.81 (0.77 to 0.85), p<0.001). However, there was a significant increase in ambulance attendances for mental health conditions (1.37 (1.22 to 1.51), p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relative absence of COVID-19 in the community during the 5-week nationwide lockdown, there were significant differences in ambulance utilisation during this period. The lockdown was associated with an increase in ambulance attendances for mental health conditions and is of concern. In considering future lockdowns, the potential implications on a populations mental well-being will need to be seriously considered against the benefits of elimination of virus transmission.","output":"Changes in demand for emergency ambulances during a nationwide lockdown that resulted in elimination of COVID-19: an observational study from New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In other leadership roles, Larkin has been * founding treasurer of the Wisconsin Association of Clinical Nurse Specialists (2012-2015), * a member of the Wisconsin Association of Clinical Nurse Specialists Steering Committee (2012-2018), and * co-chair of the Wisconsin State Chief Nursing Officer-Clinical Nurse Specialists Shared Governance Breakfast (2016-2017).

Multiple predisposing factors (for example, pre-existing cognitive impairment) and precipitating factors (for example, urinary tract infection) for delirium have been described, with most patients having both types. Because multiple factors are implicated in the aetiology of delirium, there are likely several neurobiological processes that contribute to delirium pathogenesis, including neuroinflammation, brain vascular dysfunction, altered brain metabolism, neurotransmitter imbalance and impaired neuronal network connectivity. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) is the most commonly used diagnostic system upon which a reference standard diagnosis is made, although many other delirium screening tools have been developed given the impracticality of using the DSM-5 in many settings. Pharmacological treatments for delirium (such as antipsychotic drugs) are not effective, reflecting substantial gaps in our understanding of its pathophysiology. Currently, the best management strategies are multidomain interventions that focus on treating precipitating conditions, medication review, managing distress, mitigating complications and maintaining engagement to environmental issues.

The current study aimed to describe changes in family rules and routines during the first year of pediatric cancer treatment, and to explore associations with demographics, illness factors, and caregiver distress. METHODS: This exploratory mixed-methods, cross-sectional study examined 44 primary caregivers of youth in treatment for a new cancer diagnosis in 2019 and 2020, before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Caregivers completed validated questionnaires assessing demographic and child illness characteristics, psychosocial distress, and cancer-related stressors, and participated in a semi-structured interview about family rules and routines. RESULTS: Caregivers reported changes in bedtime, mealtime, and school routines, relaxed behavioral expectations and rules around screen time, and new rules and routines around treatment, medications, and infection control. Caregivers with elevated levels of psychosocial distress reported more changed routines than caregivers with low levels of psychosocial distress. Caregivers who endorsed more cancer-related stressors reported more new rules and routines than those who reported fewer cancer-related stressors. Demographic and illness factors were not significantly associated with the number of changed, new, or stable family rules and routines. CONCLUSIONS: Families may relax rules and routines during the first several months of diagnosis, and this may be related to side effects of treatment and limited caregiver capacity.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to evaluate pharmacological treatment patterns by COVID-19 severity and identify the determinants of prescribing for COVID-19. METHODS: Using electronic health record data from a large Massachusetts-based healthcare system, we identified all patients aged &#8805; 18 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 1 March to 24 May, 2020. We defined five levels of COVID-19 severity at hospital admission: (1) hospitalized but not requiring supplemental oxygen; (2-4) hospitalized and requiring oxygen &#8804; 2, 3-4, and &#8805; 5 L per minute, respectively; and (5) intubated or admitted to an intensive care unit. We assessed the medications used to treat COVID-19 or as supportive care during hospitalization. RESULTS: Among 2821 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, we found inpatient mortality increased by severity from 5% for level 1 to 23% for level 5. As compared to patients with severity level 1, those with severity level 5 were 3.53 times (95% confidence interval 2.73-4.57) more likely to receive a medication used to treat COVID-19. Other predictors of treatment were fever, low oxygen saturation, presence of co-morbidities, and elevated inflammatory biomarkers. The use of most COVID-19 relevant medications has dropped substantially while the use of remdesivir and therapeutic anticoagulants has increased over the study period.

The putative recombination region is located inside the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein (S protein), which may represent the origin of SARS-CoV-2. Population genetic analyses provide estimates suggesting that the putative introduced DNA within the RBD is undergoing directional evolution. This may result in the adaptation of the virus to hosts. Unsurprisingly, we found that the putative recombination region in S protein was highly diverse among strains from bats.

Methods: A comprehensive literature review for the years 2005C2020 via MEDLINE and PubMed. We included randomised controlled trials that compared the use of either PDE-5i alone, PI alone or a combination of PDE-5i and PI in the treatment of psychogenic ED. All studies included were performed in adults aged 19C55 years and were written in English. Results: A total of 13 articles, with an overall sample of 597 men, were included in this systematic review. The results show that the combination of PI and PDE-5i was more effective than either PI or PDE-5i alone, on erectile function and long-term sexual satisfaction in men with psychogenic ED. Combined interventions were found to be significantly superior to medical treatment in seven studies and to PI alone in one study. In comparing PI to PDE-5i, two studies found PI to be significantly superior to PDE-5i use. In three other studies, PI was found significantly superior to no treatment at all, although some participants in the control group had taken PDE-5i. Conclusions: The combination of PDE-5i with PI shows real promise for the treatment of psychogenic ED.

Data capture and DMC reports should be focused on the most informative measures about benefits and risks. Since numerous clinical trials are being concurrently conducted in the COVID-19 setting, often addressing closely related scientific questions, structures for DMC oversight should be efficient and adequately informative. When these concurrently conducted trials are evaluating related regimens in related clinical settings, often individually underpowered for safety and having separate DMCs, processes should be implemented enabling these DMCs to share with each other emerging confidential evidence to better assess risks and benefits.

Thus, for both developed and developing countries, the pandemic, and the challenges it surfaced, meant a protracted test of resilience for governments and the existing world order. For the Philippines, the COVID-19 health crisis has managed to exacerbate the deep-rooted societal issues of inequality, corruption, and injustice. Yet, it also seems that the pandemic has somehow managed to trigger both public officials and Filipino citizens to question and to think more deeply about the capabilities and the readiness of a highly centralized bureaucracy to shift to a federal or more decentralized form of government.This unease is heightened even further in the face of the current administration operating within an almost absolutely centralized and uniform policy and governance framework during this pandemic as prescribed by the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act of 2020. This law essentially enabled the President to have almost absolute control over all government machinery and more. More importantly though, the handling of the crisis also uncovered signs of disconnect across the different levels of the Philippine government, especially as tensions between local government units and the national government unfold.As such, this paper will attempt to describe these centralization-decentralization tensions and provide an explanation of its sources to understand and assess the current decentralization context of the Philippines using the governments COVID-19 crisis response as the frame of reference.

We used maximum likelihood estimations to assess containment delays (time between symptom onset and start of isolation) and multivariable regression to identify associated factors between interventions and COVID-19 incidence. We calculated effective reproductive numbers (Rt) based on transmission pairs. RESULTS: Interventions were introduced periodically in response to the epidemic. 817 (55.4%) among 1,474 COVID-19 cases were imported. Based on a serial interval of 8.72 (5.65) days, we estimated Rt to reduce below 1 (lowest at 0.02 (95%CI 0-0.12)) during periods of strict border control and contact tracing, and to increase ahead of new clusters.

Whereas most of the infected individuals have no symptoms or only mild symptoms, in a small minority, the infection can lead to pneumonia and death. One major concern regarding the pandemic is the 2.3% average case fatality rate of the COVID-19 patients, with the fatality rate increasing to 8% for patients aged 70 to 79 and 14.8% for those aged 80 and over. Another major concern is the person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus by asymptomatic individuals during the incubation period, making it difficult to limit the spread of the disease. Many steps are underway worldwide to limit the spread of the disease, e.g. cancellation of conferences and large gatherings, closure of schools, curtailment of travel, etc. Considering the magnitude of the adverse impact on the social, cultural, commercial, educational, scientific, health, and other aspects of the society from such steps and the large anticipated casualties with the expected spread of the disease worldwide, it is important to explore methods of reducing the fatality rates of COVID-19 patients. Since the weakness of the immune system is one of the major contributing factors for the occurrence of pneumonia, and inflammation contributes to increased mortality rates of pneumonia patients, interventions that improve the immune response and/or reduce inflammation may reduce the pneumonia incidence and mortality in COVID-19 patients. There are indeed a large number of interventions that improve the immune response and/or reduce inflammation. However, all the interventions would not be applicable or acceptable to everyone and so the interventions would need to be individualized based on individual circumstances and preferences. This approach, known as Individualized Interventions to Improve the Immune Response, or the I4R approach needs to be tested in pilot clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. If the pilot clinical trials demonstrate that it is effective in reducing the incidence and mortality due to pneumonia, widespread adoption of the I4R approach for treating COVID-19 patients may reduce their morbidity and mortality, reducing the concerns regarding the coronavirus. This may be helpful in reducing the need for the drastic steps that have been taken worldwide, and help in the return of life to normalcy. Therefore, clinical trials of the I4R approach should be conducted on an urgent basis.","output":"Treatment of COVID-19 with Individualized Immune Boosting Interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study examined the relationship between perception of COVID-19, travel risk perception and travel behaviour among travellers in the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland)Can important tourism market and, after Italy, the second region in Europe that was impacted by COVID-19.

Ten paralyzed patients undergoing volume-controlled ventilation were studied; 30 breaths for each patient were identified to compare LPF and ETA. For ETA the identified breaths were temporally aligned on the beginning of inspiration; the values of the thirty curves at each time point were averaged. The analysis was conducted on the global EIT signal and on four ventral-to-dorsal regions of interest. Global tidal variations by ETA resulted higher than LPF (average difference 139  88 arbitrary units, p = 0.004). Both for global and regional waveforms, minimum and maximum EIT slopes were steeper by ETA as compared to LPF (average difference respectively ? 57  60 mL/s and 144  96 mL/s for global signal, p < 0.05); ventilator inspiratory peak airflow correlated with maximum slope measured by ETA (r = 0.902, p < 0.001), but not LPF (p = 0.319).

ROC curves and logistic regression were used for analysis. Forty-two preterm infants were included. The LUS on the 7th DOL had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.87C1) for the prediction of sBPD (optimal cutoff of 8 points: sensitivity 93%, specificity 91%). The LUS score was independently associated with sBPD [OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.1C3.9), p = 0.022, for each additional point in the score]. Conclusions: Lung aeration as assessed by LUS on the 7th DOL may predict the development of sBPD.","output":"Early assessment of lung aeration using an ultrasound score as a biomarker of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia: a prospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) with or without splenic preservation is increasingly performed for benign or border-line neoplasms of the body and tail of the pancreas.

Cytoplasmic hybrid cells (cybrids) harboring different Mthapgs were used to observe functional differences under hypoxia-ischemia. RNA sequencing (RNASeq) was conducted to identify the particularly elevated mRNA. The patient study identified an association between Mthapg F1 and risk of ischemic stroke (OR 1.72:1.27-2.34, p = 0.001). The cellular study further demonstrated an impeded induction of hypoxic inducible factor 1 in the Mthapg F1 cybrid after hypoxia-ischemia. Additionally, the study demonstrated that Mthapg F cybrids were associated with an altered mitochondrial function, including decreased oxygen consumption, higher mitochondrial ROS production, and lower mitochondrial membrane potential. Mthapg F cybrids were also noted to be prone to inflammation, with increased expression of several inflammatory cytokines and elevated matrix metalloproteinase 9. The RNASeq identified significantly elevated expressions of angiopoietin-like 4 in Mthapg F1 cybrids after hypoxia-ischemia.

This has resulted in significantly decreased length of stay, mortality and post-operative complications in this patient cohort. However, there is increasing recognition of frail patients in all age groups sustaining all fragility fractures. Until recently, these patients experienced poorer outcomes and were excluded from the dedicated care pathways that hip fracture patients received. The BPT and other national guidelines are now expanding inclusion criteria into care packages between guidelines which were initially reserved for hip fracture patients. This expansion is placing increasing pressure on limited NHS resources. Current variations between society guidelines risks producing regional and departmental inconsistencies in care. There is therefore a need to provide consistent guideline targeted at the most vulnerable trauma patients of this expanded cohort. Although the current BPT applies to over 60s only, there is limited evidence to support age-related prognosis in trauma. In contrast, frailty is being increasingly recognised as a global indicator of patient outcomes irrespective of age, with use of Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) being adopted in various medical fields. BOAST is already using CFS as an inclusion criterion for major trauma and there is increasing data to suggest that frail trauma patients benefit most from comprehensive geriatric care and expedient time-to-operation.

The activity of ten-eleven translocase 2 (TET2) responsible for selective DNA demethylation, has been recently identified as a regulator of endogenous virus inactivation and viral invasion, possibly by proteasomal deregulation of the TET2/TET3 activities. In a recent report, we presented a detailed list of factors that can be affected by TET activity, including recognition of zinc finger protein binding sites and bimodal promoters, by enhancing the flexibility of adjacent sequences. In this review, we summarize the TET-associated processes and factors that could account for SARS-CoV-2 diverse symptoms. Moreover, we provide a correlation for the observed virus-induced symptoms that have been previously associated with TET activities by in vitro and in vitro studies. These include early hypoxia, neuronal regulation, smell and taste development, liver, intestinal, and cardiomyocyte differentiation. Finally, we propose that the high mortality of SARS-CoV-2 among adult patients, the different clinical symptoms of adults compared to children, the higher risk of patients with metabolic deregulation, and the low mortality rates among women can all be accounted for by the complex balance of the three enzymes with TET activity, which is developmentally regulated. This activity is age-dependent, related to telomere homeostasis and integrity, and associated with X chromosome inactivation via (de)regulation of the responsible XIST gene expression.","output":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection: Triggering a Lethal Fight to Keep Control of the Ten-Eleven Translocase (TET)-Associated DNA Demethylation?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The advent of COVID-19 has revealed the inability of the Cameroonian Government to provide information to all its citizens in the languages they understand best since a majority of the languages are neither developed for use nor empowered by the language policy of the country Based on data from online and secondary sources this study highlights and insists on the necessity to develop and use national languages in official communication particularly when transmitting health related information If this is done, it will become possible to easily reach out to all Cameroonians with vital information for their wellbeing whenever need be Other sectors of the country such as education and agriculture would benefit squarely from a language policy that incorporates the language of each and every Cameroonian","output":"Legitimizing the development and use of Cameroon's national languages: lessons from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chest X-ray imaging technology used for the early detection and screening of COVID-19 pneumonia is both accessible worldwide and affordable compared to other non-invasive technologies. Additionally, deep learning methods have recently shown remarkable results in detecting COVID-19 on chest X-rays, making it a promising screening technology for COVID-19. Deep learning relies on a large amount of data to avoid overfitting. While overfitting can result in perfect modeling on the original training dataset, on a new testing dataset it can fail to achieve high accuracy. In the image processing field, an image augmentation step (i.e., adding more training data) is often used to reduce overfitting on the training dataset, and improve prediction accuracy on the testing dataset. In this paper, we examined the impact of geometric augmentations as implemented in several recent publications for detecting COVID-19. We compared the performance of 17 deep learning algorithms with and without different geometric augmentations. We empirically examined the influence of augmentation with respect to detection accuracy, dataset diversity, augmentation methodology, and network size. Contrary to expectation, our results show that the removal of recently used geometrical augmentation steps actually improved the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 17 models.

AIM: To determine whether APOE alleles affect outcomes in HCV-infected patients with liver cirrhosis following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). METHODS: This was a cohort study in which 179 patients, both genders and aged 34-70 years, were included before or after (up to 10 years follow-up) OLT. Liver injury severity was assessed using different criteria, including METAVIR and models for end-stage liver disease. APOE polymorphisms were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The APOE3 allele was the most common (67.3%). In inflammation severity of biopsies from 89 OLT explants and 2 patients in pre-transplant, the degree of severe inflammation (A3F4, 0.0%) was significantly less frequent than in patients with minimal and moderate degree of inflammation ( A2F4, 16.2%) P = 0.048, in patients carrying the APOE4 allele when compared to non-APOE4.

During the early epidemic with intensive social contacts, the results reveal that the average transmissibility t was 0.026 and the basic reproductive number R 0 was 6.94, triple that in the WHO report, indicating that all people would be infected in one month. The t and R 0 decreased to 0.0007 and 0.2 when quarantine was implemented. The reconstruction suggests that diluting the airborne virus concentration in closed settings is useful in addition to isolation, and high-risk susceptible should follow rigorous prevention measures in case exposed. This study can provide useful implications for control and prevention measures for the other cruise ships and closed settings.","output":"Using the contact network model and Metropolis-Hastings sampling to reconstruct the COVID-19 spread on the Diamond Princess"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the outset of 2021, the outlook is one of contrasts The US economy carries little momentum into the new year A catastrophic third Covid wave is limiting mobility, curbing employment and constraining demand Yet, while worsening health conditions will weigh on growth in the near term, a mix of fresh government transfers and gradual vaccinations should lead to firming activity and a summer mini-boom Real GDP is likely to grow around 3 9% y/y in Q4 2021, versus 2 9% y/y in the October baseline, on the back of increased fiscal stimulus ?

However, with the advent of minimally invasive surgery, the laparoscopic approach is gaining popularity. There is no consensus on the appropriate setting for laparoscopic therapy for small bowel obstruction (SBO). AIM AND OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of laparoscopic surgery for ASBO. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated the prospectively collected data of all the 38 patients who had undergone laparoscopy for ASBO, performed by a single surgeon at our institution, due to adhesions (30 patients), internal hernias (five patients), midgut malrotation (one patient), ileo-ileal intussusception (one patient), and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome (one patient) from 2012 to 2020. Data were extracted from the hospital electronic medical records (EMR) for the following parameters of each individual patient: age, sex, clinical presentation, preoperative investigation findings, final diagnosis, surgical details, operating time, time to postoperative oral feeds, length of hospital stay, complications, recurrences, and time taken to resume normal activity. A preoperative abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) was performed in all the cases. Patients with peritonitis and septic shock were excluded from the study. Results: The mean age of the 38 patients was 58 years (ranged between 33 and 83 years) with a standard deviation (SD) of 16.5. The mean age of the female patients in the study was 60.5 years with an SD of 16.6, while the mean age of the male patients was 54.9 years (SD = 16.2). The age difference between male and female patients in the study was not statistically significant (p = 0.36). The mean operating time was 74.4 minutes (range: 60-90 minutes, with an SD of 7.2). The mean time to oral liquid/soft diet was 2.5 days. The mean postoperative stay was 5.7 days. Three patients (8%) underwent conversion to open surgery, out of which two patients had multiple complex bowel-to-bowel and bowel-to-parietes adhesions, and in one patient, massive distension of small bowel caused technical difficulties. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic management of ASBO is feasible, effective, and safe. Optimum surgical techniques, the surgeon's experience with the procedure, and stringent patient selection criteria enable a high probability of success.","output":"Role of Laparoscopy in the Surgical Management of Acute Small Bowel Obstruction: Fact or Fiction?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hydatidiform moles can be fatal because of the risk of massive bleeding or thyroid storm; however, they rarely occur concomitantly with sepsis.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the implementation experiences of locally initiated palliative care improvement projects at seven diverse sites and understand the barriers and facilitators of using QI to improve palliative care in India. PARTICIPANTS: We use a quota sampling approach to capture the perspectives of 44 local stakeholders in each of the following three categories (organizational leaders, clinic leaders, and clinical team members) through a semi-structured interview guide informed by the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR). We use standard qualitative methods to identify facilitators and barriers to using QI methods in seven diverse palliative care contexts. RESULTS: Across all sites, respondents emphasized the following factors important in the success of quality improvement initiative: leveraging clinic level data, QI methods training, provider buy-in, engaged mentors, committed leadership, team support, interdepartmental coordination, collaborations with other providers, local champions, and having a structure for accountability. Barriers to using QI methods to improve palliative care services included lack of designated staff, high patient volume, resources, patient population geographic constraints, general awareness and acceptance of palliative care, and culture.

But this topic still remains among the most relevant issues in complex network theory due to its range of applicability. The contact process (CP) and the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model are used quite often to describe epidemic dynamics. Despite their simplicity, these models are robust to predict the kernel of real situations. In this work, we review concisely both processes that are well-known and very applied examples of models that exhibit absorbing-state phase transitions. In the epidemic scenario, individuals can be infected or susceptible. A phase transition between a disease-free (absorbing) state and an active stationary phase (where a fraction of the population is infected) are separated by an epidemic threshold. For the SIS model, the central issue is to determine this epidemic threshold on heterogeneous networks. For the CP model, the main interest is to relate critical exponents with statistical properties of the network.","output":"An overview of epidemic models with phase transitions to absorbing states running on top of complex networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on lung ultrasound (LUS) patterns, and their relationship with intracranial pressure (ICP) in brain injured patients have not been completely clarified. The primary aim of this study was to assess the effect of two levels of PEEP (5 and 15 cmH(2)O) on global (LUStot) and regional (anterior, lateral, and posterior areas) LUS scores and their correlation with changes of invasive ICP. Secondary aims included: the evaluation of the effect of PEEP on respiratory mechanics, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) and hemodynamics; the correlation between changes in ICP and LUS as well as respiratory parameters; the identification of factors at baseline as potential predictors of ICP response to higher PEEP. METHODS: Prospective, observational study including adult mechanically ventilated patients with acute brain injury requiring invasive ICP. Total and regional LUS scores, ICP, respiratory mechanics, and arterial blood gases values were analyzed at PEEP 5 and 15 cmH(2)O. RESULTS: Thirty patients were included; 19 of them (63.3%) were male, with median age of 65 years [interquartile range (IQR) = 66.7C76.0]. PEEP from 5 to 15 cmH(2)O reduced LUS score in the posterior regions (LUSp, median value from 7 [5C8] to 4.5 [3.7C6], p = 0.002). Changes in ICP were significantly correlated with changes in LUStot (rho = 0.631, p = 0.0002), LUSp (rho = 0.663, p < 0.0001), respiratory system compliance (rho = ? 0.599, p < 0.0001), mean arterial pressure (rho = ? 0.833, p < 0.0001) and PaCO(2) (rho = 0.819, p < 0.0001). Baseline LUStot score predicted the increase of ICP with PEEP. CONCLUSIONS: LUS-together with the evaluation of respiratory and clinical variables-can assist the clinicians in the bedside assessment and prediction of the effect of PEEP on ICP in patients with acute brain injury.

Indeed, directly transmitted pathogens have long been considered a major cost of group living in humans and other social animals, as well as a driver of the evolution of group size and social behaviour. As the risk and frequency of emerging infectious diseases rise, the ability of social taxa to respond appropriately to changing infectious disease pressures could mean the difference between persistence and extinction. Here, we examine changes in the social behaviour of humans and wildlife in response to infectious diseases and compare these responses to theoretical expectations. We consider constraints on altering social behaviour in the face of emerging diseases, including the lack of behavioural plasticity, environmental limitations and conflicting pressures from the many benefits of group living. We also explore the ways that social animals can minimize the costs of disease-induced changes to sociality and the unique advantages that humans may have in maintaining the benefits of sociality despite social distancing.","output":"Emerging infectious disease and the challenges of social distancing in human and non-human animals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Universal access to assessment and treatment of mental health and learning disorders remains a significant and unmet need. There are many people without access to care because of economic, geographic, and cultural barriers, as well as the limited availability of clinical experts who could help advance our understanding and treatment of mental health. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to create an open, configurable software platform to build clinical measures, mobile assessments, tasks, and interventions without programming expertise. Specifically, our primary requirements include an administrator interface for creating and scheduling recurring and customized questionnaires where end users receive and respond to scheduled notifications via an iOS or Android app on a mobile device. Such a platform would help relieve overwhelmed health systems and empower remote and disadvantaged subgroups in need of accurate and effective information, assessment, and care. This platform has the potential to advance scientific research by supporting the collection of data with instruments tailored to specific scientific questions from large, distributed, and diverse populations. METHODS: We searched for products that satisfy these requirements. We designed and developed a new software platform called MindLogger, which exceeds the requirements. To demonstrate the platforms configurability, we built multiple applets (collections of activities) within the MindLogger mobile app and deployed several of them, including a comprehensive set of assessments underway in a large-scale, longitudinal mental health study. RESULTS: Of the hundreds of products we researched, we found 10 that met our primary requirements with 4 that support end-to-end encryption, 2 that enable restricted access to individual users data, 1 that provides open-source software, and none that satisfy all three. We compared features related to information presentation and data capture capabilities; privacy and security; and access to the product, code, and data. We successfully built MindLogger mobile and web applications, as well as web browserCbased tools for building and editing new applets and for administering them to end users. MindLogger has end-to-end encryption, enables restricted access, is open source, and supports a variety of data collection features. One applet is currently collecting data from children and adolescents in our mental health study, and other applets are in different stages of testing and deployment for use in clinical and research settings. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the flexibility and applicability of the MindLogger platform through its deployment in a large-scale, longitudinal, mobile mental health study and by building a variety of other mental healthCrelated applets. With this release, we encourage a broad range of users to apply the MindLogger platform to create and test applets to advance health care and scientific research. We hope that increasing the availability of applets designed to assess and administer interventions will facilitate access to health care in the general population.","output":"Remote Digital Psychiatry for Mobile Mental Health Assessment and Therapy: MindLogger Platform Development Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is one of the rare haematological syndromes more commonly reported in infants/children than adults.

The majority of these studies used the standard Cox Proportional Hazards (Cox PH) model without taking into account the presence of competing risks. This study investigates, through extensive simulations, the bias in estimating the hazard ratio (HR) of death due to COVID-19 and the absolute risk reduction (ARR) when competing risks are not taken into consideration, and suggests an alternative method. Methods We simulated data for a fictive clinical trial in COVID-19 patients, to mimic recent trials involving the use of Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, and convalescent plasma therapy for example. The primary outcome is the time from randomization until death due to COVID-19. Six scenarios representing different situations of the effect of treatment on death and its competing event recovery were considered. The HR of death and the 28-day ARR were estimated using the Cox PH model and the Fine and Gray (FG) model which takes competing risks into account. The estimates were then compared to their corresponding true values and the magnitude of misestimation quantified. Results The Cox PH model misestimated the true HR of death in the majority of the scenarios. The magnitude of this misestimation increased when the process of recovery was faster and/or the chance of recovery was higher. In some cases, this model has also incorrectly shown a harmful effect of treatment when it was in fact beneficial. The true 28-day ARR of death was also misestimated, and this misestimation increased in magnitude when the process of recovery was faster. The results obtained from the FG competing risks model are all consistent and show no misestimation or changes in direction for both the HR and the 28-day ARR of death. Conclusion There is a substantial risk of misleading results in COVID-19 research if recovery and death are not considered as competing risk events. We strongly suggest the use of a competing risk approach to re-analyze relevant published data that have used the Cox PH model.","output":"The competing risk between in-hospital mortality and recovery: A pitfall in COVID-19 survival analysis research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Caribbean has experienced an overlapping and interconnected series of challenges, including economic, social, and environmental, which pose an existential threat to the region.

DESIGN: Participants were 129 adults (48.1% female, mean age 64.4 years) with an audiometric hearing loss, living in Glasgow, Scotland. A rapidly deployed 24-item online questionnaire asked about the effects of certain aspects of lockdown, including face masks, social distancing, and video calling, on participants' behavior, emotions, hearing performance, practical issues, and tinnitus. Data were analyzed descriptively across the entire sample, and with Chi-squared tests for differences between subgroups self-reporting relatively good and relatively poor unaided hearing, respectively. Additional free-text responses provided further perspectives. RESULTS: Behavior: Video calls are used more frequently than prelockdown. The better-hearing group use their hearing aids less. Emotions: There is increased anxiety (especially among the worse hearing group) concerning verbal communication situations and access to audiology services, and greater rumination about one's own hearing loss. Enjoyment of group video calls is mixed. The worse hearing group shows substantial relief at not being obliged to attend challenging social gatherings. Across both groups, a majority would like to see all key workers equipped with transparent face masks. Hearing performance: A large majority finds it hard to converse with people in face masks due to muffled sound and lack of speechreading cues, but conversing at a safe distance is not universally problematic. In the worse hearing group, performance in video calls is generally inferior to face-to-face, but similar to telephone calls. Those who use live subtitling in video calls appreciate their value. TV and radio updates about Covid-19 are easy to follow for most respondents. There is only weak evidence of face mask fixtures interfering with hearing aids on the ear, and of tinnitus having worsened during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: With due regard for the limitations of this rapid study, we find that there are many negative-and a few positive-effects of Covid-19 restrictions and safety measures on people with hearing loss. From a societal perspective, the widespread adoption of clear face masks may alleviate some of the difficulties and anxieties this population experience. From an individual perspective, one may consider using live subtitles on video calls. Manufacturers of hearing devices should consider developing processing modes and accessories specifically designed for video calls.

Understanding how these technologies are adopted over time is critical towards developing appropriate transportation policy measures. Most fundamentally: is adoption over time driven by demographic or geographic diffusion or a combination of the two? This study uses 2016 and 2018 survey data to explore the demographic and spatial predictors of changes in the adoption of on-demand ride-hailing, car sharing, and bike sharing in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) in Ontario, Canada. This study uses both descriptive statistics and inferential models to identify changes in the adoption process between 2016 and 2018. Trivariate ordered models estimated using diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) suggest that spatial diffusion plays a role (accounting for 9C44% of changes in adoption between 2016 and 2018), that joint demographic-spatial patterns explain some variation in adoption over time (4C11%), but that demographic controls explain most changes in adoption over time (approximately 39C49%). Notably, adoption is concentrated (albeit somewhat less so over time) among younger cohorts, and it increases among women, among larger households, and among households without children. It is unclear how these changes in adoption will be impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and future studies should explore the non-linear and complex nature of technology adoption, including the relative roles of service supply and demand changes.","output":"Shared mobility adoption from 2016 to 2018 in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area: Demographic or geographic diffusion?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Flow-diverter stent (FDS) placement for treatment of intracranial aneurysms can cause flow changes in the covered branches.

The circle of Willis anatomy was also studied as the flow changes in PComA postoperatively and during angiographic follow-up. Data from neurological examination were also collected. RESULTS Eighteen aneurysms of the carotid siphon in 17 patients were treated with FDS covering the ostium of the PComA. Based on the initial angiography, patients were divided into two groups: the first with a P1/PComA size ratio >1 (10 cases) and the second with a ratio 1 (8 cases). Follow-up angiography (mean time of 10 months) showed 90% of PComA flow changes in group 1 but only 12.5% in group 2. There was a significant difference between the two groups (p=0.002).

Imaging of lungs can play a key role in monitoring of the healthy status. Non-contrast chest computed tomography (CT) has been used for this purpose, mainly in China, with a significant success. However, this approach cannot be used massively mainly for both high risk and cost and in some countries also because this tool is not extensively available. Alternatively, chest X-ray, although less sensitive than CT-scan, can provide important information about the evolution of pulmonary involvement during the disease, this aspect is very important to verify the response of a patient to treatments. Here, we show how to improve the sensitivity of chest X-ray via a nonlinear post processing tool, named PACE, combining properly fast and adaptive bidimensional empirical mode decomposition and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). The results show an enhancement of the image contrast as confirmed by three widely used metrics: (i) contrast improvement index, (ii) entropy, and (iii) measure of enhancement. This improvement gives rise to a detectability of more lung lesions as identified by two radiologists, which evaluate the images separately, and confirmed by CT-scans.

An efficient contact tracing algorithm is then proposed to solve the general case of finite degree-regular graphs with multiple cycles.

Furthermore, the PEDV N protein harbouring truncations of amino acids (aa) 1 to 170 or aa 125 to 301 was demonstrated to cross-react with the anti-TGEV N polyclonal antibody (PAb), whereas the truncation-expressing aa 302 to 401 resulted in a specific reaction with the anti-PEDV N PAb but not with the anti-TGEV N PAb. Mutants of the PEDV N protein were generated based on sequence alignment and structural analysis; we then confirmed that the N-terminal residues 58-RWRMRRGERIE-68 and 78-LGTGPHAD-85 contributed to the cross-reactivity. All the results provide vital clues for the development of precise diagnostic assays for porcine coronaviruses.","output":"Two critical N-terminal epitopes of the nucleocapsid protein contribute to the cross-reactivity between porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The icephobic materials induced using micro-nano-structured surfaces have aroused great attention for promising applications. Previously, the characterization of ice adhesion of icephobic materials by shear force is usually performed without direction discrimination along the surface whatever the surface is anisotropic or not. In this work, we studied the direction-dependent ice adhesion strength on groove-shaped micro-nano-structured aluminum alloy surfaces formed using a femtosecond laser. It is found that the ice adhesion strength on the surfaces exhibits anisotropy, which corresponds to a smaller ice adhesion strength in the direction parallel to the groove than that orthogonal to the groove. Furthermore, it is found that the ice adhesion strength decreases with the increase in groove width in the orthogonal direction, while it does not change much in the parallel direction. The anisotropic ice adhesion strength is attributed to the change of wettability and morphology in the two directions. The findings in this work suggest that anisotropic ice adhesion should be fully considered when designing an icephobic micro-nano-structured metal structure, which is of great significance to the characterization and application of icephobic materials.","output":"Anisotropic Ice Adhesion of Micro-Nano-Structured Metal Surface by a Femtosecond Laser."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stable label movement and smooth label trajectory are critical for effective information understanding. Sudden label changes cannot be avoided by whatever forced directed methods due to the unreliability of resultant force or global optimization methods due to the complex trade-off on the different aspects. To solve this problem, we proposed a hybrid optimization method by taking advantages of the merits of both approaches. We first detect the spatial-temporal intersection regions from whole trajectories of the features, and initialize the layout by optimization in decreasing order by the number of the involved features. The label movements between the spatial-temporal intersection regions are determined by force directed methods. To cope with some features with high speed relative to neighbors, we introduced a force from future, called temporal force, so that the labels of related features can elude ahead of time and retain smooth movements. We also proposed a strategy by optimizing the label layout to predict the trajectories of features so that such global optimization method can be applied to streaming data.

Air exchange efficiency is a performance index able to characterize ventilation effectiveness in buildings. Some standards, such as ASHRAE 129, clearly define assessment procedures of air exchange efficiency for mechanical ventilation, adopting tracer gas techniques. However, standardized procedures are based on measurements at the exhaust and cannot be adopted for natural and mixed mode ventilation strategies. In the 80s, Sandberg suggested that tracer gas decay technique enables to measure simultaneously the nominal time constant (through air change rate measurements) and the mean age of air in several points of the ventilated zone. This paper aims to present practical issues and uncertainty analysis related to the implementation of this approach, in a new commissioning protocol. For this purpose, we compare the new procedure, based on Sandbergs observation, with the ASHRAE 129 protocol for mechanical ventilation. Results coming from field campaigns show that the difference between air exchange efficiency values obtained using ASHRAE 129 protocol (51.8 %) and the new procedure (47.4 %) are usually negligible in low airflow rate, considering an average uncertainty of 7.0 %.

Epidemiological data on the mental health statuses of frontline nurses are still limited. The aim of this study was to examine mental health (burnout, anxiety, depression, and fear) and their associated factors among frontline nurses who were caring for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China. Methods: A large-scale cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study design was used. A total of 2,014 eligible frontline nurses from two hospitals in Wuhan, China, participated in the study. Besides sociodemographic and background data, a set of valid and reliable instruments were used to measure outcomes of burnout, anxiety, depression, fear, skin lesion, self-efficacy, resilience, and social support via the online survey in February 2020. Findings: On average, the participants had a moderate level of burnout and a high level of fear. About half of the nurses reported moderate and high work burnout, as shown in emotional exhaustion (n = 1,218, 60.5%), depersonalization (n = 853, 42.3%), and personal accomplishment (n = 1,219, 60.6%). The findings showed that 288 (14.3%), 217 (10.7%), and 1,837 (91.2%) nurses reported moderate and high levels of anxiety, depression, and fear, respectively. The majority of the nurses (n = 1,910, 94.8%) had one or more skin lesions, and 1,950 (96.8%) nurses expressed their frontline work willingness. Mental health outcomes were statistically positively correlated with skin lesion and negatively correlated with self-efficacy, resilience, social support, and frontline work willingness. Interpretation: The frontline nurses experienced a variety of mental health challenges, especially burnout and fear, which warrant attention and support from policymakers. Future interventions at the national and organisational levels are needed to improve mental health during this pandemic by preventing and managing skin lesions, building self-efficacy and resilience, providing sufficient social support, and ensuring frontline work willingness.","output":"Frontline nurses' burnout, anxiety, depression, and fear statuses and their associated factors during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China: A large-scale cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased admissions with respiratory failure and there have been reports of oxygen failure and shortages of machines to deliver ventilation and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Domiciliary ventilators which entrain room air have been widely used during the pandemic Poor outcomes reported with non-invasive respiratory support using ventilators which lack an oxygen blender could be related to an unreliable Fraction of inspired O2 (FiO2) Additionally, with concerns about oxygen failure, the variety of ventilator circuits used as well as differing peak inspiratory flow rates (PIFR) could impact on the FiO2 delivered during therapy with domiciliary ventilators Methods: In a series of bench tests, we tested the effect of choice of circuit and different PIFR on the FiO2 achieved during simulation of ventilation and CPAP therapy using domiciliary ventilators Results: FiO2 was highly dependent upon the type of circuit used with circuits with an active exhalation valve achieving similar FiO2 at lower oxygen flow rates than circuits using an exhalation port During CPAP therapy, high PIFR resulted in significantly lower FiO2 than low PIFR Conclusions: This study has implications for oxygen usage as well as delivery of non-invasive respiratory support during therapy with domiciliary ventilators when these are used during the second wave of COVID-19","output":"The variation of FiO2 with circuit type and peak inspiratory flow rate during non-invasive respiratory support using domiciliary ventilators and its significance during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 poses an infectious risk to healthcare workers especially during airway management.

This study aims to use bibliometric analysis to estimate the global activity within this rapidly developing field and to identify particular areas of focus that are of current relevance to the MGBA during the last decade (2009C2018). METHODS: The current study uses the Scopus for data collection. We used the key terms microbiome-gut-brain axis and its synonyms because we are concerned with MGBA per se as a new concept in research rather than related topics. A VOSviewer version 1.6.11 was used to visualize collaboration pattern between countries and authors, and evolving research topics by analysis of the term co-occurrence in the title and abstract of publications. RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2018, there were 51,504 published documents related to the microbiome, including 1713 articles related to the MGBA: 829 (48.4%) original articles, 658(38.4%) reviews, and 226 (13.2%) other articles such as notes, editorials or letters. The USA took the first place with 385 appearances, followed by Ireland (n = 161), China (n = 155), and Canada (n = 144).The overall citation h-index was 106, and the countries with the highest h-index values were the USA (69), Ireland (58), and Canada (43). The cluster analysis demonstrated that the dominant fields of the MGBA include four clusters with four research directions: modeling MGBA in animal systems, interplay between the gut microbiota and the immune system, irritable bowel syndrome related to gut microbiota, and neurodegenerative diseases related to gut microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the research on the MGBA has been becoming progressively more extensive at global level over the past 10 years. Overall, our study found that a large amount of work on MGBA focused on immunomodulation, irritable bowel syndrome, and neurodevelopmental disorders.

After adjusting for age and sex, residents of long-term care homes were 2.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2-2.7) times more likely to test positive, and those who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 were 1.4-fold (95% CI 1.1-1.8) more likely to die than the rest of the population. INTERPRETATION Long-term care homes and shelters had disproportionate diagnosed cases per capita, and residents of long-term care homes diagnosed with COVID-19 had higher case fatality than the rest of the population. Heterogeneity across micro-epidemics among specific populations and settings may reflect underlying heterogeneity in transmission risks, necessitating setting-specific COVID-19 prevention and mitigation strategies.","output":"Heterogeneity in testing, diagnosis and outcome in SARS-CoV-2 infection across outbreak settings in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada: an observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, the disease associated in December 2019 with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, was observed for the first time in China and then spread worldwide becoming pandemic.

Therefore, we wished to explore: (i) the prevalence of advance care plans in a Swedish nursing home setting using two different definitions, (ii) the content of advance care plans, (iii) adherence to the content of care plans and (iv) possible associations between the presence of advance care planning and background characteristics, physician attendance and end-of-life care. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Twenty-two nursing homes in Sweden. SUBJECTS: A total of 367 deceased patients (included between 1 June 2018 and 23 May 2020) who had lived in nursing homes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Electronic health record data on the prevalence of advance care plans with two different definitions and variables regarding background characteristics, physician attendance and end-of-life care, were collected. RESULTS: Of the study population, 97% had a limited care plan (ACP I) documented. When using the comprehensive definition (ACP II), also including patients preferences and involvement of family members in advance care planning, the prevalence was 77%. Patients with dementia more often had care plans, and a higher physician attendance was associated with presence of advance care plans. Prescription of palliative drugs and information to family members of the patients deterioration and impending death were more common in patients with care plans compared to those where such plans were missing. There was adherence to the care plan content. CONCLUSION: In contrast to previous research, this study showed a high prevalence of advance care plans in nursing home patients. Patients with care plans more frequently received prescriptions of palliative drugs and their family members were informed to a greater extent about the patients deterioration and impending death compared to those without care plans. These aspects are often seen as vital components of good palliative care. KEY POINTS: Studies on advance care planning in nursing homes are rare, and despite their demonstrated positive effects on end-of-life care, advance care plans are often lacking. The present study revealed a high prevalence of advance care plans (77-97% depending on definition) in nursing home patients. Patients with dementia more often had advance care plans, and a higher physician attendance was associated with presence of care plans. Advance care plans were positively associated with components of good palliative care, such as prescriptions of palliative drugs and information to family.","output":"Prevalence, content and significance of advance care planning in nursing home patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, many classes, exams, and meetings have been conducted non-face-to-face. However, the foundation for video conferencing solutions is still insufficient. So this technology has become an important issue. In particular, these technologies are essential for non-face-to-face testing, and technology dissemination is urgent. In this paper, we present a single video conferencing solution using gaze estimation in preparation for these problems. Gaze is an important cue for the tasks such as analysis of human behavior. Hence, numerous studies have been proposed to solve gaze estimation using deep learning, which is one of the most prominent methods up to date. We use these gaze estimation methods to detect abnormal behavior of video conferencing participants. Our contribution is as follows. i) We find and apply the optimal network for the gaze estimation method and apply a self-supervised method to improve accuracy. ii) For anomaly detection, we present a new dataset that aggregates the values of a new gaze, head pose, etc. iii) We train newly created data on Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) models to detect anomaly behavior based on deep learning.

Egypt has launched a national treatment program to provide a cure for Egyptian patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). A common mechanism is shared between both the anticipated and unexpected aspects of COVID-19. The activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is intrinsically high in the lungs, which is a major source of ACE and hence a significant site of systemic synthesis of Ang II. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of the COVID-19 disease. ACE-2 and its angiotensin 1C7 (Ang 1C7) product, which acts on the Mas oncogene receptor, have been shown to play a protective role in fibrogenesis and inflammation of many organs, including the liver and lung. Antiviral treatment with interferon (IFN) in conjunction with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C reduces serum ACE activity and indirectly affects liver parenchyma fibrogenesis. The antifibrotic activity of sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir (SOF/DAC) is independent of its antiviral action. Elimination of HCV infection by DAA therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C could improve natural killer (NK) activity by increasing the frequency of CD 16+ CD 56+ NK cells. COVID-19 individuals exhibit enhanced platelet activation and aggregation, as well as platelet-monocyte aggregation, which is linked to coagulative disorders. Lower systemic inflammation and enhanced hepatic synthesis of both pro- and anti-coagulant factors were noticed soon after antiviral therapy. In order to protect against the severity of COVID-19, treatment of chronic hepatitis C has been observed as a possible key as a prophylaxis beside the vaccine and should be tested for evidence or rejection of observation.","output":"Does mass management of chronic hepatitis C protect the Egyptian population against fulminant coronavirus disease-2019?

We aimed to describe the spectrum, histology, management and outcomes of renal IrAE in patients with metastatic melanoma undergoing ICI therapy. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 23 patients with a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma treated with ICI between January 2017 and April 2019 who developed a renal IrAE. Baseline demographic data, biochemical and histopathological results, management and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The majority of patients who developed renal irAE were male and received combination immunotherapy. The median time of onset from initiation of ICI therapy to renal IrAE was 4 months. 52% of the treated renal IrAE had histopathologically confirmed renal IrAE. The most common histological pattern of injury was acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis (92%). One patient developed anti-GBM disease with non-dialysis dependent stage 5 CKD. In tubulointerstitial injury, there was no association between peak creatinine, renal recovery and histologically reported inflammation or fibrosis. Patients with renal IrAE demonstrated persisting renal dysfunction at 3, 6 and 12 months with a mean baseline, 3 and 12 month creatinine of 90.0 mol/L, 127.0 mol/L and 107.5 mol/L respectively. CONCLUSION: Renal IrAE is most commonly attributable to steroid responsive acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. The outcome of rarer pathologies such as anti-GBM disease may be adversely affected by a delayed diagnosis.

Here we analyzed the impact of these mutations on vaccination- and infection-induced Spike-specific T cells. We confirmed that, in the majority of infected or vaccinated individuals, different mutations present in a single VOC (Delta) or a combined mosaic of more than 30 AA substitutions and deletions found in Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron VOCs cause modest alteration in the global Spike-specific T cell response. However, distinct numerically dominant Spike-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells preferentially targeted regions affected by AA mutations and do not recognize the mutated peptides. Importantly, some of these mutations, such as N501Y (present in Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Omicron) and L452R (present in Delta), known to provide biological advantage to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of infectivity also abolished CD8 T cell recognition. Taken together, our data show that while global mRNA vaccine- and infection-induced Spike-specific T cells largely tolerate the diverse mutations present in VOCs, single Spike-specific T cells might contribute to the natural selection of SARS-CoV-2 variants.","output":"Mutations of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern escaping Spike-specific T cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study validated the general extended technology acceptance model for e-learning (GETAMEL) with the survey data from the English as a foreign language (EFL) online class during the novel coronavirus lockdown period.

Ferroptosis, a recently discovered type of cell death triggered by lipid peroxidation, is closely associated with HIBD. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a molecule associated with inflammation damage, can induce neuronal death in HIBD. However, it remains unknown whether HMGB1 contributes to neuronal ferroptosis in patients with HIBD. Herein, glycyrrhizin (GL), an HMGB1 inhibitor, was used to investigate the relationship between ferroptosis and HMGB1. RAS-selective lethal 3(RSL3), a ferroptosis agonist, was administered to further confirm the changes in the signaling pathway between HMGB1 and ferroptosis. Western blot analysis revealed that GL markedly suppressed the expression of HMGB1 and increased the level of GPX4 in the context of HIBD. We observed changes in neuronal ultrastructure via transmission electron microscopy to further confirm the occurrence of ferroptosis. Real-time PCR indicated that GL inhibited the expression of ferroptosis-related genes and inflammatory factors. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry staining confirmed GL inhibition of neuronal damage and ferroptosis in HIBD associated with GPX4 and ROS. GL not only inhibited ferroptosis induced by RSL3 and oxygen-glucose deprivation in vitro but also inhibited ferroptosis induced by HIBD in vivo. More importantly, GL may improve oxidative stress imbalance and mitochondrial damage, alleviate the downstream production of inflammatory factors, and ultimately reduce ferroptosis and damage to cortical neurons following HIBD via the HMGB1/GPX4 pathway. In conclusion, we showed for the first time that GL could suppress the occurrence of neuronal ferroptosis and reduce neuronal loss in HIBD via the HMGB1/GPX4 pathway. These findings highlight the potential of HMGB1 signaling antagonists to treat neuronal damage by suppressing ferroptosis, provide new and unique insights into GL as a neuroprotective agent, and suggest new prevention and treatment strategies for HIBD.","output":"Glycyrrhizin Attenuates Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Damage by Inhibiting Ferroptosis and Neuroinflammation in Neonatal Rats via the HMGB1/GPX4 Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During this covid-19 pandemic most of the countries have successfully conducted the parliamentary, state, and local elections. It was unfortunate that few candidates have been infected by the virus and lost their golden time in canvassing during their election campaign.

A PEDV outbreak was observed in March 2008 in a swine herd in Thailand. The disease was diagnosed by clinical symptoms, gross and histopathology and viral detection using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. The intestines of the infected piglets were collected, minced and fed to all of the gilts and sows within 2 weeks after the onset of the PEDV outbreak. Reproductive data were collected during a period from January 2007 to July 2008 and were retrospectively evaluated. The farrowing rate (FR), return rate (RR), abortion rate (AR), number of total piglets born per litter (TB), number of piglets born alive per litter (BA), percentage of stillbirth piglets per litter (SB), percentage of mummified fetus per litter (MM) and piglet's birth weight (BW), before and after the PEDV outbreak were compared. It was found that the impact of PEDV infection on the reproductive performance of gilts and sows depended on the period of pregnancy when the females were exposed to the pathogen, and parity number. The pregnant females infected with PEDV during the first 30 days of pregnancy had a 12.6 percentage point decrease of FR (91.1% vs. 78.5%, P=0.003), a 5.7 percentage point increase of RR (3.5% vs. 9.2%, P=0.01), a 1.3 percentage point increase of AR (2.1% vs. 3.4%, P=0.01) and a 2.0 percentage point increase of MM (3.5% vs. 5.6%, P<0.001). SB increased in the pregnant females that were infected with PEDV during 91-120 days of pregnancy (1.8 percentage points, 4.5% vs. 6.2%, P=0.01). The impacts of PEDV infection on subsequent reproductive performance were more severe in the pregnant gilts than the pregnant sows. PEDV infection during the first 30 days of pregnancy resulted in a decrease of TB by 1.4 (11.7 vs. 10.3 piglets/litter, P<0.001) and a decrease of BA by 2.2 (10.7 vs. 8.5 piglets/litter, P<0.001) in the gilts' litters, while the influence of PEDV infection on TB and BA was not significant in sows (P>0.05).

Methods: A Critical Care Task Force was established between Kansas City area intensive care units to allow for preparedness for potential surges by sharing of bed capacity both in the ICU and hospital, and ventilator capacity as well as weekly web-based meetings to share resource concerns and best practice. This Task Force also collected patient information to understand the dynamics of community impact and resource needs better. This effort allowed for compilation and dissemination of information regarding data that describe characteristics of patients with COVID-19 compared to a random sample of medical ICU patients with conditions other than COVID-19.Demographic and therapeutic factors affecting patients admitted to medical intensive care units in the Kansas City metro area are reported from May 5, 2020 until June 2, 2020 using a retrospective case-control study examining gender, race, and therapeutic options including modes of ventilation, vasopressor requirements, renal-replacement therapy, and disposition. Results: During data collection, patients being treated for COVID-19 in intensive care units in the Kansas City metropolitan area were more likely to be older, less likely to be white, and less likely to be immunosuppressed as compared to those being treated for non-COVID illnesses. They were more likely to require non-invasive ventilation and undergo prone positioning but were equally likely to require invasive ventilation and other organ supportive therapy.

The pandemic has caused great harm to society and caused serious psychological trauma to many people. Children are a vulnerable group in this global public health emergency, as their nervous systems, endocrine systems, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes are not well developed. Psychological crises often cause children to produce feelings of abandonment, despair, incapacity, and exhaustion, and even raise the risk of suicide. Children with mental illnesses are especially vulnerable during the quarantine and social distancing period. The inclusion of psychosocial support for children and their families are part of the health responses to disaster and disaster recovery. Based on the biopsychosocial model, some children may have catastrophic thoughts and be prone to experience despair, numbness, flashbacks, and other serious emotional and behavioral reactions. In severe cases, there may be symptoms of psychosis or posttraumatic stress disorder. Timely and appropriate protections are needed to prevent the occurrence of psychological and behavioral problems. The emerging digital applications and health services such as telehealth, social media, mobile health, and remote interactive online education are able to bridge the social distance and support mental and behavioral health for children. Based on the psychological development characteristics of children, this study also illustrates interventions on the psychological impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though the world has been struggling to curb the influences of the pandemic, the quarantine and social distancing policies will have long-term impacts on children. Innovative digital solutions and informatics tools are needed more than ever to mitigate the negative consequences on children. Health care delivery and services should envision and implement innovative paradigms to meet broad well-being needs and child health as the quarantine and social distancing over a longer term becomes a new reality. Future research on children's mental and behavioral health should pay more attention to novel solutions that incorporate cutting edge interactive technologies and digital approaches, leveraging considerable advances in pervasive and ubiquitous computing, human-computer interaction, and health informatics among many others. Digital approaches, health technologies, and informatics are supposed to be designed and implemented to support public health surveillance and critical responses to childrens growth and development. For instance, human-computer interactions, augmented reality, and virtual reality could be incorporated to remote psychological supporting service for childrens health; mobile technologies could be used to monitor childrens mental and behavioral health while protecting their individual privacy; big data and artificial intelligence could be used to support decision making on whether children should go out for physical activities and whether schools should be reopened.

Through this process, mucosal immunity plays an essential role in preventing infection and clearing the virus. It also assists in the development of longer lasting local immunity against IBV, mainly in the respiratory tract but also in the oviduct and gastrointestinal mucosal linings. The head-associated lymphoid tissues, particularly the Harderian gland, have an important role in the synthesis of immunoglobulin A (IgA). Levels of this immunoglobulin in lachrymal fluid often reflect the degree of protection against IBV challenge. Beyond the head, the importance of mucosal immunity has predominantly been studied in the trachea. Though IgA has been the major focus of IBV mucosal immunity investigations, the role of mucosa-associated nonspecific, innate, and cellular immune responses may also be significant. Ciliary movements and nonspecific substances in the mucosa, such as mucins and peptides, assist in the entrapment and removal of living and nonliving antigens. Mucosa-associated innate immune responses determine cascades of downstream cellular and humoral immunity against IBV. Cellular immunity, particularly involving CD4+, CD8+, and other T-cell subsets, have been studied in mucosa-associated sites, especially the trachea. The strength of cellular immunity at mucosal sites has been associated with protection against IBV. Recently, the evaluation of mucosal immunity has shifted from traditional methods to quantitative assays of mRNA transcription of immune genes.

We previously identified double membrane vesicles (DMVs) in the cytoplasm of cells infected with Berne virus (BEV), the prototype member of the Torovirus genus (Nidovirales Order). Our previous analysis by transmission electron microscopy suggested that the DMVs form a reticulovesicular network (RVN) analogous those described for the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1). Here, we used serial sectioning and electron tomography to characterize the architecture of torovirus replication organelles, and to learn about their biogenesis and dynamics during the infection. The formation of a RVN in BEV infected cells was confirmed, where the outer membranes of the DMVs are interconnected with each other and with the ER. Paired or zippered ER membranes connected with the DMVs were also observed, and likely represent early structures that evolve to give rise to DMVs. Also, paired membranes forming small spherule-like invaginations were observed at late time post-infection. Although resembling in size, the tomographic analysis show that these structures are clearly different from the true spherules described previously for coronaviruses. Hence, BEV shows important similarities, but also some differences, in the architecture of the replication organelles with other nidoviruses.","output":"Architecture of torovirus replicative organelles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Professionnelles aux comptences multiples, les sages-femmes peinent pourtant  tre reconnues comme des acteurs de premier plan en prinatalit.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to address the risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 patients and the mortality of severe patients. METHODS: 289 hospitalized laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Electronic medical records, including patient demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory tests results, and radiological materials, were collected and analyzed. According to the severity and outcomes of the patients, they were divided into three groups: nonsurvived (n = 49), survived severe (n = 78), and nonsevere (n = 162) groups. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were compared among these groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality and visualize the patients on a low-dimensional space. Correlations between clinical, radiological, and laboratory parameters were investigated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to determine the risk factors associated with mortality in severe patients. Longitudinal changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and nonsurvived cases during hospital stay were also collected. RESULTS: Of the 289 patients, the median age was 57 years (range, 22-88) and 155 (53.4%) patients were male. As of the final follow-up date of this study, 240 (83.0%) patients were discharged from the hospital and 49 (17.0%) patients died. Elder age, underlying comorbidities, and increased laboratory variables, such as leukocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) on admission, were found in survived severe cases compared to nonsevere cases. According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, elder age, a higher number of affected lobes, elevated CRP levels on admission, increased prevalence of chest tightness/dyspnea, and smoking history were independent risk factors for death of severe patients. A trajectory in PCA was observed from \\"nonsevere\\" toward \\"nonsurvived\\" via \\"severe and survived\\" patients. Strong correlations between the age of patients, the affected lobe numbers, and laboratory variables were identified. Dynamic changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and nonsurvived cases during hospital stay showed that continuing increase of leukocytes and neutrophil count, sustained lymphopenia and eosinopenia, progressing decrease in platelet count, as well as high levels of NLR, CRP, PCT, AST, BUN, and serum creatinine were associated with in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: Survived severe and nonsurvived COVID-19 patients had distinct clinical and laboratory characteristics, which were separated by principle component analysis. Elder age, increased number of affected lobes, higher levels of serum CRP, chest tightness/dyspnea, and smoking history were risk factors for mortality of severe COVID-19 patients.

The viral communicability may be mediated by various body fluids, but insufficient information is available on the presence of the virus in human tears. Objectives: To investigate the rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in tears collected from patients with COVID-19 by means of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay and to assess the association of virus presence with concomitant clinical conditions. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study conducted between April 9 and May 5, 2020. The setting was intensive care units at Azienda Socio-Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST) Sette-Laghi Hospital, University of Insubria, in Varese, Lombardy, Italy. A conjunctival swab was performed in 91 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, which was clinically diagnosed by rRT-PCR assay on nasopharyngeal swabs and by radiological imaging. Conjunctival swabs from 17 additional healthy volunteer participants with no symptoms of COVID-19 were examined to evaluate the availability and applicability of the conjunctival swab test. Exposure: SARS-CoV-2 detection by means of rRT-PCR assay performed on the collected samples obtained by conjunctival swabs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Conjunctival swab and nasopharyngeal swab results are reported, as well as demographic and clinical data. Results: A total of 108 participants (mean [SD] age, 58.7 [14.2] years; 55 female and 53 male) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using rRT-PCR assay, including 91 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and 17 were healthy volunteers. SARS-CoV-2 was found on the ocular surface in 52 of 91 patients with COVID-19 (57.1%; 95% CI, 46.3%-67.5%), with a wide variability in the mean viral load from both eyes. Among a subset of 41 patients, concordance of 63.0% (95% CI, 41.0%-81.0%) was found between positive conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swab test results when performed within 2 days of each other. In 17 of these patients, nasopharyngeal swab results were negative for SARS-CoV-2. In 10 of these 17 patients, conjunctival swab results were positive for the virus. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found on the ocular surface in a large part of this cohort of patients with COVID-19, although the infectivity of this material could not be determined. Because patients may have positive test results with a conjunctival swab and negative results with a nasopharyngeal swab, use of the slightly invasive conjunctival swab may be considered as a supplementary diagnostic test.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 on Ocular Surfaces in a Cohort of Patients With COVID-19 From the Lombardy Region, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The general objective of the study was to estimate the depth and persistence of the I-shock COVID-19 pandemic on formal employment dynamics in Nuevo Leon, segmenting employment by labor skills and gender.

METHODS: This prospective study enrolled children aged 2-59 months admitted to the Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital with World Health Organization (WHO)-defined clinical pneumonia. Demographic and clinico-radiological data were collected through questionnaires, physical examination, and chest radiography. Blood samples and nasopharyngeal washing were collected for microbiological analysis including culture and molecular methods. RESULTS: From July 2017 to June 2018, 189 children were enrolled, of which 53.4% were infants. Pneumonia-related admissions were less frequent over the winter. Chest radiographies were obtained in 149 children; endpoints included pneumonia in 39 cases (26.2%), other infiltrates in 31 (20.8%), and were normal in 79 children (53.0%). Non-contaminated bacterial growth was detected in 8/152 (5.3%) blood cultures, with only two cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae.

The Arabian Peninsula is considered a major global epicentre for the disease and the virus has crossed regional and continental boundaries since 2012. In this study, we focused on exploring the temporal dynamics of MERS-CoV in human populations in the Arabian Peninsula between 2012 and 2017, using publicly available data on case counts and combining two analytical methods. Disease progression was assessed by quantifying the time-dependent reproductive number (TD-Rs), while case series temporal pattern was modelled using the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). We accounted for geographical variability between three major affected regions in Saudi Arabia including Eastern Province, Riyadh and Makkah. In Saudi Arabia, the epidemic size was large with TD-Rs >1, indicating significant spread until 2017. In both Makkah and Riyadh regions, the epidemic progression reached its peak in April 2014 (TD-Rs > 7), during the highest incidence period of MERS-CoV cases. In Eastern Province, one unique super-spreading event (TD-R > 10) was identified in May 2013, which comprised of the most notable cases of human-to-human transmission. Best-fitting ARIMA model inferred statistically significant biannual seasonality in Riyadh region, a region characterised by heavy seasonal camel-related activities. However, no statistical evidence of seasonality was identified in Eastern Province and Makkah. Instead, both areas were marked by an endemic pattern of cases with sporadic outbreaks. Our study suggested new insights into the epidemiology of the virus, including inferences about epidemic progression and evidence for seasonality.

It will be part of a general e-learning concept that will be implemented in partner universities. Part 2 is addressed through an integrated teaching concept that includes interactive learning tools (for both teachers and students) and practical exercises (for example project weeks, summer schools) where the theoretical and virtual education is connected to practical experience with real instrumentation and data. One outcome of the experimental work is additional e-learning material based on the experiences and results of the project work.The prototype implementation of the virtual laser scanner is realized within a game engine, which allows for fast and easy 3D visualisation and navigation. Within this environment, the user can freely navigate and define suitable scanning positions/stations. At each scanning station a simulated scan is performed, which is based on the technical specifications of a real scanner. The mathematical solution is based on 3D line intersection with the virtual 3D surface including noise and colour as well as an intensity simulation. As a result, 3D point clouds for each station are generated, which will be further processed for registration and modelling using standard software packages.","output":"Virtual Terrestrial Laser Scanner Simulator for Digitalisation of Teaching Environment: Concept and First Results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND A growing number of older adults experience mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia.

Current models used to estimate the CT value are based on approximations that do not adequately account for the stochastic variations of the fluorescence signal that is detected during RT-PCR. Less common deviations become more apparent as the sample size increases, as is the case in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this work, we employ a method independent of CT value to interpret RT-PCR data. In this novel approach, we built and trained a deep learning model, qPCRdeepNet, to analyze the fluorescent readings obtained during RT-PCR. We describe how this model can be deployed as a quality assurance tool to monitor result interpretation in real time. The model's performance with the TaqPath COVID19 Combo Kit assay, widely used for SARS-CoV-2 detection, is described.

PURPOSE: The case of a transgender female who developed gallstone pancreatitis in the context of estrogen use for gender-affirming hormone therapy is reported. SUMMARY: A 24-year-old Caucasian transgender female presented to the emergency department for abdominal pain and vomiting after referral from urgent care for suspected pancreatitis. Her home medications included estradiol, medroxyprogesterone, and spironolactone for gender-affirming hormone therapy and omeprazole for reflux. The patient reported minimal alcohol intake, presented with mildly elevated triglyceride levels, and did not have a family history of pancreatitis or gallstone disease. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on hospital day 4 and was given a postoperative diagnosis of chronic cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, and pancreatitis. Given her history and the present illness, the use of estrogen therapy is a likely risk factor for the development of gallstone pancreatitis. CONCLUSION: Estrogen is a cornerstone of gender-affirming hormone therapy used by transgender women; however, in addition to its role in gender identity confirmation, estrogen can result in drug-induced pancreatitis.","output":"Estrogen-induced gallstone pancreatitis in a transgender female"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Created by volunteers since 2004, OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a global geographic database available under an open access license and currently used by a multitude of actors worldwide.

Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has re-emphasised the need to avoid vitamin D deficiency to help maintain immune function(2) and the urgent need for food-based strategies to help address this(3). The aims of the current study were to 1) determine any changes to vitamin D intake and status over a 9-year period, and 2) apply dietary modelling to predict the impact of vitamin D bio-enrichment of pork and pork products on population intakes in the UK. Data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) Rolling Programme Year 1-9 (2008/09-2016/17) were analysed using SPSS to determine nationally representative mean vitamin D intakes and 25(OH)D concentrations [a robust biomarker of vitamin D status]. Subgroup analysis investigating variance in sex, age and season was conducted. Informed by previous studies(4), four theoretical dietary modelling scenarios of vitamin D pork bio-enrichment were analysed (vitamin D content + 50/100/150/200% vs standard). Vitamin D intake in the UK population has not changed significantly from 2008 to 2017 yet, over the same period significant gender difference (M 2.66  1.99g/d and F 2.30  1.66g/d, p &lt; 0.05) and seasonal variation in the mean 25(OH)D concentrations were evident. In 2016/17, across all age groups, 13.2% were considered insufficient (25(OH)D &lt;25nmol/L). Across the whole group, theoretical modelling demonstrated an increase of 4.9, 10.1, 15.0 and 19.8% in daily vitamin D intake when vitamin D concentrations in bio-enriched pork were elevated by 50, 100, 150 and 200%, respectively. Based on the 200% modelling scenario, a greater relative change was observed in males (22.6%) compared to females (17.8%), and although older adults (65+ years) had significantly greater vitamin D intakes compared to other age categories (3.28  2.27g/day), this age group observed the smallest relative increase from the dietary modelling scenarios (14.3%). The greatest relative change was observed amongst 11-18-year olds, where 200% vitamin D bio- enrichment of pork and pork products would result in a 25.2% increase in mean daily vitamin D intakes.

Studies that have attempted to improve patient hand hygiene practice lack sustainability due to dependability on healthcare staff, and no prior studies have tested ways to improve independent patient hand hygiene practice. One such approach is using a patient-centered multi-modal educational intervention and electronic voice-recorded reminder cue to promote self- management of hand hygiene. METHODS: This comparative effectiveness study tested two educationally-based approaches to improve patient hand hygiene in older adults hospitalized for 4 days for elective lower extremity orthopedic or podiatry surgery at a veterans hospital. Group 1 (n = 41) received an educational video, an educational handout and a voice-recorded electronic audio reminder (EAR) an active cue, which verbally reminded the participant to clean their hands 3 times a day (7am, 12 pm, 5pm). Group 2 (n = 34) received the educational video and handout without the EAR. There were no significant differences between the two randomly assigned groups in terms of age, ethnicity and sex. RESULTS: Figure 1 shows the daily difference in product consumption Day 0 to Day 3. The average product consumption of ABHR (alcohol-based hand rub) in Group 1 (EAR) was 29.97 grams (SD 17.13). Group 2 (No EAR) averaged 10.88 grams (9.27) (P < 0.0001). Comparing post-operative day (POD) 0 to POD 3, and controlling for covariates (Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand [QuickDASH], Hand Grip Strength, Surgical Pain, MRSA in Nares, and Education), multivariate analyses indicated that the electronic audio reminder was a significant predictor (=.468) of ABHR consumption, R(2) = .39, R(2)adj. = .34, F (6, 68) = 7.265, P < .001. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a short educational intervention that included a video, a handout, and a verbal audio reminder has the potential to increase patient-centered infection prevention in the acute care settings without increasing the workload of healthcare workers.

Therefore, LAB could be used for heterologous protein secretion and they are good potential candidates as antigen delivery vehicles. To develop such live vaccines, a better control of protein secretion is required. We developed an efficient secretion system in the model LAB, Lactococcus lactis. Staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc) was used as the reporter protein. We first observed that the quantity of secreted Nuc correlated with the copy number of the cloning vector. The nuc gene was cloned on a high-copy number cloning vector and no perturbation of the metabolism of the secreting strain was observed. Replacement of nuc native promoter by a strong lactococcal one led to a significant increase of nuc expression. Secretion efficiency (SE) of Nuc in L. lactis was low, i.e., only 60% of the synthesized Nuc was secreted. Insertion of a synthetic propeptide between the signal peptide and the mature moiety of Nuc increased the SE of Nuc. On the basis of these results, we developed a secretion system and we applied it to the construction of an L. lactis strain which secretes a bovine coronavirus (BCV) epitopeprotein fusion (BCV-Nuc). BCV-Nuc was recognized by both anti-BCV and anti-Nuc antibodies.

OBJECTIVE Because cervical dural tears are rare, most surgeons have limited experience with this complication. A multicenter study was performed to better understand the presentation, treatment, and outcomes following cervical dural tears. METHODS Multiple surgeons from 23 institutions retrospectively identified 21 rare complications that occurred between 2005 and 2011, including unintentional cervical dural tears. Demographic data and surgical history were obtained. Clinical outcomes following surgery were assessed, and any reoperations were recorded. Neck Disability Index (NDI), modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA), Nurick classification (NuC), and Short-Form 36 (SF36) scores were recorded at baseline and final follow-up at certain centers. All data were collected, collated, and analyzed by a private research organization. RESULTS There were 109 cases of cervical dural tears among 18 463 surgeries performed. In 101 cases (93%) there was no clinical sequelae following successful dural tear repair. There were statistical improvements (P < .05) in mJOA and NuC scores, but not NDI or SF36 scores. No specific baseline or operative factors were found to be associated with the occurrence of dural tears. In most cases, no further postoperative treatments of the dural tear were required, while there were 13 patients (12%) that required subsequent treatment of cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Analysis of those requiring further treatments did not identify an optimum treatment strategy for cervical dural tears.

AIM: The objective of this study was to determine how perceived and experienced sexual satisfaction changed with the advent of COVID-19 among heterosexual married individuals in Kenya. METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional survey. Data was collected virtually using monkey survey from social groups. A total of 194 participants responded to the survey. OUTCOMES: The difference in overall sexual satisfaction as well as satisfaction with sex frequency; sex process; and time, place and ambience around sexual intercourse before and during COVID-19. RESULTS: Most of the participants (73.4%) reported that they were satisfied with their marital sex before COVID-19 but the proportion of those reporting satisfaction dropped to 58.4% when they were asked about their experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among participants surveyed during the pandemic itself, therefore, 41.3% reported that they were currently sexually dissatisfied whereas just 26.6% reported that they were dissatisfied even prior to the pandemic. There was a significant difference in the overall distributions before and during COVID-19 (&#967;2 = 38.86, P< .001). CLINICAL TRANSLATION: COVID-19 pandemic should be considered an etiology of sexual dissatisfaction and possibly sexual dysfunctions and COVID-19 control measures should incorporate ways of enhancing sexual well-being. CONCLUSION: There was perceived increase in dissatisfaction with sex which could be a pointer to the falling quality of life during COVID-19 pandemic especially among the most sexually active men aged 31-50 years living in places where COVID-19 control measures are being stringently implemented.

We performed virtual screening of FDA-approved compounds, including antiviral, anti-malarial, anti-parasitic, anti-fungal, anti-tuberculosis, and active phytochemicals against the Nsp9 replicase and spike proteins. Selected hit compounds were identified based on their highest binding energy and favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) profile. Conivaptan, an arginine vasopressin antagonist drug exhibited the highest binding energy (-8.4 Kcal/mol) and maximum stability with the amino acid residues present at the active site of the Nsp9 replicase. Tegobuvir, a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus, also exhibited maximum stability along with the highest binding energy (-8.1 Kcal/mol) at the active site of the spike proteins. Molecular docking scores were further validated by molecular dynamics using Schrodinger, which supported the strong stability of ligands with the proteins at their active sites through water bridges, hydrophobic interactions, and H-bonding.

Most dogs with CNS inflammation are diagnosed with presumptive autoimmune disease. A smaller number are diagnosed with an infectious etiology. Additionally, at necropsy, a subset of dogs with CNS inflammation do not fit previously described patterns of autoimmune disease and an infectious cause is not readily identifiable. Because viral infection is a common cause of meningoencephalitis in people, we hypothesize that a subset of dogs presented with CNS inflammation have an occult viral infection either as a direct cause of CNS inflammation or a trigger for autoimmunity. The goal of this research was to screen cerebrospinal fluid from a large number dogs with CNS inflammation for occult viral infection. One hundred seventy-two dogs with neurological dysfunction and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis were identified. Of these, 42 had meningoencephalitis of unknown origin, six had steroid-responsive meningitis-arteritis, one had eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, five had documented infection, 21 had and undetermined diagnosis, and 97 had a diagnosis not consistent with primary inflammatory disease of the CNS (e.g., neoplasia). CSF samples were subsequently screened with broadly reactive PCR for eight viral groups: adenovirus, bunyavirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, flavivirus, herpesvirus, paramyxovirus, and parechovirus. No viral nucleic acids were detected from 168 cases screened for eight viral groups, which does not support occult viral infection as a cause of CNS inflammation in dogs. La Crosse virus (LACV) nucleic acids were detected from four cases in Georgia. Subclinical infection was supported in two of these cases but LACV could not be ruled-out as a cause of infection in the other two cases, suggesting further research is warranted to determine if LACV is an occult cause of CNS inflammation in dogs.","output":"Screening for Viral Nucleic Acids in the Cerebrospinal Fluid of Dogs With Central Nervous System Inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been intensifying in the past year, posing a huge threat to global health.

Drug repurposing is a feasible strategy in the current situation, which could greatly shorten drug development time and help to response quickly to the novel virus outbreak. It has been reported that histamine H(1) receptor antagonists have broad-spectrum antiviral effects. Therefore, in this study, we aim to screen potential drugs among histamine H(1) receptor antagonists that may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the model of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) overexpressing HEK293T cell membrane chromatography (CMC), five FDA-approved histamine H(1) receptor antagonists were found to have bioaffinity to ACE2. Then we determined the interaction between these drugs and ACE2 by frontal analysis and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which consistently demonstrated that these hits bind to ACE2 at micromolar levels of affinity. Through the pseudovirus assay, we finally identified that doxepin could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus from entering the ACE2-expressing cell, reducing the infection rate to 25.82%.

Metabolite and transcriptomic analyses of the stem, leaf, xylem, and epidermis of S. tetrandra were performed to identify candidate genes associated with BIAs biosynthesis. According to the metabolite analysis, the majority of the BIAs accumulated in the root, especially in the epidermis. Transcriptome sequencing revealed a total of 113,338 unigenes that were generated by de novo assembly. Among them, 79,638 unigenes were successfully annotated, and 42 candidate structural genes associated with 15 steps of BIA biosynthesis identified. Additionally, a new (S)-norcoclaurine-6-O-methyltransferase (6OMT) gene was identified in S. tetrandra, named St6OMT2.

A largely unexplored strategy to reduce mRNA hydrolysis is to redesign RNAs to form double-stranded regions, which are protected from in-line cleavage and enzymatic degradation, while coding for the same proteins. The amount of stabilization that this strategy can deliver and the most effective algorithmic approach to achieve stabilization remain poorly understood. Here, we present simple calculations for estimating RNA stability against hydrolysis, and a model that links the average unpaired probability of an mRNA, or AUP, to its overall hydrolysis rate. To characterize the stabilization achievable through structure design, we compare AUP optimization by conventional mRNA design methods to results from more computationally sophisticated algorithms and crowdsourcing through the OpenVaccine challenge on the Eterna platform. We find that rational design on Eterna and the more sophisticated algorithms lead to constructs with low AUP, which we term superfolder mRNAs. These designs exhibit a wide diversity of sequence and structure features that may be desirable for translation, biophysical size, and immunogenicity. Furthermore, their folding is robust to temperature, computer modeling method, choice of flanking untranslated regions, and changes in target protein sequence, as illustrated by rapid redesign of superfolder mRNAs for B.1.351, P.1 and B.1.1.7 variants of the prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

Collectively, these effects contribute to enzyme catalysis. Here we describe how crowding may bias the conformational change and dynamics of enzyme populations and in this way affect catalysis. Crowding effects have been studied using artificial crowding agents and in vivo-like environments. These studies revealed a correlation between protein dynamics and function in the crowded environment. We suggest that crowded environments be classified into uniform crowding and structured crowding. Uniform crowding represents random crowding conditions created by synthetic particles with a narrow size distribution. Structured crowding refers to the highly coordinated cellular environment, where proteins and other macromolecules are clustered and organized. In structured crowded environments the perturbation of protein thermal stability may be lower; however, it may still be able to modulate functions effectively and dynamically. Dynamic, allosteric enzymes could be more sensitive to cellular perturbations if their free energy landscape is flatter around the native state; on the other hand, if their free energy landscape is rougher, with high kinetic barriers separating deep minima, they could be more robust. Above all, cells are structured; and this holds both for the cytosol and for the membrane environment. The crowded environment is organized, which limits the search, and the crowders are not necessarily inert. More likely, they too transmit allosteric effects, and as such play important functional roles. Overall, structured cellular crowding may lead to higher enzyme efficiency and specificity.","output":"Structured Crowding and Its Effects on Enzyme Catalysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We are among the many that believe that artificial intelligence will not replace practitioners and is most valuable as an adjunct in diagnostic radiology.

Modifications included federal exemptions to facilitate OAT prescription re-fills, extensions, and deliveries and interim treatment guidance emphasizing take-home (non-observed) doses and reduced urine drug screening for OAT patients. METHODS: We conducted an interrupted time series study using health administrative data from September 17(th), 2019CSeptember 21(st), 2020, on 359 people who inject drugs with suspected opioid use disorder in Toronto, Ontario. We used segmented regression analyses to evaluate the joint effects of the provincial COVID-19 emergency declaration, federal OAT exemptions, and interim treatment guidanceall implemented between March 17(th)C23(rd), 2020on the weekly proportion of participants enrolled in OAT (i.e., 1 day(s) covered with methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone), with an opioid-related overdose (based on emergency department visits and hospitalizations), and who died (all-cause), and the weekly proportion of OAT-enrolled participants receiving take-home doses (i.e., 1 day(s) covered) and undergoing urine drug screening. RESULTS: Post-implementation, the interventions were associated with immediate absolute changes in OAT enrollment (+1.95%; 95% CI=0.04%C3.85%), receipt of take-home doses (+18.3%; 95% CI=13.2%C23.4%), and urine drug screening (-22.4%; 95% CI=[-26.9%]C[-17.9%]) and a gradual absolute increase of 0.56% in urine drug screening week-to-week (95% CI=0.27%C0.86%) beyond the pre-implementation trend. At 26 weeks post-implementation, OAT enrollment and urine drug screening approached pre-implementation levels whereas the increase in take-home doses was largely sustained (+15.0%; 95% CI=4.33%C25.6%). No post-implementation increases in opioid-related overdoses were observed. Death was not modelled (low event frequency). CONCLUSION: Changes to OAT provision following provincial COVID-19 restrictions were associated with an immediate and sustained increase in take-home dose coverage among OAT-enrolled participants, without corresponding increases in opioid-related overdoses among all participants.","output":"Evaluating interventions to facilitate opioid agonist treatment access among people who inject drugs in Toronto, Ontario during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper introduces the Dendrite Spherical Neuron (DSN) as an alternative to the Dendrite Ellipsoidal Neuron (DEN), in which hyperspheres group the patterns from different classes instead of hyperellipses. The reasoning behind DSN is simplifying the computation of DEN architecture, where a centroid and covariance matrix are two dendritic parameters, whereas, in DSN, the covariance matrix is replaced by a radius. This modification is useful to avoid singular covariance matrices since DEN requires measuring the Mahalanobis distance to classify patterns. The DSN training consists of determining the centroids of dendrites with the k-means algorithm, followed by calculating the radius of dendrites as the mean distance to the two nearest centroids, and finally determining the weights of a softmax function, with Stochastic Gradient Descent, at the output of the neuron. Besides, the Simulated Annealing automatically determines the number of dendrites that maximizes the classification accuracy. The DSN is applied to synthetic and real-world datasets. The experimental results reveal that DSN is competitive with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) networks, with less complex architectures. Also, DSN tends to outperform the Dendrite Morphological Neuron (DMN), which uses hyperboxes. These findings suggest that the DSN is a potential alternative to MLP and DMN for pattern classification tasks.","output":"Towards Dendrite Spherical Neurons for Pattern Classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently a serious global health threat. While conventional laboratory tests such as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), serology tests, and chest computerized tomography (CT) scan allow diagnosis of COVID-19, these tests are time-consuming and laborious, and are limited in resource-limited settings or developing countries. Point-of-care (POC) biosensors such as chip-based and paper-based biosensors are typically rapid, portable, cost-effective, and user-friendly, which can be used for COVID-19 in remote settings. The escalating demand for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 presents a strong need for a timely and comprehensive review on the POC biosensors for COVID-19 that meet ASSURED criteria: Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and Robust, Equipment-free, and Deliverable to end users. In the present review, we discuss the importance of rapid and early diagnosis of COVID-19 and pathogenesis of COVID-19 along with the key diagnostic biomarkers. We critically review the most recent advances in POC biosensors which show great promise for the detection of COVID-19 based on three main categories: chip-based biosensors, paper-based biosensors, and other biosensors. We subsequently discuss the key benefits of these biosensors and their use for the detection of antigen, antibody, and viral nucleic acids. The commercial POC biosensors for COVID-19 are critically compared. Finally, we discuss the key challenges and future perspectives of developing emerging POC biosensors for COVID-19.

However, there has been considerable confusion and disagreement regarding the degree to which masks protect the wearer from airborne particles. Objectives: To evaluate the fitted filtration efficiency (FFE) of various consumer-grade and improvised face masks, as well as several popular modifications of medical procedure masks that are intended to improve mask fit or comfort. Design, Setting, and Participants: For this study conducted in a research laboratory between June and August 2020, 7 consumer-grade masks and 5 medical procedure mask modifications were fitted on an adult male volunteer, and FFE measurements were collected during a series of repeated movements of the torso, head, and facial muscles as outlined by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration Quantitative Fit Testing Protocol. The consumer-grade masks tested included (1) a 2-layer woven nylon mask with ear loops that was tested with an optional aluminum nose bridge and nonwoven filter insert in place, (2) a cotton bandana folded diagonally once (ie, \\"bandit\\" style) or in a (3) multilayer rectangle according to the instructions presented by the US Surgeon General, (4) a single-layer woven polyester/nylon mask with ties, (5) a nonwoven polypropylene mask with fixed ear loops, (6) a single-layer woven polyester gaiter/neck cover balaclava bandana, and (7) a 3-layer woven cotton mask with ear loops. Medical procedure mask modifications included (1) tying the mask's ear loops and tucking in the side pleats, (2) fastening ear loops behind the head with 3-dimensional-printed ear guards, (3) fastening ear loops behind the head with a claw-type hair clip, (4) enhancing the mask/face seal with rubber bands over the mask, and (5) enhancing the mask/face seal with a band of nylon hosiery over the fitted mask. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary study outcome was the measured FFE of common consumer-grade and improvised face masks, as well as several popular modifications of medical procedure masks. Results: The mean (SD) FFE of consumer grade masks tested on 1 adult male with no beard ranged from 79.0% (4.3%) to 26.5% (10.5%), with the 2-layer woven nylon mask having the highest FFE. Unmodified medical procedure masks with ear loops had a mean (SD) FFE of 38.5% (11.2%). All modifications evaluated in this study increased procedure mask FFE (range [SD], 60.3% [11.1%] to 80.2% [3.1%]), with a nylon hosiery sleeve placed over the procedure mask producing the greatest improvement. Conclusions and Relevance: While modifications to improve medical procedure mask fit can enhance the filtering capability and reduce inhalation of airborne particles, this study demonstrates that the FFEs of consumer-grade masks available to the public are, in many cases, nearly equivalent to or better than their non-N95 respirator medical mask counterparts.","output":"Evaluation of Cloth Masks and Modified Procedure Masks as Personal Protective Equipment for the Public During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This scoping review provides an overview of COVID-19 approaches to managing unanticipated school closures and available literature related to young people learning outside-of-school.

This has generated renewed interest regarding whether corticosteroids should be used in non-COVID ARDS as well. The objective of this study was to summarize all RCTs examining the use of corticosteroids in ARDS. METHODS: The protocol of this study was pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020200659). We searched online databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CDC library of COVID research, CINAHL, and COCHRANE. We included RCTs that compared the effect of corticosteroids to placebo or usual care in adult patients with ARDS, including patients with COVID-19. Three reviewers abstracted data independently and in duplicate using a pre-specified standardized form. We assessed individual study risk of bias using the revised Cochrane ROB-2 tool and rated certainty in outcomes using GRADE methodology. We pooled data using a random effects model. The main outcome for this review was 28-day-mortality. RESULTS: We included 18 RCTs enrolling 2826 patients. The use of corticosteroids probably reduced mortality in patients with ARDS of any etiology (2740 patients in 16 trials, RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72C0.95, ARR 8.0%, 95% CI 2.2C12.5%, moderate certainty). Patients who received a longer course of corticosteroids (over 7 days) had higher rates of survival compared to a shorter course. CONCLUSION: The use of corticosteroids probably reduces mortality in patients with ARDS. This effect was consistent between patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS, corticosteroid types, and dosage.

DNA methylation levels of RNAs are also associated with LUSC prognosis. This study aimed to construct a prognostic model with high performance in predicting LUSC prognosis using the methylation levels of lncRNAs and genes. METHODS: The differentially expressed RNAs (DERs) and differentially methylated RNAs (DMRs) between the recurrent and non-recurrent LUSC tissues in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; training dataset) were identified. Weighted correlation network analysis was performed to identify co-methylation networks. Differentially methylated genes and lncRNAs with opposite expression-methylation levels were used for the screening of prognosis-associated RNAs. The prognostic model was constructed and its performance was validated in the GSE39279 dataset. RESULTS: A total of 664 DERs and 981 DMRs (including 972 genes) in recurrent LUSC tissues were identified. Three co-methylation modules, including 226 differentially methylated genes, were significantly associated with LUSC. Among prognosis-associated RNAs, 18 DERs/DMRs with opposite methylation-expression levels were included in the methylation prognostic risk model. LUSC patients with high risk scores had a poor prognosis compared with patients who had low risk scores (TCGA: HR = 3.856, 95% CI [2.297C6.471]; GSE39279: HR = 3.040, 95% CI [1.435C6.437]).

The aim of this work was to study the composition and distribution of the film covering the surfaces of Mahurkar Maxid and Palindrome catheters, which were removed from the body of long-term hemodialysis patients. Moreover, the roughness and contact angle of the catheters were evaluated. METHODS Two brand new (as a reference) and thirty used catheters were the subject of the study. Their implantation period lasted from 4 months to a year and the reason for removal was the production of another vascular access or obstruction. Surfaces were analyzed by scanning electron microscope, atomic force microscope and goniometer. RESULTS The inner surfaces of the used catheters were covered with a film of various complexity which includes a plurality of protein, blood cell counts and the crystals. The closer to the distal part the film becomes more complex and multi-layered. Even the surfaces of brand new catheter were not completely smooth. The only significant difference between analyzed models was the presence of thrombus in the distal part of Mahurkar Maxid catheters, not in the Palindrome. CONCLUSIONS The distal part of the catheters is the place most exposed to obstruction and infection, which may be due to not reaching the anticoagulant agent into this part. Not only the occurrence of side holes affects the formation of thrombus, but also their quantity, geometry and distribution which effect on fluid mechanics.

The current supportive environments where organic foods are limited, and new processed foods have been brought to the market with more variant tastes and acceptability for the kids and adolescents that have diverged their eating patterns. It has significantly contributed to the health issues and growth discrepancies of the users. However, the awareness of the food contents is an important milestone for understanding the risks associated with the usage of junk foods. A quantitative approach has been used in this study to measure the effect of perceived severity, vulnerability and fear on the junk food eating behaviors and ultimately on the obesity. The moderating role of product knowledge hiding has also been measured on the relationship of junk food eating and obesity. Structural equation modeling is used using the software Smart-PLS for measuring the hypothesis with a sample size of 228 selected through purposive sampling. The sample consisted of kids and adolescents who were reached on purpose for data collection. The current study has explored the role of perceived severity, vulnerability and the fear of using junk foods which have been found as a negative effect on junk food eating behavior which is positively associated with obesity among the kids and adolescents. The result of study shows that perceived threat has a negative effect on the junk food eating behavior of the adolescents. However, the positive relationship of junk food eating behavior with obesity can be decreased if the information about the products is not hidden.

Research examining evidence-based treatments for psychological injuries resulting from operational duties (also known as operational stress injuries) has not yielded robust results that would indicate ongoing interventions as the best solution for managing PSP mental health injuries; as such, proactive psychological interventions designed to bolster resilience are being considered potentially beneficial for mitigating the impact of occupational stress on PSP. Despite the growing popularity of resilience programs, most are delivered in a single session after an event deemed particularly problematic with no follow-up. Longer interventions may better support sustained resiliency, mitigate the impact of operational stress, and increase positive PSP workplace outcomes. The current article introduces the Before Operational Stress (BOS) program, which was designed for delivery early in a PSP career to enhance self-awareness and healthy relationships. The year-long program is derived from cognitive behavior therapy and group therapeutic techniques to meet program objectives. The current BOS program evaluation demonstrated small, statistically significant improvements in symptoms of PTSD, quality of life, stigma, and perceived social support from baseline (Time 1) to 6 months (Time 4). There were also non-significant improvements observed in symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, alcohol use, as well as in emotional regulation and resilience. Qualitative results indicated participants positively perceived the BOS program, with participants reporting specific improvements in self-awareness, avoidant behaviors, and relationships with family and colleagues. The BOS program content (e.g., functional disconnection and functional reconnection) and processes (e.g., psychoeducation within a supportive learning structure; mutually empowering group interactions) appear unique relative to other PSP resilience programs, with promising initial results in support of PSP mental health.

During this emergency period, the restricted human dealings with nature have appeared as blessing for health of the total environment. The variation of atmospheric O3 may modulate the range of UV index (UVI) at any region of the earth. The objective of the study is to examine the variation of UV index over the megacities of India with respect to tropospheric O3 level modification during COVID-19 lockdown. The meteorological or environmental data (temperature in C, gust in km/h, wind speed km/h, relative humidity in %, air pressure in mb and cloud cover in okta) of four selective megacities of India (Kolkata, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai) during and pre lockdown period have been obtained to comprehend about the variation of UV index and tropospheric O3. The descriptive statistical applications i.e. standard deviation, standard errors and K-means clustering have been done through standard statistical software. In the present study, t-test has been used to understand level of significance of surface O3 and UVI during pre-lockdown (2019) and lockdown (2020) phase. The result shows that the four major megacities in India namely New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai have experienced the vibrant diminution in terms of the concentration of UV index with slightly increasing the tropospheric O3 level during the lockdown phase. The higher accumulation of O3 during the lockdown in the lower atmosphere of four megacities does not exceed the permissible limit. The excess amount of O3 has remarkably contributed to trap the harmful UV radiation which has lowered the UVI in these worst polluted megacities of India. In the meantime, the prominent reduction of NOx during the lockdown period decreases the titration impact to O3 and this mechanism helps to revitalize the ozone concentration level. The uniqueness of the current study is highlighted the ground reality regarding reduction of UV index and amplification of tropospheric O3 concentration during lockdown phase.

Codon usage patterns of viruses reflect a series of evolutionary changes that enable viruses to shape their survival rates and fitness toward the external environment and, most importantly, their hosts. To understand the evolution of MARV at the codon level, we report a comprehensive analysis of synonymous codon usage patterns in MARV genomes. Multiple codon analysis approaches and statistical methods were performed to determine overall codon usage patterns, biases in codon usage, and influence of various factors, including mutation pressure, natural selection, and its two hosts, Homo sapiens and Rousettus aegyptiacus. RESULTS: Nucleotide composition and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis revealed that MARV shows mutation bias and prefers U- and A-ended codons to code amino acids. Effective number of codons analysis indicated that overall codon usage among MARV genomes is slightly biased. The Parity Rule 2 plot analysis showed that GC and AU nucleotides were not used proportionally which accounts for the presence of natural selection. Codon usage patterns of MARV were also found to be influenced by its hosts. This indicates that MARV have evolved codon usage patterns that are specific to both of its hosts. Moreover, selection pressure from R. aegyptiacus on the MARV RSCU patterns was found to be dominant compared with that from H. sapiens. Overall, mutation pressure was found to be the most important and dominant force that shapes codon usage patterns in MARV. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first detailed codon usage analysis of MARV and extends our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to codon usage and evolution of MARV.

Furthermore, cardiovascular comorbidities increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of a severe form of COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). CASE SUMMARY: We describe the case of a COVID-19 patient whose inaugural presentation was a refractory cardiac arrest secondary to the destabilization of known, non-significant coronary artery disease. Patient was supported by venoarterial extracorporeal life support. After 12 h of support, cardiac function remained stable on low vasopressor support but the patient remained in a coma and brainstem death was diagnosed. DISCUSSION: Myocardial injury is frequently seen among critically unwell COVID-19 patients and increases the risk of mortality. This case illustrates several potential mechanisms that are thought to drive the cardiac complications seen in COVID-19. We present the potential role of inflammation and ACE2 in the pathophysiology of COVID-19.","output":"Cardiac arrest and COVID-19: inflammation, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and the destabilization of non-significant coronary artery diseasea case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) post SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is characterized by thrombocytopenia and severe thrombosis. Platelet function during patient recovery in the medium-/long-term has not been investigated fully. Here, we undertook a 3-month study, assessing the recovery of a VITT patient and assessing platelet morphology, granule content and dense-granule release at two distinct time points during recovery. CASE PRESENTATION: A 61 year-old female was admitted to hospital 15 days post ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination. Hematological parameters and peripheral blood smears were monitored over 3 months. Platelet morphology and granule populations were assessed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at two distinct time points during recovery, as was agonist-induced platelet dense-granule release. Upon admission, the patient had reduced platelet counts, increased D-dimer and high anti-PF4 antibodies with multiple sites of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). Peripheral blood smears revealed the presence of large, hypergranular platelets. Following treatment, hematological parameters returned to normal ranges over the study period. Anti-PF4 antibodies remained persistently high up to 90 days post-admission. Two days after admission, VITT platelets contained more granules per-platelet when compared to day 72 and healthy platelets. Additionally, maximal ATP release (marker of dense-granule release) was increased on day 2 compared to day 72 and healthy control platelets. CONCLUSION: This study highlights a previously unreported observation of platelet hypergranularity in VITT which may contribute to the thrombotic risk associated with VITT. Optimal approaches to monitoring recovery from VITT over time remains to be determined but our findings may help inform therapeutic decisions relating to anticoagulation treatment in this novel pathology.","output":"Case Report: Hypergranular Platelets in Vaccine-Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia After ChAdOx1 nCov-19 Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 vaccine immunogenicity is variable in immunocompromised patients and sub-optimal when compared to the general population.

Herein, we have evaluated the association between HTN and cardiac injury in 388 COVID-19 (47.5  15.2 years) including 75 HTN and 313 normotension. Demographic data, cardiac injury markers, other laboratory findings, and comorbidity details were collected and analyzed. Compared to patients without HTN, hypertensive-COVID-19 patients were older, exhibited higher C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and comorbidities such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Further, these hypertensive-COVID-19 patients presented more severe disease with longer hospitalization time, and a concomitant higher rate of bilateral pneumonia, electrolyte disorder, hypoproteinemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In addition, cardiac injury markers such as creatine kinase (CK), myoglobin, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide were significantly increased in these patients. Correlation analysis revealed that systolic blood pressure correlated significantly with the levels of CK, and LDH. Further, HTN was associated with increased LDH and CK-MB in COVID- 19 after adjusting essential variables. We also noticed that patients with elevated either high sensitivity-CRP or CRP demonstrated a significant high level of LDH along with a moderate increase in CK (p = 0.07) and CK-MB (p = 0.09).

In addition, we discuss the complex regulation of its phospholipid cleaving activity by membrane lipids and lipid-binding proteins. The majority of the literature implies that ASM hydrolyses solely sphingomyelin to generate ceramide and ignores its ability to degrade further substrates. Indeed, more than twenty different phospholipids are cleaved by ASM in vitro, including some minor but functionally important phospholipids such as the growth factor ceramide-1-phosphate and the unique lysosomal lysolipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate. The inherited ASM deficiency, Niemann-Pick disease type A and B, impairs mainly, but not only, cellular sphingomyelin catabolism, causing a progressive sphingomyelin accumulation, which furthermore triggers a secondary accumulation of lipids (cholesterol, glucosylceramide, GM2) by inhibiting their turnover in late endosomes and lysosomes. However, ASM appears to be involved in a variety of major cellular functions with a regulatory significance for an increasing number of metabolic disorders.

Trauma cases were reduced by 40% in April 2020. Overall emergency theatre patient waiting time was 30% lower for April 2020 compared with 2019. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 and the associated lockdown has heavily impacted on both orthopaedic inpatient and outpatient services. Lockdown led to a larger reduction in the orthopaedic trauma burden than in international centres, but the overall reduction in surgeries, outpatient visits and hospital admissions was less. This lesser reduction was probably due to local factors, but also to a conscious decision to avoid total collapse of our surgical services.","output":"Drastic reduction of orthopaedic services at an urban tertiary hospital in South Africa during COVID-19: Lessons for the future response to the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had a catastrophic impact on Canada's long-term care system.

Infectious disease outbreaks increase psychological stress, and life events impact sleep quality. American Indians have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Investigate whether childhood trauma predicts changes in sleep quality following onset of the pandemic and test whether pandemic stress contributes to changes in sleep. METHODS: In a sample of 210 American Indian adults (Age M(SD) = 55.09(13.10), 59.5% female) demographics, childhood trauma and sleep quality were measured at Time 1. One month following the onset of the pandemic, psychological stress specific to the pandemic and sleep quality were measured. RESULTS: Using linear regression controlling for age, sex, income, and sleep quality at Time 1, childhood adversity predicted both psychological stress specific to the pandemic and changes in sleep quality from Time 1 to Time 2 ( = 0.33, t(205) = 4.88, P < .001, R(2) = 0.10) and ( = 0.24, t(204) = 3.48, P < .001, R(2) = 0.05), respectively.

DESIGN: A 58-item questionnaire elicited information on policies for 9 critical care interventions, factors that limited care provision, and innovations developed to deliver care. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The questionnaire was sent to 82 ETCs. METHODS: We analyzed ordinal and categorical data pertaining to the ETC characteristics and descriptive data about their policies and perceived challenges. Statistical analyses assessed whether ETCs with experience caring for VHF patients were more likely to have critical care policies than those that did not. RESULTS: Of the 27 ETCs who responded, 17 (63%) were included. Among them, 8 (47%) reported experience caring for persons under investigation or confirmed cases of VHF. Most felt ready to provide intubation, chest compressions, and renal replacement therapy to these patients. The factors most cited for limiting care were staff safety and clinical futility. Innovations developed to better provide care included increased simulation training and alternative technologies for procedures and communication. CONCLUSIONS: There were broad similarities in critical care policies and limitations among institutions.

Our objective is to define the key target populations, their size, and priority for a COVID-19 vaccination program in the context of China. METHODS: On the basis of utilitarian and egalitarian principles, we define and estimate the size of tiered target population groups for a phased introduction of COVID-19 vaccination, considering evolving goals as vaccine supplies increase, detailed information on the risk of illness and transmission, and past experience with vaccination during the 2009 influenza pandemic. Using publicly available data, we estimated the size of target population groups, and the number of days needed to vaccinate 70% of the target population. Sensitivity analyses considered higher vaccine coverages and scaled up vaccine delivery relative to the 2009 pandemic. RESULTS: Essential workers, including staff in the healthcare, law enforcement, security, nursing homes, social welfare institutes, community services, energy, food and transportation sectors, and overseas workers/students (49.7 million) could be prioritized for vaccination to maintain essential services in the early phase of a vaccination program. Subsequently, older adults, individuals with underlying health conditions and pregnant women (563.6 million) could be targeted for vaccination to reduce the number of individuals with severe COVID-19 outcomes, including hospitalizations, critical care admissions, and deaths. In later stages, the vaccination program could be further extended to target adults without underlying health conditions and children (784.8 million), in order to reduce symptomatic infections and/or to stop virus transmission. Given 10 million doses administered per day, and a two-dose vaccination schedule, it would take 1 week to vaccinate essential workers but likely up to 7 months to vaccinate 70% of the overall population. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework is general but could assist Chinese policy-makers in the design of a vaccination program. Additionally, this exercise could be generalized to inform other national and regional strategies for use of COVID-19 vaccines, especially in low- and middle-income countries.","output":"Who should be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination in China?

Objective: To study the prevalence, risk factors, and characteristics of the neurological complications associated with COVID-19 and their relationship with clinical outcomes. Methods: We conducted a prospective, single-center, observational, cohort study of consecutive hospitalized adults COVID-19 patients with and without neurological manifestation admitted between March 2020 until the end of December 2020. Data was collected prospectively using electronic medical records; Cases and controls were observed until they either get discharged from the hospital or died. The primary outcomes were death, survival, and survival with sequalae. Results: Among 497 patients with COVID-19, 118 patients (23.7%) had neurological complications, 94 patients (18.9%) had encephalopathy, and 16 patients (3.2%) had cerebrovascular accidents (CVA).

METHODS: Fourteen smell-related questions were created based on smells familiar to Koreans. Among them, questions with a &#954; value of 0.6 or higher were finally selected through a test-retest reliability analysis. The correlations between the scores of the olfactory questionnaire and those of olfactory function tests (Butanol Threshold Test [BTT] and Cross Cultural Smell Identification Test [CCSIT]) were analyzed. To evaluate the predictive ability of the questionnaire and elicit cutoff values, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated. RESULTS: Out of the 14 questions in the questionnaire, 11 (&#954; > 0.6) were selected for the olfactory questionnaire. We analyzed 2,273 subjects, and there was a significant correlation between the total score of the olfactory questionnaire and the BTT (r = 0.643, P < 0.001) or CCSIT (r = 0.615, P < 0.001) scores.

Current anatomy curriculum at Paul L. Foster School of Medicine consists of self-taught PowerPoint material, clinical vignette-centered team-based learning (dry lab), and prosection-based instruction (wet lab). This study examined the impact of video-based muscle model (VBMM) instruction using a student-designed forearm muscle model on anatomy quiz scores and student perceptions of its effectiveness with regards to learning outcomes. METHODS: Students divided into Group 1 (54 students) and Group 2 (53 students) were assessed prior to and following a 3.5-minute video on anterior forearm compartment musculature using the muscle model. Group 1 began by completing a pretest, then received VBMM instruction, and then completed a posttest prior to participating in the standard dry lab and 1 hour wet lab. Group 2 completed the wet lab, then received the pretest, VBMM instruction, and posttest prior to participating in the dry lab. Both groups took an identical five-question quiz covering locations and functions of various anterior forearm muscles each time. RESULTS: Mean scores were higher than no formal intervention with exposure to VBMM instruction alone (0.73 points, P = .01), wet lab alone (0.88 points, P = .002), and wet lab plus VBMM instruction (1.35 points, P= <.001). No significant difference in scores was found between instruction with VBMM versus wet lab alone (P = 1.00), or between either instruction method alone compared to a combination of the two methods (P = .34, .09). Student survey opinions on the VBMM instruction method were positive. CONCLUSION: VBMM instruction is comparable to prosection-based lab with regards to score outcomes and was well received by students as both an independent learning tool and as a supplement to cadaveric lab. When compared to either instruction method alone, the supplementation of VBMM with cadaveric prosection instruction was best.

It may present as de novo or, more frequently, as a result of acute decompensation of chronic heart failure (ADHF). Apart from the economic burden on patient and health care system, each AHF related hospitalization is associated with significant increases in 12-month rehospitalization and mortality rate (44% and 17% in ESC-HF pilot study; 30.2 and 30.8% in Trivandrum Heart Failure Registry) Maggioni et al. (2013), Harikrishnan et al. (2017) [1,2]. As of July 15th, India has about 936,181 cases and nearly 24,309 death attributed to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) infection (Solomon et al., n.d. [3]). Unprecedented apprehension due to the rapid spread of COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in hospital avoiding behavior among patients suffering other diseases, including HF. Also, spread of COVID-19 pandemic attracted the major allocation of healthcare infrastructure and human resources, including emergency services, for the care of COVID-19 infected patients, and little is known about the effect of this stressed-out healthcare system on short and long term outcome in patients suffering from HF. Although, the implementation of lockdown by the Government (from March 25, 2020) initially slowed the community spread of COVID-19, but inadvertently, suspension of public transport further affected the delivery of medical care for HF patients, as most of the patients in India still use public transport for their emergency department (ED) visits. In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients who were admitted for AHF (de novo and ADHF; left ventricular ejection fraction <40%) in two Medical college hospitals providing healthcare services in Jodhpur, western India. Both are regional tertiary care centres of local hub and spike networks for the management of various cardiovascular emergencies. Our EDs have a separate registration desks for patients coming with non-Covid-19 emergencies and COVID-19 symptoms, with clear signs at the entrance directing patients to the designated registration desk. Also, ED was expanded to avoid overcrowding and separate waiting area was created for those who have COVID-19 signs and symptoms. We analysed demographic, clinical, echocardiographic and outcome parameters in patients admitted for AHF during the study period of 16 weeks (March 25 to July 14, 2020; starting from the day when lockdown was imposed by Government of India) and compared this data with a control period of 16 weeks (Dec 05, 2019 to March 24, 2020; when there was no lockdown and number of COVID-19 attributed death 10). In addition, hospitalization rates during the study period were also compared with data from the same period in 2018C19. Patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were not included in study. Our analysis of patients admitted during the study (lockdown) period revealed 69% reduction in AHF hospitalizations as compared to the control period (241 vs 782) and 60% reduction compared to same calendar period from the previous year (144 vs 602; Figure 1). It was contrary to an expected increase due to the availability issue of guideline-directed medical therapy in follow-up patients and an anticipated surge in AHF due to late presentation of patients with acute myocardial infarction associated mechanical complications. Among the patients from the lockdown period, 96.7% presented with NYHA IV symptoms, this was significantly higher than the rate during the control period (out of 782; 76.6% presented with NYHA IV symptoms during the control period; p value <0.001; Table 1). The mean age (SD) of patients in study and control period was 63.5(11.2) and 61.1(11.9) respectively, with no significant difference. Compared with control group, study group patients were more commonly male (82.6 vs 71.6%; p value <0.02), more likely to have atrial fibrillation (23.7 vs 18.2%; p value <0.02), lower eGFR (64.6 vs 77.7%; p value <0.05), lower mean ejection fraction (24.2  5.6 vs 30.4  4.9%; p value <0.001) and higher NT pro BNP levels (mean value 7349.2 vs 5680.4 pg/ml; p value <0.001). Median length of stay during study and control period was 5 and 4 days respectively. We also observed significantly increased in-hospital mortality during the lockdown period as compared to the control period (8.3% vs 5.4%; p value <0.001). The number of patients presenting to ED with AHF in western India has reduced significantly, and yet, late presentations with advanced symptoms and low EF seem to have increased. Similar pattern of decreased admission for cardiovascular emergency was reported from California, where weekly rates of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction decreased by up to 48% during the Covid-19 period (Solomon et al., n.d. [3]). The current case fatality rate for COVID-19 in India is approximately 2.6% [4], which is far less than that of AHF and we presume that many untreated AHF patients must have died at home during COVID-19 pandemic. There have been reports of the inexplicable increase in out of hospital cardiac arrests, revealing that patients were staying too long at home to seek care for a more severe medical condition (Wong et al., 2020 [5]). Complete suspension of public transit system along with lack of emergency medical services in India, risk of acquiring COVID-19 at ED and misleading information in media and social platforms about flooding of hospital beds due to COVID-19, even when there were reserved wards for other emergencies, led to hospital avoiding behavior among patients suffering from even the most serious medical conditions. Hospitals are now erroneously perceived as reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2. Community educational campaigns are imperative to convey that hospitals are secured, resourceful, and fully prepared for life-threatening emergencies; which if untreated, has higher morbidity and mortality rate as compared to COVID-19.","output":"Impact of Covid-19 outbreak on clinical presentation of patients admitted for acute heart failure in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Caregivers of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) cancer patients experience high caregiver burden and carry a significant amount of responsibility. Mindfulness has the potential to lessen caregiver burden by aiding in stress management. To date, no studies have examined the efficacy of mindfulness in reducing caregiver burden in this population. Based on our pilot study demonstrating initial feasibility and acceptability of FOCUS (Focusing On mindfulness for Caregivers Under Stress), this 3-arm randomized controlled trial aims to examine the efficacy of a 6-week mindfulness-based stress management program for allogeneic HCT caregivers. Hypotheses include that the FOCUS condition will have lower post-treatment caregiver burden and that patients of these caregivers will have better patient health outcomes compared to other treatment conditions. METHOD: Eligible caregivers will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: FOCUS, Healthy Living (HL; active control), and Enhanced Care (EC; usual care). Caregivers in FOCUS and HL will participate in 6-week weekly individual treatment sessions and will be sent brief daily momentary interventions/messages. Caregivers in all conditions will complete daily diaries over the course of treatment. Patients of enrolled caregivers will be enrolled for assessments only. Participants will complete assessments at baseline, end of treatment, 2- and 6-months post-treatment.

Awareness about this potentially fatal adverse event is paramount in patient management and to make a conscious therapeutic choice. It represents a differential diagnostic challenge, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim is to describe the incidence and characteristics of this adverse event across oncological treatment groups and to promote greater knowledge about this important toxicity. ABSTRACT: Interstitial lung disease is recognized as a group of diseases with a different etiopathogenesis characterized by chronic lung inflammation with the accumulation of inflammatory cells, lymphocytes and macrophages, and the consequent release of proinflammatory cytokines. Various degrees of pulmonary fibrosis can be associated with this inflammatory condition. Interstitial lung disease related to oncological drugs is a relevant problem in clinical practice. The etiopathogenetic mechanisms underlying this adverse event are not completely known but can be partly explained by the mechanism of action of the drug involved. Therefore, knowledge of the relevance of this potentially fatal adverse event supported by the reported safety data of pivotal studies becomes fundamental in the management of patients. The prompt diagnosis of drug-related pneumonia and the consequent differential diagnosis with other forms of pneumonia allow a rapid suspension of treatment and the establishment of an immunosuppressive treatment if necessary. In the context of the health emergency related to SARS CoV2 infection and COVID-19-related interstitial lung disease, such knowledge holds decisive relevance in the conscious choice of cancer treatments. Our intent was to describe the oncological drugs most correlated with this adverse event by reporting, where possible, the percentages of insurgency in pivotal studies to provide an overview and therefore promote greater awareness of this important toxicity related to oncological treatment.","output":"Drug-Related Pneumonitis in Cancer Treatment during the COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, there is no approved antiviral agent to treat COVID-19.

Only randomized controlled trials covering treatment or prevention with convalescent plasma in COVID-19 patients were included. Data were extracted into summary tables. The matrix developed was used to identify common themes and compare primary and secondary outcomes of each trial against other parameters/characteristics of the trial. Microsoft Excel was used to create grids of numbers, texts and analysis using various formulae. A total of 3109 trial registry entries were identified, and 44 fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study.

By obtaining a focused clinical history from the patient, they can identify patients who need to be referred to their physician or to the emergency room, as well as which patients can be managed at home. Red flags that prompt referral include severe systemic illness, respiratory distress, hemoptysis, and altered level of consciousness. Patients with underlying chronic illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and heart failure who present with cough should be assessed for possible exacerbation of their illness and should be referred if this is suspected. Determining the duration of cough is an important step, as this helps identify possible etiologies. Cough <3-week duration is categorized as acute, 3- to 8-week duration is subacute, and > 8-week duration is a chronic cough. Patients with cough lasting >3 weeks should generally be referred for further evaluation and management. Acute cough is often infectious but can also be due to exacerbation of underlying illness or could be medication-related. Upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) is one of the most common causes of subacute and chronic cough. Several different etiologies lead to UACS, which is thought to be caused by postnasal drip  sensitization of cough receptors in the respiratory tract. First-generation antihistamines or decongestants are therapeutic options when UACS is suspected. It is important to note that antitussive medications such as dextromethorphan can actually prolong illness in patients with a productive cough and are thus not recommended.

We described a 28-year-old man with fever, sore throat, dysphagia, and a positive IgM viral capsid Ag (VCA Ag) for EBV infection. He was admitted and received dexamethasone. He developed bilateral peritonsillar abscess (PTA) and splenic infarction, rare complications of acute EBV infection, two days after discharge. Although early reports noted PTA might occur following dexamethasone administration, recently, no obvious evidence supports it. However, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate level in our patient might indicate bacterial superinfection, which could exacerbate with dexamethasone administration. Several mechanisms such as transient hypercoagulable state and insufficient blood supply due to splenomegaly were proposed for splenic infarction due to EBV infection. Since our patient remained asymptomatic during the disease, IM-associated splenic complications, including splenic infarction, should be kept in mind. Our patient underwent bilateral tonsillectomy and received conservative management for the splenic infarction.

A major pathological characteristic for DM is the apoptosis of endothelial cells (ECs) induced by high glucose (HG), however, the function of circRNA in the ECs' phenotypes is still elusive. Here, this study identified an up-regulated circRNA (circVEGFC) in the HG-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Functionally, knockdown of circVEGFC alleviated the apoptosis and recovered the proliferation in HUVECs induced by HG administration. Mechanistically, circVEGFC functioned as the sponge of miR-338-3p, and miR-338-3p was found to target the 3'-Untranslated Regions (3'-UTR) of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1&#945;).

We present a single-institution series of transvaginal hybrid NOTES cholecystectomies (TVC) and compare outcomes with patients undergoing standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). METHODS Patients had an indication for elective cholecystectomy and met the following institutional review board-approved inclusion criteria: female gender, age >18 years, body mass index 35, ASA Classification I or II, and absence of acute cholecystitis. TVC was performed by using one or two transabdominal ports to enable gallbladder retraction and clip application. Dissection was performed with a flexible endoscope through a posterior colpotomy using instrumentation from the NOTES GEN1 Toolbox (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.). RESULTS Seven patients underwent TVC and seven patients underwent LC. Operative times were significantly longer for TVC (162 vs. 68 min; p < 0.001). All procedures were performed on an outpatient basis, except for one patient in each group who were discharged on POD#1. Three minor (grade I) complications occurred: two in the LC group and one in the TVC group. TVC patients required less narcotics in the postanesthesia care unit (1 vs. 8 mg morphine equivalents; p = 0.02). Visual Analog Scale pain scores (scale 0-10) were less in the TVC group at 30 min (1 vs. 5; p = 0.02) and 60 min (2 vs. 5; p = 0.02). TVC pain scores also were lower on postoperative days 1, 4, and 7 (2, 1, 0 vs. 6, 3, 2), although only significantly on POD#1 (p = 0.01). SF-36 scores were similar at 1 and 3 months postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS This series adds to the existing evidence that transvaginal hybrid NOTES cholecystectomy using a flexible endoscope for dissection is a technically feasible and safe procedure.

However, the thymus begins to degenerate as early as the second year of life and continues through aging in human beings, leading to a decreased output of na?ve T cells, the limited TCR diversity and an expansion of monoclonal memory T cells in the periphery organs. These alternations will reduce the adaptive immune response to tumors and emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, also it is easier to suffer from autoimmune diseases in older people. In the context of global aging, it is important to investigate and clarify the causes and mechanisms of thymus involution. MAIN BODY: Epigenetics include histone modification, DNA methylation, non-coding RNA effects, and chromatin remodeling. In this review, we discuss how senescent thymic epithelial cells determine and control age-related thymic atrophy, how this process is altered by epigenetic modification. How the thymus adipose influences the dysfunctions of the thymic epithelial cells, and the prospects of targeting thymic epithelial cells for the treatment of thymus atrophy. CONCLUSION: Epigenetic modifications are emerging as key regulators in governing the development and senescence of thymic epithelial cells. It is beneficial to re-establish effective thymopoiesis, identify the potential therapeutic strategy and rejuvenate the immune function in the elderly.","output":"Epigenetic modifications in thymic epithelial cells: an evolutionary perspective for thymus atrophy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Small, non\\\\coding RNAs (microRNAs) have been shown to regulate gene expression in response to exercise in various tissues and organs, thus possibly coordinating their adaptive response. Thus, it is likely that differential microRNA expression might be one of the factors that are responsible for different training responses of different individuals. Consequently, determining microRNA patterns might be a promising approach toward the development of individualized training strategies. However, little is known on (1) microRNA patterns and their regulation by different exercise regimens and (2) possible correlations between these patterns and individual training adaptation.

In this work, we applied selected deep learning models including multilayer perceptron, random forest, and different versions of long short-term memory (LSTM), using three data sources to train the models, including COVID-19 occurrences, basic information like coded country names, and detailed information like population, and area of different countries. The main goal is to forecast the outbreak in nine countries (Iran, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, Spain, China, and the USA). The performances of the models are measured using four metrics, including mean average percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), normalized RMSE (NRMSE), and R 2. The best performance was found for a modified version of LSTM, called M-LSTM (winner model), to forecast the future trajectory of the pandemic in the mentioned countries.

Compensatory sweating is a difficult adverse effect. Clipping has been proposed because of its supposed reversibility when clips are removed at a later date. The primary aims of this article are to investigate the neuronal lesion of the sympathetic chain caused by clipping and to study the possibility of regeneration after removal of the clips. METHODS We performed an experimental study at the Minimally Invasive Surgery Centre Jesus Uson in Caceres (Spain). We used a swine model, performing clipping, unclipping, and extirpation of different segments of sympathetic chain with clips and after clip removal, following a chronogram of 10, 20, and 30 days. Pathologic studies of specimens and statistics were done at the University of Seville. RESULTS Ten days after clipping, all sympathetic chains displayed evident Wallerian degeneration. Twenty days after clipping, Wallerian degeneration of myelinated fibers was more widespread and also more striking. Thirty days after clipping, a very marked macrophagic reaction was visible, with multiple signs of phagocytosis of myelin debris. By 30 days post operation and 20 days after clip removal, a few residual myelin and amyelinated fibers were visible. These findings suggest that axon regeneration is not possible. CONCLUSIONS There are Wallerian degeneration and axon loss 10 days after clipping. The almost total absence of myelinated and amyelinated fibers following clip removal suggests that there was no nerve regeneration, and that therefore clipping cannot be considered a reversible technique.","output":"Sympathetic chain clipping for hyperhidrosis is not a reversible procedure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over 90% of the COVID-19 patients with computed tomographic (CT) manifestations showed radiological improvement on dissipating stage.

Traffic forwarding is undertaken by means of forwarding tables within network devices, which need to be searched upon in order to find the proper destination, and that process may be resource-consuming as the number of entries in such tables grow. However, the arithmetic framework proposed may speed up the traffic forwarding decisions as relaying on integer divisions and modular arithmetic, which may result more straightforward.

In the current COVID-19 context among older adults in the community, the fear of COVID-19, anxiety symptoms, compassion, resilience, and the practice of protective behaviors are possibly related to each other in several ways. How these factors relate to each other would have important implications in managing the spread of the disease and its mental health consequences. To this end, we modeled their interrelationships using a structural equation model. Older adults (N = 421), aged 60 and above completed various questionnaires-COVID-19 Fear Inventory, Short form of the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory, COVID-19 Risky and Protective Behaviours, Resilience Appraisals Scale, and Compassion Scale during a COVID-19 lockdown. The relationships between these variables were assessed within a structural equation model. The findings showed that older adults who are more compassionate engage in protective behaviors more frequently. Additionally, frequent practice of protective behaviors and greater resilience predicted lower anxiety among older adults. Greater fear predicted higher anxiety levels but did not significantly influence an individual's engagement in protective behaviors. Mental health services are crucial in fostering resilience and supporting older adults psychologically. Social services are also necessary in maintaining and enhancing social support for older adults. Importantly, these findings suggest that public health communications could promote compassion and avoid using a fear-based approach to increase engagement in protective behaviors.","output":"The interplay between anxiety, fear, protective behaviors, compassion, and resilience among older adults during a COVID-19 lockdown: a structural equation modeling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with diffuse lung damage. Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death. METHODS: In this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison. RESULTS: A total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care. Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P<0.001). The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization. In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs. 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs. 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs. 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.55). CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support.

Better approaches of diagnostics and medical facilities have helped some countries recover early. Previous exposures to epidemics have imparted lessons to handle such a pandemic with a high level of preparedness. The World Health Organization (WHO) and national health authorities are taking great efforts via efficient and impactful interventions to contain the virus. Diagnostic tests such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction are increasingly being used to confirm the diagnosis because testing biological samples for the presence of the virus is the definitive method to identify the disease, analyze the risk for transmission, and determine whether someone has been cured or not. It is also important to screen asymptomatic individuals to get the exact overview of the virus spread. Antibody detection plays a pivotal role in diagnosis; however, using it at the wrong time yields negative results and conveys dissenting opinion about the tests. Although the scaling up of testing has been significant, overall testing has been limited by the availability of diagnostics. Rapid diagnoses and discontinuation of transmission are keys to ending this pandemic. Diagnostics manufacturers are developing test kits and distributing them to different countries. Therefore, more than 500 commercial test kits for molecular- and immunoassays, most with Emergency Use Authorization, are now becoming available in the market.

Different geographical areas of the Northern Hemisphere in the United States and in Europe were selected in order to provide a wide range among the different parameters. The death rates were gathered from an available dataset. As a further control, we also included latitude, as a proxy for temperature. METHODS: Utilizing a publicly available dataset, we retrieved data for the months of March and April 2020 for 25 areas in Europe and in the US. We computed the monthly number of deaths/1 M people of confirmed COVID-19 cases and calculated the average monthly high temperatures and population density for all these areas. We determined the correlation between number of deaths/1 M people and the average monthly high temperatures, the latitude and the population density. RESULTS: We divided our analysis in two parts: analysis of the correlation among the different variables in the month of March and subsequent analysis in the month of April. The differences were then evaluated. In the month of March there was no statistical correlation between average monthly high temperatures of the considered geographical areas and number of deaths/1 M people. However, a statistically significant inverse correlation became significant in the month of April between average monthly high temperatures (p = 0.0043) and latitude (p = 0.0253) with number of deaths/1 M people. We also observed a statistically significant correlation between population density and number of deaths/1 M people both in the month of March (p = 0.0297) and in the month of April (p = 0.0116), when three areas extremely populated (NYC, Los Angeles and Washington DC) were included in the calculation. Once these three areas were removed, the correlation was not statistically significant (p = 0.1695 in the month of March, and p = 0.7076 in the month of April). CONCLUSIONS: The number of COVID-19-related deaths/1 M people was essentially the same during the month of March for all the geographical areas considered, indicating essentially that the infection was circulating quite uniformly except for Lombardy, Italy, where it started earlier. Lockdown measures were implemented between the end of March and beginning of April, except for Italy which started March 9th. We observed a strong, statistically significant inverse correlation between average monthly high temperatures with the number of deaths/1 M people. We confirmed the data by analyzing the correlation with the latitude, which can be considered a proxy for high temperature.

CONCLUSIONS This review reports factors promoting leak and gives technical recommendations to avoid leak after LSG based on the available evidence and expert consensus which encompasses: (1) use a bougie size 40 Fr, EL:1, (2) begin the gastric transection 5-6 cm from the pylorus, EL:2-3, (3) use appropriate cartridge colors from antrum to fundus, EL:1, (4) reinforce the staple line with buttress material, EL:1, (5) follow a proper staple line, (6) remove the crotch staples, EL:4, (7) maintain proper traction on the stomach before firing, (8) stay away from the angle of His at least 1 cm, EL:1, (9) check the bleeding from the staple line, (10) perform an intraoperative methylene blue test, EL:4.","output":"Leaks after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: overview of pathogenesis and risk factors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Life course complexity has so far been analyzed from a cohort perspective, but period measures could allow the holistic analysis of the impact of temporary circumstances on it. OBJECTIVE We measure life course complexity from a period perspective and decompose the results according to age and transition type. METHODS Complexity is measured as the number of distinct states visited (NDS) and the average number of visits to each visited state (ANV). Measures are based on sequences taken from different cohorts from a similar age onward, until a common period of interest. Period complexity is the sum of the cohort-specific differences in complexity reached at the beginning and at the end of the period of interest, summed through years of age. RESULTS Analyzing life courses of Dutch women born 1977-2000, we find decreases in NDS and increases in ANV from both perspectives. Changes are explained by a decrease in transitions to being married and an increase in returns to the parental home and living alone. CONCLUSIONS A woman who would experience the complexity of the years 2017-2018 throughout her life course would visit fewer distinct states and return more often to the same states than any average woman born between 1977-1978 and 1987-1988 actually did. This means that life courses might continue to become less linear in the future and that some of the parts that constitute them might continue to become more often omitted.

The new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has created an unprecedented global health problem, resulting in more than 250,000 confirmed deaths. The disease produced by this virus, called Covid-19, presents with variable clinical manifestations, from practically asymptomatic patients with catarrhal processes to severe pneumonias that rapidly evolve to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure. In recent weeks, papers have been published describing coagulation disorders and arterial and venous thrombotic complications in these patients, mainly among those admitted to intensive care units. The infection triggers an immune response, which causes different inflammatory mediators to be released into the blood. These include cytokines, which interact with platelets and different coagulation proteins, and promote thrombogenesis. One of the most widely studied coagulation markers in Covid-19 is D-dimer (), raised levels of which have prognostic implications, although the best cut-off point for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in this population has not been clarified, nor has its usefulness in determining the intensity of thromboprophylaxis required in these patients.

RESULTS: Of 557 consecutive COVID-19 patients, 46 had active cancer (8%). Comorbidities included diabetes (n = 137, 25%), hypertension (n = 284, 51%), coronary artery disease (n = 114, 20%) and dyslipidaemia (n = 122, 22%).

In this study, we introduce the on-line multiloci identification system (MIST) for automated detection of three hundred and forty-nine Trichoderma species based on a set of three DNA barcodes. MIST is based on the reference databases of validated sequences of three commonly used phylogenetic markers collected from public databases. The databases consist of four hundred and sixteen complete sequences of the nuclear rRNA internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS), five hundred and eighty-three sequence fragments of the gene encoding translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1) and five hundred and thirty-four sequence fragments of the gene encoding RNA polymerase subunit 2 (rpb2). Through MIST, information from different DNA barcodes can be combined and the identification of Trichoderma species can be achieved based on the integrated parametric sequence similarity search (blastn) performed in the manner of a decision tree classifier. In the verification process, MIST provided correct identification for forty-four Trichoderma spp. based on DNA barcodes consisting from tef1 and rpb2 markers. Thus, MIST can be used to obtain an automated species identification as well as to retrieve sequences required for the manual identification by means of phylogenetic analysis.IMPORTANCE The genus Trichoderma is important to human kind, with a wide range of applications in industry, agriculture and bioremediation. Thus, quick and accurate identification of Trichoderma species is paramount since it is usually the first step in Trichoderma-based research. However, it frequently becomes a limitation, especially for researchers who lack taxonomic knowledge of fungi. Moreover, as the number of Trichoderma-based studies has increased, a growing number of unidentified sequences have been stored in public databases, which has made the species identification more ambiguous. In this study, we provide an easy to use tool for automated species identification (MIST), a list of Trichoderma species, and corresponding sequences of reference DNA barcodes.

In the present study, we assessed the possible effect of TCoV on the reproductive performance of experimentally infected turkey hens. In two separate trials, 29- to 30-wk-old turkey hens in peak egg production were either mock-infected or inoculated orally with TCoV (Indiana strain). Cloacal swabs and intestinal and reproductive tissues were collected and standard reverse-transcription PCR was conducted to detect TCoV RNA. In the cloacal swabs, TCoV was detected consistently at 3, 5, 7, and 12 days postinoculation (DPI) with higher rates of detection after 5 DPI (> 90%). All intestinal samples were also positive for TCoV at 7 DPI, and microscopic lesions consisting of severe enteritis with villous atrophy were observed in the duodenum and jejunum of TCoV-infected hens.

In both experimental trials an average of 28%-29% drop in egg production was observed in TCoV-infected turkey hens between 4 and 7 DPI. In a separate trial we also confirmed that TCoV can efficiently transmit from infected to contact control hens. Our results show that TCoV infection can affect the reproductive performance in turkey hens, causing a transient drop in egg production. This drop in egg production most likely occurred as consequence of the severe enteritis produced by the TCoV.

The senescent immune system has been described to have a causal role in driving systemic aging and therefore may represent a key therapeutic target to prevent pathological consequences associated with aging and extend a healthy lifespan. Previous studies from our group associated a polymorphic haplotype variant in the BPIFB4 gene (LAV-BPIFB4) with exceptional longevity. Transfer of the LAV-BPIFB4 in preclinical models halted the progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and frailty by counterbalancing chronic inflammation. In the present study, we aimed to delineate the action of systemic adeno-associated viral vector-mediated LAV-BPIFB4 gene transfer (AAV-LAV-BPIFB4) on the deleterious age-related changes of the immune system and thereby the senescence-associated events occurring in C57BL/6J mice aged 26 months. Our in vivo data showed that 26-months-old mice had a higher frequency of CD45(+)SA-beta Gal(+) immune cells in peripheral blood than young (4-months-old) C57BL/6J mice. Notably, AAV-LAV-BPIFB4 gene transfer in aged mice reduced the pool of peripheral immunosenescent cells that were shown to be enriched in the spleen. In addition, the proper tuning of the immune secretory phenotype (IL1(low), IL6(low), IL10(high)) associated with a significant reduction in SA-beta Gal-positive area of aorta from AAV-LAV treated mice. At the functional level, the reduction of senescence-associated inflammation ensured sustained NAD(+) levels in the plasma of AAV-LAV-BPIFB4 old mice by preventing the NADase CD38 increase in F4/80+ tissue-resident macrophages and Ly6C(high) pro-inflammatory monocytes of the spleen and bone marrow. Finally, to validate the clinical implication of our findings, we showed that Long-living-individuals (LLIs, >95 years), which delay CVDs onset, especially if LAV-carriers, were characterized by high NAD(+) levels. In conclusion, the new senotherapeutic action of LAV-BPIFB4 may offer a valuable therapeutic tool to control aging and reduce the burden of its pathophysiological disorders, such as CVDs.","output":"Transfer of the longevity-associated variant of BPIFB4 gene rejuvenates immune system and vasculature by a reduction of CD38(+) macrophages and NAD(+) decline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International public health policies increasingly favor mandatory immunization.

AIMS: To evaluate the attitudes of neurologists in regard to AE, to review the differential diagnosis, treatment options, and to reveal the effect of COVID-19 on this matter. METHODS: A detailed questionnaire prepared for AE was sent to neurologists via social media and WhatsApp after the approval of the Ethics Committee. The responses of 245 respondents working in different settings were analyzed, and the group with 15 years or less experience in neurology was statistically compared to the group with more than 15 years of experience. RESULTS: Awareness and knowledge levels on AE seemed high in all groups, while 11% had never thought about AE during the differential diagnosis in real life. Before starting treatment, 20% thought that the autoantibody result should definitely support it, and 77.6% reported that they did not recognize AE well. Participants stated that satisfactory guidelines for diagnosis and treatment (88.2%) and widespread laboratory support (83.7%) were lacking. Neurologists with less experience and those working outside of training hospitals get more often consultation from an experienced clinician while diagnosing and conduct more detailed investigations at the diagnosis stage (p = 0.0025, p = 0.0001).

Using systems biology, we detected progressive dysregulation of multiple parameters indicative of organ damage that correlated with disease severity, particularly affecting kidneys, hepatobiliary system, and immune landscape. By performing unsupervised clustering and trajectory analysis, we identified T and B cell depletion as early indicators of a complicated disease course. In addition, markers of hepatobiliary damage emerged as robust predictor of lethal outcome in critically ill patients. This allowed us to propose a novel clinical COVID-19 SeveriTy (COST) score that distinguishes complicated disease trajectories and predicts lethal outcome in critically ill patients.","output":"Multi-dimensional and longitudinal systems profiling reveals predictive pattern of severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of people in many ways. However, little is known about weight gain in American adults during the pandemic. AIMS AND METHODS: The purpose of this study was to conduct a national assessment of weight gain in adult Americans after the first year of the pandemic. An online questionnaire was employed to explore perceptions of adults regarding pandemic weight gain and the relationship between weight gain and sociodemographic characteristics, pre-pandemic weight status, and psychological distress. Multiple methods were used to assess the psychometric properties of the questionnaire (i.e., face validity, content validity, and internal consistency reliability testing). Chi-Square tests and logistic regression analysis were used to assess group differences and predictors of weight gain in the study participants. RESULTS: A total of 3,473 individuals participated in the study with weight changes distributed as: gained weight (48%), remained the same weight (34%), or lost weight (18%). Those who reported being very overweight before the pandemic were most likely to gain weight (65%) versus those who reported being slightly overweight (58%) or normal weight (40%) before the pandemic. Weight gain was statistically significantly higher in those with anxiety (53%), depression (52%), or symptoms of both (52%). The final multiple regression model found that the statistically significant predictors of pandemic weight gain were psychological distress, pre-pandemic weight status, having children at home; and time since last bodyweight check. CONCLUSIONS: Population health promotion strategies in the pandemic should emphasize stress reduction to help individuals manage body weight and avoid chronic diseases in the future.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic and weight gain in American adults: A nationwide population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 emergency has challenged both the institutional configuration of the Italian NHS and the management of health organizations and hospitals The political debate and media coverage have often highlighted the regionalization and the capacity of leaders of health organizations as limitations or causes of failures in managing the pandemic Vice versa, a more in depth and fact-based analysis of what took place in the last months shows how the management of health organizations and the supervision of health services at regional level were strengths in coping with the emergency This work illustrates why Italian NHS should invest more in consolidating the corporatization process of health organizations and the regional governance of health sector Copyright ?

This peculiar space must maintain a very low fluid volume at negative hydraulic pressure in order to guarantee a proper mechanical coupling between the chest wall and lungs. To better understand the potential for liquid drainage, the key parameter to be considered is the difference in hydraulic pressure between the pleural space and the lymphatic lumen.

New reports show a prevalence of COVID-related thyroiditis. Recent studies suggest that there may be a higher risk of thyroiditis in the setting of SARS-CoV-2, and several cases of Graves disease have been reported in individuals with SARS-CoV-2, although the incidence of such findings and their relationship to COVID-19 is unknown. In this report, we present Graves hyperthyroidism in a 48-year-old African American male who was admitted to the hospital for complaints of cough, fatigue, and palpitations. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was found to have suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and an elevated free T4. The patient had no prior history of thyroid disease. Initially, it was thought to be a case of viral thyroiditis, and he was discharged on prednisone. However, he was found to have positive thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) and a diffuse increase in flow on doppler ultrasound of the thyroid. Subsequently, he was started on anti-thyroid medications with significant improvement. What is unique about this case is that, unlike other described cases in the literature where there was a relapse of a known Graves' disease after COVID-19 disease, our patient did not have a history or symptoms of thyroid disease prior to this event, which should raise the concern about possible activation of Graves' disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection through an autoimmune pathway.

This case study of the municipality of H?rn?sand, aims to assess opportunities and challenges for using waste flows and by-products for local food production, facilitated by industrial symbiosis. A potential symbiotic network was developed during three workshops with the main stakeholders in H?rn?sand. The potential of the COVID-19 pandemic to instigate policy changes, behavioural changes and formation of new alliances that may catalyse the transition towards food systems based on industrial symbiosis is discussed. The material flow inventory revealed that many underexploited resource flows were present in quantities that rendered them commercially interesting. Resources that can be used for innovative food production include, e.g., lignocellulosic residues, rock dust, and food processing waste. The internalised drive among local companies interested in industrial symbiosis and the emerging symbiotic relations, provide a fertile ground for the establishment of a local network that can process the sub-exploited material flows.

However, the bulk of existing data evaluates the population of COVID patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). There has been limited evidence in the emergency department (ED) population and as a result, there is variability in diagnostic evaluation for patients presenting with COVID. The objective of this study was to describe the diagnostic evaluation of both COVID positive and negative patients in the ED. Methods: Over a period of 13 months beginning March 2020, all patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) of a single, tertiary academic medical center in the United States and tested for COVID, who had contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging of the chest performed were included in this retrospective cohort study. The primary outcome was CT positivity rate for PE and radiologist impressions were used to determine positivity rate for all patients. A subset of patients received D-dimer testing or received supplemental oxygen in the ED and CT positivity was evaluated in these strata. Results: After exclusion of CT chest studies without contrast, 5576 patient encounters were included in the final cohort with 367 patients considered to be COVID positive at the time of ED presentation. The positivity rate for PE in COVID positive patients was 9.8% compared to 7.1% for non-COVID patients. The rate of D-dimer testing prior to CT was higher (76% vs 25%) in COVID positive compared to negative patients. CT test positivity rate was close when comparing COVID positive and negative patients who did not receive oxygen (5.0% vs 6.3%) but in those that received supplemental oxygen in the ED, 12.7% of COVID positive patients were positive for PE compared to 8.3% for COVID negative. The d-dimer institutional cut-off of 0.5 mcg/mL was sensitive for PE on CT without false negative results. There was a significant age difference between hypoxic patients (median age of 63) and not-hypoxic patients (median age of 50). A Sankey diagram of COVID positive patients who had both contrast-enhanced CTs performed and D-dimers drawn is presented as a figure. Conclusion: Non-hypoxic COVID positive patients had a largely comparable positivity rate of PE on contrast enhanced CT imaging compared to non-hypoxic non-COVID patients, but in the subset of patients who received supplemental oxygen, COVID patients were at considerably increased risk of PE. Using the conventional cut-off value of D-dimers yielded no false negative results, however D-dimer values frequently were obtained as part of a routine COVID workup for risk stratification. Our study was limited by its single center design. Further research is needed to determine if COVID positive patients have an increased risk of pulmonary embolism.

Variations in the S protein (mediates virus entry) were associated with differences in its interaction with ACE2 (cellular S receptor) and sensitivity to TMPRSS2 (enables virus entry via S cleavage) inhibition. Anti-ACE2 antibodies more strongly inhibited SARS-CoV than SARS-CoV-2 infection, probably due to a stronger SARS-CoV-2 S-ACE2 affinity relative to SARS-CoV S. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV displayed differences in cell tropism. Cellular ACE2 and TMPRSS2 levels did not indicate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.

Objective: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. Design: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. Setting: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. Measurements: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. Results: There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Limitation: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. Conclusion: This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS.

METHODS We searched PubMed, Medline, Cochrane library, clinicaltrials.gov and EMBASE from 31st December 2019 to 15th December 2020 for studies enrolling consecutive COVID-19 patients presenting with neurological manifestations. Risk of bias was examined using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scale. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed, and pooled prevalence and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated for neurological manifestations. Odds ratio (OR) and 95%CI were calculated to determine the association of neurological manifestations with disease severity and mortality. Presence of heterogeneity was assessed using I-square, meta-regression, and subgroup analyses. Statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.2. RESULTS Of 2,455 citations, 350 studies were included in this review, providing data on 145,721 COVID-19 patients, 89% of whom were hospitalized. Forty-one neurological manifestations (24 symptoms and 17 diagnoses) were identified. Pooled prevalence of the most common neurological symptoms included: fatigue (32%), myalgia (20%), taste impairment (21%), smell impairment (19%) and headache (13%). A low risk of bias was observed in 85% of studies; studies with higher risk of bias yielded higher prevalence estimates. Stroke was the most common neurological diagnosis (pooled prevalence- 2%).

It can also be activated by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein. In the present study, we set out to determine the regulatory effects of this pathway on the replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Our results demonstrate that the expression of a constitutively active Akt1 profoundly inhibited HBV RNA transcription and consequently reduced HBV DNA replication in HepG2 cells. This suppression of HBV gene transcription was apparently mediated by the activation of mTOR, as it was abolished by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Moreover, treatment of HBV-expressing HepG2.2.15 cells with inhibitors of PI3K, Akt, and mTOR increased the transcription of 3.5-kb and 2.4-kb viral RNA as well as the replication of HBV DNA. This observation implies that the basal level activation of this pathway in HepG2 cells regulated HBV replication. Consistent with previous reports showing that the HCV NS5A protein could bind to the p85 subunit of PI3K and activate the PI3K-Akt signal transduction pathway, our results showed that expression of this protein could inhibit HBV RNA transcription and reduce HBV DNA replication in HepG2 cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway during liver oncogenesis may be at least partially responsible for the elimination of HBV replication from tumor cells and may also provide an explanation for the observed suppression of HBV replication by HCV coinfection.","output":"Regulation of hepatitis B virus replication by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-akt signal transduction pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Gender-based violence affects 35C45% of women worldwide, mostly coming from domestic violence.

Different from the existing Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) based virus transmission models, which fits well for pandemic modeling with sufficient historical data, the new model, which is also SEIR based, uses short history data to find the trend of the changing disease dynamics for the infected, the dead and the recovered so that it can naturally accommodate the adaptive real-time changes of disease mitigation, business activity and social behavior of populations. As the parameters of the improved SEIR models are trained by short history window data for accurate trend prediction, our differential epidemic model, essentially are window-based time-varying SEIR model. Since SEIR model still is a physics-based disease transmission model, its near-term (like one month) projection can still be very instrumental for policy makers to guide their decision for disease mitigation and business activity policy change in a real-time.

Increasing energy consumption makes it difficult to ensure electrical energy supply security. Meeting the energy demand can be achieved with the right planning. Proper planning is critical for both economical use of resources and low cost for the end consumer. On the other hand, erroneous estimation of demand may cause waste of resources and energy crisis. Accurate estimation is possible by accurately modeling the factors affecting electricity consumption. Apart from known factors such as seasonal conditions, days of the week and hours, modeling in extreme events such as pandemics that affect all our behaviors increases the success in modeling the future projection. This ensures that the security of electrical energy supply is carried out effectively with limited resources. For this purpose, in this study, a hybrid multiple linear regression\\\\feedforward artificial neural network (MLR\\\\FFANN) based algorithm model was proposed, taking into account the estimated impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on the energy consumption values of Bursa, an industrial city in Turkey. The aim of the hybrid MLR\\\\FFANN approach was to simultaneously optimize the  polynomial for multiple linear regression and the weight and bias coefficients for the forward propagation neural network using the adaptive guided differential evolution, equilibrium optimizer, slime mold algorithm, and stochastic fractal search with fitness distance balance (SFSFDB) optimization algorithms. The success of the model whose parameters were optimized using the optimization algorithms was determined according to mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error evaluation criteria and statistical analysis of these results. According to the results of the analysis, the MLR\\\\FFANN approach whose parameters were optimized with the SFSFDB algorithm was more successful in the training of the dataset containing the COVID\\\\19 precautions.","output":"Prediction of electricity energy consumption including COVID\\\\19 precautions using the hybrid MLR\\\\FFANN optimized with the stochastic fractal search with fitness distance balance algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although much of the public health effort to combat COVID-19 has focused on disease control strategies in public settings, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within households remains an important problem. The nature and determinants of household transmission are poorly understood. METHODS: To address this gap, we gathered and analyzed data from 22 published and pre-published studies from 10 countries (20,291 household contacts) that were available through September 2, 2020. Our goal was to combine estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 household secondary attack rate (SAR) and explore variation in estimates of the household SAR. RESULTS: The overall pooled random-effects estimate of the household SAR was 17.1% (95% CI: 13.7-21.2%). In study-level, random-effects meta-regressions stratified by testing frequency (1 test, 2 tests, >2 tests), SAR estimates were 9.2% (95% CI: 6.7-12.3%), 17.5% (95% CI: 13.9-21.8%), and 21.3% (95% CI: 13.8-31.3%), respectively. Household SAR tended to be higher among older adult contacts and among contacts of symptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that SAR reported using a single follow-up test may be underestimated and that testing household contacts of COVID-19 cases on multiple occasions may increase the yield for identifying secondary cases.","output":"The household secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2: A rapid review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) are critical to joint inflammation and destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Increased glycolysis in RA FLSs contributes to persistent joint damage. SUMOylation, a posttranslational modification of proteins, plays an important role in initiation and development of many diseases. However, the role of small ubiquitin-like modifier-activating (SUMO-activating) enzyme 1 (SAE1)/ubiquitin like modifier activating enzyme 2 (UBA2) in regulating the pathogenic FLS behaviors is unknown. Here, we found an increased expression of SAE1 and UBA2 in FLSs and synovial tissues from patients with RA. SAE1 or UBA2 knockdown by siRNA and treatment with GA, an inhibitor of SAE1/UBA2-mediated SUMOylation, resulted in reduced glycolysis, aggressive phenotype, and inflammation. SAE1/UBA2-mediated SUMOylation of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) promoted its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation and decreased PK activity. Moreover, inhibition of PKM2 phosphorylation increased PK activity and suppressed glycolysis, aggressive phenotype, and inflammation. We further demonstrated that STAT5A mediated SUMOylated PKM2-induced glycolysis and biological behaviors. Interestingly, GA treatment attenuated the severity of arthritis in mice with collagen-induced arthritis and human TNF-&#945; transgenic mice. These findings suggest that an increase in synovial SAE1/UBA2 may contribute to synovial glycolysis and joint inflammation in RA and that targeting SAE1/UBA2 may have therapeutic potential in patients with RA.","output":"Increased SUMO-activating enzyme SAE1/UBA2 promotes glycolysis and pathogenic behavior of rheumatoid fibroblast-like synoviocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Returning universities to full on-campus operations while the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing has been a controversial discussion in many countries. The risk of large outbreaks in dense course settings is contrasted by the benefits of in-person teaching. Transmission risk depends on a range of parameters, such as vaccination coverage, number of contacts and adoption of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures (NPIs). Due to the generalised academic freedom in Europe, many universities are asked to autonomously decide on and implement intervention measures and regulate on-campus operations. In the context of rapidly changing vaccination coverage and parameters of the virus, universities often lack the scientific facts to base these decisions on. To address this problem, we analyse a calibrated, data-driven simulation of transmission dynamics of 10755 students and 974 faculty in a medium-sized university. We use a co-location network reconstructed from student enrolment data and calibrate transmission risk based on outbreak size distributions in other Austrian education institutions. We focus on actionable interventions that are part of the already existing decision-making process of universities to provide guidance for concrete policy decisions. Here we show that with the vaccination coverage of about 80% recently reported for students in Austria, universities can be safely reopened if they either mandate masks or reduce lecture hall occupancy to 50%. Our results indicate that relaxing NPIs within an organisation based on the vaccination coverage of its sub-population can be a way towards limited normalcy, even if nation wide vaccination coverage is not sufficient to prevent large outbreaks yet.","output":"High COVID-19 vaccine coverage allows for a re-opening of European universities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, several restrictive measures have been put in place that cause significant disruption to lifestyle habits.

It has been shown that apoptotic cells from blood and tissues may be involved in the complex pathogenesis of dengue. However, very little is known about the interplay between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic mediators in this disease. Therefore, plasma levels of the three proapoptotic mediators Fas ligand (FasL), tumor necrosis factor\\\\ (TNF\\\\), and TNF\\\\related apoptosis\\\\inducing ligand (TRAIL) were measured in dengue patients. Patients were classified according to the World Health Organization classification of dengue revised in 2009. Additionally, inhibitors of apoptosis protein (IAPs) were determined in plasma (Survivin) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) lysates (cIAP\\\\1, cIAP\\\\2, XIAP). Levels of apoptotic proteins in plasma were correlated with counts of blood cells. FasL and TRAIL levels were elevated in dengue patients without warning signs when compared to patients with severe dengue and controls. Dengue patients with warning signs showed decreased levels of Survivin compared to patients with severe dengue and controls. TRAIL was inversely correlated with counts of lymphocyte subsets. In contrast, Survivin was positively correlated with leukocyte counts. There was a trend of elevated IAPs levels in PBMCs of patients with severe dengue. The results suggest a likely antiviral effect of TRAIL in dengue. It appears that TRAIL might be involved with apoptosis induction of lymphocytes, whereas IAPs might participate in protecting leukocytes from apoptosis.

Methods: The whole genomes of 330 SARS-CoV-2 samples were sequenced using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Phylogenetic and sequence analysis of a total of 3014 Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 20 different States/Union Territories (January to September 2020) from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database was performed to observe the clustering of Nextstrain and Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages (Pangolin) lineages with the GISAID clades. The identification of mutational sites under selection pressure was performed using Mixed Effects Model of Evolution and Single-Likelihood Ancestor Counting methods available in the Datamonkey server. Results: Temporal data of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed that except for Uttarakhand, West Bengal and Haryana that showed the circulation of GISAID clade O even after July 2020, the rest of the States showed a complete switch to GR/GH clades. Pangolin lineages B.1.1.8 and B.1.113 identified within GR and GH clades, respectively, were noted to be indigenous evolutions. Sites identified to be under positive selection pressure within these clades were found to occur majorly in the non-structural proteins coded by ORF1a and ORF1b.

The 35-items questionnaire was prepared using Google forms and distributed through e-mails and social media. RESULTS: The 1,026 responses comprised of 558 HCWs (54.4%) and 468 GPPs (45.6%). The most reliable source of information was TV news for 43% GPPs, whereas it was HCWs/Local health authorities for 36.8% HCWs. HCWs had sufficient knowledge regarding COVID-19, while it was relatively low among GPPs (average correct response 65% and 53%, respectively). Intra-group analysis with respect to age, sex, qualification, and socioeconomic status showed that knowledge about mode of transmission by airborne aerosols was significantly low with respect to qualification among GPPs while younger age group (<40 years) HCWs had significantly more knowledge about mode of transmission and asymptomatic carriers.

Prompt and accurate virus detection enables timely treatment and effective quarantine of virus carrier, and therefore effectively reduces the possibility of large-scale spread. However, conventional virus detection techniques often suffer from slow response, high cost or sophisticated procedures. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials have been used as promising sensing platforms for the high-performance detection of a variety of chemical and biological substances. The unique properties of 2D materials, such as large specific area, active surface interaction with biomolecules and facile surface functionalization, provide advantages in developing novel virus detection technologies with fast response and high sensitivity. Furthermore, 2D materials possess versatile and tunable electronic, electrochemical and optical properties, making them ideal platforms to demonstrate conceptual sensing techniques and explore complex sensing mechanisms in next-generation biosensors. In this review, we first briefly summarize the virus detection techniques with an emphasis on the current efforts in fighting again COVID-19. Then, we introduce the preparation methods and properties of 2D materials utilized in biosensors, including graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and other 2D materials. Furthermore, we discuss the working principles of various virus detection technologies based on emerging 2D materials, such as field-effect transistor-based virus detection, electrochemical virus detection, optical virus detection and other virus detection techniques.

We recently demonstrated in a post-mortem cohort that SARS-CoV-2 renal tropism was associated with kidney injury, disease severity and mortality. We also proposed an algorithm to predict the need for ICU-resources and the risk of adverse outcomes in Covid-19 patients harnessing urinalysis and protein/coagulation parameters on admission for signs of kidney injury. Here, we aimed to validate this hypothesis in a multicenter cohort. Methods: : Patients hospitalized for Covid-19 at four tertiary centers were screened for an available urinalysis, serum albumin (SA) and antithrombin-III activity (AT-III) obtained prospectively within 48h upon admission. The respective presumed risk for an unfavorable course was categorized as low, intermediate or high, depending on a normal urinalysis, an abnormal urinalysis with SA 2 g/dl and AT-III 70%, or an abnormal urinalysis with at least one SA or AT-III abnormality. Time to ICU or death within ten days served as primary, in-hospital mortality and required organ support served as secondary endpoints. Results: : Among a total of N=223 screened patients, N=145 were eligible for enrollment, falling into the low (N=43), intermediate (N=84), and high risk (N=18) categories. The risk for ICU transfer or death was 100% in the high risk group and significantly elevated in the composite of high and intermediate risk as compared to the low risk group (63.7% vs. 27.9%;HR 2.6;95%-CI 1.4 to 4.9;P=0.0020). Having an abnormal urinalysis was associated with mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or renal replacement therapy (RRT). Conclusion: Our data confirm that Covid-19-associated urine abnormalities on admission predict disease aggravation and need for ICU. By engaging a simple urine dipstick on hospital admission our algorithm allows for early preventive measures and appropriate patient stratification.

End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients on dialysis are particularly at high risk of infections due to impairments in the innate and adaptive immune system. Vaccination on dialysis patients (DP) still remains challenging, because of the variable response and low seroconversion rate compared with healthy controls (HC). Therefore, it is urgently necessary to establish a different vaccination strategy for DP, in terms of dose and administration time. METHODS: Here, we report an observational prospective cohort study in which the immunogenic efficacies of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 on DP and HC were evaluated by absolute quantification of IgG levels in the blood. RESULTS: DP showed a delayed seroconversion after two vaccine doses, with a low absolute IgG levels compared to HC. While healthy populations reached complete seroconversion within 10 days from the administration of second dose, only 76% of DP were seropositive. After booster dose, DP strongly improved seroconversion rate as well as antibody levels, reaching 97% seropositivity and 50 times enhancement on antibody levels. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: These results prompt to suggest an additional vaccine dose in DP, reducing the interval of time from the second dose. Since few data are available on immune response in DP overtime after three vaccine doses currently, our study is among the first reports demonstrating the improved seropositivity and IgG levels in DP after booster vaccine dose.","output":"The DiaCoVAb study in South Italy: immune response to Sars-CoV-2 vaccination in dialysis patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To capture the subjective experience of close family ascendants of acute bacterial meningitis survivors and to explore how they give meaning to this specific experience. DESIGN: A qualitative study of indepth interviews using interpretative phenomenological analysis. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Main meaning-making processes of participants experience. SETTINGS: Participants were recruited through two associations of people affected by meningitis and their family ascendants. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sampling of 11 women whose children or grandchildren were between 0.2 and 20 years old at the time of their meningitis diagnosis (M=4.06, SD=7.3). On average, 9.39 (SD=5.4) years had passed between the onset of illness and the interview. RESULTS: Six superordinate themes (meningitis disease; healthcare services and professionals; knowledge/ignorance; repercussions of the meningitis experience: life afterwards; sick child attitudes/behaviour; and sibling attitudes/behaviour) and two main meaning-making processes in relation to participants experience of meningitis were identified: (1) the sick child becoming a hero: comparison with other children; and (2) engaging action/attitude: finding the positive of the traumatic experience and engaging action to improve the care system. These two processes underpin the psychological adjustment to meningitis and its consequences. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a unique insight into close family members first-hand experience with acute bacterial meningitis. Findings highlighted factors characterising the disease experience, the psychological adjustment of meningitis survivors families and their meaning-making processes. These findings are important for research and clinical practice, demonstrating the multidimensional impact of the disease on family ascendants, their need for professional psychological support and the importance of direct involvement of parents in identifying key aspects of care.","output":"Familial experience of acute bacterial meningitis in children: a transversal qualitative study using interpretative phenomenological analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Residents in facilities such as nursing homes (NHs) are particularly vulnerable to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We carried out a survey between 25 March 2020 and 5 May 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All Italian nursing homes either public or providing services both privately and within the NHS were included in the study. An on-line questionnaire was sent to 3292 nursing homes across all Italian regions. Nursing homes were also contacted by telephone to provide assistance in completing the questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 1356 nursing homes voluntarily participated to the survey, hosting a total of 100,806 residents. Overall, 9154 residents died due to any cause from February 1 to the time when the questionnaire was completed (from March 25 to May 5). Of these, 7.4% had COVID-19 and 33.8% had flu-like symptoms, corresponding to a cumulative incidence of 0.7 and 3.1, respectively. Lack of personnel, difficulty in transferring patients to hospital or other facility, isolating residents with COVID-19, number of beds and geographical area were the main factor positively associated to the presence of COVID-19 in nursing homes.

Medical education presents an opportunity to influence physicians towards meeting the healthcare needs of underserved communities when establishing their practice. Understanding the impact of educational interventions designed to offset physician maldistribution is crucial to informing health human resource strategies aimed at ensuring that the disposition of the physician workforce best serves the diverse needs of all patients and communities. METHODS A scoping review was conducted using a six-stage framework to help map current evidence on educational interventions designed to influence physicians' decisions or intention to establish practice in underserved areas. A search strategy was developed and used to conduct database searches. Data were synthesized according to the types of interventions and the location in the medical education professional development trajectory, that influence physician intention or decision for rural and underserved practice locations. RESULTS There were 130 articles included in the review, categorized according to four categories: preferential admissions criteria, undergraduate training in underserved areas, postgraduate training in underserved areas, and financial incentives. A fifth category was constructed to reflect initiatives comprised of various combinations of these four interventions. Most studies demonstrated a positive impact on practice location, suggesting that selecting students from underserved or rural areas, requiring them to attend rural campuses, and/or participate in rural clerkships or rotations are influential in distributing physicians in underserved or rural locations. However, these studies may be confounded by various factors including rural origin, pre-existing interest in rural practice, and lifestyle. Articles also had various limitations including self-selection bias, and a lack of standard definition for underservedness. CONCLUSIONS Various educational interventions can influence physician practice location: preferential admissions criteria, rural experiences during undergraduate and postgraduate medical training, and financial incentives.

CRP, by activating the classical complement pathway and interacting with macrophages via Fc gamma receptors, can cause pulmonary inflammation with subsequent fibrosis. Recently, we have reported first-in-man CRP apheresis in a high-risk COVID-19 patient. Treatment was unfortunately clinically unsuccessful. Here, we report on successful CRP apheresis treatment in a lower-risk COVID-19 patient with respiratory failure. CASE REPORT: A 39-year-old male patient suffering from fatigue, dyspnea, and fever for 4 days was referred to us. The patient had to be intubated. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of a throat smear revealed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mutation analysis revealed the VOC B. 1.1.7 variant. CRP levels were 79.2 mg/L and increased to 161.63 mg/L. Procalcitonin (PCT) levels were continuously normal (<0.5 ng/ml). Antibiotic therapy was started to avoid bacterial superinfection. CRP apheresis was performed once via central venous access. CRP levels declined from a maximum of 161.63 mg/L to 32.58 mg/L. No apheresis-associated adverse effects were observed. Subsequently, CRP plasma levels declined day by day and normalized on day 5. The patient was extubated on day 5 and discharged from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on day 6. A second low CRP peak (maximum 22.41 mg/L) on day 7 remained clinically inapparent. The patient was discharged in good clinical condition with a CRP level of 6.94 mg/L on day 8.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of a laboratory modified CDCbased SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 assay across a range of sample types. Study Design We compared the matrix effect on the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection by qRT-PCR in nasal swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), sputum, plasma, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), stool, VTM, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Initial limits of detection (LoD) were subsequently narrowed to confirm an LoD for each specimen type and target gene. RESULTS: LoDs were established using a modified CDC-based laboratory developed test and ranged from a mean CT cut-off of 33.8-35.7 (10-20 copies/reaction) for the N1 gene target, and 34.0-36.2 (1-10 copies/reaction) for N2.

Although the intermediate duration of action of lidocaine and mepivacaine appears to be more suitable for day-case surgery, their use is not deemed appropriate by many because of a high incidence of transient neurologic symptoms (TNSs). The present review summarizes recent clinical data on the intrathecal use of alternative local anesthetics and adjuvants that may offer valuable alternatives to general anesthesia in day-case surgery. RECENT FINDINGS Prilocaine has a similar intrathecal pharmacokinetic profile as lidocaine but with a significantly lower risk of TNSs. Onset of spinal after 2-chloroprocaine is comparable with lidocaine or prilocaine, but with a considerably shorter duration of action. Also, TNS is clearly less frequent compared with lidocaine. Although its intrathecal use has recently been approved in Europe, this is still considered to be off-label in the USA. Articaine provides an extraordinary fast onset and a short duration of spinal block, the latter being approximately intermediate between chloroprocaine and prilocaine. However, articaine is associated with a high risk for intraoperative hypotension and a small risk for TNS, albeit but less frequent than after lidocaine. Concerns regarding possible neurotoxicity of articaine remain to be resolved. SUMMARY SPA for day cases might become a most valuable method for ambulatory surgery when using short acting local anesthetics.

While people of all ages are affected in some way by the pandemic, older persons have been far more likely to suffer the most severe health consequences. For this reason, how people have responded to mitigating behaviors to COVID-19 may differ by age. Using a nationally representative sample from the longitudinal data of the Understanding America Study (UAS), we examined differentials in behavioral responses to COVID-19 by age and how they changed over the first three months of the pandemic. Behavioral responses and changes in behavior over time differed by age, type of behaviors and time reference. At the beginning of the pandemic (March, 2020), older and younger people were similar in their likelihood of engaging in preventive personal behaviors when controlling for other influences. As the pandemic progressed, however, older people adopted mitigating personal behavioral changes more than younger people, such that about 1C2 months after the pandemic started, older people were more likely to comply with suggested behaviors and regulations including practicing better hygiene, quarantining, and social distancing. One month into the pandemic, older people were less likely than younger people to engage in two of four risky behaviors. The change in risky behavior over time did not differ by age; but both younger and older people were more likely to engage in risky behaviors after two months. Being female, a member of a racial/ethnic minority group, higher socioeconomic status, having more COVID-19 cases in ones state of residence, a higher perceived risk for infection and dying, and a more left-leaning political orientation were related to adopting more pandemic mitigating behaviors.","output":"How does age affect personal and social reactions to COVID-19: Results from the national Understanding America Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), a receptor on T cells, and its ligand, PD-L1, have been a topic of much interest in cancer research. Both tumour and virus-infected cells can upregulate PD-L1 to suppress cytotoxic T-cell killing. Research on the PD-1/PD-L1 axis has led to the development of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) as promising cancer therapies. Although effective in some cancer patients, for many, this form of treatment is ineffective due to a lack of immunogenicity in the tumour microenvironment (TME). Despite the development of therapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, the mechanisms and pathways through which these proteins are regulated are not completely understood. In this review, we discuss the latest research on molecules of inflammation and innate immunity that regulate PD-L1 expression, how its expression is regulated during viral infection, and how it is modulated by different cancer therapies. We also highlight existing research on the development of different combination therapies with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies. This information can be used to develop better cancer immunotherapies that take into consideration the pathways involved in the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, so these molecules do not reduce their efficacy, which is currently seen with some cancer therapies. This review will also assist in understanding how the TME changes during treatment, which will provide further rationale for combination therapies.","output":"Mechanisms of PD-L1 Regulation in Malignant and Virus-Infected Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE Although use of oral anticoagulants (OACs) is increasing, there is a substantial lack of data on how to treat OAC-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). OBJECTIVE To assess the association of anticoagulation reversal and blood pressure (BP) with hematoma enlargement and the effects of OAC resumption. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study at 19 German tertiary care centers (2006-2012) including 1176 individuals for analysis of long-term functional outcome, 853 for analysis of hematoma enlargement, and 719 for analysis of OAC resumption. EXPOSURES Reversal of anticoagulation during acute phase, systolic BP at 4 hours, and reinitiation of OAC for long-term treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Frequency of hematoma enlargement in relation to international normalized ratio (INR) and BP. Incidence analysis of ischemic and hemorrhagic events with or without OAC resumption. Factors associated with favorable (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-3) vs unfavorable functional outcome. RESULTS Hemorrhage enlargement occurred in 307 of 853 patients (36.0%). Reduced rates of hematoma enlargement were associated with reversal of INR levels <1.3 within 4 hours after admission (43/217 [19.8%]) vs INR of 1.3 (264/636 [41.5%]; P < .001) and systolic BP <160 mm Hg at 4 hours (167/504 [33.1%]) vs 160 mm Hg (98/187 [52.4%]; P < .001). The combination of INR reversal <1.3 within 4 hours and systolic BP of <160 mm Hg at 4 hours was associated with lower rates of hematoma enlargement (35/193 [18.1%] vs 220/498 [44.2%] not achieving these values; OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.19-0.42; P < .001) and lower rates of in-hospital mortality (26/193 [13.5%] vs 103/498 [20.7%]; OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.37-0.95; P = .03). OAC was resumed in 172 of 719 survivors (23.9%). OAC resumption showed fewer ischemic complications (OAC: 9/172 [5.2%] vs no OAC: 82/547 [15.0%]; P < .001) and not significantly different hemorrhagic complications (OAC: 14/172 [8.1%] vs no OAC: 36/547 [6.6%]; P = .48). Propensity-matched survival analysis in patients with atrial fibrillation who restarted OAC showed a decreased HR of 0.258 (95% CI, 0.125-0.534; P < .001) for long-term mortality. Functional long-term outcome was unfavorable in 786 of 1083 patients (72.6%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with OAC-associated ICH, reversal of INR <1.3 within 4 hours and systolic BP <160 mm Hg at 4 hours were associated with lower rates of hematoma enlargement, and resumption of OAC therapy was associated with lower risk of ischemic events.

Thus, this paper is devoted to design and implement a prototype of wireless medical robot (MR) that can communicate between patients and medical consultants. The prototype includes the modelling of a four-wheeled MR using systems' identification methodology, from which the model is utilized in control design and analysis. The required controller is designed using the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and Fuzzy logic (FLC) techniques. The MR is equipped onboard with some medical sensors and a camera to acquire vital signs and physical parameters of patients. The MR model is obtained via an experimental test with input/output signals in open-loop configuration as singleCinputCsingleCoutput from which the estimation and validation results demonstrate that the identified model possess about 89% of the output variation/dynamics. This model is used for controllers' design with PID and FLC, the response of which is good for heading angle tracking. Concerning the medical measurements, more than two thousand real recorded Photo-plethysmography (PPG) signals and Blood Pressure (BP) are used to find the appropriate BP estimation model. Towards this objective, some experiments are designed and conducted to measure the PPG signal.

OliveNet? is an active directory of phytochemicals obtained from different parts of the olive tree, Olea europaea (Oleaceae). Olive oil, olive fruits containing phenolics, known for their health benefits, are indispensable in the Mediterranean and Arabian diets. Secoiridoids is the largest group of olive phenols and is exclusive to the olive fruits. Functional food like olive fruits could help prevent and alleviate viral disease at an affordable cost. A systematized virtual search of 932 conformers of 78 secoiridoids utilizing Autodock Vina, followed by precision docking using Idock and Smina indicated that Nzhenide oleoside (NZO), Oleuropein dimer (OED), and Dihydro oleuropein (DHO) blocked the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-ACE-2 interface; Demethyloleuropein (DMO), Neo-nzhenide (NNZ), and Nzhenide (NZE) blocked the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the NZO-S-protein-ACE-2 complex by Desmond revealed stability during 50 ns. RMSD of the NZO-S-protein-ACE-2 complex converged at 2.1 ? after 20 ns. During MD, the interaction fractions confirmed multiple interactions of NZO with Lys417, a crucial residue for inhibition of S protein. MD of DMO-M(pro) complex proved its stability as the RMSD converged at 1.6 ?. Analysis of interactions during MD confirmed the interaction of Cys145 of M(pro) with DMO and, thus, its inhibition. The docking predicted IC(50) of NZO and DMO was 11.58 and 6.44 M, respectively. Molecular docking and dynamics of inhibition of the S protein and M(pro) by NZO and DMO correlated well. Docking of the six-hit secoiridoids to IL1R, IL6R, and TNFR1, the receptors of inflammatory cytokines IL1, IL6, and TNF, revealed the anti-inflammatory potential except for DHO. Due to intricate structures, the secoiridoids violated Lipinski's rule of five. However, the drug scores of secoiridoids supported their use as drugs. The ADMET predictions implied that the secoiridoids are non-toxic and pose low oral absorption.

AIM: To investigate the burden, spectrum, risk factors, and impact of paediatric HCAI by prospective clinical surveillance at a South African referral hospital. METHODS: Continuous prospective clinical and laboratory HCAI surveillance using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) definitions was conducted at Tygerberg Children's Hospital, South Africa, from May 1(st) to October 31(st) in 2014 and 2015. Risk factors for HCAI and associated mortality were analysed with multivariate logistic regression; excess length of stay was estimated using a confounder and time-matching approach. FINDINGS: HCAI incidence density was 31.1 per 1000 patient-days (95% CI: 28.2C34.2); hospital-acquired pneumonia (185/417; 44%), urinary tract infection (UTI) (45/417; 11%), bloodstream infection (BSI) (41/417; 10%), and surgical site infection (21/417; 5%) predominated. Device-associated HCAI incidence in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) was high: 15.9, 12.9 and 16 per 1000 device-days for ventilator-associated pneumonia, central line-associated BSI and catheter-associated UTI, respectively. HCAI was significantly associated with PICU stay (odds ratio: 2.0), malnutrition (1.6), HIV infection (1.7), HIV exposure (1.6), McCabe score fatal (2.0), comorbidities (1.6), indwelling devices (1.9), blood transfusion (2.5), and transfer in (1.4). Two-thirds of paediatric deaths were HCAI-associated, occurring at a median of four days from HCAI onset with significantly higher crude mortality for HCAI-affected vs HCAI-unaffected hospitalizations [24/325 (7.4%) vs 12/1022 (1.2%); P < 0.001]. HCAI resulted in US$371,887 direct costs with an additional 2275 hospitalization days, 2365 antimicrobial days, and 3575 laboratory investigations.

OBJECTIVES We sought to investigate the role of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells cellular senescence in initiation and/or progression of pulmonary fibrosis and therapeutic potential of targeting senescence related pathways and senescent cells. METHODS Epithelial cells of 9 control donor proximal and distal lung tissues and 11 IPF fibrotic lung tissues were profiled by single cell RNAseq to assesses the contribution of epithelial cells to the senescent cell fraction for IPF. A novel mouse model of conditional AT2 cell senescence was generated to study role of cellular senescence in pulmonary fibrosis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We show that alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells isolated from IPF lung tissue exhibit characteristic transcriptomic features of cellular senescence. We used conditional loss of Sin3a in adult mouse AT2 cells to initiate a program of p53-dependent cellular senescence, AT2 cell depletion, and spontaneous, progressive pulmonary fibrosis. We establish that senescence rather than loss of AT2 cells promotes progressive fibrosis and show that either genetic or pharmacologic interventions targeting p53 activation or senescence block fibrogenesis. CONCLUSIONS Senescence of AT2 cells is sufficient to drive progressive pulmonary fibrosis.

COVID-19 should be regarded as a systemic disease involving multiple systems. COVID-19 is associated with excessive inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, blood coagulation activation and fibrin formation. The development of a screening algorithm for the evaluation of endothelial and blood coagulation activation is an urgent need for the optimisation of the management of the patients with severe COVID-19. To this aim biomarkers of endothelial cell activation and hypercoagulability have central place Aim: The prospective observational monocentric cohort study ROADMAP-COVID-19 study aimed to evaluate the biomarkers of hypercoagulability and endothelial cell activation which they could be used in the development of a screening algorithm in patients with COVID-19 Methods: The ROADMAP-COVID-19 study enrolled 90 consecutive patients hospitalized at Tenon University Hospital (AP-HP, Paris) between March 18th and April 30th, 2020 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the ICU with clinically deteriorated severe COVID-19 (ICU- group). Patients were assessed upon the first day to the ICU admission. The control group consisted 30 healthy individuals (C-group). All patients and controls were evaluated for, clotting times (PT and aPTT), fibrinogen, D-Dimers, antithrombin (AT), protein C (PC) and protein S (Ps) activity, clotting factors V (FV), VIII (FVIII) and XII (FXII), high molecular weight kininogen (HK), von Willebrand factor (FvW), thrombin generation assay (TG) using TF 20 pM-PPP-Reagent? (Thrombogram-Thrombinoscope from Stago), fibrin monomers (FM), free TFPI and TF activity, thrombomodulin activity (TM), TF expressing microparticles (the ratio TF/TFPI was also calculated) and Heparanase. The IL-6 levels were also measured. All patients hospitalized in conventional medical department or in ICU routinely received thromboprophylaxis with body weight adapted enoxaparin. The ratio of the mean values of each studied biomarker in the ICU and the C-group was calculated. Biomarkers were classified in four clusters (Decrease, Stable, Slight Increase, Moderate Increase and High Increase). Results :The ICU-group consisted of 102 patients; 87% of these patients were admitted to the ICU directly from the emergency department. Males were 76 out of 102 patients. Age ranged from 30 to 93 years in the W-group. The changes of the biomarkers in patients with COVID-19 admitted at the ICU as compared to healthy individuals with are shown in Table 1. The ICU patients with COVID-19 were characterized by marked increase of IL-6 followed by increase of heparanase and D-dimers. The PPL-ct showed the most important decrease. Patients showed a significant decrease in FXII levels which was associated with a moderate increase of kininogen levels. The levels of the natural coagulation inhibitors as well as the clotting times (PT and aPTT) did not significantly modify in patients as compared to the controls. The rate of the propagation phase of thrombin generation (MRI) and the Peak of thrombin were significantly decrease and the lag-time was prolonged reflecting the antithrombotic effect of treatment with LMWH. Heparanse, free TFPI, and TM showed moderate or high increase. The decreased Ratio of TF/TFPI indicated that the free TFPI release dominated over the release of soluble TF activity. Conclusion: Patients with severe COVID-19 requiring ICU admission showed inhaled inflammatory reaction, hyperocoagulability and endothelial cell activation whereas platelet activation appeared to be secondary. Among the studied biomarkers the PPL-ct D-dimers and heparanase followed by TFPI, FvW, FM and TM levels appear to be mandatory for hypercoagulability of cellular origin. Interestingly patients with severe COVID-19 showed consumption of FXII indicating intrinsic clotting pathway activation and high levels of HK which also indicates endothelial cell activation. The clinical relevance of these biomarkers for early detection of hypercoagulability of cellular origin in patients with COVID-19 is being evaluated in prospective study.

METHODS: A total of 232 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor were enrolled in the study, retrospectively. The cross-sectional area, muscle index, and attenuation of erector spine muscle, pectoralis muscle, and total skeletal muscle were automatically measured on computed tomography images. The study population was assigned into tertiles on the basis of the total SMcsa index. The relationship between the values obtained and the length of hospital stay, admission to intensive care unit, the need for invasive mechani cal ventilation, and mortality was investigated. RESULTS: Admission to intensive care unit, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and mor tality were higher at tertile 3 groups than in the other groups (all P values <.001).

The eight-item adult version of the ELCSA was translated from English to Sinhala and Tamil. Cognitive testing (on 10 pregnant women and five local experts) and psychometric validation of the self-administered HFI tool were conducted among pregnant women (n = 269) attending the special clinics of the Rajarata Pregnancy Cohort (RaPCo) in Anuradhapura in February 2020. We assessed the psychometric properties and fit using a one parameter logistic model (Rasch model analysis) using STATA Version 14 and WINSTEP software Version 4.3.4. Concurrent validity was tested using psychological distress. The scale was internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.79) and had a good model fit (Rasch items infit statistic range: 0.85 to 1.07). Item 8 ('did not eat for the whole day') was removed from the model fit analysis, as it was not affirmed by respondent. Item severity scores ranged from -2.15 for 'not eating a diverse diet' to 4.43 for 'not eating during the whole day'.

However, details on this interaction remain incomplete. To provide further characterization, we undertook a retrospective observational cohort analysis of the majority of the hemodialysis and renal transplant population affected by the first regional outbreak of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Germany. In a region of 250,000 inhabitants we identified a total of 21 cases with SARS-CoV-2 among 100 KTX and 260 HD patients, that is, 7 KTX with COVID-19, 14 HD with COVID-19, and 3 HD with asymptomatic carrier status. As a first observation, KTX recipients exhibited trends for a higher mortality (43 vs 18%) and a higher proportion of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (57 vs 27%) when compared to their HD counterparts. As a novel finding, development of ARDS was significantly associated with the time spent on previous renal replacement therapy (RRT), defined as the composite of dialysis time and time on the transplant (non-ARDS 4.3 vs ARDS 10.6a??years, Pa??=a??.016). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed an OR of 1.7 per year of RRT. The association remained robust when analysis was confined to KTX patients (5.1 vs 13.2a??years, Pa??=a??.002) or when correlating the time spent on a renal transplant alone (Pa??=a??.038). Similarly, longer RRT correlated with death vs survival (Pa??=a??.0002). In conclusion our data suggest renal replacement vintage as a novel risk factor for COVID-19-associated ARDS and death. The findings should be validated by larger cohorts.","output":"Time on previous renal replacement therapy is associated with worse outcomes of COVID-19 in a regional cohort of kidney transplant and dialysis patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to enable online learning to continue developing when the COVID-19 pandemic passes, this study aimed to identify the critical factors that affected the use of e-learning by university students during the pandemic These critical factors will help to increase the efficiency of future development and deployment of online learning systems Through a literature review, this study employed the technology acceptance model, social support, and taskCtechnology fit as the theoretical basis to establish the framework of the online learning environment with regards to the technology acceptance model in the context of emergency management A questionnaire survey was administered to students in universities that had implemented online teaching during the pandemic, and 552 valid responses were collected The survey explored the factors affecting the willingness of higher education institution students to continue using online learning, and the following conclusions were drawn (1) The easier an online learning platform was to navigate, the better it was perceived by the students, and thus the students were more willing to use it (2) Ease of use and usefulness were associated with the teachers choice of platform and their ability to achieve a satisfactory fit between the course design and platform navigation, which thereby affected the students learning outcomes and attitude towards use (3) The positive attitude of teachers towards teaching increased the students perceived ease of use of online learning (4) During the pandemic, family supporta major support for teachers in online teachingenhanced teachers attitudes towards, and willingness to provide, online teaching A high level of support showed that the parents urged the students to learn and complete online learning tasks as instructed by the teachers, implying that family support could affect the students habits towards, adaptation to, and identification of online learning The study results provide insights into the factors affecting the willingness of teachers and students to continue using e-learning platforms","output":"Exploring the Critical Factors, the Online Learning Continuance Usage during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we report on the use of the NetLab remote laboratory located in Australia, accessed outside the country, including Sri Lanka, Poland, Singapore and Sweden and other tens of locations After a review of the current use and the development of NetLab, we concentrate on the overseas applications of the remote laboratory There is an increasing recognition by students using remote laboratories that their learning experience is comparable with working in real laboratories Remote laboratories enable working in a safe, an international, multicultural environment, becoming more and more important in the era of globalisation and coronavirus","output":"International Sharing of the Remote Laboratory NetLab"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The significance of bats as a source and carrier of viruses of emerging infectious diseases has been increasingly appreciated, and new data have been accumulated during recent year Bat-borne viruses, including rabies virus, other lyssaviruses, coronaviruses, henipaviruses, filoviruses, are among the most important of the emerging pathogens Bats are important reservoir of zoonotic viruses of different families, including SARS-CoV Nipah virus, Hendra virus and Ebola virus, and they have been identified as a source of pig-killing coronavirus SADS and PED in China Bats, carrying these agents, appear to be capable of limiting excessive or inappropriate virus-induced inflammation, which often leads to severe diseases in other animal species and also in humans Recently detected, highly divergent lyssaviruses and filoviruses in bats across the EU, may possess potential risk to human populations, because neither vaccines nor antiviral drugs against these viruses have been developed yet","output":"Bats as reservoir and vector of viruses pathogenic for humans and animals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The negative emotions induced by the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic are affecting people's health.

Study design A retrospective review to evaluate the use of a negative-pressure otolaryngology viral isolation drape (NOVID) system to reduce cross-infection through aerosol. The apparatus consists of a plastic drape suspended over the surgical field in the head and neck region with a smoke evacuator suction placed inside the chamber with an ultra-low penetrating air (ULPA) efficiency rating and a fluid suction high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter compartment. Spread of patient secretions and droplet formation was evaluated using 1% fluorescein dye in 10 ml of normal saline and ultraviolet light. The dye was applied topically in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx preoperatively and intraoperatively prior to the use of instruments such as micro-debrider, electrocautery and high-speed drilling. Following completion of the surgical procedure, an ultraviolet Wood's lamp was used to evaluate the presence of droplets on the surgical drapes and surgical gowns of the operating team. Results The study sample consisted of four patients who underwent endonasal endoscopic surgical procedures; two of these patients required concurrent endoscopic sinus surgery. A micro-debrider was used in three cases; electrocautery in three cases, while a high-speed drilling was employed in two cases. Presence of fluorescein was identified around the patients' nares; on the chest wipe and instrument tray in all four patients. Dye contamination was noted on the gauze placed over the smoke evacuator (two cases of skull base surgery); no fluid droplets were identified beyond the nares or the smoke evacuator (two cases of sinus surgery). However, fluid contamination was identified underneath barrier several centimetres away from the nares (one case of trans-sphenoidal surgery). Droplets were also identified on the surgeon's gown in the abdominal region in all cases and on the arm region in one case. In one case, droplets were also identified on the abdominal region of the nurse, but this was attributed to cross contamination from surgical gauze and instruments. Conclusions This retrospective study provides preliminary data on aerosol and droplet contamination during endonasal and transoral surgery performed under a negative pressure isolation drape system. Although the authors did not screen patients for SARS-CoV-2, they propose smoke evacuator ULPA filter attachment is appropriate to capture particles down to 0.1 microns including SARS-CoV-2 which is 0.125 microns. It would be helpful to see direct evidence to support this claim in future studies. The authors have not provided details regarding set-up time and training requirements for effective application of the isolation drape apparatus or the associated costs etc. It would have also been helpful if the authors could comment on any potential difficulties in undertaking the surgical procedure with the isolation system in place. The sample size is limited to four patients and variations in the magnitude and extent of aerosol contamination needs to be investigated further before drawing any conclusions. Although unlikely, this study design did not capture the presence of aerosol/droplets in the air within the operating room which may follow removal of the isolation drape system or from exposed surgical instruments. Notwithstanding the limitations of the design, negative-pressure aspiration of air under a chamber barrier is likely to minimise the contamination from aerosol and droplet during endonasal and transoral surgery.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): challenges and management of aerosol-generating procedures in dentistry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES.

DESIGN. Retrospective case series. SETTING. A regional hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS. Obstetric patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of Kwong Wah Hospital from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2010. RESULTS. From 2006 to 2010, there were 67 such patients admitted to the intensive care unit (0.23% of total maternities and 2.34% of total intensive care unit admission), which was a higher incidence than reported in two other local studies. As in the latter studies, the majority were admitted postpartum (n=65, 97%), with postpartum haemorrhage (n=39, 58%) being the commonest cause followed by pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (n=17, 25%). In the current study, significantly more patients had had elective caesarean sections for placenta praevia but fewer had had a hysterectomy. The duration of intensive care unit stay was shorter (mean, 1.8 days) with fewer invasive procedures performed than in the two previous studies, but maternal and neonatal mortality was similar (3% and 6%, respectively). CONCLUSION. Postpartum haemorrhage and pregnancy-induced hypertension were still the most common reasons for intensive care unit admission. There was an increasing trend of intensive care unit admissions following elective caesarean section for placenta praevia and for early aggressive intervention of pre-eclampsia. Maternal mortality remained low but had not decreased.

However, an optimized method for its detection in sewage has not yet been adequately investigated. Therefore, in this study, the efficient detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the solid fraction of wastewater was investigated using two quantitative PCR assays. In particular, wastewater samples were collected from a manhole located in the commercial district of a metropolitan region in Japan, where COVID-19 is highly prevalent, and two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The samples were concentrated using four separate methods, namely, electronegative membrane adsorption, polyethylene glycol precipitation, ultrafiltration, and solid precipitation. Each method revealed a significant concentration of pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) RNA, which is an indicator virus for wastewater. As expected, non-enveloped PMMoV RNA was enriched in the supernatant fraction such that relatively low concentrations were detected in the solid fraction of the wastewater samples. In contrast, higher SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were consistently detected in the solid fractions compared with the supernatant fractions based on the other methods that were investigated in this study. Spearman's correlation tests showed that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater samples from the WWTP were significantly correlated with the number of COVID-19 cases recorded during the data collection period.

This study aims to measure CDI prevalence before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in a local cohort of U.S. Veterans. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of all Veterans presenting to the South Texas Veterans Health Care System in San Antonio, Texas from Jan 1, 2019 to Apr 30, 2021. Monthly laboratory confirmed CDI events were collected overall and categorized as the following: hospital-onset, healthcare facility-associated (HO-HCFA-CDI), community-onset, healthcare facility-associated CDI (CO-HCFA-CDI), and community-associated CDI (CA-CDI). Monthly confirmed COVID-19 cases were also collected. CDI prevalence was calculated as CDI events per 10,000 bed days of care (BDOC) and was compared between pre-pandemic (Jan 2019-Feb 2020) and pandemic (Mar 2020-Apr 2021) periods. RESULTS: A total of 285 CDI events, 920 COVID-19 cases, and 104,220 BDOC were included in this study. The overall CDI rate increased from 20.33 per 10,000 BDOC pre-pandemic to 34.51 per 10,000 during the pandemic (p< 0.0001). This was driven primarily by a rise in CO-HCFA-CDI rates (0.95 vs 2.52 per 10,000 BDOC; p< 0.0001) during the pandemic, followed by increases in CA-CDI (15.58 vs. 18.61 per 10,000 BDOC; p< 0.0001) and HO-HCFA-CDI (2.66 vs. 5.43 per 10,000 BDOC; p< 0.0001). Lastly, CDI rates have tripled since the start of the pandemic (March-Apr 2020) compared to the current year (March-Apr 2021) (14.69 vs. 43.76 per 10,000 BDOC). CONCLUSION: Overall, CDI prevalence increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven mostly by an increase in CO-HCFA-CDI.

To fill this gap, we studied doseCresponse functions of TMS for modulation of visual processing. Our approach combined electroencephalography (EEG) with application of single pulse TMS to visual cortex as participants performed a motion perception task. During participants first visit, motion coherence thresholds, 64-channel visual evoked potentials (VEPs), and TMS resting motor thresholds (RMT) were measured. In second and third visits, single pulse TMS was delivered 30 ms before the onset of motion or at the onset latency of the N2 VEP component derived from the first session. TMS was delivered at 0%, 80%, 100%, or 120% of RMT over the site of N2 peak activity, or at 120% over vertex. Behavioral results demonstrated a significant main effect of TMS timing on accuracy, with better performance when TMS was applied at N2-Onset timing versus Pre-Onset, as well as a significant interaction, indicating that 80% intensity produced higher accuracy than other conditions. TMS effects on VEPs showed reduced amplitudes in the 80% Pre-Onset condition, an increase for the 120% N2-Onset condition, and monotonic amplitude scaling with stimulation intensity. The N2 component was not affected by TMS. These findings reveal doseCresponse relationships between intensity and timing of TMS on visual perception and electrophysiological brain activity, generally indicating greater facilitation at stimulation intensities below RMT.","output":"Dose-dependent enhancement of motion direction discrimination with transcranial magnetic stimulation of visual cortex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, nanoluminophores with potential-resolved multicolor electrochemiluminescence (PRMCECL) property emerge and show promising applications in sensitive, selective and accurate bioassays, bioimaging, and multicolor emitting devices. However, only limited PRMCECL nanoluminophores and their applications in ratiometric biosensors eliminating proportional errors have been reported. Herein, a novel PRMCECL nanoluminophore was synthesized by encapsulating CdS quantum dots (CdSQDs) into MOF-5 (CdSQDs@MOF-5). Using K2S2O8 as a coreactant, two electrochemiluminescence (ECL) peaks, ECL-1 centered at 685 nm and ECL-2 centered at 475 nm, were observed at -1.4 V and -1.8 V, respectively. Related ECL mechanisms have been proposed. Based on the potential-resolved ECL signals, a label-free differential ECL immunosensor for the determination of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was established by assembly of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride), CdSQDs@MOF-5 and cTnI antibody functionalized silver nanoparticles on the surface of fluorine doped tin oxide electrode subsequently. In the presence of cTnI, cTnI was captured by the sensing interface, leading to an increase in ECL-1 and ECL-2 intensity. cTnI could be determined in the range of 0.01 - 1000 pg/mL with a detection limit of 5.01 fg/mL by using intensity difference between ECL-1 and ECL-2. This work provides a new family member of PRMCECL nanoluminophores. The proposed label-free differential ECL immunosensor provides a new strategy based on potential-resolved ECL signals, which could effectively eliminate the additive error and show better sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy for the detection of cTnI than single-signal strategy and ratiometric strategy.","output":"Potential-Resolved Differential Electrochemiluminescence Immunosensor for Cardiac Troponin I Based on MOF-5 Wrapped CdS Quantum Dots Nanoluminophores"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic with increasing numbers of cases worldwide.

We collected 258 faecal specimens from nine provinces in China and detected the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 using real-time RTCPCR. Vero cells were used to isolate the virus from SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positive samples, after which sequencing of Spike gene in eight samples was performed.

From the perspective of clinical typing, the nucleic acid can be detected in the faeces of critical patients within two weeks and until four to five weeks in the faeces of severe and mild patients. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from stool specimens of two severe patients. Four non-synonymous mutations in Spike gene were newly detected in three stool samples.

SARS-CoV-2 variants have the potential to evade natural and vaccine-induced immunity. Methods In a longitudinal cohort study of healthcare workers (HCWs) in Oxfordshire, UK, we investigated the protection from symptomatic and asymptomatic PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection conferred by vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2, Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCOV-19) and prior infection (determined using anti-spike antibody status), using Poisson regression adjusted for age, sex, temporal changes in incidence and role. We estimated protection conferred after one versus two vaccinations and from infections with the B.1.1.7 variant identified using whole genome sequencing. Results 13,109 HCWs participated; 8285 received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (1407 two doses) and 2738 the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (49 two doses). Compared to unvaccinated seronegative HCWs, natural immunity and two vaccination doses provided similar protection against symptomatic infection: no HCW vaccinated twice had symptomatic infection, and incidence was 98% lower in seropositive HCWs (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.02 [95%CI <0.01-0.18]). Two vaccine doses or seropositivity reduced the incidence of any PCR-positive result with or without symptoms by 90% (0.10 [0.02-0.38]) and 85% (0.15 [0.08-0.26]) respectively. Single-dose vaccination reduced the incidence of symptomatic infection by 67% (0.33 [0.21-0.52]) and any PCR-positive result by 64% (0.36 [0.26-0.50]). There was no evidence of differences in immunity induced by natural infection and vaccination for infections with S-gene target failure and B.1.1.7.

We recently described a way to induce a potent SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T immune response through the generation of engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) emerging from muscle cells. This method relies on intramuscular injection of DNA vectors expressing different SARS-CoV-2 antigens fused at their N-terminus with Nefmut protein, i.e., a very efficient EV-anchoring protein. However, quality, tissue distribution, and efficacy of these SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells remained uninvestigated. To fill the gaps, antigen-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes induced by the immunization through the Nefmut-based method were characterized in terms of their polyfunctionality and localization at lung airways, i.e., the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that injection of vectors expressing Nefmut/S1 and Nefmut/N generated polyfunctional CD8+ T lymphocytes in both spleens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs). When immunized mice were infected with 4.4 lethal doses 50% of SARS-CoV-2, all S1-immunized mice succumbed, whereas those developing the highest percentages of N-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes resisted the lethal challenge. We also provide evidence that the N-specific immunization coupled with the development of antigen-specific CD8+ T-resident memory cells in lungs, supporting the idea that the Nefmut- based immunization can confer a long-lasting, lung-specific immune memory. In view of the limitations of current anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in terms of antibody waning and efficiency against variants, our CD8+ T cell-based platform could be considered for a new combination prophylactic strategy.","output":"Strong SARS-CoV-2 N-specific CD8+ T immunity induced by engineered extracellular vesicles associates with protection from lethal infection in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Although the number of people infected with COVID-19 has increased over time, its effects on workplace accidents are still poorly understood. On the one hand, COVID-19 can reduce workplace accidents through contracted economic activities or changes in work methods.

The main purpose of this paper is to examine how COVID-19 affected workplace accidents in Korea during the early part of the pandemic. (2) Methods: This paper utilizes the administrative data on workplace accidents in Korea collected by Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency. In particular, we use monthly data from February 2016 to August 2020. This period was chosen to rule out the effect from the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2015 and to include COVID-19 effects in 2020, given the available data. To examine the impact of COVID-19 on workplace injury and illness, we estimate fixed effects regression models, allowing us to control for group and time effects.

As many as 50% of patients reported having at least one comorbidities with COVID-19 upon hospital admission. Hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases are among the most commonly reported.

SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the worldwide pandemic which has been taking place in 2020, and is causing a markedly higher number of infections and deaths compared to previous coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Based on updated scientific literature, the present review compiles the most relevant knowledge of SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 and the clinical and typical responses that patients have exhibited against this virus, discussing current and future therapies, and proposing strategies with which to combat the disease and prevent a further global threat. The aggressiveness of SARS-CoV-2 arises from its capacity to infect, and spread easily and rapidly through its tight interaction with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor. While not all patients respond in a similar manner and may even be asymptomatic, a wide range of manifestations associated with COVID-19 have been described, particularly in vulnerable population groups, such as the elderly or individuals with other underlying conditions. The proper function of the immune system plays a key role in an individual's favorable response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A hyperactivated response, on the contrary, could account for the more severe cases of COVID-19, and this may finally lead to respiratory insufficiency and other complications, such as thrombotic or thromboembolic events.

The M protein harbors a higher substitution rate (0.6% correlated to its size) among viral open reading frames (ORFs) from published data. The four substitutions detected in the M protein, which cause non-synonymous changes, can be classified into three types.

Using this methodology, we found that a small number of clinical and cytokine expression variables are predictive of presenting COVID-19 disease severity, raising questions about the mechanism by which COVID-19 creates severe illness. The variables that were the most predictive of CSS included clinical variables such as age and abnormal chest x-ray as well as cytokines such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon-inducible protein 10, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a plethora of changes in cytokine profiles and that particularly in severely ill patients, these changes are consistent with the presence of macrophage activation syndrome and could furthermore be used as a biomarker to predict disease severity.","output":"Cytokine ranking via mutual information algorithm correlates cytokine profiles with presenting disease severity in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stroke remains one of the leading causes of disability in adults, and lower limb spasticity, affected stance, and balance impact everyday life and activities of such patients. Robotic therapy and assessment are becoming important tools to clinical evaluation for post-stroke rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to determine in a more objective manner the effects of visual feedback balance training through a balance trainer system and radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT), along with conventional physiotherapy, on lower limb post-stroke spasticity, trunk control, and static and dynamic balance through clinical and stabilometric assessment. The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. The experimental group underwent conventional physiotherapy, visual feedback balance training, and rESWT. The control group underwent conventional physiotherapy, visual feedback training and sham rESWT. The statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Software and MATLAB. Primary clinical outcome measures were The Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), passive range of motion (PROM), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and Clonus score. Secondary outcome measures were trunk performance, sensorimotor, and lower limb function. Stabilometric outcome measures were trunk control, static balance, and dynamic balance. Visual feedback training using the Prokin system and rESWT intervention, along with conventional physiotherapy, yielded statistically significant improvement both on clinical and stabilometric outcome measures, enhancing static and dynamic balance, trunk performance, sensorimotor outcome, and limb function and considerably diminishing lower limb spasticity, pain intensity, and clonus score in the experimental group.","output":"Effectiveness of Radial Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy and Visual Feedback Balance Training on Lower Limb Post-Stroke Spasticity, Trunk Performance, and Balance: A Randomized Controlled Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Large-scale vaccination is considered one of the most effective strategies to control the pandemic of COVID-19.

The samples were screened by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Blood and urine samples of suspected users (n = 9669) were analyzed for drugs of abuse during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and compared with their results (n = 8727) obtained just before the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of party drugs, such as MDMA and cocaine, and the classic illicit drug cannabis was significantly decreased and followed the same trend after complete lockdown was over. In contrast, methamphetamine use increased significantly during the lockdown period and continued after the lockdown. Interestingly, the number of tests that were positive for pregabalin as a misused licit drug increased, and this increase continued after the lockdown. The results showed a significant increase in drug abuse cases and changes in drug abuse trends, with an alteration toward more easily obtainable and lower-priced drugs.

Although the mechanisms underlying this link are not well established, a number of potential factors may be involved. Indeed, the obesity-related vulnerability to infectious diseases could be due to chronic low-grade inflammation, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia, which lead to a weakening of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition, obesity results in anatomical-functional changes by the mechanical obstacle of excessive adipose tissue that blunt the respiratory mechanisms and predisposing to respiratory infections. Subjects with obesity are also at risk of skin folds and sweat more profusely due to the thick layers of subcutaneous fat, favoring the proliferation of microorganisms and slowing the repair of wounds down. All these factors make subjects with obesity more prone to develop nosocomial infections, surgical site, skin and soft tissue infections, bacteremia, urinary tract infections, and mycosis. Furthermore, infections in subjects with obesity have a worse prognosis, frequently prolonging hospitalization time as demonstrated for several flu viruses and recently for COVID-19. Thus, the aim of this manuscript is to provide an overview of the current clinical evidence on the associations between obesity and infectious diseases highlighting physio pathological insights involved in this link.","output":"The impact of obesity on immune response to infection: Plausible mechanisms and outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The rapid development of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) into a pandemic required people to quickly acquire, evaluate, and apply novel complex health-related information about the virus and transmission risks. This study examined the potentially unique and synergistic roles of individual differences in neurocognition and health literacy in the early uptake and use of COVID-19 public health information.Method: Data were collected between April 23 and 21 May 2020, a period during which 42 out of 50 states were under a stay-at-home order. Participants were 217 healthy adults who completed a telephone-based battery that included standard tests of neurocognition, health literacy, verbal IQ, personality, and anxiety. Participants also completed measures of COVID-19 information-seeking skills, knowledge, prevention intentions, and prevention behaviors.Results: A series of hierarchical multiple regressions with data-driven covariates showed that neurocognition (viz, episodic verbal memory and executive functions) was independently related to COVID-19 knowledge (e.g. symptoms, risks) at a medium effect size, but not to information-seeking skills, prevention intentions, or prevention behaviors. Health literacy was independently related to all measured aspects of COVID-19 health information and did not interact with neurocognition in any COVID-19 health domain.Conclusions: Individual differences in neurocognition and health literacy played independent and meaningful roles in the initial acquisition of knowledge related to COVID-19, which is a novel human health condition. Future studies might examine whether neurocognitive supports (e.g. spaced retrieval practice, elaboration) can improve COVID-19-related knowledge and health behaviors in vulnerable populations.","output":"How did individual differences in neurocognition and health literacy influence the initial uptake and use of health-related information about COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Present day risk assessment on the spreading of airborne viruses is often based on the classical Wells-Riley model assuming immediate mixing of the aerosol into the studied environment.

In the present agent-based methodology, we study the viral aerosol inhalation exposure risk in two scenarios including a low/high risk scenario of a supermarket/bar. The model takes into account typical behavioral patterns for determining the rules of motion for the agents. We solve a diffusion model for aerosol concentration in the prescribed environments in order to account for local exposure to aerosol inhalation. We assess the infection risk using the Wells-Riley model formula using a space-time dependent aerosol concentration. The results are compared against the classical Wells-Riley model. The results indicate features that explain individual cases of high risk with repeated sampling of a heterogeneous environment occupied by non-equilibrium concentration clouds.

Baseline data come from the Norwegian Counties Public Health Survey (participation rate 46%, of which 59% took part in a COVID-19 follow-up study). RESULTS: Overall loneliness was stable or falling during the lockdown. However, some subgroups, single individuals and older women, reported slightly increased loneliness during lockdown. Interestingly, individuals with low social support and high levels of psychological distress and loneliness before the pandemic experienced decreasing loneliness during the pandemic.

A large part of this variation may be due to the ages of individuals who are tested and identified. OBJECTIVE: To measure the contribution of distortions from the age distributions of confirmed cases to CFRs within and across populations. DESIGN: Cross-sectional demographic study using aggregate data on COVID-19 cases and deaths by age. SETTING: Population-based data from China, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. PARTICIPANTS: All individuals with confirmed COVID-19, as reported by each country as of 19 April 2020 (N = 1 223 261). MEASUREMENTS: Age-specific COVID-19 CFRs and age-specific population shares by country. RESULTS: The overall observed CFR varies widely, with the highest rates in Italy (9.3%) and the Netherlands (7.4%) and the lowest rates in South Korea (1.6%) and Germany (0.7%). Adjustment for the age distribution of cases explains 66% of the variation of across countries, with a resulting age-standardized median CFR of 1.9%. Among a larger sample of 95 countries, the observed variation in COVID-19 CFRs is 13 times larger than what would be expected on the basis of just differences in the age-composition of countries. LIMITATION: The age-adjusted rates assume that, conditional on age, COVID-19 mortality among diagnosed cases is the same as that among undiagnosed cases and that individuals of all ages are equally susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. CONCLUSION: Selective testing and identifying of older cases considerably warps estimates of the lethality of COVID-19 within populations and comparisons across countries. Removing age distortions and focusing on differences in age-adjusted case fatality will be essential for accurately comparing countries' performance in caring for patients with COVID-19 and for monitoring the epidemic over time.

However, other research suggests that additional mechanisms like hyperventilation may contribute to the process. The goal of the present investigation was to examine the influences of cardiovascular and respiratory variables on vasovagal symptoms. METHODS This study was part of a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of behavioral techniques on the prevention of vasovagal reactions in blood donors. Data from the no-treatment control group were analyzed. The final sample was composed of 160 college and university students. Observational and self-report measures of symptoms were obtained. Physiological variables were measured mainly using respiratory capnometry. RESULTS While respiration rate remained stable throughout donation, change in end-tidal CO2 was associated with requiring treatment for a reaction during donation (OR = .57, 95% CI = .41-.79, p = .001) and self-reported symptoms measured in the post-donation period using the Blood Donation Reactions Inventory (=-.152, 95% CI= -.28- -.02, t=-2.32, p=.022). Individuals with higher levels of pre-donation anxiety displayed larger decreases in end-tidal CO2 throughout the procedure (F(2,236) = 3.64, p = .043, p = .030). BDRI scores were related to changes in systolic (=-.022, 95% CI= -.04- -.004, t=-2.39, p=.019) and diastolic blood pressure (=-.038, 95% CI= -.06- -.02, t=-4.03, p <.001).

Direct-acting antiviral treatment can result in a virologic cure in most persons with 8-12 weeks of all-oral medication regimens. This report augments (i.e., updates and summarizes) previously published recommendations from CDC regarding testing for HCV infection in the United States (Smith BD, Morgan RL, Beckett GA, et al.

The recommendation for HCV testing that remains unchanged is regardless of age or setting prevalence, all persons with risk factors should be tested for hepatitis C, with periodic testing while risk factors persist.

This paper was designed to investigate whether, and to what extent, the consumption of soft drinks and the prevalence of obesity are linked through feedback effects. METHODS: An ecological study design and a simultaneous equation model were used to investigate the existence of a vicious cycle between the consumption of soft drinks and the prevalence of obesity. The analysis was based on a longitudinal dataset covering per capita sales of soft drinks, the age-standardised prevalence rate of obesity and several demographic and socio-economic control variables in a sample of 98 countries worldwide for the period 2005C2019. RESULTS: Using a Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) regression model with fixed effects, we documented a self-reinforcing process that links consumption and obesity. Changes in the spread of obesity were associated with changes in soft drink consumption: a one-unit increase in the age-adjusted prevalence rate of obesity increased consumption by about 2.39 l per person per year. Similarly, as the consumption of soft drinks rose, so did the prevalence of obesity: the age-adjusted rate of obesity increased by 0.07% for every additional litre consumed per capita. Computing the impact multipliers, we found that the outcome of a one-unit decrease in the average price of soft drinks was twofold: a) the prevalence of obesity increased by around 0.17%; and b) consumption increased by around 2.40 l per person, the sum of the increase directly caused by the price reduction (2 l) and the increase due to the interplay between consumption and obesity (0.4 l). CONCLUSIONS: This study has identified a feedback loop between unhealthy habits (i.e. the consumption of soft drinks) and health outcomes (i.e. the prevalence of obesity). This interplay amplifies the impact of any exogenous changes in the determinants of consumption and obesity. These feedback effects should be considered and exploited in planning effective strategies to tackle the burden of obesity and the global epidemic of non-?communicable diseases.

We assessed mediation effects of similarity and credibility on acceptance in terms of attitudes and usage intentions. Results: Exposure to testimonials was associated with higher usage intentions (d=0.50) and more positive attitudes toward digi-MHSs (d=0.32) compared to mere information (aCG). Regarding source-related effects, one-way ANOVA showed group differences in intentions ( [Formula: see text] =0.13) that were significantly higher after exposure to testimonials targeted at students than in the other groups after adjusting for baseline intentions ( [Formula: see text] =0.24).

TRIAL DESIGN: Randomised, parallel 3-arm (1:1:1 ratio), open-label, Phase IV platform trial of immunomodulatory therapies in patients with late stage 1 or stage 2 COVID-19-related disease, with a diagnosis based either on a positive assay or high suspicion of COVID-19 infection by clinical and/or radiological assessment. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18 and over, with a clinical picture strongly suggestive of COVID-19-related disease (with/without a positive COVID-19 test) AND a Risk count (as defined below) >3 OR &#8805;3 if risk count includes \\"Radiographic severity score >3\\". A risk count is calculated by the following features on admission (1 point for each): radiographic severity score >3, male gender, non-white ethnicity, diabetes, hypertension, neutrophils >8.0 x109/L, age >40 years and CRP >40 mg/L. Patients should be considered an appropriate subject for intervention with immunomodulatory therapies in the opinion of the investigator and be able to be maintained on venous thromboembolism prophylaxis during the inpatient dosing period, according to local guidelines. The complete inclusion and exclusion criteria as detailed in the additional file 1 should be fulfilled. Patients will be enrolled prior to the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, cardiac or renal support. Participants will be recruited across multiple centres including initially at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, University Hospital of Wales, Gloucestershire Royal Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Each active comparator arm will be compared against standard of care (SoC). The immunomodulatory drugs were selected from a panel of licenced candidates by a drug evaluation committee, which considered potential efficacy, potential toxicity, scalability and novelty of each strategy. The initial active arms comprise baricitinib and ravulizumab. Baricitinib will be given 4 mg orally (once daily (OD)) on days 1-14 or until day of discharge. The dose will be reduced to 2 mg OD for patients aged > 75 years and those with an estimated Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance of 30-60 ml/min. Ravulizumab will be administered intravenously once according to the licensed weight-based dosing regimen (see Additional file 1). Each active arm will be compared with standard of care alone. No comparisons will be made between active arms in this platform trial. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the incidence (from baseline up to Day 14) of any one of the events (whichever comes first): death, invasive mechanical ventilation, extra corporeal membrane oxygenation, cardiovascular organ support (inotropes or balloon pump), or renal failure (estimated Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance <15ml/min). RANDOMISATION: Eligible patients will be randomised using a central web-based randomisation service (Sealed Envelope) in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by site to one of the treatment arms or SoC. BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label trial. Data analysis will not be blinded. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): There is no fixed sample size for this study. Serial interim analyses will be triggered by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), including analysis after 125 patients are recruited to each arm, 375 in total assuming 3 arms. Additional interim analyses are projected after 229 patients per arm, and potentially then after 469 per arm, but additional analyses may be triggered by the IDMC.

We present a COVID-19 prognostic algorithm implemented in real-time as a clinical decision support structure for symptomatic persons under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 in the emergency department (ED). Methods: : The training data included 1,469 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 14 days of acute care. The validation was done using a retrospective set of 414 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and a PUI set of 13,271 patients who had symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 test during acute care visit. We performed a real-time model assessment on 2,174 patients with an ED visit and symptomatic test or COVID-19 positive result. The logistic regression prognostic model used demographics, comorbidities, home medications, and vital signs factors. The COVID-19 severity outcome comprised a composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation (ventilator) use, and mortality. Results: : The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) was 0.87 (95%-CI: 0.83, 0.91) in the retrospective validation and 0.82 (95%-CI: 0.81, 0.83) in the PUI population for predicting COVID-19 severity. The model had an AUROC of 0.85 (95%-CI, 0.83, 0.87) in the real-time set. The rates of ICU admission, ventilator use, and death in patients with the lowest 20% of the scores were zero, significantly lower compared to those rates (20.6%, 9.5%, and 18.1%, respectively) for patients with the highest 20% of the scores in the real-time set.

Many admissions end in discharge against medical advice, which is associated with readmission and all-cause mortality. Opioid withdrawal contributes to premature discharge. We sought to understand the barriers to timely provision of opioid substitution therapy (OST), which helps to prevent opioid withdrawal, in acute hospitals in England. METHODS: We requested policies on substance dependence management from 135 National Health Service trusts, which manage acute hospitals in England, and conducted a document content analysis. Additionally, we reviewed an Omitted and Delayed Medicines Tool (ODMT), one resource used to inform critical medicine categorisation in England. We worked closely with people with lived experience of OST and/or illicit opioid use, informed by principles of community-based participatory research. RESULTS: Eighty-six (64%) trusts provided 101 relevant policies. An additional 44 (33%) responded but could not provide relevant policies, and five (4%) did not send a definitive response. Policies illustrate procedural barriers to OST provision, including inconsistent application of national guidelines across trusts. Continuing community OST prescriptions for people admitted in the evening, night-time, or weekend was often precluded by requirements to confirm doses with organisations that were closed during these hours. 42/101 trusts (42%) required or recommended a urine drug test positive for OST medications or opioids prior to OST prescription. The language used in many policies was stigmatising and characterised people who use drugs as untrustworthy. OST was not specifically mentioned in the reviewed ODMT, with drugs used in substance dependence collectively categorised as posing low risk if delayed and moderate risk if omitted. CONCLUSIONS: Many hospitals in England have policies that likely prevent timely and effective OST. This was underpinned by the low-risk categorisation of OST delay in the ODMT. Delays to continuity of OST between community and hospital settings may contribute to inpatient opioid withdrawal and increase the risk of discharge against medical advice. Acute hospitals in England require standardised best practice policies that account for the needs of this patient group.

In the present study, 35 % of households from the UHNS-2019 cohort were randomly selected for repeat interviews, 1 year after the baseline study and 6 months after COVID-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka. Height/length and weight of children and women were re-measured, household food insecurity was reassessed, and associated factors were gathered through interviewer-administered questionnaires. Differences in measurements at baseline and follow-up studies were compared. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 207 households, comprising 127 women and 109 children were included. RESULTS: The current prevalence of children with wasting and overweight was higher in the follow-up study than at baseline UHNS-2019 (183 % v. 137 %; P = 026 and 83 % v. 37 %; P = 012, respectively). There was a decrease in prevalence of child stunting (147 % v. 119 %; P = 037). A change was not observed in overall obesity in women, which was about 307 %. Repeated lockdown was associated with a significant reduction in food security from 57 % in UHNS-2019 to 30 % in the current study (P < 0001).

We aimed to develop a risk score to identify patients with increased risk of COVID-19, allowing proper identification and allocation of limited resources. A retrospective study was conducted of 338 patients who were admitted to the hospital from the emergency room to regular floors and tested for COVID-19 at an acute care hospital in the Metropolitan Washington D.C. area. The dataset was split into development and validation sets with a ratio of 6:4. Demographics, presenting symptoms, sick contact, triage vital signs, initial laboratory and chest X-ray results were analysed to develop a prediction model for COVID-19 diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression was performed in a stepwise fashion to develop a prediction model, and a scoring system was created based on the coefficients of the final model. Among 338 patients admitted to the hospital from the emergency room, 136 (40.2%) patients tested positive for COVID-19 and 202 (59.8%) patients tested negative. Sick contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case (3 points), nursing facility residence (3 points), constitutional symptom (1 point), respiratory symptom (1 point), gastrointestinal symptom (1 point), obesity (1 point), hypoxia at triage (1 point) and leucocytosis (?1 point) were included in the prediction score.

Host genetic variation is likely to contribute to ID risk and downstream clinical outcomes, but there is a need for a genetics-anchored framework to decipher molecular mechanisms of disease risk, infer causal effect on potential complications, and identify instruments for drug target discovery. Here we perform transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) of 35 clinical ID traits in a cohort of 23,294 individuals, identifying 70 gene-level associations with 26 ID traits. Replication in two large-scale biobanks provides additional support for the identified associations. A phenome-scale scan of the 70 gene-level associations across hematologic, respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurologic traits proposes a molecular basis for known complications of the ID traits. Using Mendelian Randomization, we then provide causal support for the effect of the ID traits on adverse outcomes. The rich resource of genetic information linked to serologic tests and pathogen cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum, sinus/nasopharyngeal, tracheal, and blood samples (up to 7,699 positive pathogen cultures across 92 unique genera) that we leverage provides a platform to interrogate the genetic basis of compartment-specific infection and colonization. To accelerate insights into cellular mechanisms, we develop a TWAS repository of gene-level associations in a broad collection of human tissues with 79 pathogen-exposure induced cellular phenotypes as a discovery and replication platform. Cellular phenotypes of infection by 8 pathogens included pathogen invasion, intercellular spread, cytokine production, and pyroptosis.

We have reviewed the pharmacological properties of this natural product which displays anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperglycemic and anti-cancer properties. The pharmacological activities essentially derive from the capacity of DMC to interact with the protein targets HMGB1 and AMPK. Upon binding to HMGB1, DMC inhibits the nucleocytoplasmic transfer of the protein and its extracellular secretion, thereby blocking its alarmin function. DMC also binds to the AMP site of AMPK to activate phospho-AMPK and then to trigger downstream signals leading to the anti-inflammatory and anti-hyperglycemic effects. AMPK activation by DMC reinforces inhibition of HMGB1, to further reduce the release of the alarmin protein, likely contributing to the anticancer effects. The characterization of a tight control of DMC over the AMPK-HMGB1 axis not only helps to explain the known activities of DMC but also suggests opportunities to use this chalcone to treat other pathological conditions such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (which affects patients with COVID-19).

Since elevated von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII (FVIII) levels have been described as acute phase reactants that may indicate endothelial dysfunction and inflammation in different settings, including chronic autoimmune diseases, they could serve as potential candidate biomarkers of cGvHD. In this review we focused on reported data regarding VWF and FVIII as well as other markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, evaluating their potential role in cGvHD.","output":"Von Willebrand Factor, Factor VIII, and Other Acute Phase Reactants as Biomarkers of Inflammation and Endothelial Dysfunction in Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory viruses have sometimes resulted in worldwide pandemics, with the influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) being major participants.

However, this association can be affected by many correlates of these traits. Due to its large impact on human health, socioeconomic status (SES) could at least partially influence the association between obesity and COVID-19 severity. To estimate the independent effect of traits related to body size and SES on the clinical manifestations of COVID-19, we conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study analyzing the effect of obesity-related anthropometric traits on COVID-19 outcomes. Methods Applying two-sample MR approaches, we evaluated the effects of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference, (HIP) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) studied in up to 234,069 participants from the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium with respect to three COVID-19 outcomes: severe respiratory COVID-19 (5,101 cases vs. 1,383,241 controls), hospitalized COVID-19 (9,986 cases vs. 1,877,672 controls), and COVID-19 infection (38,984 cases vs. 1,644,784 controls) obtained from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI). Finally, to test the effect of SES using multivariable MR methods, we analyzed genetic data related to self-reported household income (HI) information from 286,301 UK Biobank (UKB) participants. Results BMI and WC were associated with severe respiratory COVID-19 (BMI: OR = 1.68 p = 0.0004; WC: OR = 1.72, p = 0.007) and COVID-19 hospitalization (BMI: OR= 1.62, p = 1.35e-06; WC: OR = 1.62, p = 0.0001). Also, HIP influenced hospitalized COVID-19 (OR = 1.31, p = 0.012) and COVID-19 infection (OR = 1.18, p = 0.002). Conversely, HI was associated with lower odds of severe respiratory COVID-19 (OR = 0.57, p = 0.011) and hospitalized COVID-19 (OR = 0.71, p = 0.045). Testing these effects in multivariable MR models, we observed that the effect of these obesity-related anthropometric traits on COVID-19 outcomes is not independent of SES effect assessed as HI.

This phenomenon could be explained by the overexpression of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) on epithelial cell surfaces of the respiratory tract. Indeed, ACE-2 is a receptor for coronaviruses including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV), and ACE-2 is overexpressed under chronic exposure to air pollution such as NO(2) and PM(2.5). In this review, we explain that ACE-2 acts as the sole receptor for the attachment of the SARS-CoV-2 via its spike protein. The fact that respiratory and vascular epithelial cells express ACE-2 has been previously observed during the 2003 epidemic of the SARS-CoV-1 in China, and during the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome in Saudi Arabia. High ACE-2 expression in respiratory epithelial cells under air pollution explains the positive correlation between the severity in COVID-19 patients and elevated air pollution, notably high NO(2) and PM(2.5) levels. Specific areas in India, China, Italy, Russia, Chile and Qatar that experience heavy air pollution also show high rates of COVID-19 infection and severity. Overall, we demonstrate a link between NO(2) emissions, PM(2.5) levels, ACE-2 expression and COVID-19 infection severity.

The stem-loop 2 motif (s2m) is one such element with an unusually high degree of sequence conservation, being found in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) in the genomes of many astroviruses, some picornaviruses and noroviruses, and a variety of coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2. The evolutionary conservation and its occurrence in all viral subgenomic transcripts imply a key role for s2m in the viral infection cycle. Our findings indicate that the element, while stably folded, can nonetheless be invaded and remodeled spontaneously by antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that initiate pairing in exposed loops and trigger efficient sequence-specific RNA cleavage in reporter assays. ASOs also act to inhibit replication in an astrovirus replicon model system in a sequence-specific, dose-dependent manner and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture. Our results thus permit us to suggest that the s2m element is readily targeted by ASOs, which show promise as antiviral agents. IMPORTANCE The highly conserved stem-loop 2 motif (s2m) is found in the genomes of many RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: We exposed infant mice to C. leptum (fed-CL) and then induced asthma using the allergen ovalbumin (OVA). RESULTS: Fed-CL increased regulatory T (Treg) cells in cesarean-delivered mice compared with vaginally delivered mice. Compared with OVA-exposed mice, mice exposed to C. leptum + OVA did not develop the typical asthma phenotype, which includes airway hyper-responsiveness, cell infiltration, and T helper cell subset (Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17) inflammation. Early-life C. leptum exposure induced an immunosuppressive environment in the lung concurrent with increased Treg cells, resulting in the inhibition of Th1, Th2, Th9, and Th17 cell responses.

This study aimed to describe the clinical outcomes and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCW. METHODS: Three databases were surveyed and 328 articles were identified. Of these, 225 articles did not meet inclusion criteria; therefore, 97 full-text article were reviewed. Finally, after further revision, 30 articles were included in the systematic review and 28 were used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were identified involving 119,883 patients. The mean age of the patients was 38.37 years (95% CI 36.72-40.03) and males comprised 21.4% (95% CI 12.4-34.2) of the population of HCW. The percentage of HCW who tested positive for COVID-19 was 51.7% (95% CI 34.7-68.2). The total prevalence of comorbidities in seven studies was 18.4% (95% CI 15.5-21.7). The most prevalent symptoms were fever 27.5% (95% CI 17.6-40.3) and cough 26.1% (95% CI 18.1-36). The prevalence of hospitalisation was 15.1% (95% CI 5.6-35) in 13 studies and of death was 1.5% (95% CI 0.5-3.9) in 12 studies. Comparisons of HCW with and without infection showed an increased relative risk for COVID-19 related to personal protective equipment, workplace setting, profession, exposure, contacts, and testing. CONCLUSION: A significant number of HCW were reported to be infected with COVID-19 during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a prevalence of hospitalisation of 15.1% and mortality of 1.5%.

A meta-analysis of LMCo cases could fill the knowledge gaps in this topic. METHODS Electronic databases were searched for all LMCo/PAH studies, abstracts and case reports including pulmonary artery (PA) size. Restricted maximum likelihood meta-analysis was used to evaluate LMCo-associated factors. Specificity, sensitivity and accuracy of PA size thresholds for diagnosis of LMCo were calculated. Treatment options and outcomes were summarized. RESULTS A total of five case-control cohorts and 64 case reports/series (196 LMCo and 438 controls) were included. LMCo cases had higher PA diameter (Hedge's g 1.46 [1.09; 1.82]), PA/aorta ratio (Hedge's g 1.1 [0.64; 1.55]) and probability of CHD (log odds-ratio 1.22 [0.54; 1.9]) compared to non-LMCo, but not PA pressure or vascular resistance. A 40 mm cut-off for the PA diameter had balanced sensitivity (80.5%), specificity (79%) and accuracy (79.7%) for LMCo diagnosis, while a value of 44 mm had higher accuracy (81.7%), higher specificity (91.5%) but lower sensitivity (71.9%). Pooled mortality after non-conservative treatment (n = 150, predominantly stenting) was 2.7% at up to 22 months of mean follow-up, with 83% survivors having no angina at follow-up. CONCLUSION PA diameter, PA/aorta ratio and CHD are associated with LMCo, while hemodynamic parameters are not. Data from this study support that a PA diameter cut-off between 40 and 44 mm can offer optimal accuracy for LMCo screening.

To the best of our knowledge, since the introduction of HBV vaccination, there have been limited data for vaccine response to HBV and its impact on early childhood HBV infections among children HIV exposed but uninfected in Botswana. AIMS: To determine the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV vaccine response in 18 months old children HIV exposed but uninfected in Botswana. METHODS: Stored plasma samples from 304 children at 18 months of age and 287 mothers from delivery were tested for HBsAg. Mothers with positive HBsAg had HBV DNA level tested, and their HBV genotypes were determined by amplifying a 415-base pair (bp) region of the surface gene. Plasma samples from children exposed to HIV were tested for hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) titers. RESULTS: No children (0 of 304) were positive for HBsAg at 18 months while 5 (1.74%) of 287 HIV-positive mothers were HBsAg positive. Four of the HBsAg positive mothers were infected with genotype A1, while 1 was infected with genotype E. The median anti-HBs titer in children was 174 mIU/mL [QR: 70, 457]. Three (1.1%) of 269 children had an inadequate vaccine response (<10 mIU/mL), while 266 (98.9%) of 269 had protective immunity. However, when using the &#8805;100mIU/mL threshold, only 170 (63.2%) of 269 children had complete protection.

The study was conducted during the influenza H1N1 2009 pandemic and included 801 migrant participants living in border areas thought to be high risk by the Thailand Ministry of Public Health. Data were collected by Migrant Community Health Workers using a 201-item interviewer-assisted questionnaire. Univariate descriptive analyses were conducted. RESULTS: With the exception of border measures, to which nearly all participants reported they would be adherent, attitudes towards recommended NPIs were generally negative or uncertain. Other potential barriers to NPI implementation include limited experience applying these interventions (e.g., using a thermometer, wearing a face mask) and inadequate hand washing and household disinfection practices. CONCLUSIONS: Negative or ambivalent attitudes towards NPIs combined with other barriers identified suggest that vulnerable migrants in Thailand have a limited capacity to participate in pandemic preparedness efforts. This limited capacity likely puts migrants at risk of propagating the spread of a pandemic virus. Coordinated risk communication and public education are potential strategies that may reduce barriers to individual NPI implementation.","output":"Pandemic preparedness: perceptions of vulnerable migrants in Thailand towards WHO-recommended non-pharmaceutical interventions: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Healthcare systems globally were shocked by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Policies put in place to curb the tide of the pandemic resulted in a decrease of patient volumes throughout the ambulatory system The future implications of COVID-19 in healthcare are still unknown, specifically the continued impact on the ambulatory landscape The primary objective of this study is to accurately forecast the number of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 weekly visits in primary care practices Materials and Methods This retrospective study was conducted in a single health system in Delaware All patients' records were abstracted from our electronic health records system (EHR) from January 1, 2019 to July 25, 2020 Patient demographics and comorbidities were compared using t-tests, Chi square, and Mann Whitney U analyses as appropriate ARIMA time series models were developed to provide an 8-week future forecast for two ambulatory practices (AmbP) and compare it to a na?ve moving average approach Results Among the 271,530 patients considered during this study period, 4,195 patients (1 5%) were identified as COVID-19 patients The best fitting ARIMA models for the two AmbP are as follows: AmbP1 COVID-19+ ARIMAX(4,0,1), AmbP1 nonCOVID-19 ARIMA(2,0,1), AmbP2 COVID-19+ ARIMAX(1,1,1), and AmbP2 nonCOVID-19 ARIMA(1,0,0) Discussion and Conclusion: Accurately predicting future patient volumes in the ambulatory setting is essential for resource planning and developing safety guidelines Our findings show that a time series model that accounts for the number of positive COVID-19 patients delivers better performance than a moving average approach for predicting weekly ambulatory patient volumes in a short-term period","output":"Prediction model for COVID-19 patient visits in the ambulatory setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and the social unrest pervading U.S. cities in response to the killings of George Floyd and other Black citizens at the hands of police are historically significant. These events exemplify dismaying truths about race and equality in the United States. Racial health disparities are an inexcusable lesion on the U.S. health care system. Many health disparities involve medications, including antidepressants, anticoagulants, diabetes medications, drugs for dementia, and statins, to name a few. Managed care pharmacy has a role in perpetuating racial disparities in medication use. For example, pharmacy benefit designs are increasingly shifting costs of expensive medications to patients, creating affordability crises for lower income workers, who are disproportionally persons of color. In addition, the quest to maximize rebates serves to inflate list prices paid by the uninsured, among which Black and Hispanic people are overrepresented. While medication cost is a foremost barrier for many patients, other factors also propagate racial disparities in medication use. Even when cost sharing is minimal or zero, medication adherence rates have been documented to be lower among Blacks as compared with Whites. Deeper understandings are needed about how racial disparities in medication use are influenced by factors such as culture, provider bias, and patient trust in medical advice. Managed care pharmacy can address racial disparities in medication use in several ways. First, it should be acknowledged that racial disparities in medication use are pervasive and must be resolved urgently. We must not believe that entrenched health system, societal, and political structures are impermeable to change. Second, the voices of community members and their advocates must be amplified. Coverage policies, program designs, and quality initiatives should be developed in consultation with those directly affected by racial disparities. Third, the industry should commit to dramatically reducing patient cost sharing for essential medication therapies. Federal and state efforts to limit annual out-of-pocket pharmacy spending should be supported, even though increased premiums may be an undesirable (yet more equitable) consequence. Finally, information about race should be incorporated into all internal and external reporting and quality improvement activities.

Sulodexide has pleiotropic properties within the vascular endothelium that can prove beneficial in the long COVID-19 symptoms. Purpose We aimed to evaluate the effect of sulodexide when used in patients with endothelial dysfunction and long COVID-19 symptoms. Methods We conducted a prospective multicenter longitudinal case-control study. Endothelial function was evaluated with DTM E4-Diagnose Polymath based on the Endothelium Quality Index (EQI). A group of patients with endothelial dysfunction (EQI<2.0) received sulodexide. All the patients were followed-up 21days after inclusion. Primary outcomes were defined as endothelial function amelioration (delta EQI) and long COVID-19 symptoms evolution during the follow-up. Results A total of 410 patients were included in this study. Patients were included at an average time of 1.891.2month after COVID-19 infection. At inclusion, 210 (51.2%) patients had an EQI<2. The median age was 4913.8 (18C80) years. Among the patients with endothelial dysfunction, only 79 patients received sulodexide. Patients in sulodexide group had lower EQI than the non-medical intervention group (0.940.6 vs. 1.520.4; P <10?3). They were more diabetic, hypertensive, had more coronary artery disease and received more long-term medications (aspirin, Bblockers and statins) than the others (P =0.01, 0.002, 0.01, 0.009, 0.001 and 0.01, respectively). At the 21-days follow-up, patients in sulodexide group presented lower long COVID symptoms especially chest pain, palpitations, fatigue and neuro-cognitive difficulties associated to a significant amelioration of endothelial function (delta EQI 1.261.07 vs. 0.220.7; P <10?3).

METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in 77 French hospitals from April 22 to May 13 2020. All ICU frontline healthcare workers were eligible. The primary endpoint was the mental health, assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. Sources of stress during the crisis were assessed using the Perceived Stressors in Intensive Care Units (PS-ICU) scale. Epidemic intensity was defined as high or low for each region based on publicly available data from Sant Publique France. Effects were assessed using linear mixed models, moderation and mediation analyses. RESULTS: In total, 2643 health professionals participated; 64.36% in high-intensity zones. Professionals in areas with greater epidemic intensity were at higher risk of mental health issues (p < 0.001), and higher levels of overall perceived stress (p < 0.001), compared to low-intensity zones. Factors associated with higher overall perceived stress were female sex (B = 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.08C0.17), having a relative at risk of COVID-19 (B = 0.14; 95%-CI = 0.09C0.18) and working in high-intensity zones (B = 0.11; 95%-CI = 0.02C0.20). Perceived stress mediated the impact of the crisis context on mental health (B = 0.23, 95%-CI = 0.05, 0.41) and the impact of stress on mental health was moderated by positive thinking, b = ? 0.32, 95% CI = ? 0.54, ? 0.11.

Genomic surveillance continues to be a critical effort toward tracking the virus and containing its spread, and more genomes from diverse geographical areas and different time points are needed to provide an appropriate representation of the virus evolution. In this study, we report the successful assembly of one single gapless, unambiguous contiguous sequence representing the complete viral genome from a nasopharyngeal swab of an infected health care worker in Cairo, Egypt. The sequence has all typical features of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, with no protein-disrupting mutations. However, three mutations are worth highlighting and future tracking: a synonymous mutation causing a rare spike S813I variation and two less frequent ones leading to an A41V variation in NSP3, encoded by ORF1a (ORF1a A895V), and a Q677H variation in the spike protein. Both affected proteins, S and NSP3, are relevant to vaccine and drug development. Although the genome, named CU_S3, belongs to the prevalent global genotype, marked by the D614G spike variation, the combined variations in the spike proteins and ORF1a do not co-occur in any of the 197,000 genomes reported to date.

In preventive medicine, however, high sensitivity is sometimes considered as more critical in order not to overlook infectious individuals, because the latter may be associated with ongoing spread of a transmittable disease. Accordingly, this work was focused on a theoretical model on how the sensitivity of case definitions can be optimized by adding clinical symptoms to diagnostic results for preventive purposes, if the associated reduction in specificity is considered as acceptable. The model was exemplified with an analysis on whether and in how far exposure risk can be reduced by the inclusion of observable symptoms during seroconversion syndrome in case of rapid diagnostic test-based prevention of sexual HIV transmission. The approach provided a high level of safety (negative predictive values close to 1) for the price of a considerably number of false positives (positive predictive values < 0.01 for some subpopulations).

The majority of pre-weaned calf mortality is attributed to diarrhea or other digestive problems. Five enteric pathogens are commonly associated with diarrhea in dairy calves, including bovine rotavirus, bovine coronavirus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Cryptosporidium parvum. Pathogen-associated differences in health outcomes and case fatality rates have not been well-characterized. Additionally, updated prevalence estimates may reflect important changes in the epidemiology of the pathogens on dairy farms. For this cohort study, fecal samples were collected from 276 clinically ill calves across 5 central Ohio dairy farms on the first day of diarrheal diagnosis. Genomic techniques, including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) were used to test for the presence of the five enteric pathogens. A Poisson regression model was used to estimate the relative risk of mortality, and a survival analysis with a Cox regression model was used to analyze time to return to a healthy clinical status by pathogen. Rotavirus was the most frequently identified at 68.1 % (188/276), followed by F5 (K99)+E. coli at 42.5 % (114/268), C. parvum at 28.4 % (66/232), coronavirus at 5.8 % (16/276), and Salmonella had the lowest prevalence at 3.7 % (10/268). Risk of mortality tended to be higher for calves infected with Salmonella (RR = 3.83; 95 %CI: 0.93, 16.02, p = 0.062); however, the time to return to a healthy clinical status was not different for different pathogens. Only farm was a significant predictor of time to return to health (p = 0.017); the within-farm median duration of signs substantially varied between 2 and 7 days. The results suggest that the prevalence and distribution of rotaviral infections is higher than reported in prior studies. With the exception of infections caused by Salmonella spp., pathogen diagnosis on the first day of diarrhea was a poor predictor of the outcome and duration of disease. These results are critical to guide the implementation of prevention measures to detect, treat, and prevent calf diarrhea.","output":"Longitudinal health outcomes for enteric pathogens in preweaned calves on Ohio dairy farms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic posed unique challenges for breast reconstruction. Many professional organizations initially placed restrictions on breast reconstruction, leading surgeons to conceive innovative protocols for offering breast reconstruction. This study reviewed the current evidence on breast reconstruction during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide guidance for surgeons facing future crises. METHODS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for studies (1) describing implant and autologous breast reconstruction following mastectomy and (2) occurring during or pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Of the 1347 studies identified, 26 were included. Studies discussed type of reconstruction (18, 69%), complications (11, 42%), timing of reconstruction (10, 38%), protocols (10, 38%), COVID-19 screening (7, 27%), and length of hospital stay (7, 27%). The type of reconstruction varied depending on the stage of the pandemic: early on, autologous breast reconstruction was halted to preserve resources, but was later resumed. Within implant-based reconstruction, direct-to-implant was favored over serial tissue expansion. Several protocols were developed, with many emphasizing multidisciplinary collaborations for patient selection, use of specialized measures to reduce risk of COVID-19 transmission, and optimization of same-day discharge. Complication rates following breast reconstruction were similar to pre-pandemic rates. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has forever changed the landscape of breast reconstruction by raising important questions about delivery of care, cost, and resource utilization. The findings of this review may inform surgeons as they plan for similar future crises or strive for improved patient care and efficacy even during nonpandemic times.","output":"Breast Reconstruction during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 virus that spreads globally has an impact on economic growth in Indonesia.

Viral viability from longitudinally-collected specimens was assessed. Whole-genome sequencing and serological studies were performed to measure viral evolution and evidence of immune escape. FINDINGS: We found compelling evidence of ongoing replication and infectivity for up to 162 days from initial positive by subgenomic RNA, single-stranded RNA, and viral culture analysis. Our results reveal a broad spectrum of infectivity, host immune responses, and accumulation of mutations, some with the potential for immune escape. INTERPRETATION: Our results highlight the potential need to reassess infection control precautions in the management and care of immunocompromised patients. Routine surveillance of mutations and evaluation of their potential impact on viral transmission and immune escape should be considered.","output":"Increased viral variants in children and young adults with impaired humoral immunity and persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection: A consecutive case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via the original article","output":"Adapting inpatient addiction medicine consult services during the COVID-19 pandemic (vol 16, 13, 2021)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the Middle East region, the incidence of breast cancer (BC) has substantially increased in the last years. Despite a considerable body of research about BC in Arab countries, how illness perceptions of healthy women about BC may influence risk perception is unknown. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on a sample of 298 young Emirati women. The measures included demographic information, illness perceptions, and risk perception. Descriptive and correlational analyses were performed to assess illness perceptions about BC, perceived individual risk and comparative risk. A structural equation modelling (S.E.M.) was built to investigate the relationship between illness perceptions and perceived individual risk. RESULTS: Participants reported negative illness perceptions about BC The individual risk perception and the compared risk perception for BC were low. Participants with a family history of BC reported more negative illness and higher risk perceptions. The relationship between illness perceptions and perceived individual risk was significant and mediated by compared risk. The S.E.M. explained 55.9% of the variance in predicting perceived individual risk for BC. CONCLUSION: Women's views of BC are important factors in risk perception and may provide culturally sensitive clues to promote early screening for BC in Arab countries.

Crises and technological advances have influenced each other to bring about changes in the ways of working. In the 70s of the last century, in the middle of the so-called oil crisis, the concept of teleworking was defined using remote computer equipment to access office equipment and thus avoid moving around using traditional vehicles. Then from the 90s, with the advent of communications and the widespread use of the Internet, the first virtual work teams were implemented in software development companies that already had some of the important characteristics needed to work in this way, such as, cultural diversity, characterized tasks, geographical distribution of members, communication, interdependence of tasks, leadership, cohesion, empowerment, confidence, virtuality. This manuscript groups the main factors into different models proposed by the literature and also analyzes the results of a study conducted in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis on 317 software development teams that had to work in virtual teams (VT). The results of the quantitative methodology with structural equation modeling based on variance using the partial least squares route method are analyzed. The results of the research focus on some determinants that can directly affect the performance of the virtual team. A first determinant is communication in relation to the tasks.

It unites health professionals, researchers, community leaders, and government officials, and is a catalyzing force in developing policies, research interventions, and programs that address prevention, social determinants, health disparities, and health equity. The NCHD Student Research Forum (SRF) was established in 2011 at the Medical University of South Carolina to build high-quality biomedical research presentation capacity in primarily underrepresented undergraduate and graduate/professional students. This paper describes the unique research training and professional development aspects of the NCHD SRF. These include guidance in abstract development, a webinar on presentation techniques and methods, a vibrant student-centric conference, and professional development workshops on finding a mentor and locating scholarship/fellowship funding, networking, and strategies for handling ethical issues in research with mentors. Between 2011 and 2018, 400 undergraduate and graduate/professional students participated in the NCHD SRF. Most students were women (80.5%). Approximately half were African American or black (52.3%), 18.0% were white, and 21.3% were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. The NCHD SRF is unique in several ways. First, it provides detailed instructions on developing a scientific abstract, including content area examples. Second, it establishes a mandatory pre-conference training webinar demonstrating how to prepare a scientific poster. Third, it works with the research mentors, faculty advisors, department chairs, and deans to help identify potential sources of travel funding for students with accepted abstracts.

The impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on the severity of COVID-19 has been underlined in the literature. In this analysis, we have provided evidence of an association between CKD and COVID-19. We followed the PRISMA protocol and conducted a literature search using Google Scholar, EMBASE, PubMed, and Clinical trail.gov. The initial search yielded 2102 articles. We included 20 cohorts based on inclusion criteria reporting an association between CKD and COVID-19 after excluding irrelevant articles, including review articles and duplicates. We conducted pooled prevalence of CKD and meta-analysis to estimate the odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI) using Cochrane RevMan (version 5.4, Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration), and R programming language version 4.16-2 (University of Auckland, New Zealand).

METHODS Using the National Trauma Data Bank from 2007 to 2015, facial fracture patients arriving by interfacility transfer were included in the study. RESULTS Over 9 years, 171,618 patients were included, with 37.5 percent having an isolated facial injury. Isolated facial injury patients tended to be younger, less frequently white, more frequently assaulted, and more frequently underwent facial fracture operative repair during the index admission (all, p < 0.001). From 2007 to 2015, insurance coverage increased from 54.6 to 79.0 percent (R2 = 0.90, p < 0.001). In addition, there was a 45 percent proportional increase in patients 50 to 89 years of age compared to a 20 percent decrease in patients 0 to 39 years of age (both, R2 = 0.99, p < 0.001). The proportion of transfer patients with isolated facial injury increased over the study period (32.0 to 39.4 percent, R2 = 0.90, p < 0.001); however, there was a decline in operative intervention (29.5 to 22.1 percent, R2 = 0.94, p < 0.001) and a 151 percent increase in the proportion discharged from the emergency department upon transfer arrival (R2 = 0.99, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Facial fracture patients subject to interfacility transfer comprise a wide array of demographics and injury patterns, with most having concomitant injuries and only a minority undergoing immediate operative intervention.

The BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel EZ (RP EZ) is a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-waived respiratory pathogen PCR panel which rapidly tests for 14 common respiratory organisms. The aim of this study was to identify the distribution of organisms seen in pediatric clinics and to determine if utilization of this point-of-care test improved disease management, while exploring impact on clinic workflow. METHODS From January 2018 through January 2019, when clinically appropriate, patients were tested by the RP EZ and/or antigen tests (Clinic A) or antigen test only (Clinic B). Residual samples from Clinic B antigen tests were frozen and later tested on the RP EZ for definitive pathogen identification. Patient data and prescription records were extracted from the electronic health record. RESULTS A total of 430 patients had RP EZ tests performed, and at least 1 organism was detected in 70.4% of patients. The most common organisms identified were human rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. Appropriate treatment occurred for 93.6% of patients when the RP EZ was performed (Clinic A) versus 87.9% of patients who had only antigen tests performed (Clinic B, P = 0.0445). Utilization of RP EZ testing also significantly reduced appointment duration time (48.0 versus 54.9 minutes, P = 0.0009). Three false-positive influenza B results were identified by antigen testing.

Methicillin resistance and the PantonCValentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin, as well as less specific factors, have been associated with poor outcome in severe CAP, but their roles are unclear. METHODS: A prospective multicentre cohort study of severe staphylococcal CAP was conducted in 77 paediatric and adult intensive care units in France between January 2011 and December 2016. After age-clustering, risk factors for mortality, including pre-existing conditions, clinical presentation, laboratory features, strain genetic lineage, PVL, other virulence factors and methicillin resistance were assessed using univariate and multivariable Cox and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regressions. RESULTS: Out of 163 included patients, aged 1 month to 87 years, 85 (52.1%) had PVL-positive CAP; there were 20 (12.3%) patients aged <3 years (hereafter toddlers), among whom 19 (95%) had PVL-positive CAP. The features of PVL-positive CAP in toddlers matched with the historical description of staphylococcal pleuropneumonia, with a lower mortality (three (15%) out of 19) compared to PVL-positive CAP in older patients (31 (47%) out of 66).

We then found a modest decline in ADCC titer over a median 3-month follow-up in 21 patients who had serial samples available for analysis. We confirmed that the antibody-dependent target cell lysis was mediated primarily via the NK Fc?3RIIIa receptor (CD16). This ADCC assay had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting serologic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.","output":"The development and kinetics of functional antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Current retrospective study aims to evaluate household Secondary Attack Rate (SAR) of COVID-19 in Gandhinagar (rural) district of Gujarat, India. Methods: Line-listing of 486 laboratory-confirmed patients, tested between 28th March to 2nd July was collected, out of them 80 (15% of overall sample) cases were randomly selected. Demographic, clinical and household details of cases were collected through telephonic interview. During interview 28 more patients were identified from the same household and were added accordingly. So, study included 74 unrelated cluster of households with 74 primary cases and 386 close contacts. Results: SAR in household contacts of COVID-19 in Gandhinagar was 8.8%. Out of 108, 8 patients expired (7.4%), where higher mortality was observed in primary cases (9.5%) as compared to secondary cases (3%). Occupational analysis showed that majority of the secondary cases (88%) were not working and hence had higher contact time with patient. No out-of-pocket expenditure occurred in 94% of the patients, in remaining 6% average expenditure of 1,49,633INR (2027 USD) was recorded. Conclusions: Key observations from the study are 1) SAR of 8.8% is relatively low and hence home isolation of the cases can be continued 2) Primary case is more susceptible to fatal outcome as compared to secondary cases 3) Government has covered huge population of the COVID-19 patients under cost protection.

The authors highlight the importance of the societal consequences of the outbreak and changes in the world of work to manage occupational health. The key points identified - such as individual socio-economic factors, psychological effects and occupations with highest risk of contamination - modify return-to-work approaches. It is estimated that around 800 million people of working age worldwide were living with disabilities before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In early January 2021, the cumulative COVID-19 hospitalisation rate reached 207.4/100 000 (18-49-year-olds) and 505.7/100 000 (50-64-year-olds), respectively, in the United States (3). In France, the hospitalisation rate was 411.5/100 000 across all ages (4). A recent cohort study of working-age men who were hospitalised for COVID-19 highlighted the long-term health consequences of such a disease (5). The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic creates new challenges for occupational health, shifting attention away from return-to-work after health problems to resuming work during an outbreak, dealing with lockdown, and taking special account of workers with vulnerabilities (6, 7). We recommend considering three different aspects of occupational medicine during a pandemic. Firstly, for most workers at high-risk of severe COVID-19, the issues of work disability and resuming work had never occurred before the epidemic. Recommendations such as physical and social distancing and wearing a facemask are highly advisable to protect against infection but may not be enough to enable some individuals to resume work. Therefore, decision-making requires individual comprehensive assessments of the underlying medical condition, the SARS-CoV-2 contamination risk associated with either regular work or teleworking, and vaccination opportunities. The second situation concerns workers who have suffered from COVID-19. Preliminary studies suggest that long recovery duration is related to high severity (7), but this is still a matter of debate for patients suffering from \\"long COVID-19\\" (5, 8, 9), a condition for which the long-term effects remain unknown. Any long-running recovery must be considered to be a potential sign of long COVID-19. These long-lasting syndromes occur among patients with severe symptoms but have also been reported independently of acute phase severity, hospitalisation and receiving medical oxygen (8, 9). Researchers worldwide are currently investigating such syndromes. Strategies promoting return to work for these workers will need to be implemented and could be similar to programmes developed for other chronic conditions. Moreover, numerous more serious sequelae following critical illness suggest the need for enhanced support by rehabilitation and occupational health specialists. Finally, the consequences of the epidemic must be evaluated over time for people who suffered from functional limitations before COVID-19 as their physical and mental condition may be modified by the epidemic and, specifically, the consequences of lockdown (10). In all of these situations, medical, social, financial and working contexts are key elements. In addition to a medical assessment, the use of scales such as the Work Ability Index (WAI) (11) or the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) (12) can help perform long-term follow-up and provide information about work capacity and workload. It also gives a \\"back to basics\\" perspective, urging politicians to move towards a \`decent-work-for-all\` policy, as advocated by the United Nation\`s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, which the WHO has endorsed (13).

This study aimed to examine stress levels and causal stressors for perceived stress and generalized anxiety in the Indian population related to the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A total of 300 adults were invited to participate in the online study via snowball and virtual snowball sampling. They were requested to complete electronic survey forms for assessing perceived stress and anxiety, and questions related to psychosocial stressors. Frequency and percentage were used for categorical variables. One-way ANOVA test was applied to compare responses based on gender, level of education, employment, and place of residence. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result: In total, 257 out of the 300 invited, responded and completed the survey. Men accounted for 58% (n=149) of the respondents. Overall, 84% (n=217) of participants had moderate to severe levels of perceived stress and 88% (n=228) had moderate to severe levels of anxiety. Women, as well as those not employed, reported significantly higher perceived stress and anxiety, urban residents reported higher perceived stress, while level of education had no difference in terms of perceived stress as well as anxiety. Fear of contracting COVID-19 was the highest stressor followed by difficulties in executing a routine exercise schedule and worry about the future.

METHODS Publicly available data of PM2.5 concentrations from reference monitoring systems at sites across Scotland were extracted for the 31-day period immediately following the imposition of lockdown rules on 23 March 2020. Similar data for 2017, 2018 and 2019 were gathered for comparison. Mean period values were calculated from the hourly data and logged values compared using pairwise t-tests. Weather effects were corrected using meteorological normalisation. RESULTS NO2 concentrations were significantly lower in the 2020 lockdown period than in the previous 3 years (p<0.001). Mean outdoor PM2.5 concentrations in 2020 were much lower than during the same period in 2019 (p<0.001). However, despite UK motor vehicle journeys reducing by 65%, concentrations in 2020 were within 1 g/m3 of those measured in 2017 (p=0.66) and 2018 (p<0.001), suggesting that traffic-related emissions may not explain variability of PM2.5 in outdoor air in Scotland. CONCLUSIONS The impact of reductions in motor vehicle journeys during COVID-19 lockdown restrictions may not have reduced ambient PM2.5 concentrations in some countries.

Comprehensive gene expression analysis in Alternaria-exposed mouse airways, a model of SAFS, has not been conducted. METHODS BALB/c mice received intranasal administration of Alternaria extract or phosphate-buffered saline twice a week for 6 weeks. Lung sections and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were obtained to assess airway inflammation. RNA-Seq in the central airway was performed, and gene ontology (GO) analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were conducted for pathway analyses. An in vitro experiment using human airway epithelial cell 16HBE14o- was performed to validate the RNA-Seq findings. RESULTS Eosinophilic airway inflammation with mucus overproduction and airway remodeling was observed in mice exposed to Alternaria. RNA-Seq analysis revealed 403 upregulated and 108 downregulated genes in airways of Alternaria-exposed mice. In GO analysis, the functions of immunoglobulin (Ig) receptor binding, Ig production, inflammatory response, and T-cell activation were upregulated, while those of keratinization and defense response to other organisms were downregulated. GSEA revealed positive enrichment in T-cell receptor complex, immunological synapse, antigen binding, mast cell activation, and Ig receptor binding, and negative enrichment in keratinization and cornification in Alternaria-exposed mice relative to control. Alternaria exposure to 16HBE14o- cells validated the downregulation of epithelial keratinization-related genes, including SPRR1A, SPRR1B, and KRT6B.

Design, setting, and participants: We conducted a vaccine booster study built on a single-center, randomized, double-blind phase 1/2 trial of the two-dose schedule of CoronaVac among healthy adults[]60 years in Hebei, China. We examined neutralizing antibody titres six months or more after the second dose in all participants. We provided a third dose to 303 participants recruited in phase 2 trial to assess their immune responses. Interventions: Two formulations (3 g, and 6 g) were used in phase 1 trial, and an additional formulation of 1.5 g was used in phase 2 trial. All participants were given two doses 28 days apart and followed up 6 months after the second dose. Participants in phase 2 received a third dose 8 months after the second dose. Main outcomes and measures: Geometric mean titres (GMT) of neutralizing antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2 and adverse events were assessed at multiple time points following vaccination. Results: Neutralizing antibody titres dropped below the seropositive cutoff of 8 at 6 months after the primary vaccination in all vaccine groups in the phase 1/2 trial. A third dose given 8 months or more after the second dose significantly increased neutralizing antibody levels. In the 3 g group (the licensed formulation), GMT increased to 305 [95%CI 215.3-432.0] on day 7 following the third dose, an approximately 7-fold increase compared with the GMT 28 days after the second dose. All solicited adverse reactions reported within 28 days after a booster dose were of grade 1 or 2 severity. Conclusion and relevance: Neutralizing antibody titres declined substantially six months after two doses of CoronaVac among older adults. A booster dose rapidly induces robust immune responses.

Moreover, based both on biomarker as well as imaging findings, widespread endothelial and cardiac injury seems to be present in many patients presenting with COVID-19, associated with adverse outcomes including new onset HF. Systematic echocardiographic studies in patients with COVID-19 indicate that the most common cardiac pathology is right ventricular (RV) dilatation (39%) over and above both left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (16%) and LV systolic dysfunction (10%).

These observations seem to indicate a potentially rather high risk of clinical HF emerging in patients post-COVID-19, warranting close long-term monitoring of patients during recovery. On the other hand, given the established adverse prognostic role that pre-existing HF plays as a comorbidity in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, it not only seems important in the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that all patients with known HF should proactively be well controlled and treated according to current guidelines, but also additionally be considered for priority vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 infection if not yet vaccinated.","output":"Heart failure outcomes and Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare workers (HCWs) stand at the frontline for fighting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A non-systematic review of the literature regarding the management of penile cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic was performed until April 30, 2020. We propose our recommendations based on this evidence. RESULTS: Penile cancer is an uncommon but aggressive disease. Prognosis is determined by several characteristics, being the most important the presence of lymph nodes, in which case, treatment should not be delayed. For these reasons, an initial evaluation is mandatory. Priority classifications, based on the oncological outcomes when treatment is delayed, have been made in order to separate deferrable disease from the one that needs high priority treatment. In penile cancer with low risk of progression, surgical treatment can be delayed, but other options must be considered, like topical treatment or laser therapy. In cases with intermediate risk of progression, surgical treatment may be delayed up to three months, but we must consider radiation therapy and brachytherapy as effective options. When feasible, follow-up should by telemonitoring. CONCLUSIONS: In the COVID-19 era, initial evaluation of the patient is mandatory. Histological diagnosis with local staging is necessary before offering any therapeutic option. In case of superficial non-invasive disease, topical treatment is effective in absence of lymph node involvement. In selected patients, radiotherapy is an organ-preserving approach with good results. Non-deferrable surgical treatment must be performed by an experienced surgeon and as an outpatient procedure when possible.

These gender disparities during the pandemic may indicate not only a lack of women's leadership in international clinical trials and involvement in new projects but also may reveal imbalances in women's access to research activities and funding during health emergencies.","output":"Gender disparities in COVID-19 clinical trial leadership"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe restaurant industry is characterized by long hours, intense job demands and a lack of work-life balance. While a growing body of research has investigated methods for decreasing role conflict-related stress and strain in foodservice and hospitality employees, there is still little understanding of what supervisors can do to decrease work-life-related employee strain. This study aims to investigate how family-supportive supervisor behaviors (FSSB) influence employee emotional exhaustion (EE) and subsequent turnover intentions, as well as the role of gender in moderating these effects.Design/methodology/approachA survey-based design using a national panel of 226 foodservice employees was used to investigate the hypotheses developed in this paper.FindingsResults indicated that FSSB decreased employee EE and subsequent turnover intentions. The authors also found that this relationship was stronger for female employees.Research limitations/implicationsThe study provides insight into the role that employee gender may play in response to the perception of and reactions to FSSB. Women still shoulder a majority of home and non-work caring duties, and therefore, they may be more positively affected when supervisors engage in behaviors that allow for balancing work and non-work demands.Originality/valueThere is little hospitality or foodservice-focused research into the effects of FSSB, and little overall research that investigates the role that gender may play in shaping the beneficial effects of FSSB. Given that women make up a majority of foodservice employees in the USA, yet there is a lack of female representation at higher levels of organizations, the study provides insights into ways in which organizations and supervisors can improve female employees working experiences and potentially increase their retention.","output":"Family-supportive supervisor behaviors and employee turnover intention in the foodservice industry: does gender matter?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has ingendered a significant transition in medical practice towards an online model of care.

However, few studies have focused on patients with substance use disorders (SUDs). This research aimed to compare the clinical status and substance use patterns of SUD outpatients, before and during confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This multicentre study recruited 588 patients (29.2% women; M age = 47.4  11.7 years) in thirteen centres for addiction treatment in Catalonia, Spain. All subjects were evaluated with validated instruments and ad hoc questionnaires. The sample was divided into 3 groups according to how the substance consumption pattern changed during lockdown (maintained pattern, worsened pattern, and improved pattern). RESULTS: More than 62% of the patients maintained or worsened their consumption pattern during confinement, and about 38% improved throughout this time. Diverse factors were associated with the changes in pattern like age, addiction severity, psychological distress during lockdown, social and familial issues, and therapeutic variables. CONCLUSION: The home lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with major implications for substance consumption and psychiatric distress among SUD outpatients.

Comorbidities such as age over 40 years, obesity, and diabetes mellitus play an important role in the response inflammatory and immunological that can accelerate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines causing endothelial dysfunction that produces endotheliitis, hypercoagulability, and fibrinolysis not only at lung level but also in other organs such as the heart and central nervous system. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which has a high prevalence in older adults with obesity, is a risk factor for endothelial dysfunction due to hypoxia that may favor hyper inflammation in response to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore OSA should be considered serious comorbidity for COVID-19 fatality.

It is an emerging infectious disease, probably of animal origin. Several domesticated and non-domesticated animals are naturally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including Mustelidae, of which mink is the first species identified to suffer from this infection. We report herein the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in lymph node tissue from two feral American mink (Neovison vison) trapped in the wild in the Valencian Community (Eastern Spain) during invasive species trapping campaigns. ABSTRACT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of COVID-19, is considered a pathogen of animal origin that is mainly transmitted from human to human. Several animal species can be naturally or experimentally infected by SARS-CoV-2, with compelling evidence that mink is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human-to-mink infection cases have been reported and there are also suggestions that mink-to-human infection occurs. Mink infections have been reported to date only on fur farms, except for one infected free- ranging wild mink near a Utah (USA) fur farm, which suggests a transmission pathway from farms to wild mink. We now report the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 2 of 13 feral dark brown American mink (Neovison vison) trapped in the Valencian Community (Eastern Spain), during an invasive species trapping campaign. They were trapped in riverbeds in sparsely inhabited rural areas known to harbor self-sustained feral mink populations. The closest fur farm is about 20 km away. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by two-step RT-PCR in these animals mesenteric lymph nodes and was confirmed by sequencing a 397-nucleotide amplified region of the S gene, yielding identical sequences in both animals. A molecular phylogenetic analysis was run on this sequence, which was found to correspond to the consensus SARS-CoV-2 sequence from Wuhan. Our findings appear to represent the first example of SARS-CoV-2 acquired in the wild by feral mink in self-sustained populations.","output":"First Description of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Two Feral American Mink (Neovison vison) Caught in the Wild"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As much of the world has gone into complete lockdown, woefully unprepared, many countries have turned to South Korea for answers, given its handling of COVID\\\\19 Rapid and widespread testing, expansive surveillance assemblage and selected quarantine practices are upheld by many countries and public health professionals as superb, a model to adopt But this is not South Koreas only lesson Indeed, the world is on edge, scrambling in the here and now, but trying to figure out what happens to sociality going forward","output":"Viral living"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Learning the differential statistical dependency network between two contexts is essential for many real-life applications, mostly in the high dimensional low sample regime.

In the healthy lung, ATII cells coordinate the host defense mechanisms, not only generating a restrictive alveolar epithelial barrier, but also orchestrating host defense mechanisms and secreting surfactant proteins, which are important in lung protection against pathogen exposure. Moreover, surfactant proteins help to maintain homeostasis in the distal lung and reduce surface tension at the pulmonary air-liquid interface, thereby preventing atelectasis and reducing the work of breathing. ATII cells may also contribute to the fibroproliferative reaction by secreting growth factors and proinflammatory molecules after damage. Indeed, various acute and chronic diseases are associated with intensive inflammation. These include oedema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, fibrosis and numerous interstitial lung diseases, and are characterized by hyperplastic ATII cells which are considered an essential part of the epithelialization process and, consequently, wound healing. The aim of this review is that of revising the physiologic and pathologic role ATII cells play in pulmonary diseases, as, despite what has been learnt in the last few decades of research, the origin, phenotypic regulation and crosstalk of these cells still remain, in part, a mystery.","output":"The History and Mystery of Alveolar Epithelial Type II Cells: Focus on Their Physiologic and Pathologic Role in Lung"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We define data analyses to monitor a change in R, the average number of secondary cases caused by a typical infected individual. The input dataset consists of incident cases partitioned into outbreaks, each initiated from a single index case. We split the input dataset into two successive subsets, to evaluate two successive R values, according to the Bayesian paradigm. We used the Bayes factor between the model with two different R values and that with a single R value to justify that the change in R is statistically significant. We validated our approach using simulated data, generated using known R. In particular, we found that claiming two distinct R values may depend significantly on the number of outbreaks. We then reanalyzed data previously studied by Jansen et al. [Jansen et al. Science 301 (5634), 804], concerning the effective reproduction number for measles in the UK, during 1995C2002. Our analyses showed that the 1995C2002 dataset should be divided into two separate subsets for the periods 1995C1998 and 1999C2002. In contrast, Jansen et al. take this splitting point as input of their analysis. Our estimated effective reproduction numbers R are in good agreement with those found by Jansen et al. In conclusion, our methodology for detecting temporal changes in R using outbreak-size data worked satisfactorily with both simulated and real-world data.

The nasal cavity and the rhinopharynx are the sites of initial replication of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, a nasal spray may be a suitable dosage form for this purpose. The main objective of our study was to test the antiviral action of three candidate nasal spray formulations against SARS-CoV-2. We have found that iota-carrageenan in concentrations as low as 6 g/ mL inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero cell cultures. The concentrations found to be active in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 may be easily achieved by the application of nasal sprays already marketed in several countries.

Social capital and a sense of social cohesion are known to have roles in buffering against the effects of adverse life circumstances. Our study sought to investigate the association of a range of social attitudes and activities - as proxies for social capital - with loneliness while taking into account socio-demographic factors. We undertook a national survey on a stratified random sample of the New Zealand (NZ) adult population aged 18+ in 2017 (n = 1,358), data from which included the requisite variables. The prevalence of loneliness was highest in young adults (18-30), falling with age until a slight rise in older people (76+). Loneliness was associated with socio-demographic factors, being more prevalent in the more disadvantaged groups: the deprived, Maori (the indigenous people of NZ), the non-partnered, and the less educated. Controlling for these socio-demographic factors, pro-social attitudes (that is towards political efficacy, trust in others, not feeling exploited, or being committed to family) and participation in social activities (that is being employed or being involved in recreation groups) - were protective against loneliness. Our study supports asset-based approaches to tackling loneliness - with implications for health and social care - that emphasise mobilising existing social resources, building social capital, and raising social cohesion in our communities. Such intervention on loneliness would help to prevent and ameliorate its detrimental consequences for public health.","output":"Social attitudes and activities associated with loneliness: Findings from a New Zealand national survey of the adult population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: following the global COVID-19 outbreak, the government of Benin implemented preventive measures to stall viral transmission. We sought to evaluate adherence of the Beninese people to these preventive measures, in order to identify predictors of poor adherence and adapt the national response to COVID-19. Methods: two consecutive online surveys were conducted between May and August 2020. Four hundred and sixty two and 507 adult participants aged 18 years and above responded to the first and second survey respectively, with >70% being males. Results: more than 98% of respondents reported wearing face masks. A five-point adherence score was constituted by scoring observance to key preventive measures (mask use, physical distancing, hand hygiene, coughing hygiene and avoiding to touch ones face). We observed that the mean adherence scores were fairly stable over time, respectively 4.08 and 4.03 during the first and second survey (p=0.439). Increasing age (aOR=1.043, 95% CI: 1.026 - 1.061; p<0.001) and obtaining COVID-19 information from official sources (aOR=1.628, 95% CI: 1.275 - 2.081; p<0.001) were significantly associated with higher adherence scores in a multivariable model.

In April 2020, we launched a longitudinal cohort study to assess the behavioral and epigenetic vestiges of COVID-19-related prenatal stress exposure in mothers and infants. COVID-19-related prenatal stress was retrospectively assessed at birth. SLC6A4 methylation was assessed in thirteen CpG sites in mothers and infants buccal cells.

If only the electrical activation sequence in the heart is needed, then the full bidomain equations can be substituted by the Eikonal equation which allows much faster responses w.r.t. the changed material parameters in the equation. We use our Eikonal solver optimized for memory usage and parallelization. Patient-specific simulations in cardiac electrophysiology require patient-specific conductivity parameters which are not accurately available in vivo. One chance to improve the given conductivity parameters consists in comparing the computed activation sequence on the heart surface with the measured ECG on the torso mapped onto this surface. By minimizing the squared distance between the measured solution and the Eikonal computed solution we are able to determine the material parameters more accurately. To reduce the number of optimization parameters in this process, we group the material parameters and introduce a specific scaling parameter [Formula: see text] for each group. The minimization takes place w.r.t. the scaling [Formula: see text]. We solve the minimization problem by the BFGS method and adaptive step size control.

To improve the affinity of 1A1D-2, in this study, we analyzed the previously solved structure of 1A1D-2-DENV2 EDIII complex. Mutations were designed, including A54E and Y105R in the heavy chain, with charges complementary to the epitope. Molecular dynamics simulation was then used to validate the formation of predicted salt bridges. Interestingly, a surface plasmon resonance experiment showed that both mutations increased affinities of 1A1D-2 toward EDIII of DENV1, 2, and 3 regardless of their sequence variation. Results also revealed that A54E improved affinities through both a faster association and slower dissociation, whereas Y105R improved affinities through a slower dissociation. Further simulation suggested that the same mutants interacted with different residues in different serotypes. Remarkably, combination of the two mutations additively improved 1A1D-2 affinity by 8, 36, and 13-fold toward DENV1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Managing these demands cannot be effectively conducted without a nationwide collective effort that relies on data to forecast hospital demands on the national, regional, hospital and individual levels. To this end, we developed the COVID-19 Capacity Planning and Analysis System (CPAS) - a machine learning-based system for hospital resource planning that we have successfully deployed at individual hospitals and across regions in the UK in coordination with NHS Digital. In this paper, we discuss the main challenges of deploying a machine learning-based decision support system at national scale, and explain how CPAS addresses these challenges by (1) defining the appropriate learning problem, (2) combining bottom-up and top-down analytical approaches, (3) using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, (4) integrating heterogeneous data sources, and (5) presenting the result with an interactive and transparent interface.

Statistics of the sound signals, analysis in the frequency domain, and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are then calculated and applied in two classifiers, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to diagnose whether a user is contracted with COVID-19 or not.

In this piece of work, the authors consider the effects of the recent COVID-19 pandemic event on the global equity market, commodities and FX market, measured in terms of the investors' fear index. Design/methodology/approach: In this empirical work, the authors employ time series-based regression models followed by augmented dummy regressions and growth of the COVID-19. Findings: COVID-19-induced investors' fear appears to be higher in the equity segment for the first time since the market crash of 1987 and the global financial crisis of 2008C2009. Furthermore, this disease outbreak shock has been more pronounced in terms of crude oil prices. Besides, a market participant in the commodity and FX market has paid a disproportionate premium to protect such pandemic development. Findings show that Options act as the best hedge against an uncertainty like COVID-19 and that option-based implied volatility is the best measure of investors' fear and market volatility. Practical implications: This study has practical implications for the financial markets, e.g. (1) Contagious disease outbreak news matters for the equity, commodity, and foreign exchange markets C empirical outcome validates the theory of market efficiency valid for the Options. (2) Option's implied volatility is the best indicator of investor fear measured for the unprecedented economic news. Further implication holds for the policymakers and society, e.g. (1) The unavailability of short-selling could be one plausible reason for increased uncertainty and volatility;hence, policymakers should look upon this issue at the exchange level. (2) Any market needs multiple lines of risk management, effective price discovery and attractive liquidity. Originality/value: The study is novel in terms of presenting market behavior amid COVID-19 across global equity markets and commodities and FX markets. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Does disease outbreak news impact equity, commodity and foreign exchange market?

Introduction: It is not yet possible to estimate the proportion of patients with COVID-19 who present distinguishable classical neurological symptoms and syndromes. The objective of this study is to estimate the incidence of sensory symptoms (hypoaesthesia, paraesthesia, and hyperalgesia) in physicians who have presented the disease at Hospital Universitario Fundacin Alcorcn (HUFA) in Madrid; to establish the relationship between sensory symptoms and the presence of other signs of infection; and to study their association with the severity of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional, retrospective, observational study. HUFA physicians who presented SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 March and 25 July 2020 were included in the study. A voluntary, anonymous survey was distributed via corporate email. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were collected from professionals with PCR- or serology-confirmed COVID-19. Results. The survey was sent to 801 physicians and we received 89 responses. The mean age of respondents was 38.28 years. A total of 17.98% presented sensory symptoms. A significant relationship was found between the presence of paraesthesia and cough, fever, myalgia, asthaenia, and dyspnoea. A significant relationship was also found between paraesthesia and the need for treatment and admission due to COVID-19. Sensory symptoms were present from the fifth day of illness in 87.4% of cases. Conclusions. SARS-CoV-2 infection can be associated with sensory symptoms, mostly in severe cases.

We show that any EU response strategy to the COVID-19 crisis excluding mutual financial support to member countries lacks credibility. Some form of fiscal risk sharing is indeed better than none, especially in presence of increasing sovereign default risk of some EU member countries. The moral hazard created by risk sharing can be hedged by introducing some form of fiscal delegation to Brussels. The desirable level of delegation, however, depends on its costs. When these are low, risk sharing and delegation are substitutes and it is optimal to opt for high delegation and low risk sharing. On the contrary, when delegation costs are high, centralization and risk sharing are complements and both are needed. Proposed arrangements at the EU level in response to the COVID-19 shock seem to reflect these basic insights by rotating around a combination of fiscal risk sharing and delegation in the form of fiscal spending conditionality.","output":"Reducing Risk While Sharing it: A Fiscal Recipe for the EU at the Time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 virus pandemic is leading to a large number of deaths There are forecasts that there will be an exponential increase in the number of such deaths across the globe because of this deadly virus To arrest the spread of the virus in this situation, the supply of medical materials including PPE and body bags (also known as human remains pouch or cadaver bag) should be designed to stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus Conventional body bags have shortcomings, which need to be addressed by a refined redesigning and use of appropriate materials to adequately match the requirements in the current Covid-19 situation Current designs of the body bags do not allow the family members sentiments towards the deceased and to cater to the desire of the family members to view the face of the deceased without exposing them to a strong possibility of infection from the cadaver This is, therefore, a very traumatic experience to the family and in many cases, the cadaver is not handled with respect due to the unavailability of safe design body bags, which also exposes health workers to avoidable risk from the infections Technopark@iitk has proposed an integrated 5-layer body bag to tackle this situation for Covid-19 deceased such that it is (1) leak-proof, (2) impermeable/water-proof, (3) strong enough for the purpose, (4) ergonomically designed, and (5) has provision to view the face of the dead body for family viewing before cremation/burial This new design would keep the handling of the deceased body to a minimum during transportation from the hospital/site of death to a mortuary, and then to the home of the deceased/burial ground/crematorium, where it may be disposed-off along with the body in it, in a respectable manner, without putting people involved to the risk of infection","output":"Conceptual Design of a Body Bag for Preventing Infections and Safe Disposal of Deceased from COVID-19 Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Generalist practitioners often find interacting with patients deeply satisfying and joyful; they also experience encounters that are challenging and complex.

There are several HSPs, including HSPA5, also known as 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) or binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP) that is an ER resident involved in the folding of polypeptides during their translocation into this compartment prior to the transition to the Golgi network. HSPA5 is detected on the surface of cells or secreted into the extracellular environment. Surface HSPA5 has been proposed to have various roles, such as receptor-mediated signal transduction, a co-receptor for soluble ligands, as well as a participant in tumor survival, proliferation, and resistance. Recently, surface HSPA5 has been reported to be a potential receptor of some viruses, including the novel SARS-CoV-2. In spite of these observations, the association of HSPA5 within the plasma membrane is still unclear. To gain information about this process, we studied the interaction of HSPA5 with liposomes made of different phospholipids. We found that HSPA5 has a high affinity for negatively charged phospholipids, such as palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphoserine (POPS) and cardiolipin (CL). The N-terminal and C-terminal domains of HSPA5 were independently capable of interacting with negatively charged phospholipids, but to a lesser extent than the full-length protein, suggesting that both domains are required for the maximum insertion into membranes. Interestingly, we found that the interaction of HSPA5 with negatively charged liposomes promotes an oligomerization process via intermolecular disulfide bonds in which the N-terminus end of the protein plays a critical role.

In addition, there is growing evidence showing that autophagy can exert a lethal function via autophagic cell death (ACD). As ACD has been implicated in apoptosis-resistant glioblastoma (GBM), there is a high medical need for identifying novel ACD-inducing drugs. Therefore, we screened a library containing 70 autophagy-inducing compounds to induce ATG5-dependent cell death in human MZ-54 GBM cells. Here, we identified three compounds, i.e. loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 that significantly induce cell death in several GBM cell lines compared to CRISPR/Cas9-generated ATG5- or ATG7-deficient cells, pointing to a death-promoting role of autophagy. Further cell death analyses conducted using pharmacological inhibitors revealed that apoptosis, ferroptosis, and necroptosis only play minor roles in loperamide-, pimozide- or STF-62247-induced cell death. Intriguingly, these three compounds induce massive lipidation of the autophagy marker protein LC3B as well as the formation of LC3B puncta, which are characteristic of autophagy. Furthermore, loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 enhance the autophagic flux in parental MZ-54 cells, but not in ATG5 or ATG7 knockout (KO) MZ-54 cells. In addition, loperamide- and pimozide-treated cells display a massive formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes at the ultrastructural level. Finally, stimulation of autophagy by all three compounds is accompanied by dephosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a well-known negative regulator of autophagy. In summary, our results indicate that loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 induce ATG5- and ATG7-dependent cell death in GBM cells, which is preceded by a massive induction of autophagy.

MTT assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity effects of the S. ebulus extract; also, antiviral effects were measured both by test TCID50 and quantitative real-time PCR methods. To study the inhibitory impact of S. ebulus extract on the expression of HSV-1 antigens, indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was also performed. All analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism software v. 7.0. Results: In the postexposure assay of HSV-1 with S. ebulus extract at the highest nontoxic concentration (75 g/mL), S. ebulus extract led to 2.6 log10 TCID50 reduction in infectious virus titer. At the highest nontoxic concentration, the S. ebulus extract led to inhibition rates of 91.2%, based on the quantitative real-time PCR assay results (p<0.001). Also, in the immunofluorescence assay, a significant reduction was observed in fluorescence emission intensity in HSV-1-infected cell treated with S. ebulus extract compared to the control group.

METHODS: Case numbers from calendar weeks 1 through 22 of the two consecutive years 2019 and 2020 were obtained from 29 university hospitals and 7 non-university hospitals in Germany. Information was also obtained on the patients' age, sex, and urgency, along with the type of case (outpatient/inpatient), admitting ward, and a small number of tracer diagnoses (I21, myocardial infarction; J44, COPD; and I61, I63, I64, G45, stroke /TIA), as well as on the number of COVID-19 cases and of tests performed for SARS-CoV-2, as a measure of the number of cases in which COVID-19 was suspected or at least included in the differential diagnoses. RESULTS: A total of 1 022 007 emergency room consultations were analyzed, of which 546 940 took place in 2019 and 475 067 in 2020. The number of consultations with a positive test for the COVID-19 pathogen was 3122. The total number of emergency room consultations in the observation period was 13% lower in 2020 than in 2019, with a maximum drop by 38% coinciding with the highest number of COVID-19 cases (calendar week 14; 572 cases). After the initiation of interpersonal contact restrictions in 2020, there was a marked drop in COVID-19 case numbers, by a mean of -240 cases per week per emergency room (95% confidence interval [-284; -128]). There was a rise in case numbers thereafter, by a mean of 17 patients per week [14; 19], and the number of cases of myocardial infarction returned fully to the level seen in 2019. CONCLUSION: In Germany, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant drop in medical emergencies of all kinds presenting to the nation's emergency departments. A recovery effect began to be seen as early as calendar week 15, but the levels seen in 2019 were not yet reached overall by calendar week 22; only the prevalence of myocardial infarction had renormalized by then.

Four coders structured qualitative findings by themes including content, delivery, and source of information. An accompanying survey was used to describe participant Twitter use and HPV vaccine knowledge and attitudes. The average participant age was 44.6 years old, 63% were mothers, and the majority had high HPV vaccine knowledge. Parents indicated that they want to hear from other parents about their experiences with the HPV vaccine. However, it was hard to know where to find this information. When experiences are shared on social media, the negative ones are more memorable and more personal. Parents thought Twitter could be an important space to communicate about the HPV vaccine if it was done in a credible, verifiable, and authentic way. Parents want to learn about the HPV vaccine through other parent experiences, especially when this aligns with science supporting the vaccine. Public health and medical communities must embrace this mix of evidence and lived experiences to deliver and discuss health information.","output":"Identifying HPV vaccine narrative communication needs among parents on social media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article on p. 4251 in vol. 13, PMID: 34150012.].","output":"Erratum: Study on clinical characteristics of 173 cases of COVID-19 and effect of glucocorticoid on nucleic acid negative conversion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Acute ischemic stroke caused by primary multivessel occlusions (pMVO) is a rare but devastating disease. Whether multi-target mechanical thrombectomy for pMVO is beneficial remains unknown. METHODS Multicenter retrospective review of patients treated with multi-target mechanical thrombectomy. The following pMVO sites were included: basilar artery, internal carotid artery, and middle cerebral artery (M1 and M2). Baseline characteristics were reported together with interventional technique, technical efficacy, and safety parameters. Clinical outcomes were evaluated applying the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale. A systematic literature review was performed to summarize previous reports on pMVO mechanical thrombectomy. RESULTS Of 6081 patients screened, 21 patients met the inclusion criteria (0.35% [95% CI, 0.23%-0.53%]). In 70% (14/20) a cardioembolic cause was reported. A successful reperfusion of Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scale score 2b was achieved in 95.2% (20/21) for the first and 76.1% (16/21) for the second target vessel. In those who survived the acute hospital stay (n=10/21), median admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improved from 21 (interquartile range, 13-27) to 8 (interquartile range, 2-20) at discharge (P=0.006). Mortality was 60% (12/20) at 90 days and only 20% (4/20) of patients reached modified Rankin Scale score 2. Acceptable outcomes were almost exclusively observed in pMVO patients presenting with at least one M2 occlusion. CONCLUSIONS Multi-target mechanical thrombectomy for pMVOs is rarely performed; however, the procedure appears to be feasible and safe with high reperfusion rates for both occlusion sites. More than half of all treated patients deceased early and favorable outcomes may only be expected for pMVO patients including at least one M2 occlusion.","output":"Primary Multivessel Occlusions Treated With Mechanical Thrombectomy: A Multicenter Analysis and Systemic Literature Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease with significant morbidity and mortality that has had a major impact on health and health care services worldwide. Hong Kong has had a significant number of cases and deaths. Nurses, at the vanguard of the clinical health care team, have been particularly affected by it. The outbreak prompted the health authorities to implement a series of public health measures and hospital policies, including a guideline for the diagnosis and management of patients with SARS. Aims and objectives. This paper aims at providing an overview of what is known about SARS and the impact it has had in Hong Kong and to highlight from the perspective of a school of nursing the major clinical, educational and public health implications. Conclusions. The lack of understanding and uncertainty about the disease led to significant variation in the provision of information, contributing to the confusion and anxiety in the community. Therefore, there is a need to revise the nursing curriculum, to provide continuing education to all health care professionals, particularly with regard to infection control measures, and to revisit the range of public health policies to ensure the health of the community is protected by these policies. There also has been a reaffirmation of the importance of health promotion that highlights the importance of the partnership between nurses, health policy makers and public health personnel. It is evident that the organization and delivery of clinical practice, teaching and health promotion have to be flexible and responsive to a changing health scenario. Relevance to clinical practice. Nurses must play a crucial role in the prevention, detection and containment of SARS. They will need to implement and ensure strict adherence to infection control measures and, in some circumstances, isolation and quarantine may be warranted. Attention to the psychological state of patients and family members should not be overlooked.

However, the number of deaths attributable to diabetes, hypertension, obesity, or smoking have never been estimated. We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of observational studies to investigate the association between diabetes, hypertension, body mass index (BMI) or smoking with the risk of death in patients with COVID-19.Methods: Relevant observational studies were identified by searches in the PubMed and Embase databases through October 29, 2020. Random-effects models were used to estimate summary relative risks (SRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We further estimated the proportion of deaths attributable to these conditions. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the Cochrane methods and the GRADE framework. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020218115.Findings: A total of 186 studies representing 210,447 deaths among 1,304,587 patients with COVID-19 were included in this analysis. The SRR for death in COVID-19 patients was 1.54 (95% CI=1.44-1.64, I2=92%, n=145, low certainty) for diabetes and 1.42 (95% CI=1.30-1.54, I2=90%, n=127, low certainty) for hypertension compared to patients without each of these comorbidities. Regarding obesity, the SSR was 1.45 (95% CI=1.31-1.61, I2=91%, n=54, high certainty) for patients with BMI 30kg/m2 compared to those with BMI <30kg/m2 and 1.12 (95% CI=1.07-1.17, I2=68%, n=25) per 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI. There was evidence of a J-shaped non-linear dose-response relationship between BMI and mortality from COVID-19, with the nadir of the curve at a BMI of around 22-24, and a 1.5-2 fold increase in COVID-19 mortality with extreme obesity (BMI of 40-50). The SRR was 1.28 (95% CI=1.29-1.50, I2=74.0, n=28, low certainty) for ever, 1.29 (95% CI=1.03-1.62, I2=84%, n=19) for current and 1.26 (95% CI=1.11-1.42, I2=84%, n=14) for former smokers compared to never smokers. The proportion of deaths attributable to diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and smoking was 8%, 7%, 11%, and 2%, respectively.Interpretation: Our findings suggest that diabetes, hypertension, obesity and smoking are major contributors to COVID-19 mortality accounting for nearly 30% of COVID-19 deaths.Funding Statement: There was no funding source for this study.Declaration of Interests: We declare no competing interests.","output":"Diabetes, Hypertension, Body Mass Index, Smoking and COVID-19-Related Mortality: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An evaluation of the role played by the social work profession during the outbreak of COVID-19 is necessary Although social workers have made efforts to address peoples needs during the pandemic, it is worth examining the role they have played in safeguarding health equality Focusing on the case of Hong Kong, we found that the profession was generally ill-prepared for the outbreak, and in particular, for confronting the attendant social inequalities We identified three possible reasons for these findings: 1) non-governmental organizations were caught off-guard by the outbreak, 2) there was no clearly articulated intervention agenda to inform practitioners of the roles they should play in such a large-scale crisis, and 3) having become more formalized and standardized, social work services may have become less flexible in responding to emerging community needs We conclude this article by suggesting three directions that could allow the profession to better pursue its mission during large-scale crises ?

The genome encodes for the nsp12 protein, which houses the RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity responsible for the replication of the viral genome. A homology model of nsp12 was prepared using the structure of the SARS nsp12 (6NUR) as a model. The model was used to carry out in silico screening to identify molecules among natural products, or FDA approved drugs that can potentially inhibit the activity of nsp12. This exercise showed that vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) may bind to the active site of the nsp12 protein. A model of the nsp12 in complex with substrate RNA and incoming NTP showed that Vitamin B12 binding site overlaps with that of the incoming nucleotide. A comparison of the calculated energies of binding for RNA plus NTP and methylcobalamin suggested that the vitamin may bind to the active site of nsp12 with significant affinity. It is, therefore, possible that methylcobalamin binding may prevent association with RNA and NTP and thus inhibit the RdRP activity of nsp12. Overall, our computational studies suggest that methylcobalamin form of vitamin B12 may serve as an effective inhibitor of the nsp12 protein.","output":"Vitamin B12 May Inhibit RNA-Dependent-RNA Polymerase Activity of nsp12 from the SARS-CoV-2 Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the translating of the worldwide pandemic COVID-19 disease from South East Asia to Europe, north African countries accelerate their steps to follow WHO guidelines to prepare the outbreak response In March 2020, Tunisian ministry of health switched Abderrahmen Mami Hospital as a COVID-19 center Main objectives were management of patients but also setting-up new rules to permit enough safety for the staff members and harmony between medical, non medical and administrative departments within the facility Organization and communication during the accelerating rate preparation process were crucial to get enough qualified human resources, material resources and clear procedural texts just in time before cases arrival in huge numbers A group of medical and administrative experts within a central crisis unit brought this challenge into reality","output":"Switching to a Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) center : Lessons from Ariana Hospital experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article investigates the role of new digital technologies during a crisis period on the example of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the methods used by different states to prevent the spread of the virus and its consequences, the author analyzes the advantages of the impelled rapid digitalization, scrutinizes its negative aspects, and discusses perspectives. Although the digital transformation had already been taking place before the pandemic actually started (2019), the current crisis facilitates the unprecedented digitalization breakthrough in all life spheres, which will have delayed consequences. The short-run effects are already obvious: deepening of virtual communication;advancement of electronic document flow systems and online-services (including E-Government, public health service, etc.);virtualization of education, culture, sports, leisure activities;transformation of labour market towards distance employment, an outburst of electronic commerce and services, robot automation in economy;virtualization of political life (online-meetings, online-debates, online-summits, etc.), and, moreover, a transfer of power struggle and geopolitical struggle itself to digital platforms. Greater convenience and effectiveness are the most vivid advantages of digital technologies development, which plays the key role in crisis periods. Better access of disabled persons and people living in geographically remote places to medical aid, education, cultural objects, etc. also belongs to important achievements of the rapid digitalization. At the same time, there are significant negative aspects of this process, both general and specific. The violation of democratic rights and freedoms (primarily, of personal data security and individual privacy) is unavoidable in the light of the necessary \\"digital control\\" from the state to contain the spread of infection. Private IT companies participating in the process of the virus spread control due to their products (mobile applications, Internet platforms, etc.) also benefit from access to personal data. Whereas this issue is not central in authoritarian regimes like China, it becomes very challenging for democratic societies of the West. The digitalization of services gives wide room for irregularities and fraud in general. A growing \\"digital exclusion\\" is another concern: the greater dependency on technical means excludes certain parts of the population unable to use them for different reasons. An increasing individualization and solitude amid the lacking real-life communication gives rise to complicated psychological issues and mental disorders. Among specific negative side-effects of digitalization there are obstacles in personal electronic verification, worsening in the quality of remote medical assistance and online-education, unemployment growth and smashup of offline-businesses in economy, and some other. The most complicated question of the current crisis and the next \\"post-COVID\\" period is how serious the above-mentioned negative consequences of the rapid digitalization will be, to what extent they may devaluate its advantages, what sacrifice will be made by humanity to pay for comfort and effectiveness.","output":"THE ROLE OF NEW DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN A TIME OF CRISIS (Pandemic 2019-2021)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Software developers are turning to vlogs (video blogs) to share what a day is like to walk in their shoes.

A fourteen-amino-acid biotinylation sequence was inserted immediately after the N-terminal, His-tagged end of the construct in order to enable the attachment of a biotin moiety in vivo.

Here we show essential differences in the way prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC) process the RR signal from the olfactory bulb (OB) that may support dynamic, flexible PFC-HC coupling utilizing this input. We used inter-regional coherences and their correlations in rats, breathing at low rate (~ 2 Hz), outside of the short sniffing bouts. We found strong and stable OB-PFC coherence in wake states, contrasting OB-HC coherence which was low but highly variable. Importantly, this variability was essential for establishing PFC-HC synchrony at RR, whereas variations of RRO in OB and PFC had no significant effect. The findings help to understand the mechanism of rhythmic modulation of non-olfactory cognitive processes by the on-going regular respiration, reported in rodents as well as humans.

The IC50 of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 greatly increased from 50.0 g/mL (after the first episode) to 14.8 g/mL (after the second episode), and remained strongly reactive (20.1 l/mL) after 47 days of the second episode. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological, clinical, and serological analyses confirmed that the patient had re-infection instead of persistent viral shedding from first infection. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 re-infection may manifest as asymptomatic with increased neutralizing antibody levels. Further studies such as the virus characteristics, immunology, and epidemiology on SARS-CoV-2 re-infection are needed.","output":"Asymptomatic COVID-19 re-infection in a Japanese male by elevated half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of neutralizing antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Australian management plan for pandemic influenza (2005) highlighted a number of areas where more information may yield better plans for protecting Australia.

The purpose was to assess and triage potential COVID-19 symptoms and to reduce the number of calls to public health-care helplines. The device was used almost 150,000 times in a few weeks and was described by politicians and administrators as a solution and success. However, high usage cannot serve as the sole criterion of success. What might be adequate criteria? And should digital triage for citizens by default be considered low risk? METHODS: This paper reflects on the uncertain aspects of the performance, risks and issues of accountability pertaining to the digital diagnostic device in order to draw lessons for future improvements. The analysis is based on the principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM), the EU and US regulations of medical devices and the taxonomy of uncertainty in health care by Han et al. RESULTS: Lessons for future digital devices are (a) the need for clear criteria of success, (b) the importance of awareness of other severe diseases when triaging, (c) the priority of designing the device to collect data for evaluation and (d) clear allocation of responsibilities. CONCLUSIONS: A device meant to substitute triage for citizens according to its own criteria of success should not by default be considered as low risk. In a pandemic age dependent on digitalisation, it is therefore important not to abandon the ethos of EBM, but instead to prepare the ground for new ways of building evidence of effect.","output":"'You should see a doctor', said the robot: Reflections on a digital diagnostic device in a pandemic age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical student training in the United Kingdom has undoubtedly been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

While video-based interviews have been evaluated previously, we identified a gap in the literature on the implementation of video-based interviews, and how they compare to their face-to-face counterparts. Methods: A scoping review was conducted to consolidate the available literature on the benefits and limitations of video-based interviews, and to understand the perceived barriers associated with transitioning away from face-to-face interviews. A search strategy, developed in concert with an academic health sciences librarian, was run on Ovid Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Central. The search was performed on March 31, 2020, and updated on February 21, 2021. Studies that implemented and evaluated the impact of video-based interviewing in healthcare were included in our study. Review articles, and editorials were excluded. Results: Forty-three studies were included in our scoping review, of which 17 were conference abstracts and 26 were peer-reviewed manuscripts. The risk of bias was moderate or high in most studies, with only four studies having a low risk of bias. Both financial costs and opportunity costs associated with the selection process were reported to be improved with video-based interviewing, while the impact on environmental costs was not well explored. Technical limitations, which were not prevalent, were easily managed during the interview process. Overall, video-based interviews were well received by both applicants and interviewers, although most participants still reported a preference for face-to-face interviews. Conclusions: While video-based interviewing has become necessary during the Coronavirus 2019 era, there are benefits from a financial, opportunistic, and environmental point of view that argue for its continued use even after the pandemic. Despite its successful implementation with minimal technical issues, a preference still remains for face-to-face interviews. Reasons for this preference are not clear from the available literature.

This may account for some of the diversity in clinical outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe COVID-19. Although age is a risk factor for COVID-19, how age affects SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses remains unknown. We found that some pre-existing T cell responses to specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins, Spike (S) and Nucleoprotein (N), were significantly lower in elderly donors (>70 years old) who were seronegative for S than in young donors. However, substantial pre-existing T cell responses to the viral membrane (M) protein were detected in some elderly donors. These responses likely compensate for loss of T cell responses specific to S and N. In contrast, young and elderly donors exhibited comparable T cell responses to S, N, and M proteins after infection with SARS-CoV-2. M-specific responses were mediated by CD4 T cells producing interferon-{gamma} in both seronegative and seropositive individuals. T cells in seronegative elderly donors responded to various M-derived peptides, while the response after SARS-CoV-2 infection was apparently focused on a single peptide. These data suggest that diversity of target antigen repertoire for pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells declines with age, but the magnitude of pre-existing T cell responses is maintained by T cells reactive to specific viral proteins such as M. A better understanding of the role of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells that are less susceptible to age-related loss may contribute to development of more effective vaccines for elderly people.","output":"Altered pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in elderly individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transport companies, whose activities have a significant impact on the economy of the whole of Europe, constantly face new market challenges.

In this study, we analyzed the association between obesity and COVID-19 outcome (death, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, mechanical ventilation needs, quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [qSOFA] score, and confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure [CURB-65] scores) for hospitalized diabetic patients. METHODS: In this prospective hospital-based registry of patients with COVID-19 in East Azerbaijan, Iran, 368 consecutive diabetic patients with COVID-19 were followed from admission until discharge or death. Self-reported weight and height were used to calculate body mass index (kg/m(2)) upon admission. Our primary endpoint was analyzing obesity and COVID-19 mortality association. Assessing the associations among obesity and disease severity, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation was our secondary endpoint. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 317 patients and found no significant difference between obese and non-obese patients regarding frequency of death, invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, CURB-65, or qSOFA scores (P>0.05).

Our study was intended to investigate the emotional and psychological state of healthcare workers and look for the association between sociodemographic factors/profession-related condition and emotional state. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online among healthcare workers from various backgrounds. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed by the Chinese versions of the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), respectively. Supplementary questions (Supplementary Material) were recorded to describe the participants information about workplace violence, profession, and attitude related to the COVID pandemic. Wherever suitable, independent t-test, and one-way ANOVA were performed to detect group differences of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 total scores after grouping by sociodemographic variables, respectively, such as age, gender, marital status, educational level, after-tax income, department category, job title, experience of workplace violence, and anti-epidemic participation. Multiple linear regression analyses (stepwise method) were utilized in order to look for the potential associated factors of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 total scores. RESULTS: A total of 2,139 questionnaires with valid response were completed. Approximately 86.44% of participants had minimal symptoms of anxiety, 11.08% mild, 1.59% moderate, and 0.89% severe. Meanwhile, 81.34% had minimal symptoms of depression, 14.07% mild, 2.90% moderate, 1.17% moderately severe, and 0.51% severe. Students t-test showed that participants with female gender, with experience of workplace violence scored higher on both GAD-7 and PHQ-9, and participants with experience of anti-epidemic front-line work during pandemic scored lower on both GAD-7 and PHQ-9. ANOVA showed that participants aging from 31 to 40, with higher educational level, with middle level of annual after-tax income, with department of internal medicine or surgery, or with middle level of job title scored higher on both GAD-7 and PHQ-9. Regression analyses showed that female gender, high job title, and the experience of workplace violence positively were associated with anxiety or depression. Doctoral education, department (other vs. psychiatry), job enthusiasm, and professional self-identity were negatively associated with anxiety or depression. Additionally, psychological support was negatively associated with depression. CONCLUSION: As the epidemic prevention and control against COVID-19 become normalized in China, emotional state of healthcare workers deserves extensive attention. Our study revealed that gender, educational level, department category, job title, the experience of workplace violence, job enthusiasm, and professional self-identity are the most important influencing factors of physicians anxiety and depression.

BACKGROUND Ablation for AF is a highly effective strategy; however, the risk of transient ischemic attack and stroke is approximately 0.5% to 1%. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging studies report a 7% to 14% prevalence of silent cerebral infarction. Whether cerebral ischemia results in POCD after ablation for AF is not well established. METHODS The study included 150 patients; 60 patients undergoing ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), 30 patients undergoing ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation (PeAF), and 30 patients undergoing ablation for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) were compared with a matched nonoperative control group of patients with AF awaiting radiofrequency ablation (n = 30). Eight neuropsychological tests were administered at baseline and at 2 days and 90 days post-operatively. The tests were administered at the same time points to the nonoperative control group. The reliable change index was used to calculate POCD. RESULTS The prevalences of POCD at day 2 post-procedure were 28% in patients with PAF, 27% in patients with PeAF, 13% in patients with SVT, and 0% in control patients with AF (p = 0.007). At day 90, the prevalences of POCD were 13% in patients with PAF, 20% in patients with PeAF, 3% in patients with SVT, and 0% in control patients with AF (p = 0.03). When analyzing the 3 procedural groups together, 29 of 120 patients (24%) manifested POCD at day 2 and 15 of 120 patients (13%) at day 90 post-procedure (p = 0.029). On univariate analysis, increasing left atrial access time was associated with POCD at day 2 (p = 0.04) and day 90 (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Ablation for AF is associated with a 13% to 20% prevalence of POCD in patients with AF at long-term follow-up. These results were seen in a patient population with predominant CHADS2 (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age 75 years, Diabetes mellitus, previous Stroke/transient ischemic attack) scores of 0 to 1, representing the majority of patients undergoing ablation for AF. The long-term implications of these subtle changes require further study.","output":"Subtle post-procedural cognitive dysfunction after atrial fibrillation ablation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On February 21st, 2020, the first case of severe acute respiratory failure due to the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in Italy As of March 8th, 2020, Italy was the 2nd most affected country in the world As of March 6th, 2020, the Italian Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published the clinical ethics Recommendations for the allocation of intensive care treatments in exceptional, resource-limited circumstances, in order to support the clinicians involved in the care of critically-ill CoViD-19 patients and facing a scenario of imbalance between supply and demand of ICU beds The SIAARTI Recommendations have raised stir within the medical-scientific community, and also among legal experts, philosophers, and in the media The aims of this paper are: 1) to summarize the ethical foundations of the SIAARTI recommendations;2) to report the scientific evidence on which the recommendations are grounded;3) to describe the economic, organizational and epidemiological context;4) to reply to some of the criticisms","output":"Covid-19 Pandemic and Triage: Philosophy and the Law Sometimes Look at the Tree While Medicine Tries to Put out the Forest Fire"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emotion is a unique ability possessed by human beings as advanced creatures. Emotions give people a unique physical and mental experience. Assigning emotions to computer systems is one of the latest topics in artificial intelligence research. The purpose is to allow machines to achieve natural coordination between humans and computers. This article focuses on the visual expression of emotion in the dynamic three-dimensional painting system, creating an intelligent painting system and realizing a good user experience. In this paper, the discrete method is used to qualitatively analyze emotions, and the continuous method is used to quantify basic emotions, and emotional modeling and emotional quantitative analysis are proposed to realize quantitative analysis of emotions. Combining these two methods, a comprehensive method is proposed, which uses a continuous method to quantify the basic emotions of each discrete dimension, and finally superimposes them into a comprehensive emotional synthesis model. Emotion modeling is the basis of emotion visualization. Borrowing the relationship between emotion synthesis model and visual emotion elements, this article puts forward the concept of qualitative and quantitative visual emotion elements, and expounds that the multidimensional superposition of visual emotion elements makes dynamic three-dimensional painting system emotions. The experimental results in this article show that the emotional visualization scheme of 100 samples is tested by quantitative statistical methods to demonstrate its effectiveness. Starting from 5 points of concern, the emotion visualization method discussed in this article can indeed convey or suggest a certain positive emotion (the average value of experience, transitivity, and infectiousness > 2.5, and the variance is close to 0), but we also found this recognition at the same time The degree is not high enough, and individual differences are large (mean value < 2.5, variance close to 1). This can indicate that different subjects have different feelings and evaluations of this emotional visualization.

Front-end code is included in this architecture by using server-side rendering of JS bundles. Environments for integration testing are created with preproduction deploys side by side with production deploys using appropriate levels of isolation. After a successful integration test run, preproduction components are known to work with production precisely as it is. For isolation, test traffic uses staging databases that are copied daily from the production databases, omitting sensitive data.

The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence, time of onset, and duration of anosmia in patients with COVID-19 infection and the association of anosmia with other symptoms and eosinophil count. Material and Methods: Two hundred patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, who were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic were assessed for olfaction with a nonirritant odor. The presence of anosmia was recorded, and a questionnaire integrating the anosmia reporting tool was filled. Patients with anosmia/hyposmia were followed telephonically at 7 and 14 days for resolution of anosmia and other symptoms. The presence of anosmia was correlated with eosinophil count. Results: Of the 200 COVID-19 patients, 87% were symptomatic. More than half of the patients had fever (56%). Anosmia was observed in 30% of the patients and hyposmia in 4% of patients. In 41% of the patients, olfactory loss was reported before diagnosis. The mean duration of anosmia was 7.8 ( 5) days;97% of patients recovered with a resolution of symptoms within 2 weeks. Ageusia was the most commonly and significantly associated symptom with anosmia (66%, n = 45) followed by sore throat (41%), and rhinorrhea (28%). The symptoms in both the sexes were comparable. Absolute eosinophil count of &lt;40/L was observed in 59 patients (29.5%) and an absolute eosinophil count of 0 in 17 patients (8.5%). Among the 68 anosmic patients, 36 (47%) patients had eosinopenia, which was statistically significant. Conclusion: Anosmia is an early and sometimes the only symptom in approximately one-third of the patients with COVID-19 infection. Eosinophil count should be checked in anosomic patient with suspicion of COVID-19 infection.

This study aimed to assess the level and associated factors of fear and depression amid the COVID-19 pandemic among the adult population of Bangladesh. METHODS: After providing informed consent, 1050 participants completed the cross-sectional online survey tool. Depressive symptoms and fear were assessed through the PHQ-9 and validated fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), respectively. Linear regression analysis was performed to predict potential factors of fear and depression. RESULTS: The study finds that females had higher scores for fear of COVID-19 scale (1' = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.15 to 2.47) and Patient Health Questionnaire (2' = 1.92; 95% CI: 0.95 to 2.88) than their male counterpart. Respondents considering the virus to be extremely dangerous had higher scores for FCV-19S (1' = 1.55; 95% CI: 0.66 to 2.44) and PHQ-9 (2 = 1.59; 95% CI: 0.25 to 2.92).

However, in an early phase, after a sudden and unforeseen shock has caused unexpected and fast-changing dynamics, data from traditional statistics are only available with non-negligible time delays. This leaves policymakers uncertain about how to most effectively manage their economic countermeasures to support businesses, especially when they need to respond quickly, as in the COVID-19 pandemic. Given this information deficit, we propose a framework that guided policymakers throughout all stages of this unforeseen economic shock by providing timely and reliable sources of firm-level data as a basis to make informed policy decisions. We do so by combining early stage ad hoc web analyses, follow-up business surveys, and retrospective analyses of firm outcomes. A particular focus of our framework is on assessing the early effects of the pandemic, using highly dynamic and large-scale data from corporate websites. Most notably, we show that textual references to the coronavirus pandemic published on a large sample of company websites and state-of-the-art text analysis methods allowed to capture the heterogeneity of the pandemics effects at a very early stage and entailed a leading indication on later movements in firm credit ratings. While the proposed framework is specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, the integration of results obtained from real-time online sources in the design of subsequent surveys and their value in forecasting firm-level outcomes typically targeted by policy measures, is a first step towards a more timely and holistic approach for policy guidance in times of economic shocks.","output":"An integrated data framework for policy guidance during the coronavirus pandemic: Towards real-time decision support for economic policymakers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We provide new evidence on the drivers of the early US coronavirus pandemic.

Selected patients may benefit from methods to alter toxin pharmacokinetics to minimize systemic, target organ, or tissue compartment exposure (either by decreasing absorption or increasing elimination). These may include syrup of ipecac, orogastric lavage, activated single- or multi-dose charcoal, whole bowel irrigation, endoscopy and surgery, urinary alkalinization, saline diuresis, or extracorporeal methods (hemodialysis, charcoal hemoperfusion, continuous venovenous hemofiltration, and exchange transfusion).

The supply and consumption of seafood is influenced by a range of drivers including ecosystem change and ocean regulation, the influence of corporations and evolving consumer demand, as well as the growing focus on the importance of seafood for meeting nutritional needs. These drivers need to be examined in a holistic way to develop an informed understanding of the needs, potential impacts and solutions that align seafood production and consumption with relevant 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper uses an evidence-based narrative approach to examine how the anticipated global trends for seafood might be experienced by people in different social, geographical and economic situations over the next ten years. Key drivers influencing seafood within the global food system are identified and used to construct a future scenario based on our current trajectory (Business-as-usual 2030). Descriptive pathways and actions are then presented for a more sustainable future scenario that strives towards achieving the SDGs as far as technically possible (More sustainable 2030). Prioritising actions that not only sustainably produce more seafood, but consider aspects of access and utilisation, particularly for people affected by food insecurity and malnutrition, is an essential part of designing sustainable and secure future seafood systems.

This study aimed to determine the extent to which the 24-h allocation of time to different physical behaviors changes between days working at the office (WAO) and days WFH in office workers during the pandemic. METHODS: Data were collected on 27 office workers with full-time employment at a Swedish municipal division during the COVID-19 outbreak in MayCJuly 2020. A thigh-worn accelerometer (Axivity) was used to assess physical behavior (sedentary, stand, move) during seven consecutive days. A diary was used to identify periods of work, leisure and sleep. 24-h compositions of sedentary, standing and moving behaviors during work and non-work time were examined using Compositional data analysis (CoDA), and differences between days WAO and days WFH were determined using repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Days WFH were associated with more time spent sleeping relative to awake, and the effect size was large (F = 7.4; p = 0.01; (p)(2) = 0.22). The increase (34 min) in sleep time during WFH occurred at the expense of a reduction in work and leisure time by 26 min and 7 min, respectively.

The primary safety end point, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was the first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE; a composite of death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke), pooled across the two trials. Secondary safety end points included expanded MACE (MACE plus hospitalization for either heart failure or a thromboembolic event). The primary and key secondary efficacy end points in each trial were the mean change in hemoglobin concentration from baseline during two evaluation periods: weeks 24 through 36 and weeks 40 through 52. RESULTS A total of 1751 patients with ESA-untreated NDD-CKD and 1725 with ESA-treated NDD-CKD underwent randomization in the two trials. In the pooled analysis, in which 1739 patients received vadadustat and 1732 received darbepoetin alfa, the hazard ratio for MACE was 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.36), which did not meet the prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.25. The mean between-group differences in the change in the hemoglobin concentration at weeks 24 through 36 were 0.05 g per deciliter (95% CI, -0.04 to 0.15) in the trial involving ESA-untreated patients and -0.01 g per deciliter (95% CI, -0.09 to 0.07) in the trial involving ESA-treated patients, which met the prespecified noninferiority margin of -0.75 g per deciliter.

These rationally designed new treatment methods have the potential to change the therapeutic landscape in multiple myeloma and improve the long-term survival outcome. ABSTRACT: SeverFigurel cellular elements of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in multiple myeloma (MM) patients contribute to the immune evasion, proliferation, and drug resistance of MM cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated M2-like, alternatively activated macrophages, CD38+ regulatory B-cells (Bregs), and regulatory T-cells (Tregs). These immunosuppressive elements in bidirectional and multi-directional crosstalk with each other inhibit both memory and cytotoxic effector T-cell populations as well as natural killer (NK) cells. Immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs), protease inhibitors (PI), monoclonal antibodies (MoAb), adoptive T-cell/NK cell therapy, and inhibitors of anti-apoptotic signaling pathways have emerged as promising therapeutic platforms that can be employed in various combinations as part of a rationally designed immunomodulatory strategy against an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in MM. These platforms provide the foundation for a new therapeutic paradigm for achieving improved survival of high-risk newly diagnosed as well as relapsed/refractory MM patients. Here we review the scientific rationale and clinical proof of concept for each of these platforms.","output":"Overcoming the Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironment in Multiple Myeloma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With the advent of data-intensive science, a full integration of big data science and health care will bring a cross-field revolution to the medical community in China. The concept big data represents not only a technology but also a resource and a method. Big data are regarded as an important strategic resource both at the national level and at the medical institutional level, thus great importance has been attached to the construction of a big data platform for health care. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop and implement a big data platform for a large hospital, to overcome difficulties in integrating, calculating, storing, and governing multisource heterogeneous data in a standardized way, as well as to ensure health care data security. METHODS: The project to build a big data platform at West China Hospital of Sichuan University was launched in 2017. The West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform has extracted, integrated, and governed data from different departments and sections of the hospital since January 2008. A masterCslave mode was implemented to realize the real-time integration of multisource heterogeneous massive data, and an environment that separates heterogeneous characteristic data storage and calculation processes was built. A business-based metadata model was improved for data quality control, and a standardized health care data governance system and scientific closed-loop data security ecology were established. RESULTS: After 3 years of design, development, and testing, the West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform was formally brought online in November 2020. It has formed a massive multidimensional data resource database, with more than 12.49 million patients, 75.67 million visits, and 8475 data variables. Along with hospital operations data, newly generated data are entered into the platform in real time. Since its launch, the platform has supported more than 20 major projects and provided data service, storage, and computing power support to many scientific teams, facilitating a shift in the data support modelfrom conventional manual extraction to self-service retrieval (which has reached 8561 retrievals per month). CONCLUSIONS: The platform can combine operation systems data from all departments and sections in a hospital to form a massive high-dimensional high-quality health care database that allows electronic medical records to be used effectively and taps into the value of data to fully support clinical services, scientific research, and operations management. The West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform can successfully generate multisource heterogeneous data storage and computing power. By effectively governing massive multidimensional data gathered from multiple sources, the West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform provides highly available data assets and thus has a high application value in the health care field. The West China Hospital of Sichuan University big data platform facilitates simpler and more efficient utilization of electronic medical record data for real-world research.","output":"Big Data Health Care Platform With Multisource Heterogeneous Data Integration and Massive High-Dimensional Data Governance for Large Hospitals: Design, Development, and Application"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nucleic acid aptamers specific to S-protein and its receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2) virions are of high interest as potential inhibitors of viral infection and recognizing elements in biosensors.

There are some 274 species worldwide, distributed in Africa and the Asia-Pacific. To date, only five complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of Dacus fruit flies have been published and are available in the GenBank. METHODS AND RESULTS: In view of the lack of study on their mitogenome, we sequenced (by next generation sequencing) and annotated the complete mitogenome of D. vijaysegarani from Malaysia to determine its features and phylogenetic relationship. The whole mitogenome of D. vijaysegarani has identical gene order with the published mitogenomes of the genus Dacus, with 13 protein-coding genes, two rRNA genes, 22 tRNAs, a non-coding A + T rich control region, and intergenic spacer and overlap sequences. Phylogenetic analysis based on 15 mitochondrial genes (13 PCGs and two rRNA genes), reveals Dacus, Zeugodacus and Bactrocera forming a distinct clade. The genus Dacus forms a monophyletic group in the subclade containing also the Zeugodacus group; this Dacus-Zeugodacus subclade is distinct from the Bactrocera subclade. D. (Mellesis) vijaysegarani forms a lineage with D. (Mellesis) trimacula in the subcluster containing also the lineage of D. (Mellesis) conopsoides and D. (Callantra) longicornis. D.

Objectives: To prospectively assess the incidence of objectively proven venous thromboembolism (VTE) and identify predisposing risk factors in a cohort of hospitalized patients with acute COVID-19 pneumonia undergoing prophylactic-dose heparin. Patients and methods: All consecutive patients admitted for acute COVID-19 pneumonia to the General Internal Medicine Unit of Padova University Hospital, Italy between November 2020 and April 2021, and undergoing prophylactic-dose heparin, were enrolled. Demographic and clinical characteristics and laboratory and radiological findings were recorded on admission. Cases were patients who developed VTE during their hospital stay. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to ascertain the risk factors associated with developing in-hospital VTE. Results: 208 patients (median age: 77 years; M/F 98/110) were included; 37 (18%) developed in-hospital VTE during a median follow-up of 10 days (IQR, 4C18). VTE patients were significantly younger (p = 0.004), more obese (p = 0.002), and had a lower Padua prediction score (p < 0.03) and reduced PaO2/FIO2 ratio (p < 0.03) vs. controls. Radiological findings of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were significantly more frequent in VTE patients than controls (p = 0.003). Multivariable regression showed that obesity (1.75, 95% CI 1.02C3.36; p = 0.04) and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on X-rays (2.39, 95% CI 1.22C5.69; p = 0.04) were correlated with increased risk of in-hospital VTE. Conclusions: Obesity and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on imaging may help clinicians to identify patients admitted to medical wards for acute COVID-19 pneumonia at risk of developing VTE despite prophylactic-dose heparin. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether the administration of therapeutic/intermediate-dose heparin may help prevent VTE episodes without further increasing the bleeding risk.","output":"Risk Factors of Venous Thromboembolism in Noncritically Ill Patients Hospitalized for Acute COVID-19 Pneumonia Receiving Prophylactic-Dose Anticoagulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the prevalence and impact of atrioventricular valve (AVV) regurgitation in patients with single ventricle physiology has become increasingly apparent, the optimal timing for valve intervention is unclear. To investigate this, we performed a retrospective review of all 1,167 patients from the Mayo Clinic Fontan database. Thirteen percent (153 patients) had AVV repair or replacement during their staged single ventricle palliation. We found that patients with right ventricular morphology and common AVV were at increased risk for AVV intervention. Patients who underwent AVV intervention had increased risk of death/transplant compared to those who did not (hazards ratio (HR)=1.75, 95% CI 1.37-2.23, p<0.001). With respect to valve intervention timing, while AVV intervention prior to Fontan presented similar risk for death/transplant compared to no AVV intervention (HR=0.85, 95% CI 0.32-2.27, p=0.74), intervention at time of Fontan had a significantly higher risk (HR=1.46, 95% CI 1.09-1.97, p=0.01), and intervention after Fontan had a much more substantial risk (HR=3.83, 95% CI 2.54-5.79, p<0.001). AVV repair failure occurred in 11% of patients. In terms of relative risk of valve repair versus replacement, in post-Fontan AVV intervention patients, AVV replacement carried a 2.9 fold risk of death/transplant compared to AVV repair. In conclusion, AVV disease remains a considerable challenge for durable Fontan physiology. This data demonstrates that earlier intervention on valve pathology improves survival with the Fontan circulation. Continued surveillance of single ventricle patients and prompt referral of those with valve pathology can improve outcomes in this challenging population.","output":"Effect of Earlier Atrioventricular Valve Intervention on Survival After the Fontan Operation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Presently, the world is infected by COVID 19 virus which has created an emergency public health.

This work aims to study the epidemiological features of epidemics in different Nigerian regions and quantify the association between reproduction number (R) and state rainfall. We quantify the infectivity of LF by the reproduction numbers estimated from four different growth models: the Richards, three-parameter logistic, Gompertz and Weibull growth models. LF surveillance data are used to fit the growth models and estimate the Rs and epidemic turning points () in different regions at different time periods. Cochran's Q test is further applied to test the spatial heterogeneity of the LF epidemics. A linear random-effect regression model is adopted to quantify the association between R and state rainfall with various lag terms.

The interest in ESG investing creates greater demand for ESG data, ratings, and rankings, spawning a proliferation of agencies offering these products, which investors, academics, and regulators rely on unquestioningly. Research highlights that different ESG ratings and rankings produce significantly different assessments of the ESG performance of companies. This article examines the causes of differences in the ratings and rankings generated by different agencies. Findings indicate that the divergences among raters can be attributed to differences in the definitions of ESG constructs (i.e., a theorization problem) and methodological differences (i.e., a commensurability problem). While users of ESG ratings and rankings are advised to study the definitions and methodologies before their use, a lack of transparency about the data sources, weightings, and methodologies makes it difficult to ensure that companies true ESG performance is accounted for when making portfolio selection and investment decisions.

The two aims of this work were to assess the performances of SOFIA(?)RSV tests in real-life-laboratory conditions (study 1) and implemented at point-of-care testing in a pediatric emergency department (ED, study 2), during two consecutive winter seasons. METHODS: In study 1, fresh nasopharyngeal swabs from patients of all ages were sampled in 1.5 ml of Universal virological Transport Medium (UTM) and prospectively tested using SOFIA(?)RSV tests. In study 2, conducted in a pediatric ED, nasopharyngeal swabs were placed in 3 ml of UTM. All SOFIA(?)RSV tests were confirmed by molecular testing, considered as reference method. The epidemiological and clinical features of tested patients, as well as the care of these patients after obtaining quick results were evaluated. RESULTS: The sensitivities of SOFIA(?)RSV in infants (aged under 24 months) performed in the laboratory and in the pediatric ED were respectively 95% (95% CI: 86.8C98.1) and 74.8% (95% CI: 68.0C80.9) compared to PCR. In study 1, the sensitivity among children (from 2 to 15 years old) and adults (above 15 years old) dropped to 45% (95% CI: 23.1C68.5) and 59% (95% CI: 32.9C81.6), respectively.

Blood inventory management that relies heavily on experience-based decisions may not be adaptive to real demand, leading to high operational costs, wastage, and shortages. METHODS We combined statistical modeling, machine learning, and optimization methods to develop a data-driven demand forecasting and inventory management strategy for red blood cells (RBCs). We then used the strategy to inform daily blood orders. A secondary semi-weekly (twice per week) ordering strategy was developed to handle the last-mile split delivery problem for blood suppliers, characterized by multi-deliveries to the same location multiple times during a short period of time. Both strategies were evaluated using the TRUST database including all patient data across four hospitals in Hamilton, Ontario. RESULTS We identified 227,944 RBC transfusions for 40,787 patients in Hamilton, Ontario from 2012 to 2018. The predicted daily demand from the hybrid demand forecasting model was not significantly different from the actual daily demand (paired t-test p-value = 0.163); however, the proposed daily ordering quantity from the model was significantly lower than the actual ordering quantity (p-value <0.001). The proposed daily ordering strategy reduced inventory levels by 38.4% without risk of shortages, leading to an overall cost reduction of 43.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 42.3%, 43.7%) compared with the actual cost. The semi-weekly ordering strategy reduced ordering frequency by 62.6% (95% CI: 61.5%, 63.7%). CONCLUSION The proposed data-driven ordering strategy combining demand forecasting and inventory optimization can achieve significant cost savings for healthcare systems and blood suppliers.","output":"From demand forecasting to inventory ordering decisions for red blood cells through integrating machine learning, statistical modeling, and inventory optimization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The presence of respiratory information within the pulse oximeter signal (PPG) is a well-documented phenomenon. However, extracting this information for the purpose of continuously monitoring respiratory rate requires: (1) the recognition of the multi-faceted manifestations of respiratory modulation components within the PPG and the complex interactions among them; (2) the implementation of appropriate advanced signal processing techniques to take full advantage of this information; and (3) the post-processing infrastructure to deliver a clinically useful reported respiratory rate to the end user. A holistic algorithmic approach to the problem is therefore required. We have developed the RR(OXI) algorithm based on this principle and its performance on healthy subject trial data is described herein. METHODS Finger PPGs were collected from a cohort of 139 healthy adult volunteers monitored during free breathing over an 8-min period. These were subsequently processed using a novel in-house algorithm based on continuous wavelet transform technology within an infrastructure incorporating weighted averaging and logical decision making processes. The computed oximeter respiratory rates (RR(oxi)) were then compared to an end-tidal CO2 reference rate RR(ETCO2). RESULTS RR(ETCO2) ranged from a lowest recorded value of 2.97 breaths per min (br/min) to a highest value of 28.02 br/min. The mean rate was 14.49 br/min with standard deviation of 4.36 br/min. Excellent agreement was found between RR(oxi) and RR(ETCO2), with a mean difference of -0.23 br/min and standard deviation of 1.14 br/min. The two measures are tightly spread around the line of agreement with a strong correlation observable between them (R2 = 0.93).

Active school transport (AST) and gamification are potential methods for increasing childrens daily physical activity. We previously developed a game named Tic-Tac-Training for promoting active transport at workplaces; however, the game has not been applied to AST. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to investigate how Tic-Tac-Training functions to promote AST among schoolchildren in northern Sweden, improve the game to be more suitable for schoolchildren, and construct a road map for future development based on childrens ideas. METHODS: First, we developed Tic-Tac-Training using the Scrum agile software development method. Second, we conducted a questionnaire-based formative evaluation of the game with schoolchildren (n=16; 9/16, 56% male; 6/16, 38% female; and 1/16, 6% other aged 11-12 years) in Lule?, Sweden. Third, we conducted focus group interviews with 33 children (13/33, 39% male and 20/33, 61% female aged 12-13 years) to gather ideas for gamifying AST. We mapped the interview results to the Octalysis gamification framework and established a road map for future development. RESULTS: The formative evaluation revealed several issues, including a lack of interesting game features, lack of support for continuous engagement, disliked competitive features, and lack of incentives for discourse and participation. New features such as rewards, collectibles, and levels were implemented based on the results. The focus group interviews revealed additional ideas for gamifying AST, such as using avatars, in-game currency and trading, and context-sensitive tasks. CONCLUSIONS: The results have several potential impacts on how reusable, gamified AST interventions can be developed and what kind of gamification elements schoolchildren in northern Sweden wish to see. These results can interest game researchers and teachers who wish to apply gamification in school contexts.

Purpose To investigate 3D quantitative ablation margins (3D-QAMs) as an algorithm to predict ASR within 1 year after stereotactic microwave ablation (SMWA) for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Materials and Methods Sixty-five tumors in 47 patients from a prospective multicenter study of patients undergoing SMWA for CRLM were included in this retrospective 3D-QAM analysis. Using a previously developed algorithm, 3D-QAM defined as the distribution of tumor to ablation surface distances was assessed in co-registered pre- and post-ablation CT scans. The discriminatory power and optimal cutoff values for 3D-QAM were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Multivariable logistic regression analysis using generalized estimating equations was applied to investigate the impact of various 3D-QAM outputs on 1-year ASR while accounting for other known influencing factors. Results Ten of the 65 (15.4%) tumors included for 3D-QAM analysis developed ASR. ROC analyses identified i) 3D-QAM <1 mm for >23% of the tumor surface, ii) 3D-QAM <5 mm for >45%, and iii) the minimal ablation margin (MAM) as the 3D-QAM outputs with optimal discriminatory qualities. The multivariable regression model without 3D-QAM yielded tumor diameter and KRAS mutation as 1-year ASR predictors. When adding 3D-QAM, this factor became the main predictor of 1-year ASR [odds ratio (OR) 21.67 (CI 2.48, 165.21) if defined as >23% <1 mm; OR 0.52 (CI 0.29, 0.95) if defined as MAM]. Conclusions 3D-QAM allows objectifiable and standardized assessment of tumor coverage by the ablation zone after SMWA.

A major driver leading to the lack of emphasis on timely ICU nutrition delivery is lack of objective data to guide nutrition care. If we are to ultimately overcome current fundamental challenges to effective ICU nutrition delivery, we must all adopt routine objective, longitudinal measurement of energy targets via indirect calorimetry (IC). Key evidence supporting the routine use of IC in the ICU includes (1) universal societal ICU nutrition guidelines recommending IC to determine energy requirements; (2) data showing predictive equations or body weight calculations that are consistently inaccurate and correlate poorly with measured energy expenditure, ultimately leading to routine overfeeding and underfeeding, which are both associated with poor ICU outcomes; (3) recent development and worldwide availability of a new validated, accurate, easy-to-use IC device; and (4) recent data in ICU patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) showing progressive hypermetabolism throughout ICU stay, emphasizing the inaccuracy of predictive equations and marked day-to-day variability in nutrition needs. Thus, given the availability of a new validated IC device, these findings emphasize that routine longitudinal IC measures should be considered the new standard of care for ICU and post-ICU nutrition delivery. As we would not deliver vasopressors without accurate blood pressure measurements, the ICU community is only likely to embrace an increased focus on the importance of early nutrition delivery when we can consistently provide objective IC measures to ensure personalized nutrition care delivers the right nutrition dose, in the right patient, at the right time to optimize clinical outcomes.","output":"Point-Counterpoint: Indirect Calorimetry Is Essential for Optimal Nutrition Therapy in the Intensive Care Unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus causes respiratory infections in humans.

High-density lipoproteins (HDL) have two kinds of interactions with this barrier. First, bloodborne HDL must pass the endothelium to access extravascular tissues, for example the arterial wall or the brain, to mediate cholesterol efflux from macrophages and other cells or exert other functions. To complete reverse cholesterol transport, HDL must even pass the endothelium a second time to re-enter circulation via the lymphatics. Transendothelial HDL transport is a regulated process involving scavenger receptor SR-BI, endothelial lipase, and ATP binding cassette transporters A1 and G1. Second, HDL helps to maintain the integrity of the endothelial barrier by (i) promoting junction closure as well as (ii) repair by stimulating the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and their progenitor cells, and by preventing (iii) loss of glycocalix, (iv) apoptosis, as well as (v) transmigration of inflammatory cells. Additional vasoprotective functions of HDL include (vi) the induction of nitric oxide (NO) production and (vii) the inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. These vasoprotective functions are exerted by the interactions of HDL particles with SR-BI as well as specific agonists carried by HDL, notably sphingosine-1-phophate (S1P), with their specific cellular counterparts, e.g., S1P receptors.

Methods: A comprehensive systematic literature search of medical electronic databases including Pubmed/Medline, Europe PMC, and Google Scholar was performed for relevant data published from January 1, 2020 to June 26, 2020. Observational studies reporting clear extractable data on inflammatory parameters in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. Screening of articles, data extraction and quality assessment were carried out by two authors independently. Standardized mean difference (SMD)/mean difference (MD/WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random or fixed-effects models. Results: A total of 83 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Of which, 54 studies were grouped by severity, 25 studies were grouped by mortality, and 04 studies were grouped by both severity and mortality. Random effect model results demonstrated that patients with severe COVID-19 group had significantly higher levels of C-reaction protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-2R (IL-2R), serum amyloid A (SAA) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) compared to those in the non-severe group.

Se presentan modelos alternativos a las residencias tradicionales y a la manera habitual de relacin con el sistema pblico de salud, que unen a otras ventajas la de haber mostrado capacidades excelentes para proteger de la COVID-19 a las personas mayores que viven en estos centros. Entre estos modelos destacan diferentes tipos de viviendas de grupo, modalidades de coordinacin sociosanitaria basadas en la gestin de casos y en la dotacin de profesionales sanitarios desde el sistema de salud.

The effects of COVID-19 pandemic on older people living in care homes have been devastating. In Spain approximately 3% of the cases and 40% of the deaths have occurred in this group. In addition, due to measures taken to control the crisis, the incidence of geriatric syndromes has increased, and residents fundamental rights have been violated. In this article we describe structural factors of care homes and their relationship with public health services that have influenced the impact of the pandemic. We suggest different types of group homes, and models of provision/coordination with public health services that have given excellent results protecting nursing homes residents from the COVID-19, as alternative models to conventional residences and to the regular provision of health care services. We recommend that these successful experiences are taken into account in the transformation of the social-health model (to one integrated and focused on people) that has begun to be implemented in some Autonomous Communities of Spain.","output":"COVID-19 en residencias de mayores: factores estructurales y experiencias que avalan un cambio de modelo en Espa?a"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first Covid-19 patient was admitted to Montefiore Medical Center (MMC) on March 10, 2020 Soon thereafter there was a rapid and exponential surge of Covid-19 admissions to MMC that could have resulted in catastrophic consequences if MMC had been overwhelmed, as happened in Europe To adjust to this crisis our institution, under the inspiring leadership of Dr Philip Ozuah, President and CEO of Montefiore Medicine, adopted an \\"all hands on deck\\" approach, mobilizing our entire workforce to expand our units to accommodate the growing number of patients being admitted Given that the internal medicine (IM) and ICU units are part of the department of medicine (DOM), the DOM was at the center of this mobilization The DOM is the largest department at MMC and mobilizing it required careful planning, seamless teamwork, and strong leadership To achieve that goal, we applied a framework that we designate the \\"3C framework,\\" denoting Coordination, Communication, and Collaboration In this report we describe the many initiatives the Montefiore Einstein DOM implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic using the 3C framework These included establishing the Medicine Covid-19 Taskforce to lead our efforts, starting a daily newsletter for up-to-date communications, rapidly expanding the ICU and IM units, converting most specialty inpatient consults to eConsults, coordinating research studies, and more The goal of this report is to serve as a guide on how the 3C framework helped us organize, mobilize, and energize the department of medicine effectively and efficiently during this unprecedented crisis","output":"Teamwork and Leadership Under Fire at the Epicenter of the COVID-19 Epidemic in the Bronx"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs) require immunosuppression to reduce disease activity, but this also has important possible detrimental impacts on immune responses following vaccination.

To highlight the different membrane-active regions of NS2A, we characterized the effects of peptides derived from a peptide library encompassing this proteins full length on different membranes by measuring their membrane leakage induction and modulation of lipid phase behavior.

This peptide presents an interfacial/hydrophobic pattern characteristic of a membrane-proximal segment. We show that dens25 strongly interacts with membranes that contain a large proportion of lipid molecules with a formal negative charge, and that this effect has a major electrostatic contribution.

To place recent findings into context, we compared symptoms and functional health status in two independent samples assessed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants were recruited via an online panel using quota sampling. We assessed symptoms, functional health, and global quality of life with the EORTC QLQ-C30 in two general population samples in Spain (collected in July 2019 and April 2020). We also assessed several COVID-19 related variables, such as adherence to social distancing. RESULTS: Data from N = 1010 participants before the pandemic (mean age 47.1 years, 50.5% female) were compared with data from N = 504 participants during the pandemic (mean age 47.1 years, 50.8% female). Participants during the pandemic (vs. before the pandemic) reported lower role functioning and emotional functioning, as well as less symptom burden. A lower degree of social distancing was associated with better functional health and lower symptom burden. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on functional health and symptom burden in the Spanish general population.

Alongside other specialized pharmacists, we re-evaluated daily processes and therapies used to treat COVID-19 patients within our institutions from a cardiovascular perspective and share what we have learned. Objectives: To develop a collaborative approach for cardiology issues and concerns in the care of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients by drawing on the experiences of cardiology pharmacists across the country. Methods: On March 26, 2020, a conference call was convened composed of 24 cardiology residency-trained pharmacists (23 actively practicing in cardiology and 1 in critical care) from 16 institutions across the United States to discuss cardiology issues each have encountered with COVID-19 patients. Discussion centered around providing optimal pharmaceutical care while limiting staff exposure. Results: The collaborative of pharmacists found for the ST-elevation myocardial infarction patient, many institutions were diverting COVID-19 rule-out patients to their Emergency Department (ED). Thrombolytics are an alternative to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) allowing for timely treatment of patients and decreased staff exposure. An emergency response grab and go kit includes initial drugs and airway equipment so the patient can be treated and the cart can be left outside the room. Cardiology pharmacists have developed policies and procedures to address monitoring of QT prolonging medications, the use of inhaled prostacyclins, and national drug shortages. Technology has allowed us to practice social distancing, while staying in close contact with our teams, patients, and colleagues and continuing to teach. Residents are engaged in unique decision-making processes with their preceptors and assist as pharmacist extenders.

Microbiota constitutes part of the inner and outer environment of the plant. This Umwelt underlies steady dynamics, due to complex local and global biotic and abiotic changes. Hence, adaptive plant holobiont responses are crucial for continuous metabolic adjustment at the systems level. Plants require oxygen-dependent respiration for energy-dependent adaptive morphology, such as germination, root and shoot growth, and formation of adventitious, clonal, and reproductive organs, fruits, and seeds. Fermentative paths can help in acclimation and, to our view, the role of alternative oxidase (AOX) in coordinating complex metabolic and physiological adjustments is underestimated. Cellular levels of sucrose are an important sensor of environmental stress. We explored the role of exogenous sucrose and its interplay with AOX during early seed germination. We found that sucrose-dependent initiation of fermentation during the first 12 h after imbibition (HAI) was beneficial to germination. However, parallel upregulated AOX expression was essential to control negative effects by prolonged sucrose treatment. Early downregulated AOX activity until 12 HAI improved germination efficiency in the absence of sucrose but suppressed early germination in its presence. The results also suggest that seeds inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can buffer sucrose stress during germination to restore normal respiration more efficiently. Following this approach, we propose a simple method to identify organic seeds and low-cost on-farm perspectives for early identifying disease tolerance, predicting plant holobiont behavior, and improving germination. Furthermore, the research strengthens the view that AOX can serve as a powerful functional marker source for seed hologenomes.","output":"Adaptive Reprogramming During Early Seed Germination Requires Temporarily Enhanced Fermentation-A Critical Role for Alternative Oxidase Regulation That Concerns Also Microbiota Effectiveness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fast and reliable detection of patients with severe and heterogeneous illnesses is a major goal of precision medicine1,2.

However, there are few antiviral drugs that can effectively treat these infections. The standard approach in the development of antiviral drugs involves the identification of a unique viral target, followed by the design of an agent that addresses that target. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent a novel source of potential antiviral drugs. AMPs have been shown to inactivate numerous different enveloped viruses through the disruption of their viral envelopes. However, the clinical development of AMPs as antimicrobial therapeutics has been hampered by a number of factors, especially their enzymatically labile structure as peptides. We have examined the antiviral potential of peptoid mimics of AMPs (sequence-specific N-substituted glycine oligomers). These peptoids have the distinct advantage of being insensitive to proteases, and also exhibit increased bioavailability and stability. Our results demonstrate that several peptoids exhibit potent in vitro antiviral activity against both HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 when incubated prior to infection. In other words, they have a direct effect on the viral structure, which appears to render the viral particles non-infective. Visualization by cryo-EM shows viral envelope disruption similar to what has been observed with AMP activity against other viruses. Furthermore, we observed no cytotoxicity against primary cultures of oral epithelial cells. These results suggest a common or biomimetic mechanism, possibly due to the differences between the phospholipid head group makeup of viral envelopes and host cell membranes, thus underscoring the potential of this class of molecules as safe and effective broad-spectrum antiviral agents.

METHODS: This study was performed in 155 children hospitalized with MP pneumonia. The clinical features and laboratory and radiographic findings on admission in children with positive or negative MP-specific IgM titers were retrospectively reviewed from the electronic medical records. RESULTS: The mean age of the included children was 6.0 years, and 118 (76.1%) of the children were positive for MP-specific IgM. A longer duration between symptom onset and admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24C1.75), longer duration of symptoms during the illness (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02C1.30), and development of extra-pulmonary manifestations (aOR 9.16, 95% CI 1.96C42.81) were significantly associated with a positive MP-specific IgM titer.

Methods A PubMed research was conducted. The following data were collected: age, sex, side of the pneumothorax, smoking habit, time form onset of symptoms to the diagnosis of pneumothorax, the development of new bullous lesions on computed tomography and the type of treatment. In order to analyze the most homogeneous population possible, intubated patients were deliberately excluded. In total, 44 cases of spontaneous pneumothorax in otherwise healthy patients were taken into account. Since the available data were extracted from small observational studies, no particular bias risk assessment was performed. Descriptive statistics were used to synthesize results. Results There were 37 male (84.1%) and 6 female (13.6%) patients. The majority of patients (66%) were treated only by chest tube thoracostomy, which most of the times resulted in a complete resolution of the pneumothorax. Simple surveillance was applied in 10 cases. Three patients underwent minimally invasive surgery. In 14 cases (31.8%) air-filled lesions were detected on imaging. Eleven patients received corticosteroids during their hospital stay. In the majority of cases (86.3%) the pneumothorax was resolved.

The rapid onset of a systemic pro-inflammatory state followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of mortality in patients with COVID-19. We performed a retrospective observational study to explore the capacity of different complete blood cell count (CBC)-derived inflammation indexes to predict in-hospital mortality in this group. Methods. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived NLR (dNLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), mean platelet volume to platelet ratio (MPR), neutrophil to lymphocyte  platelet ratio (NLPR), monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), systemic inflammation index (SII), and the aggregate index of systemic inflammation (AISI) were calculated on hospital admission in 119 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Results. Non-survivors had significantly higher AISI, dNLR, NLPR, NLR, SII, and SIRI values when compared to survivors. Similarly, KaplanCMeier survival curves showed significantly lower survival in patients with higher AISI, dNLR, MLR, NLPR, NLR, SII, and SIRI. However, after adjusting for confounders, only the SII remained significantly associated with survival (HR = 1.0001; 95% CI, 1.0000C1.0001, p = 0.029) in multivariate Cox regression analysis. Conclusions. The SII on admission independently predicts in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients and may assist with early risk stratification in this group.","output":"The Systemic Inflammation Index on Admission Predicts In-Hospital Mortality in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Asymptomatic COVID-19 has become one of the biggest challenges for controlling the spread of the SARS-CoV-2. Diagnosis of asymptomatic COVID-19 mainly depends on quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), which is typically time-consuming and requires expensive reagents. The application is limited in countries that lack sufficient resources to handle large-scale assay during the COVID-19 outbreak. Here, we demonstrated a new approach to detect the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection using serum metabolic patterns combined with ensemble learning. The direct patterns of metabolites and lipids were extracted by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) within 1 s with simple sample preparation. A new ensemble learning model was developed using stacking strategy with a new voting algorithm. This approach was validated in a large cohort of 274 samples (92 asymptomatic COVID-19 and 182 healthy control), and provided the high accuracy of 93.4%, with only 5% false negative and 7% false positive rates. We also identified a biomarker panel of ten metabolites and lipids, as well as the altered metabolic pathways during asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection.

The membrane bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as the entry point of COVID-19 2. Conversely, it supports an anti-inflammatory pathway. This led to the controversy of the impact of medications, which influence its expression. ACE2 is part of the wider renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and is upregulated via compounds, which inhibits the classical ACE, thereby plasma aldosterone and aldosterone receptor (MR) activation. MR activation may therefore protect organs from binding the COVID-19 by reducing ACE2 expression. Glycyrrhizin (GL) is a frequent component in traditional Chinese medicines, which have been used to control COVID-19 infections. Its systemically active metabolite glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) inhibits 11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase(11betaHSD2) and activates MR in organs, which express this enzyme, including the lungs. Does this affect the protective effect of ACE2? Importantly, GL has anti-inflammatory properties by itself via toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonism and therefore compensates for the reduced protection of the downregulated ACE2. Finally, a direct effect of GL or GA to reduce virus transmission exists, which may involve reduced expression of type 2 transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2), which is required for virus uptake. Glycyrrhizin may reduce the severity of an infection with COVID-19 at the two stages of the COVID-19 induced disease process, 1. To block the number of entry points and 2. provide an ACE2 independent anti-inflammatory mechanism.","output":"Symptomatic Protective Action of Glycyrrhizin (Licorice) in COVID-19 Infection?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a dire need for innovative solutions to address global health needs.

Researchers and analysts have suggested to use Google searches on smell loss as indicators of COVID-19 cases. However, such searches may be due to interest elicited by media coverage of the COVID-19-related smell loss, rather than attempts to understand self-symptoms. We analyzed searches related to 4 senses: smell and taste (both recently shown to be impaired in some COVID-19 patients), vision and sight (senses not currently known to be impaired in COVID-19 patients), and an additional general control (\\"COVID-19 symptoms\\"). Focusing on two countries with a large number of cases, Italy and the United States, we have compared Google Trends results per region or state to the number of new cases prevalence in that region. The analysis was performed for each of the 8 weeks ranging from March 4th till April 28th. No correlation with vision loss or sight loss searches was identified, while taste and smell loss searches were correlated with new COVID-19 cases during a limited time window, that starts when the number of weekly new cases reached for the first time 21357 cases in Italy (11-17 March) and 47553 in the US (18-24 March). Media effect on the specific symptoms searches was also analyzed, establishing a different impact according to the country. Our results suggest that Google Trends for taste loss and smell loss searches captured a genuine connection between these symptoms and new COVID-19 cases prevalence in the population. However, due to variability in correlation from week to week, and overall decrease in correlation as taste and smell loss are becoming known COVID-19 symptoms, recognized now by CDC and World Health Organization, Google Trends is no longer a reliable marker for monitoring the disease spread.

Strikes and other forms of work stoppage may result in harm to patients and, therefore, violate professional obligations of beneficence. However, in rare circumstances a health care worker's choice to remain on the job despite risk or potential harm to themselves or even their family may be considered beyond their professional obligation. During a pandemic such as COVID-19, the ethical calculus (that is, finding the right balance between beneficence and harm before deciding on a course of action) must take account of a confluence of factors, including the risks to present patients, future patients, and health care workers; the severity and duration of the risks; and the availability of ameliorative or protective steps that reduce risk and harm. The principle of beneficence to both future patients and health care workers may be thwarted if the risk analysis is confined only to short-term concerns (that is, to concerns occurring within a narrow temporal window). If a significantly elevated risk has been demonstrated to affect nurses and other health care workers of color disproportionately, racial justice must also be considered.

To address this, we developed an in vitro infection model for two human coronaviruses; alphacoronavirus 229E-CoV (229E) and betacoronavirus OC43-CoV (OC43) in differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells (pBECs). Primary BECs from healthy subjects were grown at air-liquid interface (ALI) and infected with 229E or OC43, and replication kinetics and time-course expression of innate immune mediators were assessed. OC43 and 229E-CoVs replicated in differentiated pBECs but displayed distinct replication kinetics: 229E replicated rapidly with viral load peaking at 24 h postinfection, while OC43 replication was slower peaking at 96 h after infection. This was associated with diverse antiviral response profiles defined by increased expression of type I/III interferons and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) by 229E compared with no innate immune activation with OC43 infection. Understanding the host-virus interaction for previously established coronaviruses will give insight into pathogenic mechanisms underpinning SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory disease and other future coronaviruses that may arise from zoonotic sources.","output":"Human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 replicate and induce distinct antiviral responses in differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter reflects on the relationship between the knowledge mobilisation processes that have contributed to behaviour change at an individual and organisational level.

Large-bore distal intracranial catheters have become necessary for aneurysm treatment with flow diverting devices including the Pipeline embolization device (PED). These catheters must accommodate 0.027 inch microcatheters, be supple enough to track distally and be able to provide sufficient support for manipulations required for PED deployment. METHODS A single-center aneurysm database was reviewed to identify patients who underwent anterior circulation aneurysm embolization with the PED while using the Navien distal intracranial catheter. Data were collected regarding the equipment used, cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) tortuosity, intraprocedural Navien positions and periprocedural complications. RESULTS The Navien catheter (5 Fr, 0.070 inch outer diameter, 0.058 inch inner diameter, 115 cm) was used in 78 cases of anterior circulation PED. It was tracked into position over a Marksman microcatheter in 76 of the 78 cases (97%). The final catheter tip position was in the cervical ICA (1/78, 1%), petrous ICA (23/78, 30%), proximal cavernous ICA (48/78, 62%), distal cavernous/clinoidal ICA (3/78, 4%), supraclinoid ICA (2/78, 2%) and the M1 segment (1/78, 2%). In each case the catheter was tracked to its desired position (100% clinical success) despite significant proximal vessel tortuosity in 34 cases (44%). No clinically significant catheter-related complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS The Navien intracranial catheter is an important component of the triaxial system for embolization of cerebral aneurysms with the PED.

Our purpose is to evaluate the external validity of Ali-M3 using Japanese sequential sampling data. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, COVID-19 infection probabilities were calculated using Ali-M3 in 617 symptomatic patients who underwent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and chest CT for COVID-19 diagnosis at 11 Japanese tertiary care facilities, between January 1 and April 15, 2020. Results: Of 617 patients, 289 patients (46.8%) were RT-PCR-positive. The area under the curve (AUC) of Ali-M3 for predicting a COVID-19 diagnosis was 0.797 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.762-0.833) and goodness-of-fit was P = 0.156.

Case studies have reported patients treated with anti-CD20 therapy who suffered from persistent Covid-19. We aimed to assess the incidence, risk factors and long-term outcomes of persistent Covid-19 in patients with lymphoma. Patients and methods This retrospective multicentric study was conducted in 16 French hospitals. All adult patients with lymphoma who were admitted for Covid-19 in March and April 2020 were included. Persistent Covid-19 was defined as persisting severe Covid-19 symptoms requiring in-hospital stay for >30 days. Patients who re-experienced severe Covid-19 symptoms after initial improvement, requiring repeated hospitalizations for a total in-hospital length of stay >30 days were added to the persistent Covid-19 cases. Results One hundred eleven patients were included. Thirty days after admission for Covid-19, 24 patients had died, 55 had been definitively discharged from hospital, 31 were still hospitalized and 1 was later rehospitalized for Covid-19 recurrence. The incidence of persistent Covid-19 was 32/111 (29%). Patients with persistent Covid-19 had a median age of 64 years (range, 43-87) and 63% were male. Twenty-two patients (69%) had at least one significant comorbidity. None of the patients with T-cell (n=8) lymphoma or classical Hodgkin's disease (n=8) experienced persistent Covid-19. In the 32 patients with persistent Covid-19, the median time between first admission and final discharge was 58 days (range, 31-235) and the median duration of Covid-19 symptoms was 83 days (range, 32-237). Eight patients received corticosteroids and 9 convalescent plasma: all patients recovered from their symptoms, except one. Overall, 9 patients with persistent Covid-19 died (27%). After a median follow-up of 191 days (range, 3-260), the 6-month overall survival was 69% (95% CI 60-78%) for the whole cohort. In multivariate analysis, administration of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody within 12 months before admission to hospital for Covid-19 was both associated with decreased overall survival (HR 2.13, 95% CI 1.03-4.44, p = 0.043) and prolonged in-hospital stay (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.24-3.13, p = 0.004). The two other significant factors associated with decreased overall survival and prolonged in-hospital stay: age  70 years and refractory or relapsed lymphoma. Conclusion Patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma hospitalized for Covid-19 have a high incidence of prolonged evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Administration of anti-CD20 therapy within the last 12 months is one of the main risk factors for longer in-hospital stay and death of Covid-19. The risk of persistent Covid-19 was also higher in patients older than 70 years or with refractory or relapsed disease.

Major barriers to the implementation of screening are physician and system related-the requirement for a detailed smoking history, including pack-years, to determine eligibility. We conducted this pilot to determine the feasibility of lung cancer screening (LCS) promotion that would offer screening to eligible persons and patient completion of smoking history to estimate the size of the population of former smokers who may be eligible for LCS in a single health care system. PATIENTS AND METHODS Two hundred participants were randomly selected from former smokers who were seen at the University of Minnesota Health in the past 2 years and assigned to control (usual care) and electronic promotion, stratified by age. Electronic messages to promote LCS were sent to an intervention group, including a link to complete a detailed smoking history in the electronic health record. RESULTS Of 99 participants, 66 (67%) in the intervention group read the message, 24 (36%) of 66 responded, and 19 (79%) of 24 respondents completed the smoking history. Ten intervention participants and 13 usual care participants were eligible for screening on the basis of pack-year history. Four eligible participants underwent screening in the intervention group compared with one participant in the usual care group.

The clinical, laboratory, and lung imaging data were collected during hospitalization and isolation. This was a retrospective single-center case series analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1 124 patients with mild COVID-19 were admitted from February 5 to March 10, 2020, including 13 children (1.16%). All the 13 children (7 boys and 6 girls) were residents of Wuhan in China, with a median age of 16 years (range: 10-18 years). Of all the 13 children, 9(69%) were from family clusters of COVID-19 and 4(31%) had unknown sources of infection. The mean time from exposure to onset was 6.8 days (range: 2-13 days) in 9 children with a definite history of exposure. There were 6 symptomatic children with the main manifestations of fever, cough, weakness, and myalgia, and the mean time from onset to hospitalization was 9.2 days. Of all the 13 children, 7(54%) were asymptomatic with positive nucleic acid test of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). There were 4 children (31%) with abnormal lung CT findings, mainly patchy shadows or ground-glass opacities in the lung field, and 6 children (46%) had no symptoms with normal lung CT findings. All children had normal routine blood test results and C-reactive protein levels. Eight children underwent SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG tests at least once, among whom 6 had negative SARS-CoV-2 IgM but positive IgG, and 2 underwent SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG tests twice and had negative results. Of all the 13 children, 11(85%) had negative results of two SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests during hospitalization and were discharged, and 2(15%) had positive results of four SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests and were transferred to another hospital and lost to follow-up.

Three consecutive cultivations in biotin free medium were necessary to prevent growth of the auxotroph mutant, and 40 ng/ml biotin were sufficient to promote cell growth. Nevertheless, 200 ng/ml biotin were necessary to ensure growth comparable to that of the wildtype which is similar to the demand of biotin auxotroph mutants among other prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes. A phenotypic complementation of the R. eutropha bioF mutant was only achieved by homologous expression of bioF of R. eutropha or heterologous expression of bioF of Bacillus subtilis but not by bioF of Escherichia coli Together with the results from bioinformatic analysis of BioFs, this leads to the assumption that the intermediate of biotin synthesis in R. eutropha is pimeloyl-CoA instead of pimeloyl-ACP like in the Gram-positive B. subtilis Internal biotin content was enhanced by homologous expression of accB whereas homologous expression of accB and accC2 in combination led to decreased biotin concentrations in the cells.

A pulse oximeter is a device that measures the blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate of patients with various disorders. However, due to ethical concerns, commercially available pulse oximeters are limited in terms of calibration on critically sick patients, resulting in a significant error rate for measurement in the critical oxygen saturation range. The devices accessibility in developing countries healthcare settings is also limited due to portability, cost implications, and a lack of recognized need. The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable, low-cost, and portable pulse oximeter device with improved accuracy in the critical oxygen saturation range. METHODS: The proposed device measures oxygen saturation and heart rate using the reflectance approach. The rechargeable battery and power supply from the smartphone were taken into account, and the calibration in critical oxygen saturation values was performed using Prosim 8 vital sign simulator, and by comparing with a standard pulse oximeter device over fifteen iterations. RESULTS: The devices prototype was successfully developed and tested. Oxygen saturation and heart rate readings were both accurate to 97.74% and 97.37%, respectively, compared with the simulator, and an accuracy of 98.54% for the measurement of blood oxygen saturation was obtained compared with the standard device. CONCLUSION: The accuracy of oxygen measurement attained in this study is significant for measuring oxygen saturation for patients in critical care, anesthesia, pre-operative and post-operative surgery, and COVID-19 patients.

Masks made with nanofibers have drawn increasingly more attention because of their higher filtration efficiency, better comfort, and lower pressure drop. However, the interactions and consequences of the nanofibers and microwater droplets remain unclear. In this work, the evolution of fibers made of polymers with different contact angles, diameters, and mesh sizes under water aerosol exposure is systematically visualized. The images show that capillarity is very strong compared with the elasticity of the nanofiber. The nanofibers coalesce irreversibly during the droplet capture stage as well as the subsequent liquid evaporation stage. The fiber coalescence significantly reduces the effective fiber length for capturing aerosols. The nanofiber mesh that undergoes multiple droplet capture/evaporation cycles exhibits a fiber coalescing fraction of 40%C58%. The hydrophobic and orthogonally woven fibers can reduce the capillary forces and decrease the fiber coalescing fraction. This finding is expected to assist the proper design, fabrication, and use of face masks with nanofibers.

However, their active constituents and mechanisms underlying functions from N. sativa seeds is unclear. Thus, the bioactive constituents with immune regulation in N. sativa seeds were systematically studied. A new compound (3-methoxythymol-6-O--D-apiofuranosyl-(16)--D-glucopyranoside 1) and 11 known compounds (2C12) were separated from the N. sativa seeds by chromatographic methods. Their structures were then elucidated by spectroscopic analysis of MS, UV, IR, (1)H-, and (13)C-NMR. Furthermore, immunomodulatory effects of those compounds in RAW 264.7 cells were evaluated by phagocytosis, nitric oxide (NO) and cytokine release, related mRNA transcription, and key proteins expression in vitro.

Literature describes coagulopathy as a key pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19 disease. Thus, antithrombotic therapy management is still a therapeutic challenge. During hospitalization, changing oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapies into subcutaneous heparin is common in daily clinical practice. Purpose: The primary endpoint of this study is to analyze the impact of AF in mortality within 30 day since admission of COVID-19 patients. The secondary endpoint is to analyze the impact of the anticoagulant therapy strategy (therapeutic dose of subcutaneous heparin vs. OAC) in 30-day mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with AF. Methods: A total of 1001 consecutive patients hospitalized in our centre between 22nd August and 9th January 2021 with a confirmed microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19 by PCR were prospectively included. Of them, 134 had a previous diagnose of AF (13.5%). Cox regression analysis was performed to assess the impact of AF and the choice of anticoagulant therapy in 30-day mortality after adjusting for comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index). Results: After adjusting for comorbidities, AF was not independently associated with a higher 30-day mortality in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection (HR 1.04, CI 0.77-1.43, p=0.760). In the group of patients with AF, changing OAC to heparin therapy was not associated with an improved prognosis (HR 0.85, CI 95% 0.46-1.56, p=0.604).

Thus, many questions arise with regard to respiratory care after birth, necessary protection to health care workers (HCW) in the delivery room and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and safety of bag and mask ventilation, noninvasive respiratory support, deep suctioning, endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Indeed, these questions have created tremendous confusion amongst neonatal HCW.

The results demonstrated that to date, neonatal COVID-19 infection is uncommon, generally acquired postnatally, and associated with favorable respiratory outcomes. The reason why infants display a milder spectrum of disease remains unclear. Nonetheless, the risk of severe or critical illness in young patients exists. Currently, the recommended respiratory approach for infants with suspected or confirmed infection is not evidence based but should include all routinely used types of support, with the addition of viral filters, proper personal protective equipment, and placement of infants in isolation rooms, ideally with negative pressure.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations could either be maternally inherited and predispose to cancer (germ line mutations) or occur sporadically in the mtDNA of specific tissues (tissue- or tumor-specific somatic mutations) and contribute to the tumor initiation and progression process. High-throughput sequencing technologies now enable comprehensive detection of mtDNA variation in tissues and bodily fluids, with the potential to be used as an early detection tool that may impact the treatment of cancer.

Despite a significant mortality rate, the severity of most cases of COVID-19 infection ranges from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic, and silent infection affects a still-unknown proportion of the general population. No information is available on the prevalence and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 silent infection among patients with cancer receiving anticancer treatment during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 1, 2020, to the end of the same month, 560 consecutive patients with cancer, asymptomatic for COVID-19 and on anticancer treatment at Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, were evaluated and tested for SARS-CoV-2. We implemented a two-step diagnostics, including the rapid serological immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G/IgM and the nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in case of seropositivity to identify SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. RESULTS: In 560 patients, 172 (31%) resulted positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies, regardless of different type of cancer, stage, and treatment. The Ig-seropositive patients were then tested with RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swabs, and 38% proved to be SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. At an early follow-up, in the 97 SARS-CoV-2-seropositive/RT-PCR-negative patients who continued their anticancer therapies, only one developed symptomatic COVID-19 illness. CONCLUSION: Among patients with cancer, the two-step diagnostics is feasible and effective for SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers detection and might support optimal cancer treatment strategies at both the individual and the population level. The early safety profile of the different anticancer therapies, in patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, supports the recommendation to continue the active treatment, at least in cases of RT-PCR-negative patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This is the first study evaluating the prevalence and clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 silent infection in actively treated patients with cancer, during the epidemic peak in one of the worst areas of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lacking national and international recommendations for the detection of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, a pragmatic and effective two-step diagnostics was implemented to ascertain SARS-CoV-2 silent carriers. In this series, consisting of consecutive and unselected patients with cancer, the prevalence of both SARS-CoV-2-seropositive patients and silent carriers is substantial (31% and 10%, respectively). The early safety profile of the different anticancer therapies, in patients previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, supports the recommendation to continue the active treatment, at least in case of RT-PCR-negative patients.","output":"Prevalence and Clinical Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Silent Carriers Among Actively Treated Patients with Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibodies persist months and years in blood.

METHODS: Immunofluorescence analysis was performed on the prolactin (PRL) and MAPK14 expressions of pituitary gland in C57BL/6 mice and human prolactinoma specimen. In the present study, the role of MAPK14 in prolactinoma was determined using estradiol-induced mice and dopamine D2 receptor knockout (DRD2-/-) mice models in C57BL/6 wild-type (WT), MAPK14-/- and DRD2-/-MAPK14+/- mice. GH3 cells were transfected with different sets of MAPK14 small interfering RNA, which to study MAPK14 and PRL expression in GH3 cells. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence analysis showed that PRL and MAPK14 expression were colocalized and increased in the pituitary gland of mice and human prolactinoma specimen compared with the control specimen. It was shown that PRL and MAPK14 expression was colocalized and increased significantly in the pituitary gland of estradiol-injected prolactinoma mice compared with the control mice. Knockout of MAPK14 significantly inhibited tumor overgrowth, and PRL expression was decreased in estradiol-induced mice. Furthermore, MAPK14 knockout of DRD2-/-MAPK14+/- mice significantly reduced the overgrowth of pituitary gland and PRL production and secretion compared with DRD2-/- mice. MAPK14 knockout using siRNA inhibited PRL production in GH3 cells.

However, we understand very little about the effects of this pandemic on families of young children. We used a risk and resilience model to evaluate the effects of the pandemic on mental health in diverse caregivers (N = 286) with children ages birth to 5. We evaluated the hypotheses that (a) pandemic stress and caregiver-reported child psychosocial concerns correlate with caregivers' mental health symptoms and (b) caregivers' pandemic-related self-efficacy and coping mediate these relationships. Caregivers completed surveys in April-May 2020 assessing pandemic stress (e.g., health, finances, and housing), child psychosocial problems, coping strategies, and self-efficacy to manage family needs. Our primary outcome was caregivers' self-reported changes in mental health symptoms since the outbreak. Path analysis revealed that higher pandemic stress was associated with caregivers' reduced confidence in meeting their family's needs related to COVID-19, which correlated with worse caregiver mental health symptoms. Greater child psychosocial problems also predicted worse caregiver mental health symptoms. Findings suggest that pandemic stress, child psychosocial problems, and caregiver self-efficacy are interrelated in their influence on caregivers' mental health. While further research is needed to examine strategies to foster resilience and buffer the pandemic's effects on caregiver mental health, this is a first step in evaluating the psychosocial effects of this pandemic in families of young children.

Patients and methods This was an international multicenter retrospective study, including patients who had an endoscopic resection of an upper GIT lesion using the FTRD between January 2017 and February 2019. Results Fifty-six patients from 13 centers were included. The most common lesions were mesenchymal neoplasms (n = 23, 41 %), adenomas (n = 7, 13 %), and hamartomas (n = 6, 11 %). Eighty-four percent of lesions were located in the stomach, and 14 % in the duodenum. The average size of lesions was 14 mm (range 3 to 33 mm). Deployment of the FTRD was technically successful in 93 % of patients (n = 52) leading to complete and partial resection in 43 (77 %) and 9 (16 %) patients, respectively. Overall, the FTRD led to negative histological margins (R0 resection) in 38 (68 %) of patients. A total of 12 (21 %) mild or moderate adverse events (AEs) were reported. Follow-up endoscopy was performed in 31 patients (55 %), on average 88 days after the procedure (IQR 68-138 days). Of these, 30 patients (97 %) did not have any residual or recurrent lesion on endoscopic examination and biopsy, with residual adenoma in one patient (3 %).

In addition, co-infection (3.5%) and secondary infection (14.3%) were relatively low in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. A major concern is the increased risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) due to inappropriate antibiotic consumption (1). Aim: This review aims to evaluate antimicrobial consumption (excluding repurposed drugs such as remdesivir) in hospitals and determine the prevalence of COVID-19 patients who received antibiotic therapy using meta-analysis. Methods: The review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines (2). The two investigators independently developed and applied eligibility criteria to examine original articles. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (i) original research studies with a minimum sample of 50 patients;(ii) focussed on antibiotic consumption (AMC);(iii) patients with COVID-19 or consumption amid COVID-19 pandemic;(iv) any age group or gender;and (v) reported in the English language. The included articles were retrieved from MEDLINE, CINAHL, WHO COVID-19 databases, including studies published in EMBASE, Scopus, WHO-COVID, and LILACS between December 2019 to July 2021. The modified version of Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to measure biases in included studies after the consensus by both authors. The random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence or proportion of AMC among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Results: A total of 34 studies conducted among hospitalised COVID-19 patients were included. The extracted studies presented AMC in defined daily doses (r frequency and percentages. Azithromycin was the most frequently prescribed antibiotic in almost all studies. The meta-analysis that examined overall AMC using data from 25 studies (17 studies from high income countries and eight from low-middle income countires) revealed 69% (95% CI:63%-74%) of hospitalized COVID-19 received at least one course of antibiotics. The sub-group analysis of studies from high income countries (HICs) revealed 59% (95% CI: 51%-66%) consumed antibiotics compared with 89% (95% CI: 82% to 94%) among hospitalised COVID-19 patients in low-middle income countries (LMICs). Conclusion: This review highlights the trend of antibiotic consumption in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. A significant rise in antibiotic consumption was observed in LMICs and increased antibiotic consumption in the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic in HIC. The review outcomes emphasised the importance of rational and judicious use of antimicrobial therapy as well as to strenghting the antimicrobial stewardship policies and activities, particularly during a global pandemic.

It is acknowledged that the EU institutions were not directly responsible for achieving the relative peace that resulted. Yet, the EU provided a constructive context for societal normalisation. Shared EU membership improved engagement between the British and Irish governments, fostering habits of co-operation. It afforded a shared political space that helped transcend binary political, religious and ethnic differences. The implications of Brexit that entails active de-Europeanisation and resulting tensions concerning the NI protocol are therefore significant. Yet, this paper maintains that the long-term impact of Brexit remains uncertain. For instance, it is not clear that a hard Brexit will inevitably result in the unification of Ireland.

Therefore, this article is dedicated to the business innovations that appear in the new mobility industry during the COVID-19 pandemic in connection to post-pandemic transportation plans in Asia, Europe, and America. In this work, we conducted two-level research based on the desk research and expert research methodologies. From the business point of view, the results show that car-sharing systems (most organizational practices) and ride-sharing services (most safety practices) have most adapted their business models to pandemic changes. In turn, bike-sharing services have implemented the fewest business practices and innovations. From the urban transport systems point of view, the results show that European authorities have proposed the most plans and practice projects for new mobility after the pandemic compared to Asia and America.

The 2 test was used to analyze the data. RESULTS A total of 1,439 patients were included in the study. The most common reason for the dental visit was pain (47.5%). The prevalence of DA was 5.1% (74/1,439). A significant association was found between DA and gender (p = 0.020). The incidence of severe pain was higher in patients with DA than in those without DA (p = 0.002). No significant differences in the MDAS scores were found between patients with and without a chronic disease (p = 0.804), with regard to the educational status (p = 0.364), or between the age groups (p = 0.600). The prevalence of a 'strongly agree' response to all questions in COVID?19 FPCS was higher in patients with DA as compared to those without DA. CONCLUSIONS Females and patients with severe pain were more likely to exhibit DA. In general, patients with DA strongly agreed with the statements of COVID?19 FPCS, which may indicate a correlation between the 2 scales.","output":"Assessment of dental anxiety levels among dental emergency patients during the COVID?19 pandemic through the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To use ultraviolet (UV) radiations in an indigenous method for sterilization of respirators for reuse during COVID-19 outbreak. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 outbreak has infected more than 200 countries. In India, till now, more than 100,000 cases have been reported. Healthcare workers are at high risk of developing infections being in the frontline of taking care of COVDI-19 cases. The demands of personal protective equipment (PPE) are increasing, but the same is not matched with supply due to various reasons. In such scenarios, reusing respirators and face shields is an alternative. UV radiations have quick action and are able to preserve the quality of respirators. We have developed a UV box for surface sterilization of respirators with an intention to reuse. TECHNIQUE: A thermocol box was taken from the central drug store and was fitted with two UV tubes of 254 nm wavelength procured from local service center of water purifiers. The position of the two tubes was such that one was near the base while other was fixed at the top. An aluminum mesh frame was placed in the middle of the box to act as a platform. The roof of the box was converted into a lid. The effectiveness of assembly was tested using culture of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, a biological indicator tube containing test strip with spores of Bacillus atrophaeus was also exposed to UV light for a predefined duration, which did not show any color change after incubation for 48 hours. CONCLUSION: Our prototype assembly with supported efficacy from microbiological tests is an option for use of UV light within available resources for disinfection and reuse of scarce supplies of personal protective equipment. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: UV box can help in meeting the demand supply deficit for respirators, face shields, and goggles that are paramount for the protection of HCW.

A total of 322 parents completed an online survey between the 1st May and the 24th July 2020. Relationships were explored between predictor variables (coping mechanisms, household income, adequacy of space) and outcome variables (parenting self-efficacy, discipline, home-schooling relationships) mediated by stress and moderated by creativity and parenting dimensions. Moderated mediation analyses showed that inadequate space at home and negative coping mechanisms resulted in elevated stress and worse outcomes in terms of parents approaches to discipline and their experience of home-schooling their children. Negative outcomes were more pronounced for parents who used high levels of behavioural control. In turn, negative outcomes were reduced when parents had higher levels of self-perceived everyday creativity and outcomes were improved by positive coping strategies. Implications and applications of these findings are discussed.","output":"Home-schooling during COVID-19 lockdown: Effects of coping style, home space, and everyday creativity on stress and home-schooling outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The large and continued growth of the older adult population within U.S. prisons affects not only criminal justice policy and correctional health practice, but also gerontology.

Most patients with mild symptoms are isolated at home until recovery. However, compliance with home-quarantine and recovery are not warranted especially in developed countries where health capacity is poor. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate compliance with home-quarantine and the prognosis of COVID-19 among a cohort of patients isolated at home in the Governorate of Sousse, Tunisia. METHODS: Prospective longitudinal study of three months was led among a cohort of 375 patients with COVID-19 isolated at home. Participants were randomly selected from the new declared cases in the governorate of Sousse. Data were collected using a pre-established and pre-tested questionnaire administered during phone calls interviews with trained medical doctors. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 40.0 (IQR: 29.75-54.25) years. Females represented 60% of them. The average duration between close contact with symptomatic person and onset of symptoms was 4.01(1.9) days. The most commonly reported symptoms were asthenia (51.7%), smell disturbance (50.4%), myalgia (41.9%) and ageusia (40.8%). Thirty two (8.5%) participants required hospitalization and 4 (1.0%) were transferred to intensive care units.The median delay for recovery was 18 days (IQR 17.1-18.9). Otherwise, 95 (25.4%) declared not respecting the quarantine and 111 (29.6%) of participants transmitted the infection to their family members. CONCLUSIONS: Complications and intra-family transmission are frequent among COVID-19 patients isolated at home in Sousse. Accelerating the implementation of the Tunisian telemedicine law would provide a cost-effective solution for this problem. KEY MESSAGES: Isolation at home of COVID-19 patients should be associated with close monitoring by health professionals. Individual prevention measures should be reinforced among patients isolated at home to limit intra-family spread of COVID-19.","output":"Compliance with home-quarantine and prognosis of COVID-19 among a cohort of Tunisian patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Emergency physicians frequently provide care for patients who are experiencing viral illnesses and may be asked to provide verification of the patient's illness (a sick note) for time missed from work. Exclusion from work can be a powerful public health measure during epidemics; both legislation and physician advice contribute to patients decisions to recover at home. METHODS: We surveyed Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians members to determine what impacts sick notes have on patients and the system, the duration of time off work that physicians recommend, and what training and policies are in place to help providers. Descriptive statistics from the survey are reported. RESULTS: A total of 182 of 1524 physicians responded to the survey; 51.1% practice in Ontario. 76.4% of physicians write at least one sick note per day, with 4.2% writing 5 or more sick notes per day. Thirteen percentage of physicians charge for a sick note (mean cost $22.50). Patients advised to stay home for a median of 4 days with influenza and 2 days with gastroenteritis and upper respiratory tract infections. 82.8% of physicians believe that most of the time, patients can determine when to return to work. Advice varied widely between respondents. 61% of respondents were unfamiliar with sick leave legislation in their province and only 2% had received formal training about illness verification. CONCLUSIONS: Providing sick notes is a common practice of Canadian Emergency Physicians; return\\\\to\\\\work guidance is variable.

COVID-19 is mainly manifested by respiratory symptoms,however, digestive manifestations have been reported, raising the hypothesis of the viral digestive tropism. AIMS Specify the digestive manifestations due to the SARS-CoV-2, and their impact on the disease prognosis and describe the COVID-19 effect in patients with underlying digestive disease. METHODS Ageneral review of the medical literature was conducted via Medline? database, through various combinations of the following keywords :SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, gastrointestinal tract, digestive system, inflammatory bowel diseases, liver, liver injury, chronic liver disease, neoplasms. The most relevant articles were selected. RESULTS The SARS-CoV-2 tropism for the digestive tract has been confirmed by the identification of the enterocyte as a target cell of the virus. Viral particles and RNA detection in stool of infected patients has raised the potential for feco-oral transmission of the virus. Gastrointestinal manifestations were frequent and may even be revealing or isolated. Diarrhea was the most characteristic symptom. Frequent liver involvement is associated with a more severe form of the disease. Patients with digestive cancer and chronic liver disease are at risk for a severe form of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS Patients with low risk of glaucoma progression were followed up at GLOC. Visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and visual field testing or optic nerve head imaging were assessed by nurses and technicians, with virtual review of data by an ophthalmologist separately. The implementation outcomes were defined as patient satisfaction, assessed by a nurse-administered questionnaire; the rate of referrals back to the glaucoma outpatient department; the patients' journey time (minutes); the time taken for the specialist review (minutes), and the per capita manpower cost compared with current glaucoma outpatient model. RESULTS A total of 377 patients were included, with the majority being glaucoma disc suspects (n = 250, 66.4%) and primary angle closure suspects (n = 54, 14.3%). Most patients (more than 90%) reported being satisfied, and only 7.7% (n = 29) were referred back to the specialist outpatient glaucoma clinic due to possible glaucoma progression. Compared with the glaucoma outpatient clinic, the average journey time in GLOC was 50% less (59.3 mins vs 132 mins), the average time for a specialist review was 3 times faster (5.8 mins vs 19.5 mins), and the per capita manpower cost of GLOC was halved ($20.07 vs $39.78).

The exact pattern of immune system changes and their condition during the disease process is unclear. The available knowledge has indicated that the NF-kappa-B pathway, which is induced by several mediators, has a significant role in cytokine storm through the various mechanisms. Therefore, identifying the state of the immune cells and the dominant mechanisms for the production of cytokines incorporated in the cytokine storm can be a critical step in the therapeutic approach. On the other hand, some studies identified a higher risk for diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus exhibits a close association with inflammation and increases the chance of developing COVID-19. Patients with diabetes mellitus have shown to have more virus entry, impaired immunity response, less viral elimination, and dysregulated inflammatory cytokines. The parallel analysis of COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus pathogenesis has proposed that the control of the inflammation through the interfering with the critical points of major signaling pathways may provide the new therapeutic approaches. In recent years, the role of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) in chronic inflammation has been proved. Numerous immune cells express the DPP4 protein. DPP4 regulates antibody production, cytokine secretion, and immunoglobulin class switching. DPP4 inhibitors like sitagliptin reduce inflammation intensity in different states. Following the accumulating data, we hypothesize that sitagliptin might reduce COVID-19 severity. Sitagliptin, an available DPP4 inhibitor drug, showed multidimensional anti-inflammatory effects among diabetic patients. It reduces the inflammation mostly by affecting on NF-kappa-B signaling pathway. Under the fact that inflammatory mediators are active in individuals with COVID-19, blocking the predominant pathway could be helpful.","output":"Inflammation: A bridge between diabetes and COVID-19, and possible management with sitagliptin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article describes the relationship between countries' lockdown responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and those countries' political rights and civil liberties, macroeconomic variables, and vulnerability to the virus Political rights and civil liberties cannot explain the differences in lockdown timing across countries Countries with high contagion exposure due to weak water sanitation and weak health systems locked down their economies as fast as possible to reduce contagion However, countries more vulnerable to COVID-19 due to large fractions of elderly and smokers in the population did not respond differently from less-vulnerable countries Interestingly, macroeconomic variables that did affect the timing of lockdowns were the sizes of a country's financial and trading sectors, even when differences in income and population density are taken into account","output":"Lockdown Responses to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still incompletely understood, but it seems to involve immune activation and immune dysregulation. OBJECTIVE: We examined the parameters of activation of different leukocyte subsets in COVID-19-infected patients in relation to disease severity. METHODS: We analyzed plasma levels of myeloperoxidase (a marker of neutrophil activation), soluble (s) CD25 (sCD25) and soluble T-cell immunoglobulin mucin domain-3 (sTIM-3) (markers of T-cell activation and exhaustion), and sCD14 and sCD163 (markers of monocyte/macrophage activation) in 39 COVID-19-infected patients at hospital admission and 2 additional times during the first 10 days in relation to their need for intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. RESULTS: Our major findings were as follows: (1) severe clinical outcome (ICU treatment) was associated with high plasma levels of sTIM-3 and myeloperoxidase, suggesting activated and potentially exhausted T cells and activated neutrophils, respectively; (2) in contrast, sCD14 and sCD163 showed no association with need for ICU treatment; and (3) levels of sCD25, sTIM-3, and myeloperoxidase were inversely correlated with degree of respiratory failure, as assessed by the ratio of Pao2 to fraction of inspired oxygen, and were positively correlated with the cardiac marker N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide.

Naturally, this has placed added strain onto healthcare systems internationally. It was feared that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could overrun the Irish healthcare system. As such, the Irish government opted to introduce a national lockdown on the 27 March 2020 in an attempt to stem the flow of admissions to hospitals. Similar lockdowns in the UK and New Zealand have resulted in reduced emergency department presentations and trauma admissions. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of the national lockdown on trauma presentations to a model-3 hospital in Dublin, Ireland. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted. All emergency department presentations between 27 March 2019 to 27 April 2020 and 27 March 2020 to 27 April 2020 were cross-referenced against the National Integrated Medical Imaging System-Picture Archiving Communication System (NIMIS-PACS) radiology system to identify those with radiologically proven skeletal trauma. These patients were grouped according to sex, age, discharge outcome, mechanism of injury, and injury location. Results: A 21% decrease in radiologically proven trauma was observed on comparison with the same time-period last year. Additionally, a 40% reduction in trauma admissions was observed during the COVID-19 lockdown. A 60% reduction in sports-related injuries and road traffic accident-related injuries was noted during the national lockdown. However, a 17% increase was observed in patients sustaining trauma because of domestic accidents. Conclusion: Variation was observed in both the volume and nature of trauma presentations during the COVID-19 lockdown. As would be expected, a reduction was seen in the number of injuries resulting from outdoor activities. Interestingly, increased rates of domestic injuries were seen during this period which could represent an unintended consequence of the prolonged period of lockdown.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-6:261-266.","output":"Analysing the variation in volume and nature of trauma presentations during COVID-19 lockdown in Ireland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Repeated emergence of highly contagious and potentially immune-evading variant SARS-CoV-2 is posing global health and socioeconomical threats. For suppression of the spread of the virus infection among people, a procedure to inactivate virus in saliva may be useful, because saliva of infected persons is the major origin of droplets and aerosols that mediate viral transmission to nearby persons. We previously reported that SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly and remarkably inactivated by treatment in vitro with tea including green tea, roasted green tea, oolong tea and black tea. Tea catechin-derived compounds including theaflavins (TFs) with (a) galloyl moiety(ies) showed this activity. Although black tea is popularly consumed worldwide, a lot of people consume it with sugar, milk, lemon juice, and so on. But it has not been determined whether these ingredients may influence the inactivation effect of black tea against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it has not been revealed whether black tea is capable of inactivating variant viruses such as delta variant. Here we examined the effect of black tea on some variants in the presence or absence of sugar, milk, and lemon juice in vitro. Black tea and galloylated TFs remarkably inactivated alpha, gamma, delta and kappa variants. Intriguingly, an addition of milk but not sugar and lemon juice totally prevented black tea from inactivating alpha and delta variant viruses. The suppressive effect was also exerted by milk casein. These results suggest the possibility that intake of black tea without milk by infected persons may result in inactivation of the virus in saliva and attenuation of spread of SARS-CoV-2 to nearby persons through droplets. Clinical studies are required to investigate this possibility.","output":"Milk casein prevents inactivation effect of black tea galloylated theaflavins on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Ghana and Uganda, many young people are increasingly leaving residential care to live independently in the wider society. In many countries, these young people who leave care, often referred to as care leavers, are a marginalized and excluded group. Given the devastating effect COVID-19 has on vulnerable groups, we conducted in-depth interviews with 12 care leavers to understand their experiences of COVID-19 and how it is affecting their psychosocial wellbeing. We also explored their coping mechanisms. The results show that their main challenges include the loss of livelihoods and finances, reduction to social networks/social support, and fear and sustained worry. They are coping through seeking support from their peers, borrowing money from friends with expectation to pay debts in the future, reducing spending by cutting on number of meals. They indicated that access to mental health and psychosocial support is very limited and, most times, nonexistent. Most of them had not benefited from social assistance from the state or nongovernment organizations. Overall COVID-19 has put a strain on livelihood sources and this has contributed to psychosocial challenges. However, there are signs of resilience, particularly to review expenditure patterns and seeking peer support.

Machine learning techniques have been applied to automatically detect financial statement fraud with great success. This work presents the first application of a Bayesian inference approach to the problem of predicting the audit outcomes of financial statements of local government entities using financial ratios. Bayesian logistic regression (BLR) with automatic relevance determination (BLR-ARD) is applied to predict audit outcomes. The benefit of using BLR-ARD, instead of BLR without ARD, is that it allows one to automatically determine which input features are the most relevant for the task at hand, which is a critical aspect to consider when designing decision support systems. This work presents the first implementation of BLR-ARD trained with Separable Shadow Hamiltonian Hybrid Monte Carlo, No-U-Turn sampler, Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm and Metropolis-Hasting algorithms. Unlike the Gibbs sampling procedure that is typically employed in sampling from ARD models, in this work we jointly sample the parameters and the hyperparameters by putting a log normal prior on the hyperparameters. The analysis also shows that the repairs and maintenance as a percentage of total assets ratio, current ratio, debt to total operating revenue, net operating surplus margin and capital cost to total operating expenditure ratio are the important features when predicting local government audit outcomes using financial ratios. These results could be of use for auditors as focusing on these ratios could potentially speed up the detection of fraudulent behaviour in municipal entities, and improve the speed and quality of the overall audit.","output":"Bayesian inference of local government audit outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Family and friends are often the first and/or only support options used by young people (12-25 years) struggling with mental health issues.

However, different students react in different ways to online learning. Some students were able to make productive use of online learning strategies more than others. A conceptual model based on 15 variables was constructed based on UTAUT2, TAM, and other models to investigate and to study the factors that affect students' acceptance of online learning. 29 hypotheses were investigated to study the relationships among the variables that affect online learning acceptance and online learning community building in Al-Ahliyya Amman University. The collected responses were analyzed using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. SPSS and AMOS were used to analyze the data. ? 2021.

We investigated pulmonologists' perception of their knowledge and practices with delivery devices for COPD management. METHODS An online survey was designed by a steering committee of American Thoracic Society clinicians and scientists and conducted by a national market research firm between January 7 and 29, 2016. RESULTS Two hundred and five respondents completed the survey. Nearly 80% of the respondents believed that they were very knowledgeable in COPD management and the use of medications; 68% believed that they were knowledgeable about preventing exacerbations. Ninety-eight percent of the respondents stated that they were at least somewhat knowledgeable about devices. Many respondents (70%) stated that small-volume nebulizers were more effective than dry powder inhalers and pressurized metered-dose inhalers in the management of COPD exacerbations, and 63% believed that these were more effective in severe COPD (modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale grade 4). Only 54% of the respondents discussed device options with their patients. Physician screening for physical or cognitive impairments that could impact device choices was 53% and 16%, respectively. Seventy percent of the respondents discussed device use, whereas 9% discussed cleaning and storage during a patient's first visit. Few respondents were very knowledgeable in teaching patients how to use devices (43%) and, specifically, how to use (32%) or clean and/or maintain (20%) small-volume nebulizers. CONCLUSIONS Most respondents were confident in their knowledge about treating COPD. Fewer respondents were confident about the use and maintenance of inhalation devices, and most respondents desired to learn more about inhalation devices.","output":"Results of a Pulmonologist Survey Regarding Knowledge and Practices With Inhalation Devices for COPD."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose To analyze the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak during the first pandemic year in a single country. Methods A cross-sectional study was designed. The free access database of the Chilean Department of Statistics and Health Information (DEIS) was used to compare the number of orthopedic procedures between 2019 and 2020. Country mobility was exported from the Institute of Complex Engineering Systems (ISCI) free-access database; this corresponds to a direct measurement of the degree of confinement of the country. Spearman correlation (rho) was used to analyze the total monthly COVID infection trend and mobility to orthopedics procedures. Results The number of orthopedic surgeries fell by 22.8% during the first year of the pandemic. All surgical procedures were adversely affected, with the fracture/trauma surgeries being the least affected. The maximum adverse impact was seen in knee arthroplasty (-64%), followed by hip arthroplasty (-41%) and knee ligament reconstruction (-44%). The number of orthopedic procedures had a mild correlation to the monthly number of COVID-19 cases (rho=-0.53, p=0.08) and a strong correlation with the country's mobility (rho=0.94, p=0.0001). Conclusions The COVID-19 outbreak diminished the number of orthopedic procedures during 2020, and the impact was directly correlated to the country's mobility. The public health network did have a more significant adverse impact in elective surgeries due to a slower recovery than private institutions. An increase in the waiting list should be expected, which will widen the difference in access to orthopedic surgery in Chile.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Orthopedic Surgery: A Nationwide Analysis of the First Pandemic Year"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine how public liquidity should be distributed to firms when immediate production entails externalities, such as by spreading a virus. Direct provision of liquidity can address externalities, but traditional distribution of liquidity (through banks) has informational advantages. We show that which mode is preferred is determined by the variance (but not the level) of firm characteristics in the economy. Traditional provision is always part of the optimal policy when liquidity modes can be combined, and involves promising low interest rates for when the pandemic is over in order to incentivize temporary production shutdowns at firms.","output":"Liquidity provision during a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Indonesian policymakers need to respond to the current challenges, particularly the excess of nurses and the increased demand for nurses in the global market. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to present the perception of policymakers and stakeholders on the management of overseas migration of Indonesian nurses. METHODS: This study is a descriptive qualitative design where data were collected through structured interviews with key stakeholders representing the Indonesian government, namely the Ministry of Health (MOH), the Ministry of Labour (MOL), Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Indonesian Migrant Workers Protection Agency (BP2MI). The in-depth interviews involved participants who were responsible for managing Indonesian nurses migration. The qualitative data were analyzed thematically using a content analysis approach. RESULTS: The issues involving nurses migration policy are quite complex and sectoral. Themes emerging from this study include the move towards global market orientation, addressing challenges on international nurse migration, strengthening coordination among stakeholders and making the most of opportunities. All the themes reflect that the country should work hard to achieve the balance between quantity and quality of nursing resources for the international market. CONCLUSION: As regulator and executor of Indonesian nurse migration, various government policies have responded to the low number of Indonesian nurses migration overseas, emphasizing the three cycles of migration: pre-migration, migration and post-migration. The preparation of resources, regulations and placements for Indonesian nurses abroad open the opportunity to the international nursing labour market. Hence, the policies need to be strengthened from upstream to downstream to make Indonesian nurses more competitive and adaptive in global market.","output":"Going Global: Insights of Indonesian Policymakers on International Migration of Nurses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSES: Since a considerable number of health care workers (HCWs) were sent to Wuhan to aid COVID-19 control during the epidemic, non-frontline HCWs who stayed in local hospitals had to work overload to provide daily health care services for other health issues, which makes them more vulnerable to experience fatigue. Self-efficacy is suggested as a protective factor for fatigue. Nonetheless, less is known regarding the underlying mechanisms. This research aimed to explore the prevalence of fatigue among non-frontline HCWs during the pandemic, investigate the mediating effect of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and moderating effect of negative coping in the association between self-efficacy and fatigue. METHODS: General Self-Efficacy Scale, PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire and 14-item Fatigue Scale were administrated to 527 non-frontline HCWs from Anhui Province, China. The mediating effect was examined by Mackinnon's four-step procedure, while Hayes PROCESS macro was used to test the moderated mediation model. RESULTS: The prevalence of fatigue among non-frontline HCWs was 56.7%. The effect of self-efficacy on fatigue was partially mediated by PTSD symptoms (ab = -0.146, SE = 0.030, 95% CI = [-0.207, -0.095]). Additionally, negative coping moderated both the direct effect of self-efficacy on fatigue (? = -0.158, P<0.001) and the mediating effect of PTSD symptoms (? = 0.077, P = 0.008). When the standard score of negative coping increased to 1.49 and over, the direct association between self-efficacy and fatigue became insignificant. Likewise, the effect of self-efficacy on PTSD symptoms had no statistical significance when the standard score of negative coping was -1.40 and lower. CONCLUSIONS: More than half non-frontline HCWs suffered from fatigue during COVID-19. For those who tend to use negative coping, it might be crucial to design programs combining the enhancement of self-efficacy, preventions for PTSD symptoms and interventions for fatigue.","output":"Self-efficacy and fatigue among non-frontline health care workers during COVID-19 outbreak: A moderated mediation model of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and negative coping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When it comes to regulation of the health sector, the traditional focus has been a standard setting, as in the shape and form of ensuring minimum levels of quality and safety. This approach is often termed as social, but it neglects to consider the cultural commitment to ensuring quality, safety, and equity in health services. Our aim in this chapter is to highlight the role of culture and traditions which influence regulatory practices of the state. For South Asia, a region greatly dominated by informal social control, studying this area is critical to understanding the sociocultural obstacles to optimal health regulation and policy. We discuss in detail the types of regulatory practices and the diverse challenges to effectiveness in context to the health sectors of South Asia. Many cultural and traditional customs of the region sustain regressive and inefficient regulatory policies, including the dual practice of practitioners and commercialization of providers. Secondary data has been used from the Demographic Health Surveys to analyze the shortfalls of maternal health in South Asia, in order to highlight the role of state and society in improving protective regulatory policies for womens health. We believe that if the regulation of the existing maternal and reproductive health services in South Asia is improved, it will help to improve the regulatory challenge for gender equity across the health sector. Thus, we suggest a 20-point agenda to improve regulation in a way that would reduce maternal and child mortality risks. We conclude finally about the utility of co-regulation in a decentralized manner but with the state at the apex for management of a regulatory system to other actors in co-governance. The decentralized approach of engaging with non-state sectors, using information exchange systems and standard setting can provide a useful way of thinking through regulatory reforms and implementing them purposefully.","output":"The Culture of Health Regulation and Its Implications on Maternal and Reproductive Health in South Asia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECT The microvascular anatomy of spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs), especially the relationships of the vessels with the dura mater, has yet to be angiographically demonstrated in detail and proven histologically. METHODS From January 2012 through April 2014, a total of 7 patients with spinal dural AVFs in the thoracic region underwent open microsurgical obliteration at Tokyo Metropolitan Neurological Hospital. The microvascular anatomy of spinal dural AVFs was comprehensively assessed by using advanced microangiography, including 3D computer graphics and intraoperative indocyanine green video angiography, and by histological findings. RESULTS The 2 microangiography techniques revealed the spatial course and in vivo blood flow of the meningeal vessels and their relationships with the dura mater in sufficient detail. The meningeal branch of the intercostal artery split into multiple meningeal vessels on the outer dural surface adjacent to the root sleeve. After crossing the dura mater to the inner dural surface, these vessels gathered and joined a single intradural draining vessel. On the inner dural surface, the single draining vessel was fed by the surrounding multiple meningeal vessels, which appeared to be caput medusae. Histological findings revealed that the structure of the meningeal branch of the intercostal artery corresponded to that of a normal artery. The structure of intradural draining vessels corresponded to that of a vein modified by retrograde arterial inflow. On the inner dural surface, more than 1 meningeal artery gathered and joined with the proximal radiculomedullary vein. CONCLUSIONS Spinal dural AVFs are located on the inner dural surface, where multiple direct AV connections between more than 1 meningeal feeding artery and a single proximal radiculomedullary vein occur at the site where the vein connects to the dura mater.","output":"Microvascular anatomy of spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas: arteriovenous connections and their relationships with the dura mater."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the turn of the second and third decades of the XXI century Latin America was swept by waves of a systemic crisis;once again, Latin American countries entered a zone of increased turbulence A characteristic feature of the current stage of crisis shocks was a test of the strength of all existential structures of the regions mode of life (already experiencing bad times) with the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic The coronavirus epidemic, which put a number of Latin American countries on the brink of survival, arose in the context of a worsening economic condition, close to the collapse of the social situation, political instability, and emphasized the existing and emerging pain points in the countries of the region Thus, in Latin America a closely intertwined triune space of systemic failure has formed: an economic collapse, an aggravation of the socio-political situation and problem areas in the field of healthcare The article describes these three components of the systemic crisis: it analyzes the economic collapse of modern Latin American populism, draws a social landscape against which mass protests in 2019 developed and, finally, the reasons for the region getting into the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic are revealed, despite the maximum geographical distance of Latin America from the focus of the onset of coronavirus  ҧ֧ا ӧԧ  ֧֧ԧ է֧ڧݧ֧ڧ XXI  ѧڧߧܧ ާ֧ڧܧ ٧ѧݧ֧ߧݧ ӧݧߧ ڧ֧ާߧԧ ܧڧ٧ڧ,  ֧֧էߧ ѧ ݧѧڧߧѧާ֧ڧܧѧߧܧڧ ѧߧ ӧڧݧ  ٧ߧ ӧ֧ߧߧ ҧݧ֧ߧߧ ѧѧܧ֧ߧ ҧ֧ߧߧ ߧߧ֧ߧ֧ԧ ѧ ܧڧ٧ڧߧ ֧ߧڧ ѧݧ ڧѧߧڧ ߧ ߧ ӧ֧ ܧ٧ڧ֧ߧڧѧݧߧ ܧ اڧ٧ߧ֧է֧֧ݧߧ ֧ԧڧߧ ( ҧ֧ ԧ ֧֧اڧӧѧӧ֧ԧ ߧ ݧڧ ӧ֧ާ֧ߧ) ߧ֧ӧڧէѧߧߧ է֧ݧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ֧ COVID-19 ڧէ֧ާڧ ܧߧѧӧڧ, ѧӧڧӧѧ  ԧէѧ ѧڧߧܧ ާ֧ڧܧ ҧܧӧѧݧߧ ߧ ԧѧߧ ӧاڧӧѧߧڧ, ӧ٧ߧڧܧݧ  ܧߧ֧ܧ էѧ֧ԧ ܧߧާڧ֧ܧԧ ݧا֧ߧڧ, ҧݧڧ٧ܧ  ܧݧݧѧ ڧѧݧߧ ڧѧڧ, ݧڧڧ֧ܧ ߧ֧ѧҧڧݧߧ  ѧܧ֧ߧڧӧѧݧ ֧ӧڧ  ߧѧ٧֧ӧѧڧ ?ҧݧ֧ӧ ܧ?  ѧߧѧ ֧ԧڧߧ ѧܧڧ ҧѧ٧,  ѧڧߧܧ ާ֧ڧܧ ҧѧ٧ӧѧݧ ֧ߧ ֧֧ݧ֧֧ߧߧ ڧ֧էڧߧ ѧߧӧ ڧ֧ާߧԧ ҧ - ܧߧާڧ֧ܧڧ ҧӧѧ, ҧ֧ߧڧ ڧѧݧߧ-ݧڧڧ֧ܧ ҧѧߧӧܧ  ҧݧ֧ާߧ ٧ߧ  ֧ ٧էѧӧѧߧ֧ߧڧ  ѧ էѧߧ ѧѧܧ֧ڧڧܧ ܧѧ٧ѧߧߧ ֧ ѧӧߧ ѧ֧ ڧ֧ާߧԧ ܧڧ٧ڧ: ѧߧѧݧڧ٧ڧӧѧ ܧߧާڧ֧ܧڧ ܧѧ ӧ֧ާ֧ߧߧԧ ݧѧڧߧѧާ֧ڧܧѧߧܧԧ ݧڧ٧ާ, ֧֧ ڧѧݧߧ ݧѧߧէѧ, ߧ ߧ ܧԧ ѧ٧ӧڧӧѧݧڧ ާѧӧ ֧ 2019  , , ߧѧܧߧ֧, ӧܧ ڧڧߧ ?ѧէѧߧڧ? ֧ԧڧߧ  ڧ֧ߧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ COVID-19, ߧ֧ާ ߧ ԧ֧ԧѧڧ֧ܧ էѧݧ֧ߧߧ ѧڧߧܧ ާ֧ڧܧ  ѧԧ ӧ٧ߧڧܧߧӧ֧ߧڧ ܧߧѧӧڧ","output":"Three waves of the systemic crisis in Latin America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
