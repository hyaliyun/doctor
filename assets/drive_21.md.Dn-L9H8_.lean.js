Many studies on the potential roles of environmental factors in the transmission of the novel COVID-19 have been published. However, the impact of environmental factors on COVID-19 remains controversial. Machine learning techniques have been used effectively in combating the COVID-19 epidemic. However, researches related to machine learning on weather conditions in spreading COVID-19 is generally lacking. Therefore, in this study, three machine learning models (Convolution Neural Network (CNN), ADtree Classifier and BayesNet) based on the confirmed cases and weather variables such as temperature, humidity, wind and precipitation are developed. This study aims to identify the best classification model to classify COVID-19 by using significant weather features chosen by Principle Component Analysis (PCA) feature selection method. The DS4C COVID-19 data set is used to train and validate each machine learning model. Several data preprocessing tasks such as data cleaning and feature selection have been conducted on the raw dataset to ensure the quality of the training data. The performance of these machine learning algorithms is further rectified based on the selected features set by PCA. Each classifier is then optimized using different tuning parameters to achieve optimum values before comparing the output of the three classifiers against each other. The observational results have shown that the optimized CNN classifier with seven weather variables selected by PCA achieved the highest performance among all the techniques. The experimental results obtained show that the weather variables are more relevant in predicting the confirmed cases as compared to the other variables. Thus, from this result, it is evident that temperature, humidity, wind and precipitation are important features for predicting COVID-19 confirmed cases.","output":"Predicting COVID-19 Based on Environmental Factors With Machine Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The forcing online of higher education classes should have constituted a major reckoning of pedagogical practices in universities, particularly in the humanities.

This essay presents a phenomenological study of the abrupt transition from physical to online classes during the COVID\\\\19 lockdown of universities. Reworking two central theses of Marshall McLuhan's (1994) study of media, the author proposes two dispositions as necessary to encountering the role of new media in the teaching of the humanities: a state of wilful unpreparedness and a state of artistic creativity. These in turn pose educational dilemmas that require changes to the relationship between teachers, students and the learning environment, wherein these relationships become subjects of conscious study by the participants. The article draws on a range of classroom experiences in which the instructor and students attempted such a study.

The present study investigated the genetic variability of ACE2 in terms of single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variations (CNVs), and expression quantitative loci (eQTLs) in a cohort of 268 individuals representative of the general Italian population. The analysis identified five SNVs (rs35803318, rs41303171, rs774469453, rs773676270, and rs2285666) in the Italian cohort. Of them, rs35803318 and rs2285666 displayed a significant different frequency distribution in the Italian population with respect to worldwide population. The eQTLs analysis located in and targeting ACE2 revealed a high distribution of eQTL variants in different brain tissues, suggesting a possible link between ACE2 genetic variability and the neurological complications in patients with COVID-19. Further research is needed to clarify the possible relationship between ACE2 expression and the susceptibility to neurological complications in patients with COVID-19.

The demographic features, past medical history, clinical signs and symptoms, cardiac involvement, and the type of COVID-19 diagnosis confirmation were extracted. Results: In many children, MIS-C seems to be a post-infectious complication of the COVID-19 infection. This syndrome affects mul-tiple organs and has various clinical manifestations mimicking Kawasaki disease. Patients frequently present with persistent fever, kidney injury, gastrointestinal (GI) problems, neurologic symptoms, mucosal changes, conjunctivitis, and cardiac involvement. Children with MIS are more likely to present with hypotension, shock, and cardiac dysfunction, rather than coronary artery abnormalities and arrhythmia. Children with MIS need close observation;some need to be hospitalized, and a few may need a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admission. Treatment currently includes anticoagulants, IV immunoglobulin, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Conclusions: As a novel syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, MIS-C is potentially lethal.

They generally act by perturbing the bacterial cell membrane, and are thus less likely to induce resistance. Since they are membrane-active molecules, it is critical to verify and understand their potential action towards eukaryotic cells to help design effective and safe drugs. In this work, we studied the interaction of two antimicrobial peptides, aurein 1.2 and caerin 1.1, with red blood cell (RBC) membranes using in situ31P and 2H solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SS-NMR). To do so, we established a protocol to integrate up to 25% of deuterated fatty acids (FAs) in the membranes of ghosts, which are obtained when hemoglobin is removed from RBCs. The FA incorporation and the integrity of the lipid bilayer were confirmed by SS-NMR and fluorescence confocal microscopy. Leakage assays were performed to assess the lytic power of the AMPs. The in situ perturbation of the ghost membranes by aurein 1.2 and caerin 1.1 revealed by 31P and 2H SS-NMR is consistent with a membrane perturbation through a carpet mechanism for aurein 1.2, while caerin 1.1 would act on RBCs via pore formation.

Upon co-infection with infectious standard virus (STV), DIPs interfere with STV replication through competitive inhibition. Thus, DIPs are proposed as potent antivirals for treatment of the influenza disease. To select corresponding candidates, we studied de novo generation of DIPs and propagation competition between different defective interfering (DI) vRNAs in a STV co-infection scenario in cell culture. A small-scale two-stage cultivation system that allows long-term semi-continuous propagation of IAV and its DIPs was used. Strong periodic oscillations in virus titers were observed due to the dynamic interaction of DIPs and STVs. Using next-generation sequencing, we detected a predominant formation and accumulation of DI vRNAs on the polymerase-encoding segments. Short DI vRNAs accumulated to higher fractions than longer ones, indicating a replication advantage. Yet, a sweet spot of fragment length was observed. Some DI vRNAs showed breaking points in a specific part of their bundling signal (belonging to the packaging signal), suggesting its dispensability for DI vRNA propagation. Over a total cultivation time of 21 days, several individual DI vRNAs accumulated to high fractions, while others decreased. Using reverse genetics for IAV, purely clonal DIPs derived from highly replicating DI vRNAs were generated. We confirm that these DIPs exhibit a superior in vitro interfering efficacy than DIPs derived from lowly accumulated DI vRNAs and suggest promising candidates for efficacious antiviral treatment. Importance Defective interfering particles (DIPs) emerge naturally during viral infection and typically show an internal deletion in the viral genome. Thus, DIPs are propagation-incompetent. Previous research suggests DIPs as potent antiviral compounds for many different virus families due to their ability to interfere with virus replication by competitive inhibition. For instance, the administration of influenza A virus (IAV) DIPs resulted in a rescue of mice from an otherwise lethal IAV dose. Moreover, no apparent toxic effects were observed when only DIPs were administered to mice and ferrets. IAV DIPs show antiviral activity against many different IAV strains, including pandemic and highly pathogenic avian strains, and even against non-homologous viruses, like SARS-CoV-2, by stimulation of innate immunity. Here, we used a cultivation/infection system, which exerted selection pressure toward accumulation of highly competitive IAV DIPs. These DIPs showed a superior interfering efficacy in vitro, and we suggest them for effective antiviral therapy.","output":"Semi-continuous propagation of influenza A virus and its defective interfering particles: analyzing the dynamic competition to select candidates for antiviral therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Beijing has been severely affected by SARS, and SARS-associated coronavirus has been confirmed as its cause.

The study aims to identify the recovery measures and the medications used by COVID-19 patients at home. Methods An online-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted between 5 October 2020 and 5 January 2021 among the COVID-19 patients who did not seek care from hospitals and recovered at home. Participants from all the administrative divisions of Bangladesh were recruited via social media. After obtaining consent, subjects were enrolled to complete the questionnaire that included questions on demographic characteristics, clinical itinerary, non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches. Results Of the 241 respondents, the majority were males (64.3%), aged 21-30 years (42.3%), and urban residents (65.6%). Fever (92.5%), cough (78.4%), and sore throat (62.7%) were the most common symptoms. Hypertension (17.3%), allergic rhinitis (15.3%), and asthma (15.3%) were the most prevalent pre-existing chronic conditions. Most of the respondents adopted some non-pharmacological approaches, such as inhaling steam/gargling warm water (75.1%), drinking any hot drink (85.9%), and consuming vegetables and fruits (67.6%) daily. Among the medicines consumed, paracetamol was the highest (97.1%), followed by antihistamines (77.6%) and antibiotics (61.4%) while corticosteroid, antiparasitic and antiviral drugs were less consumed drugs. Binary logistic regression found, living in the urban area, level of education and pre-existing diabetes were significant factors that impact recovery time from the COVID-19. Conclusions Most of the individuals experienced mild to moderate symptoms and used non-pharmacological approaches, while over-the-counter drugs were the most consumed medicines. Though these measures did not contribute significantly to recovery time, these can be used as a form of home management in the early stage to reduce the disease severity and may be effective for mild and moderate patients.","output":"COVID-19 recovery measures and use of medications among COVID-19 patients at home: A cross- sectional study in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This study was done to evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness and safety of microwave (MW) ablation of lung tumours. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four patients underwent percutaneous MW ablation of 26 intraparenchymal pulmonary masses. All patients were judged to be inoperable on the basis of tumour stage, comorbidities, advanced age and/or refusal to undergo surgery. Ablation was performed using a microwave generator (Evident Microwave Ablation System, Covidien Ltd., Dublin). Lesions with a diameter  3 cm were treated with a single antenna, lesions with a diameter >3 cm were treated by positioning two or more antennae, simultaneously. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) follow-up with and without contrast administration at 1, 3 and 6 months and then yearly in combination with complete blood and metabolic tests. RESULTS Technical success was 100 %. No major complications were recorded. Asymptomatic grade-1 pneumothorax was recorded in 9 patients (37.5 %). One case of asymptomatic pleural effusion and one of haemoptysis, not requiring transfusion, were observed. No patients were diagnosed with a post-ablation syndrome. Complete necrosis was observed in 16 of 26 lesions (61.6 %). Partial necrosis was obtained in 30.8 % (8/26 lesions); in one case (3.8 %) a progression of the disease was recorded and in another case (3.8 %) a stability was observed.

This project was conducted to determine whether negative-pressure isolation for multiple patients can be achieved quickly and effectively using general hospital space not previously dedicated to respiratory isolation. METHODS: The physical therapy gymnasium was the area designated to test the ability to create a negative-pressure isolation environment in a large space. The conversion was planned in advance of an unscheduled drill to convert the space. Four high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtered forced air machines were used to generate negative pressure. The units were vented to the outside air by a 25-foot length of 10-inch-diameter reusable duct. We evaluated the time needed for equipment setup and room conversion and noted any subjective difficulty with either setup or operation of the equipment. We measured the ability of the equipment to generate a negative air pressure relative to adjacent areas and determined the noise levels created during the use of different combinations of machines at various power settings. RESULTS: After drill activation and the request for equipment setup, 1 hour was required to convert the physical therapy gymnasium into an operational negative-pressure environment. The room pressure readings high power ranged from ?1.5 to ?13 Pa (?0.006 to ?0.052 inches of water), and noise levels ranged from 70 to 76 dB. Calculated air changes per hour using 1, 2, 3, or 4 units running simultaneously at high power were 4.1, 8.2, 12.3, and 16.4, respectively. Using 4 units at once running at low power setting yielded 8.2 air changes per hour and generated a room pressure reading of ?8.0 Pa, or ?0.032 inches of water. CONCLUSION: Portable HEPA filtered forced air units are an effective means of creating large patient care areas with the negative-pressure environment required for respiratory isolation. This design results in a significantly lower-cost alternative compared with construction of individual rooms or units with similar capability and can be retrofitted to existing space. This type of unit would allow treatment of many more patients than current hospital capability would permit and would be an important asset in meeting the needs created by bioterrorism or a naturally occurring epidemic.","output":"Use of a portable forced air system to convert existing hospital space into a mass casualty isolation area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a main role in regulating blood pressure and electrolyte and liquid balance.

METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the compliance with WHO quality standards, that is, the Model Quality Assurance System for Procurement Agencies (MQAS) or the good distribution practices (GDP), of a convenience sample of 75 public, private-for-profit and non-for-profit distributors, audited by QUAMED in 14 low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) between 2017 and 2019. We calculated the compliance per quality assurance activity, and we defined the percentage of compliant distributors, that is, the percentage (%) of distributors with MQAS or GDP levels of >2 for each activity. RESULTS: The distributors in our sample were mainly private for-profit (66/75). Only one MQAS-audited distributor out of 11 was found compliant with all MQAS-activities, while none out of 64 GDP-assessed distributors were found compliant with all GDP activities. The GDP-assessed distributors were generally less compliant with WHO standards than MQAS-audited distributors. Common weaknesses and strengths were observed. The activities with lowest compliance were quality control, and physical storage conditions, while those with highest compliance were warehouse organisation and stock control. CONCLUSIONS: The quality systems of pharmaceutical distributors in LMICs remain weak. For preventing harm caused by poor-quality medicines, a comprehensive and stringent regulatory oversight should be urgently implemented; the WHO MQAS-standards and GDP-standards should be incorporated in national regulations; and reliable information on the quality systems of distributors (and manufacturers from which they buy) should be publicly available.","output":"Quality assurance systems of pharmaceutical distributors in low-income and middle-income countries: weaknesses and ways forward"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Endometriomas are present in up to 44% of all women with endometriosis and have a detrimental effect on fertility. However, it is controversial whether endometriomas should be surgically removed before assisted reproduction technology. Our purpose was to evaluate whether surgical stripping of endometriomas in subfertile women improves the chance of a live birth. Secondary outcomes were impact on ovarian reserve and pain. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with results reported in accordance to the PRISMA guidelines. A summary of findings table was developed using GRADE. We searched Medline and Embase. Two reviewers performed the screening. RESULTS Of 686 manuscripts, we included one randomized controlled trial and nine retrospective cohort studies, mostly of low quality. The odds ratio for live birth after surgery [compared with conservative management before in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)] was 0.87 (95% CI 0.64-1.18, six studies, I2 = 3%; ?, VERY LOW quality). The mean difference of antral follicle count was -2.09 (95% CI -4.84 to 0.67, four studies). No difference was observed regarding antral follicle count between the two groups (MD -2.09, 95% CI -4.84 to 0.67, four studies, ?, VERY LOW quality). Pain outcome was not reported in the included studies. CONCLUSION The very low quality evidence suggests no difference in odds ratio of live birth between women who underwent surgery for endometriomas before IVF/ICSI compared with conservative management. Further high quality studies are needed, but due to a lack of convincing evidence favoring surgery, we recommend considering conservative treatment if the only indication is subfertility.","output":"Surgery versus conservative management of endometriomas in subfertile women.

Rapidly expanding an existing acute care physician workforce is critical to pandemic response planning in large urban academic health systems. INTERVENTION: The Medical Emergency-Pandemic Operations Command (MEOC)a multi-specialty team of physicians, operational leaders, and support staff within an academic Department of Medicine in Calgary, Canadapartnered with its provincial health system to rapidly develop a comprehensive, scalable pandemic physician workforce plan for non-ventilated inpatients with COVID-19 across multiple hospitals. The MEOC Pandemic Plan comprised seven components, each with unique structure and processes. METHODS: In this manuscript, we describe MEOCs Pandemic Plan that was designed and implemented from March to May 2020 and re-escalated in October 2020. We report on the plans structure and process, early implementation outcomes, and unforeseen challenges. Data sources included MEOC documents, health system, public health, and physician engagement implementation data. KEY RESULTS: From March 5 to October 26, 2020, 427 patients were admitted to COVID-19 units in Calgary hospitals. In the initial implementation period (MarchCMay 2020), MEOC communications reached over 2500 physicians, leading to 1446 physicians volunteering to provide care on COVID-19 units. Of these, 234 physicians signed up for hospital shifts, and 227 physicians received in-person personal protective equipment simulation training. Ninety-three physicians were deployed on COVID-19 units at four large acute care hospitals. The resurgence of cases in September 2020 has prompted re-escalation including re-activation of COVID-19 units.

The first model was formulated without the inclusion of community awareness. The analysis focused on investigating the mathematical behavior of the model, which can explain how medical masks, medical treatment, and rapid testing can be used to suppress the spread of COVID-19. In the second model, community awareness was taken into account, and all the interventions considered were represented as time-dependent parameters.

Results: There were no COVID-19 related deaths. 1 pt (0.5%) had SACT delay due to confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall mortality at 6 months in each timeframe was 6.9% in 2020 and 8.1% in 2019. In the comparative 3-month intervals, similar numbers of GYN cancer pts received SACT in 2020 compared to 2019: 170 patients (126 ovarian;44 non-ovarian) in 2020, 184 (131 ovarian;53 nonovarian) in 2019. Median age was 61y in both groups and BAME ethnicity was balanced. In 2020, more pts had Stg III/IV disease (93%) than 2019 (84%) and fewer had Stg I/II disease (7%) compared to 2019 (16%). PS was: 0-1 in 92% of patients in 2020 vs 85% in 2019. The average number of cycles of SACT delivered in each time frame was 3. In 2020 9% received neoadjuvant SACT of which 69% proceeded to planned surgery and 31% were deemed unfit. Comparatively, in 2019 7% received neoadjuvant SACT of whom 75% proceeded to surgery and 25% were deemed unfit. In 2020, 3 pt received chemoradiation compared to 8 in 2019. 40 of 170 pts (24%) had 1-5 week treatment delays in 2020 due to any aetiology with. In 2019 there were treatment delays in 63 of 184 pts (34%). The use of GCSF in support of all SACT regimens was 52% in 2020 vs 11% in 2019. Conclusions: There was no increase in mortality associated with SACT during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in GYN cancer pts. 0.5% of pts had confirmed SARS-COV2 infection. We were able to maintain full SACT delivery for all GYN cancer pts with average cycle number unchanged between 2019 and 2020. There was no significant reduction in surgical debulking rates. In contrast, there was a reduction in GYN cancer pts receiving chemoradiation. More pts presented with Stg III/IV disease in 2020. Increased use of GSCF may have contributed to the reduced chemotherapy delays in 2020. Further research will explore the impact of vaccination.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on treatment in patients (pts) with gynecological (GYN) cancer: A comparison with 2019 data from Guy's Cancer Centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Recently, there has been an increase in the prevalence of action video gaming among adolescents and young adults. This has made video gaming a topic of interest for behavioral and higher brain cognitive function researchers. The present study investigated the impact and consequences of action video gaming on human behaviorspecifically, attention, anxiety levels, and sleep patterns. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the potential associations between action video gaming and attention, anxiety, and sleep. METHODS: Recruited participants (N = 97) were asked to independently complete an online questionnaire consisting of 4 sections: demographic data, gaming behavior, 8-item Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorders Scale. Participants were further divided into 2 groups (expert and non-expert video gamers) based on the number of hours they spent on action video games. After completing the questionnaires, the patients attended an on-site session, where they completed a validated psychological online battery test that assessed their sustained attention. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 21 years. There was a significant difference in attention between expert and non-expert video gamers; when exposed to stimuli, expert gamers displayed significantly shorter reaction times than the non-expert gamers (p < 0.05). Both groups showed a non-significant decrease in attention span throughout time. The data demonstrated no statistically significant difference in anxiety levels or daytime sleepiness between expert and non-expert video gamers, and minimal to mild anxiety levels were reported in most expert and non-expert gamers. CONCLUSION: Expert video gamers were significantly more attentive compared to non-expert gamers, and most participants showed low levels of generalized anxiety. Accordingly, expanding our knowledge on the effects of action video games on attention span is important for creatively using games in the field of education, especially for those who suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorders.","output":"Impact of Action Video Gaming Behavior on Attention, Anxiety, and Sleep Among University Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing global pandemic of infection disease COVID-19 caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2, formerly 2019-nCoV) presents critical threats to public health and the economy.

To this end, we present a mathematical method for the genomic spectrum, a kind of barcode, of SARS-CoV-2 and common human coronaviruses. The genomic spectrum is constructed according to the periodic distributions of nucleotides and therefore reflects the unique characteristics of the genome. The results demonstrate that coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 exhibits predominant latent periodicity-2 regions of non-structural proteins 3, 4, 5, and 6. Further analysis of the latent periodicity-2 regions suggests that the dinucleotide imbalances are increased during evolution and may confer the evolutionary fitness of the virus. Especially, SARS-CoV-2 isolates have increased latent periodicity-2 and periodicity-3 during COVID-19 pandemic. The special strong periodicity-2 regions and the intensity of periodicity-2 in the SARS-CoV-2 whole genome may become diagnostic and pharmaceutical targets in monitoring and curing the COVID-19 disease.","output":"Latent periodicity-2 in coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome: Evolutionary implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in England was characterized by two major waves of infections: the first one was highly spatially localized (mainly in the London area), while the second one spread homogeneously through the entire country. The reasons behind this complex spatiotemporal dynamics have yet to be clarified. In this study, we perform a Bayesian analysis of five models entailing different hypotheses on the possible determinants of the observed pattern. We find a consensus among all models in showing a surprisingly low transmission distance (defined as the geographic distance between the place of residence of the infectors and her/his infectees) during the first wave: about 1.5 km (2.2 km if infections linked to household and school transmission are excluded). The best-fitting model entails a change in human activity regarding contacts not related to household and school. By using this model we estimate that the transmission distance sharply increased to 5.3 km (10 km when excluding infections linked to household and school transmission) during the second wave. Our study reveals a possible explanation for the observed pattern and highlights the need of better understanding human mobility and activity patterns under the pressure posed by a pandemic threat.","output":"Detecting a Surprisingly Low Transmission Distance in the Early Phase of the 2009 Influenza Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has challenged the delivery of health services.

However, its diagnosis is often inaccurate. We aim to compare the diagnostic accuracy, the clinical and cost outcomes and the use of antibiotics associated with three imaging strategies in patients >65 years old with suspected pneumonia in the emergency room (ER): chest X-ray (CXR, standard of care), low-dose CT scan (LDCT) or lung ultrasonography (LUS). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre randomised superiority clinical trial with three parallel arms. Patients will be allocated in the ER to a diagnostic strategy based on either CXR, LDCT or LUS. All three imaging modalities will be performed but the results of two of them will be masked during 5 days to the patients, the physicians in charge of the patients and the investigators according to random allocation. The primary objective is to compare the accuracy of LDCT versus CXR-based strategies. As secondary objectives, antibiotics prescription, clinical and cost outcomes will be compared, and the same analyses repeated to compare the LUS and CXR strategies. The reference diagnosis will be established a posteriori by a panel of experts. Based on a previous study, we expect an improvement of 16% of the accuracy of pneumonia diagnosis using LDCT instead of CXR. Under this assumption, and accounting for 10% of drop-out, the enrolment of 495 patients is needed to prove the superiority of LDCT over CRX (alpha error=0.05, beta error=0.10).

While recent reviews of videoconference-based neuropsychological applications have been published, no updated compilation of empirical TBCA research has been completed. Therefore, this scoping review offers relevant empirical research to inform clinical decision-making specific to teleneuropsychology. METHOD: Peer-reviewed studies addressing TBCA were included. Broad search terms were related to telephone, cognitive, or neuropsychological assessment and screening. After systematic searching of the PubMed and EBSCO databases, 139 relevant articles were retained. RESULTS: In total, 17 unique cognitive screening measures, 20 cognitive batteries, and 6 single-task measures were identified as being developed or adapted specifically for telephone administration. Tables summarizing the identified cognitive assessments, information on diagnostic accuracy, and comparisons to face-to-face cognitive assessment are included in supplementary materials. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, literature suggests that TBCA is a viable modality for identifying cognitive impairment in various populations. However, the mode of assessment selected clinically should reflect an understanding of the purpose, evidence, and limitations for various tests and populations. Most identified measures were developed for research application to support gross cognitive characterization and to help determine when more comprehensive testing was needed.

OBJECTIVE: To standardize the teleneurology selection process in HD by implementing a screening tool that accounts for patient-specific factors. METHODS: We organized various indications and contraindications to teleneurology into a flowchart. If any indications or contraindications were met, patients were assigned to telehealth or maintained as in-person, respectively. If no indications or contraindications were met, patients were given the option of telehealth or in-person for their upcoming appointments. In two implementation cycles, we tested this screening tool among all HD patients scheduled for clinic visits, aided by chart review and phone interview.

It has been shown that the BIS is sensitive to changes in electromyogram (EMG) activity in anaesthetized patients. A single study using an earlier version of the BIS showed that decreased EMG activity caused the BIS to decrease even in awake subjects, to levels that suggested deep sedation and anaesthesia. METHODS We administered suxamethonium and rocuronium to 10 volunteers who were fully awake, to determine whether the BIS decreased in response to neuromuscular block alone. An isolated forearm technique was used for communication during the experiment. Two versions of the BIS monitor were used, both of which are in current use. Sugammadex was used to antagonise the neuromuscular block attributable to rocuronium. RESULTS The BIS decreased after the onset of neuromuscular block in both monitors, to values as low as 44 and 47, and did not return to pre-test levels until after the return of movement. The BIS showed a two-stage decrease, with an immediate reduction to values around 80, and then several minutes later, a sharp decrease to lower values. In some subjects, there were periods where the BIS was <60 for several minutes. The response was similar for both suxamethonium and rocuronium. Neither monitor was consistently superior in reporting the true state of awareness. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that the BIS monitor requires muscle activity, in addition to an awake EEG, in order to generate values indicating that the subject is awake. Consequently, BIS may be an unreliable indicator of awareness in patients who have received neuromuscular blocking drugs.

Therefore, a comprehensive yet dependable monitoring program is particularly beneficial for guiding the practice. However, conventional measurements can only produce limited discrete data. This paper exploits the potential of the terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) for an accurate inventory of as-built states of a concrete-faced rockfill dam under construction and for a full-field analysis of the 3D deformation pattern over its upstream face. For the former, a well-designed 3D geodetic system, with a particular consideration of the topography, promises a regulated acquisition of high-quality and blind-zone-free point cloud at field and also eases the cumbersome data registration process while maintaining its precision in house. For the latter, a problem-tailored processing pipeline is proposed for deformation extraction. Its core idea is to achieve a highly precise alignment of the point clouds with Iterative Closed Point algorithms from different epochs in datum areas that displays a featured, undeformed geometry at stable positions across epochs. Then, the alignment transformation matrix is applied to the point clouds of respective upstream face for each epoch, followed by pairwise comparisons of multiple adjusted point clouds for deformation evaluation. A processing pipeline is used to exploit the peal scene data redundancy of the GLQ dam acquired at six different epochs. Statistical analysis shows that satisfactory accuracy for deformation detection can be repeatably achieved, regardless of the scanners positioning uncertainties. The obtained 3D deformation patterns are characterised by three different zones: practically undeformed, outward and inward deformed zones. Their evolutions comply well with real construction stages and unique 3D valley topography. Abundant deformation results highlight the potential of TLS combined with the proposed data processing pipeline for cost-efficient monitoring of huge infrastructures compared to conventional labor-intense measurements.","output":"As-Built Inventory and Deformation Analysis of a High Rockfill Dam under Construction with Terrestrial Laser Scanning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 69\\\\year\\\\old man with a history of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure was diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19).

No new adverse events associated with vosoritide treatment were detected with up to 2 years of continuous daily, subcutaneous treatment. Most adverse events were mild and no serious adverse events were attributed to vosoritide. The most common adverse event remains mild and transient injection site reactions. Conclusions: The effect of vosoritide administration on growth as measured through AGV and height Z-score was maintained for up to 2-years in children with achondroplasia aged 5 to 18 years, with an improvement of body proportions.","output":"Persistent and Stable Growth Promoting Effects of Vosoritide in Children With Achondroplasia for up to 2 Years: Results From the Ongoing Phase 3 Extension Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Amazon biome is under severe threat due to increasing deforestation rates and loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services while sustaining a high burden of neglected tropical diseases. Approximately two thirds of this biome are located within Brazilian territory. There, socio-economic and environmental landscape transformations are linked to the regional agrarian economy dynamics, which has developed into six techno-productive trajectories (TTs). These TTs are the product of the historical interaction between Peasant and Farmer and Rancher practices, technologies and rationalities. This article investigates the distribution of the dominant Brazilian Amazon TTs and their association with environmental degradation and vulnerability to neglected tropical diseases. The goal is to provide a framework for the joint debate of the local economic, environmental and health dimensions. We calculated the dominant TT for each municipality in 2017. Peasant trajectories (TT1, TT2, and TT3) are dominant in ca. fifty percent of the Amazon territory, mostly concentrated in areas covered by continuous forest where malaria is an important morbidity and mortality cause. Cattle raising trajectories are associated with higher deforestation rates. Meanwhile, Farmer and Rancher economies are becoming dominant trajectories, comprising large scale cattle and grain production. These trajectories are associated with rapid biodiversity loss and a high prevalence of neglected tropical diseases, such as leishmaniasis, Aedes-borne diseases and Chagas disease. Overall, these results defy simplistic views that the dominant development trajectory for the Amazon will optimize economic, health and environmental indicators. This approach lays the groundwork for a more integrated narrative consistent with the economic history of the Brazilian Amazon.","output":"Epidemiology, Biodiversity, and Technological Trajectories in the Brazilian Amazon: From Malaria to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The crosstalk between host immunity and the external environment in the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts in bronchial asthma has recently been scrutinized There is compelling evidence that the microbiota at these sites may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this chronic airway disease The appearance of bacteria early in life in the gut before dissemination to the airways plays a pivotal role in shaping mucosal immunity Loss of microbial diversity or dysbiosis can result in aberrant immune-mediated inflammation and mucosal barrier disruption, which coincides clinically with the successive development of the \\"allergic march\\" in asthma Microbial manipulation may be effective in curbing asthma development by indirectly preserving homeostatic epithelial barrier functions The protective effects and mechanisms of immunity-microbiome crosstalk at mucosal sites require further investigation to identify therapeutic and preventive measures in asthma This topical review aims to highlight new evidence that compromised epithelial barrier function, which results in deregulated crosstalk between the microbiome and host mucosal immune system, is an important disease mechanism in asthma In the light of current COVID-19 pandemic, the collective findings on the impact of mucosal microbiota on the suceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19 is explored The possible therapeutic implications to target these abnormalities are further discussed","output":"Dynamic Interplay Between Microbiota and Mucosal Immunity in Early Shaping of Asthma and its Implication for the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 53-year-old female admitted to the hospital for generalized weakness, fever, and cough, tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

While we have been willingly moving towards open societies and reducing movement barriers, there is a need to be prepared for minimizing the openness of society on occasions such as large pandemics, which are low probability events with massive impacts. Certainly, similar to many phenomena, the Covid-19 pandemic has shown us its own geography presenting its emergence and evolving patterns as well as taking advantage of our geographical settings for escalating its spread. Hence, this study aims at presenting a data-driven approach for exploring the spatio-temporal patterns of the pandemic over a regional scale, i.e., Europe and a country scale, i.e., Denmark, and also what geographical variables potentially contribute to expediting its spread. We used official regional infection rates, points of interest, temperature and air pollution data for monitoring the pandemic's spread across Europe and also applied geospatial methods such as spatial autocorrelation and space-time autocorrelation to extract relevant indicators that could explain the dynamics of the pandemic. Furthermore, we applied statistical methods, e.g., ordinary least squares, geographically weighted regression, as well as machine learning methods, e.g., random forest for exploring the potential correlation between the chosen underlying factors and the pandemic spread. Our findings indicate that population density, amenities such as cafes and bars, and pollution levels are the most influential explanatory variables while pollution levels can be explicitly used to monitor lockdown measures and infection rates at country level. The choice of data and methods used in this study along with the achieved results and presented discussions can empower health authorities and decision makers with an interactive decision support tool, which can be useful for imposing geographically varying lockdowns and protectives measures using historical data.","output":"The Geography of the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Data-Driven Approach to Exploring Geographical Driving Forces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work examines the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize cyclic lockdowns, which is one of the methods available for control of the COVID-19 pandemic. The problem is structured as an optimal control system for tracking a reference value, corresponding to the maximum usage level of a critical resource, such as ICU beds. However, instead of using conventional optimal control methods, RL is used to find optimal control policies. A framework was developed to calculate optimal cyclic lockdown timings using an RL-based on-off controller. The RL-based controller is implemented as an RL agent that interacts with an epidemic simulator, implemented as an extended SEIR epidemic model. The RL agent learns a policy function that produces an optimal sequence of open/lockdown decisions such that goals specified in the RL reward function are optimized. Two concurrent goals were used: the first one is a public health goal that minimizes overshoots of ICU bed usage above an ICU bed threshold, and the second one is a socio-economic goal that minimizes the time spent under lockdowns. It is assumed that cyclic lockdowns are considered as a temporary alternative to extended lockdowns when a region faces imminent danger of overpassing resource capacity limits and when imposing an extended lockdown would cause severe social and economic consequences due to lack of necessary economic resources to support its affected population during an extended lockdown.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic Cyclic Lockdown Optimization Using Reinforcement Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19 brings increased risk to the mental health of asylum seekers and refugees in Australia on temporary visas.

Meanwhile, their eye movement data were collected through Dikablis Glasses. Mayers multimedia cognitive theory was adopted to discriminate the pivotal components of online course, and the MannCWhitney relevance analysis demonstrated that different representations of courses affected the viewers attention differently. Results Three subjects watched three different types of political courses. Course 1, which combined text and explanation, attracted the most attention. Course 2 was shown to be less attractive than course 1 and better than course 3, but the subjects were distracted by the animations in course 2. Course 3, which did not use any technique to present learning content, attracts the least attention from the subjects. A correlation analysis shows that course 1 and course 3 have similar results compared with course 2. Conclusion Online courses have become a norm during the COVID-19 pandemic. Improving the quality of online courses can effectively reduce the impact of the epidemic on teaching. These experiment results suggest that text + commentary in the design of online courses can effectively attract the attention of the listeners and achieve better learning results.

A media coverage analysis compares the safety perceptions of visitors and non-visitors. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods approach was adopted. Based on a content analysis of 204 news items related to safety incidents in Thailand, this paper divides the factors of safety perception into four dimensions. The quantitative data were gathered by self-administered questionnaires from 370 visitors who have previously visited Thailand and 407 potential visitors yet to visit Thailand. Findings: The results demonstrated significant differences in the safety perceptions of visitors and non-visitors, indicating non-visitors fear of uncertainty and intolerance of the exotic. The study also confirmed social-demographic characteristics influence destination safety perceptions. For non-visitors, safety issues tend to have a negative influence on future visit intention, but those with previous travel experience have less concerns. Research limitations/implications: The findings provide valuable insights to industry practice. More publicity campaigns within the Chinese media may reduce the spillover effects of crisis events and correct the potentially inaccurate images of disease and terrorism risk.

This study describes reported barriers and coping mechanisms to accessing healthcare among chronic care patients during the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown in Rwanda. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among chronic care patients enrolled in pediatric development, HIV/AIDS, non-communicable diseases, mental health, and oncology programs at 3 rural Rwandan districts. Active patients with an appointment scheduled between MarchCJune 2020 and a phone number recorded in the electronic medical record system were eligible. Data were collected by telephone interviews between 23rd April and 11th May 2020, with proxy reporting by caregivers for children and critically ill-patients. Fishers exact tests were used to measure associations. Logistic regression analysis was also used to assess factors associated with reporting at least one barrier to accessing healthcare during the lockdown. RESULTS: Of 220 patient respondents, 44% reported at least one barrier to accessing healthcare. Barriers included lack of access to emergency care (n = 50; 22.7%), lack of access to medication (n = 44; 20.0%) and skipping clinical appointments (n = 37; 16.8%). Experiencing barriers was associated with the clinical program (p < 0.001), with oncology patients being highly affected (64.5%), and with increasing distance from home to the health facility (p = 0.031). In the adjusted logistic regression model, reporting at least one barrier to accessing healthcare was associated with the patient's clinical program and district of residence. Forty (18.2%) patients identified positive coping mechanisms to ensure continuation of care, such as walking long distances during suspension of public transport (n = 21; 9.6%), contacting clinicians via telephone for guidance or rescheduling appointments (n = 15; 6.8%), and delegating someone else for medication pick-up (n = 6; 2.7%). Of 124 patients who reported no barriers to accessing healthcare, 9% used positive coping mechanisms. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of chronic care patients experienced barriers to accessing healthcare during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, many patients also independently identified positive coping mechanisms to ensure continuation of care - strategies that could be formally adopted by healthcare systems in Rwanda and similar settings to mitigate effects of future lockdowns on patients.","output":"Barriers and coping mechanisms to accessing healthcare during the COVID-19 lockdown: a cross-sectional survey among patients with chronic diseases in rural Rwanda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Thoracic ultrasound has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pulmonary involvement. Several scores for quantifying the degree of involvement have been described, although there is no evidence to show that they have any capacity for predicting unfavorable progress. METHODOLOGY: Prospective cohort study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The sample was stratified according to clinical course, and patients requiring invasive or non-invasive respiratory support were classified as having unfavorable progress. Biomarkers were analyzed at admission and on the same day that thoracic ultrasound was performed. Prognostic scales were also determined at admission. The ultrasound score was obtained in 8 or 14 areas, depending on the patient's ability to sit. RESULTS: We included 44 patients, 13 (29,5%) of whom subsequently needed ventilatory support. Eight areas were explored in all patients and 14 areas in 35 (79.5%). The most affected areas were the posterior lower lobes. Significant differences were found between the 2groups on the SOFA and quick SOFA multidimensional scales, and PCR and LDH on the same day as thoracic ultrasound, and the ultrasound scores.

There are few studies describing the duration of TB disease and its treatment from the pre-chemotherapy era and little data on how these treatments changed in response to the development of effective antibiotics. The goal of this research is to understand how inpatient treatment for high incidence populations, the First Nations peoples of Saskatchewan, Canada, changed in response to increasing availability of antibiotics effective against TB. We expected that as treatment regimens transitioned from convalescence-only to triple antibiotic therapy, the length of inpatient treatment would shorten. METHODS: Analyses were performed on records of sanatoria admissions and discharges occurring between 1933 and 1959 in Saskatchewan, Canada. Year of antibiotic discovery was taken as a proxy for treatment regimen: no chemotherapy (pre-1944), mono-therapy (Streptomycin, 1944C1946), dual-therapy (Streptomycin and PAS, 1946C1952), and triple-therapy (Streptomycin, PAS, and INH 1952-). A pooled linear regression of log-transformed length of first admission as predicted by year of admission was modeled to assess the relationship between admission length and year of admission, corrected for clinical and demographic variables. RESULTS: First admission length increased 19% in the triple-therapy era as compared to the pre-chemotherapy era, from 316 days (10.4 months) to 377 days (12.4 months). After the discovery of INH (1952), we find statistically significant increases in the proportion of successfully completed therapies (0.55 versus 0.60, p = 0.035), but also in patients who left hospital against medical advice (0.19 versus 0.29, p < 0.0001), indicating that as hospitalizations lengthened, more patients chose to discharge without the sanction of their physician. The readmission rate increased from 10 to 50% of all admissions while the province-level TB-specific death rate fell from 63.1 per 10,000 in 1933 to 4.7 per 10,000 in 1958. CONCLUSION: Counterintuitively, we find that the length of first admissions increased with the discovery of TB-treating antibiotics. Increasing admission volume and readmission rate indicate an intensification of inpatient TB treatment during this era. These analyses provide a novel estimate of the effect of changing treatment policy on sanatorium admissions in this population.

In view of the fragmentation of the large amount of information, knowledge gaps in relation to laboratory markers, and scarcity of papers in Portuguese, we propose a Literature review on laboratory changes observed in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS Analysis of articles published between December 2019 and May 2020 on the PubMed and SciELO databases. The articles were identified, filtered, and evaluated based on the approach to the subject, language, and impact. Then, the articles were subjected to a thorough reading, in full, by 4 (four) independent researchers. RESULTS Leukopenia and lymphopenia were included in most studies, even in case definitions. Platelet count and platelet-lymphocyte ratio, at peak platelet, were associated with advanced age and longer hospital stay. Eosinopenia showed a sensitivity of 74.7% and specificity of 68.7% and, together with increased CRP, these are one of the future prospects for screening for disease.

We performed an interrupted time-series study of institutional hand hygiene adherence in association with a COVID-19 inpatient census and the Ontario daily count of COVID-19 cases during a baseline period (Nov. 1, 2019, to Feb. 29, 2020), the pre-peak period of the first wave of the pandemic (Mar. 1 to Apr. 24, 2020), and the post-peak period of the first wave (Apr. 25 to July 5, 2020).

RESULTS: At baseline, the rate of hand hygiene adherence was 46.0% (6 325 401 of 13 750 968 opportunities) and this improved beginning in March 2020 to a daily peak of 79.3% (66 640 of 84 026 opportunities) on Mar. 30, 2020. Each patient admitted with COVID-19 was associated with improved hand hygiene adherence (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.0621, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0619C1.0623). Increasing Ontario daily case count was similarly associated with improved hand hygiene (IRR 1.0026, 95% CI 1.0021C1.0032). After peak COVID-19 community and inpatient numbers, hand hygiene adherence declined and returned to baseline. INTERPRETATION: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with significant improvement in hand hygiene adherence, measured using a group electronic monitoring system. Future research should seek to determine whether strategies that focus on health care worker perception of personal risk can achieve sustainable improvements in hand hygiene performance.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on hospital hand hygiene performance: a multicentre observational study using group electronic monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the current global coronavirus pandemic and more than one million infections since December 2019. The exact origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive, but the presence of a distinct motif in the S1/S2 junction region suggests the possible acquisition of cleavage site(s) in the spike protein that promoted cross-species transmission. Through plaque purification of Vero-E6 cultured SARS-CoV-2, we found a series of variants which contain 15-30-bp deletions (Del-mut) or point mutations respectively at the S1/S2 junction. Examination of the original clinical specimen from which the isolate was derived, and 26 additional SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens, failed to detect these variants. Infection of hamsters shows that one of the variants (Del-mut-1) which carries deletion of 10 amino acids (30bp) does not cause the body weight loss or more severe pathological changes in the lungs that is associated with wild type virus infection. We suggest that the unique cleavage motif promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans may be under strong selective pressure, given that replication in permissive Vero-E6 cells leads to the loss of this adaptive function. It would be important to screen the prevalence of these variants in asymptomatic infected cases. The potential of the Del-mut variants as an attenuated vaccine or laboratory tool should be evaluated.","output":"Attenuated SARS-CoV-2 variants with deletions at the S1/S2 junction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection caused by spirochaete.

However, there remains a lack of guidance on how ERSs can embed social support opportunities within their provision. This study presents retrospective acceptability findings from a 12-week social-identity-informed peer support intervention to enhance perceived social support among clients of an English ERS. Five peer volunteers were recruited, trained, and deployed in supervised ERS sessions across two sites. Peers assisted exercise referral officers (EROs) by providing supplementary practical, informational, motivational, and emotional support to ERS clients. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with peers (n = 4), EROs (n = 2), and clients (n = 5) and analysed thematically. The analysis identified three primary themes. The first theme detailed how EROs utilised peer volunteers to supplement the ERS client experience. This theme delineated peer roles within the ERS context and identified salient individual peer characteristics that contributed to their success. The second theme described peer acceptability among the various stakeholders. Peers were valued for their ability to reduce burden on EROs and to enhance perceptions of comfort among ERS clients. The final theme presented participant feedback regarding how the intervention may be further refined and enhanced. Peers represented a cost-effective and acceptable means of providing auxiliary social support to ERS clients. Moving forward, the structured integration of peers can improve the accessibility of social support among ERS participants, thus facilitating better rates of ERS completion.","output":"Multi-Stakeholder Retrospective Acceptability of a Peer Support Intervention for Exercise Referral"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There remains a great challenge to minimize the spread of epidemics. This may be particularly true on densely populated, residential college campuses. To construct class and residential networks I used data from a four-year, residential liberal arts college with 5539 students. Equal-sized random networks also were created for each day. Different levels of compliance with mask use (none to 100%), mask efficacy (50% to 100%), and testing frequency (daily, or every 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, or 105 days) were assessed. Tests were assumed to be only 90% accurate and positive results were used to isolate individuals. I also tested the effectiveness of contact tracing and subsequent quarantining of neighbors of infectious individuals. I used class enrollment and residence data from a college with 5539 students to analyze network structure and test the epidemic potential of the infectious disease agent SARS-CoV-2. Average path lengths were longer in the college networks compared to random networks. Students in larger majors generally had shorter average path lengths. Average transitivity (clustering) was lower on days when students most frequently were in class (MWF). Degree distributions were generally large and right skewed, ranging from 0 to 719. Simulations began by inoculating twenty students (10 exposed and 10 infectious) with SARS-CoV-2 on the first day of the fall semester and ended once the disease was cleared. Transmission probability was calculated based on an R0 = 2:4. Without interventions epidemics resulted in most students becoming infected and lasted into the second semester. On average students in the college networks experienced fewer infections, shorter duration, and lower epidemic peaks that occurred compared to dynamics on equal-sized random networks. The most important factors in reducing case numbers were the proportion masking and the frequency of testing, followed by contact tracing and mask efficacy.

Relative age effects (RAE) impact athlete selection processes in the short and long-term performance. The aims of this study were: (i) examine the presence of RAE by gender, competitive level, and playing position, as well as evaluate the impact of RAE on individual (goals, percentage of effectiveness in shots, saves; percentage of effectiveness in saves, assists, turnovers, steals, blocked shots, penalties, minutes played, and minutes played per match) and collective competition performance (final team position); and (ii) analyse the impact of RAE on the evolutionary trends of individual performance in international competitions throughout 16 seasons in Spanish handball (2005C2020). Methods: The sample included 631 Spanish handball players (male: n = 359; female: n = 272). A Chi-square goodness-of-fit test was used to assess whether a skewed birthdate distribution occurred. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of independent measures was used to examine the individual and collective statistical parameters by birth quartiles. A linear regression in a Hopkins sheet were performed to compare individual performance trends. Results: The results revealed RAE in the male formative categories (p < 0.001), as well as the male and female senior categories (p < 0.05). By position, RAE especially affected the centre-back in the male formative (p < 0.01) and senior categories (p < 0.05). No significant relationship between RAE and individual performance was found in male formative categories, while an impact of RAE on the minutes played was detected in the female senior category (p < 0.05). With regard to collective performance, a higher number of relatively older handball players was observed in the best ranked teams in the male formative categories and in the quarter-final teams in the female formative categories (p < 0.05). Among the male players, relatively older players spent more minutes on the court than relatively younger players, although this advantage dissipated over time and did not lead to better performance. Among the female players, relatively younger players were found to perform better as the level of competitive handball increased.

Having no symptoms in the first week of infection increases the rate of spreading virus. This increasing rate and consequently increasing number of infected individuals necessitate an immediate development of proper diagnostic methods and effective treatments. To date, no specific treatment is detected for curing COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2, similar to other viruses, needs to interact with the host proteins to reach the host and replicate its genome. Accordingly, host-virus protein-protein interactions' (PPI) identification could be useful in predicting the behavior of virus and designing antiviral drugs. Identification of host-virus PPIs with experimental approaches are so time consumable, and so computational approaches are usually applied. In this study, we developed a new method to predict SARS-CoV-2-human PPIs. Our model is a three-layer network in which the first layer contains the most similar Alphainfluenzavirus proteins to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The second layer contains protein-protein interactions between Alphainfluenzavirus proteins and human proteins. The third layer reveals protein-protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins by using the clustering coefficient network property on the two first layers. For further analysis on the results of our prediction network, we investigated human proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 proteins and report the most central human proteins in human PPI network.

Potential racial biases in SpO2 measurements may influence the accuracy of pulse oximetry readings and impact clinical decision making. We aimed to assess whether the accuracy of oxygen saturation measured by peripheral pulse oximetry (SpO2), relative to arterial blood gas (SaO2), varies by ethnicity. Methods In this large retrospective observational cohort study covering four NHS Hospitals serving a large urban population in Birmingham, consecutive patients admitted to hospital requiring oxygen therapy were identified by electronic patient records. For each spell, the first available pair of SpO2 and SaO2 measurements taken within an interval of less than 20 minutes were identified and included in the analysis. The differences between SpO2 and SaO2 measurements, were compared across self-identified groups of ethnicities. These differences were subsequently adjusted for age, sex, bilirubin, systolic blood pressure, carboxyhaemaglobin saturations and the time interval between SpO2 and SaO2 measurements. Findings Paired O2 saturation measurements from 16818 inpatient spells between 1st January 2017 and 18th February 2021, were analysed. The cohort self-identified as being of White (81.2%), Asian (11.7%), Black (4.0%), or Other (3.2%) ethnicities. Across the cohort, SpO2 was significantly higher than SaO2 (median: 98% vs. 97%, p<0.001), with a median difference of 0.5 percentage points (pps). However, the size of this difference varied considerably with the magnitude of SaO2, with SpO2 overestimation by a median of 3.8pp for SaO2 values <90% but underestimating by a median of 0.4pp for an SaO2 of 95%. The differences between SpO2 and SaO2 were also found to vary significantly by ethnicity, with this difference being 0.8pp (95% confidence interval: 0.6-1.0) greater in those of Black vs. White ethnicity. These differences resulted in 6.1% vs. 8.7% of White vs. Black patients classified as normoxic on SpO2 who were hypoxic on the gold standard SaO2 reading (p=0.007). Interpretation Pulse oximetry tends to overestimate O2 saturation, and this is more pronounced in patients of Black ethnicity. Prospective studies are urgently warranted to assess the impact of ethnicity on the accuracy of pulse oximetry, to ensure care is optimised for all.","output":"Determining the Impact of Ethnicity on the Accuracy of Measurements of Oxygen Saturations.

METHODS A total of 362 cirrhotic patients were included retrospectively across four French centres (181 per treatment group). Global RFA failure (primary RFA failure or local tumour progression) was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method after coarsened exact matching. Cox regression models were used to identify factors associated with global RFA failure and overall survival (OS). RESULTS Patients were well matched according to tumour size (?30/>30mm); tumour number (one/several); tumour location (subcapsular and near large vessel); serum AFP (<10; 10-100; >100ng/ml); Child-Pugh score (A/B) and platelet count (?100G/L), p=1 for all. One case of perioperative mortality was observed in the NTmbpRFA group and the rate of major complications was 7.2% in both groups (p=1). The cumulative rates of global RFA failure at 1, 3 and 5years were respectively 13.3%, 31% and 36.7% for MonoRFA vs. 0.02%, 7.9% and 9.2% for NTmbpRFA, p<0.001.

App-based contact tracing has the potential to optimize the resources of overstretched public health departments. However, its efficiency is dependent on widespread adoption. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the uptake of the Australian Government's COVIDSafe app among Australians and examine the reasons why some Australians have not downloaded the app. METHODS: An online national survey, with representative quotas for age and gender, was conducted between May 8 and May 11, 2020. Participants were excluded if they were a health care professional or had been tested for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 1802 potential participants contacted, 289 (16.0%) were excluded prior to completing the survey, 13 (0.7%) declined, and 1500 (83.2%) participated in the survey. Of the 1500 survey participants, 37.3% (n=560) had downloaded the COVIDSafe app, 18.7% (n=280) intended to do so, 27.7% (n=416) refused to do so, and 16.3% (n=244) were undecided. Equally proportioned reasons for not downloading the app included privacy (165/660, 25.0%) and technical concerns (159/660, 24.1%). Other reasons included the belief that social distancing was sufficient and the app was unnecessary (111/660, 16.8%), distrust in the government (73/660, 11.1%), and other miscellaneous responses (eg, apathy and following the decisions of others) (73/660, 11.1%).

Through multivariate regression, we sought to analyze risk factors that contribute to infections following TE placement. METHODS: A retrospective study reviewed all patients undergoing mastectomy with immediate or delayed TE placement over a 22-month period. Infections were defined as clinically documented cellulitis or infection, return to the operating room (RTOR) for suspected infection, or positive operative or seroma cultures. RESULTS: A total of 311 patients underwent mastectomy and TE placement to 490 breasts. 13.5% of breasts developed an infection prior to second stage reconstruction. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that patients who developed infections were older (52.8 vs. 47.6 years, OR 1.04, p = 0.02), had higher rates of full-thickness necrosis (24.6% vs. 3.6%, OR 6.64, p<0.01), had higher rates of seromas requiring drainage (33.3% vs. 11.5%, OR 2.79, p<0.01), and had longer periods of drain therapy (24.9 vs. 21.0 days, OR 1.04, p = 0.04). Logistic regression established that longer discharge antibiotic length was not protective against the development of infection. CONCLUSION: Patients were more likely to develop an infection as the length of surgical drain retention increased, patient age increased, or if they developed seromas and full-thickness necrosis. Longer post-operative antibiotics were not protective against the development of infection in this sample. Prospective studies are needed to assess how antibiotic lengths can affect the morbidity of patients undergoing TE-BR.","output":"Infections after mastectomy and tissue expander placement: A multivariate regression analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite the steady improvements in survival and operative safety, postoperative complications still remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). However, less is known on the impact of postoperative complications on health-related quality of life (QoL). The main objective of our study was to investigate the impact of postoperative complications on long-term QoL and survival after CABG surgery. METHODS: Data of 508 patients, who underwent isolated CABG was prospectively collected. The RAND-36 Health Survey (RAND-36) was used to evaluate patients QoL status preoperatively, 1 year and 12 years after the surgery. Predefined postoperative complications were reported during primary and secondary hospital stay. QoL and survival analysis were performed primarily on three patient groups: patients with and without complications and patients with major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). RESULTS: In total 205(40%) of 508 patients had at least one postoperative complication and 73 (14%) experienced MACCE. Patients thirty-day, 1-year and 10-year survival rates were, 99, 98, 84% without complications, 97, 95, 72% with complications, and 90, 89, 64% with MACCE, respectively (log-rank p < 0.001). Patients without complications showed significant(p < 0.05) improvements in seven and patients with complications in five out of eight RAND-36 QoL dimensions. All patient groups showed significant improvements in RAND-36 summary scores compared with preoperative values. Patients with complications and especially with MACCE had more profound decline in their RAND-36 summary scores while patients without complications maintained their health status best. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the constant deterioration, both patients with and without complications showed improvements even 12 years after CABG compared with preoperative state.

However, risks and benefits of this adjunctive therapy remain uncertain. We aimed to evaluate periprocedural intravenous heparin use in Dutch stroke intervention centers and to assess its efficacy and safety. Methods- Patients registered between March 2014 and June 2016 in the MR CLEAN Registry (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke), including all patients treated with endovascular treatment in the Netherlands, were analyzed. The primary outcome was functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were successful recanalization (extended Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2B), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and mortality at 90 days. We used multilevel regression analysis to evaluate the association of periprocedural intravenous heparin on outcomes, adjusted for center effects and prognostic factors. To account for possible unobserved confounding by indication, we analyzed the effect of center preference to administer intravenous heparin, defined as percentage of patients treated with intravenous heparin in a center, on functional outcome. Results- One thousand four hundred eighty-eight patients from 16 centers were analyzed, of whom 398 (27%) received intravenous heparin (median dose 5000 international units). There was substantial between-center variability in the proportion of patients treated with intravenous heparin (range, 0%-94%). There was no significant difference in functional outcome between patients treated with intravenous heparin and those without (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.87-1.56), successful recanalization (adjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.89-1.71), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.65-1.99), or mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.66-1.38). Analysis at center level showed that functional outcomes were better in centers with higher percentages of heparin administration (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.07 per 10% more heparin, 95% CI, 1.01-1.13). Conclusions- Substantial between-center variability exists in periprocedural intravenous heparin use during endovascular treatment, but the treatment is safe. Centers using heparin more often had better outcomes. A randomized trial is needed to further study these effects.","output":"Periprocedural Intravenous Heparin During Endovascular Treatment for Ischemic Stroke: Results From the MR CLEAN Registry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many physiological aspects of the neonatal transition after birth are unobservable because relevant sensors do not yet exist, compromising clinicians understanding of a neonates physiological status. Given that a neonates true physiological state is currently unavailable, we explored the feasibility of using clinicians degree of concordance as an approximation of the true physiological state. METHODS: Two phases of structured interviews were conducted. In Phase 1 (N = 8) and Phase 2 (N = 12), we presented neonatal experts with eight graphical trajectories of real newborns heart rate and oxygen saturation values in the first 10C15 min after birth. We elicited the participants interpretations of potential underlying physiological conditions that could explain the vital sign patterns. RESULTS: The global differential diagnosis data for each phase produced the same pattern of results: (1) four trajectories produced a substantial degree of concordance among clinicians (61C80%) and (2) four trajectories produced a strong degree of concordance among clinicians (81C100%). CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to achieve a strong degree of concordance among neonatal experts interpretations of newborn trajectories. Thus, using the degree of concordance as an approximation of the neonates true physiological state in resuscitation after birth may be a promising direction to explore for cognitive aid design. IMPACT: Differential diagnoses with a good degree of concordance among expert neonatal clinicians could potentially substitute in part for the direct measurement of key physiological and anatomical variables of the neonatal transition, which is currently unavailable. The concordance of clinicians judgements or inferences with regards to the true physiological state of the newborn during resuscitation after birth has never been explored. The findings provide a crucial first step toward using consensus of neonatal experts judgements in the design of a cognitive aid to support clinicians management of the newborns who require resuscitation after birth.","output":"Concordance of expert clinicians interpretations of the newborns true physiological state"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome plays a protective role in the host defense against pneumonia. The composition of the lung microbiota has been shown to be predictive of clinical outcome in critically ill patients. However, the dynamics of the lung and gut microbiota composition over time during severe pneumonia remains ill defined. We used a mouse model of pneumonia-derived sepsis caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae in order to follow the pathogen burden as well as the composition of the lung, tongue and fecal microbiota from local infection towards systemic spread. RESULTS: Already at 6 h post-inoculation with K. pneumoniae, marked changes in the lung microbiota were seen. The alpha diversity of the lung microbiota did not change throughout the infection, whereas the beta diversity did. A shift between the prominent lung microbiota members of Streptococcus and Klebsiella was seen from 12 h onwards and was most pronounced at 18 h post-inoculation (PI) which was also reflected in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines indicating severe pulmonary inflammation. Around 18 h PI, K. pneumoniae bacteremia was observed together with a systemic inflammatory response. The composition of the tongue microbiota was not affected during infection, even at 18C30 h PI when K. pneumoniae had become the dominant bacterium in the lung. Moreover, we observed differences in the gut microbiota during pulmonary infection. The gut microbiota contributed to the lung microbiota at 12 h PI, however, this decreased at a later stage of the infection. CONCLUSIONS: At 18 h PI, K. pneumoniae was the dominant member in the lung microbiota. The lung microbiota profiles were significantly explained by the lung K. pneumoniae bacterial counts and Klebsiella and Streptococcus were correlating with the measured cytokine levels in the lung and/or blood. The oral microbiota in mice, however, was not influenced by the severity of murine pneumonia, whereas the gut microbiota was affected.

We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020. METHODS: In this case series, we followed five patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) and Pellegrin University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and diagnosed with COVID-19 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done. FINDINGS: The patients were three men (aged 31 years, 48 years, and 80 years) and two women (aged 30 years and 46 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid-January, 2020. Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (52 and 74 log10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma. The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020. INTERPRETATION: We illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy. We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.

Our analysis, based on 333 genomes, revealed that the first variants detected in the state of Parana in March 2020 were the B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.28 variants. The variants B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 were predominant throughout 2020 until the introduction of the variant P.2 in August 2020 and a variant of concern (VOC), P.1, in January 2021. Phylogenetic analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were previously classified as the VOC P.1 lineage by PANGO showed that some genomes from February to April 2021 branched in a monophyletic clade and that these samples grouped together with genomes recently described with the lineage P.1-like-II. An extended phylogenetic analysis, including SARS-CoV-2 genomes from all over Brazil, showed that the P.1-like-II lineage appears at a high frequency in the southern region of the country. The P.1-like-II lineage genomes share some, but not all, defining mutations of the VOC P.1. For instance, it has the previously described ORF1a:D2980H and N:P383 L unique mutations and the newly detected ORF1a:P1213 L and ORF1b:K2340N mutations.

Finally, 22.8% of patients reported finding it difficult to respect hygiene measures because of their psoriasis, e.g., application of alcohol-based hand sanitizers (47.6%), handwashing routines (42.9%), and wearing a mask (28.6%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the major clinical impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children with psoriasis. Teleconsultations played a key role in patient management as regards patient monitoring, provision of information, and renewal of treatments. It is vital that we learn from these data to improve and adapt the monitoring of chronic dermatoses in both children and adults in the event of a future health crisis.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children with psoriasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to the World Health Organization as of September 16, 2021, there have been over 226 million documented cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has resulted in more than 4.6 million deaths and approximately 14% develop a more severe disease that requires respiratory assistance such as intubation. Early tracheostomy is recommended for patients that are expected to be on prolonged mechanical ventilation; however, supporting data has not yet been provided for early tracheostomies in COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to explore established guidelines for performing tracheostomies in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Factors considered were patient outcomes such as mortality, ventilator-associated pneumonia, intensive care unit length of stay, complications associated with procedures, and risks to healthcare providers that performed tracheostomies. Various observational studies, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews were collected through a PubMed Database search. Additional sources were found through Google. The search was refined to publications in English and between the years of 2003 and 2021. The keywords used were Coronavirus and/or guidelines'' and/or tracheostomy and/or intensive care. Twenty-three studies were retained. Due to the complex presentation of the respiratory virus COVID-19, previously established guidelines for tracheostomies had to be reevaluated to determine if these guidelines were still applicable to these critically ill ventilated patients.

These VPs are perturbed by other proteins, which are: (i) mainly expressed in the lungs, (ii) are targeted directly by SARS-CoV-2 proteins, (iii) can navigate outside the lungs as cargo of extracellular vesicles (EVs); and (iv) can activate VPs via subdiffusive processes inside the target organ.

Convergent evidence from epidemiology, pathology, and oncology suggests that new viral etiologies for cancers remain to be discovered. Oncoviral profiles can be obtained from cancer genome sequencing data; however, widespread viral sequence contamination and noncausal viruses complicate the process of identifying genuine oncoviruses. Here, we propose a novel strategy to address these challenges by performing virome-wide screening of early-stage clonal viral integrations. To implement this strategy, we developed VIcaller, a novel platform for identifying viral integrations that are derived from any characterized viruses and shared by a large proportion of tumor cells using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. The sensitivity and precision were confirmed with simulated and benchmark cancer data sets. By applying this platform to cancer WGS data sets with proven or speculated viral etiology, we newly identified or confirmed clonal integrations of hepatitis B virus (HBV), human papillomavirus (HPV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and BK Virus (BKV), suggesting the involvement of these viruses in early stages of tumorigenesis in affected tumors, such as HBV in TERT and KMT2B (also known as MLL4) gene loci in liver cancer, HPV and BKV in bladder cancer, and EBV in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

By June 2021, all the emerging variants of concern carried the D614G mutation. The rapid spread of the G614 mutant suggests that it may have a transmission advantage over the D614 wildtype. AIM: Our objective was to estimate the transmission advantage of D614G by integrating phylogenetic and epidemiological analysis. METHODS: We assume that the mutation D614G was the only site of interest which characterised the two cocirculating virus strains by June 2020, but their differential transmissibility might be attributable to a combination of D614G and other mutations. We define the fitness of G614 as the ratio of the basic reproduction number of the strain with G614 to the strain with D614 and applied an epidemiological framework for fitness inference to analyse SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and sequence data. RESULTS: Using this framework, we estimated that the G614 mutant is 31% (95% credible interval: 28C34) more transmissible than the D614 wildtype. Therefore, interventions that were previously effective in containing or mitigating the D614 wildtype (e.g. in China, Vietnam and Thailand) may be less effective against the G614 mutant. CONCLUSION: Our framework can be readily integrated into current SARS-CoV-2 surveillance to monitor the emergence and fitness of mutant strains such that pandemic surveillance, disease control and development of treatment and vaccines can be adjusted dynamically.","output":"Estimating the transmission advantage of the D614G mutant strain of SARS-CoV-2, December 2019 to June 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic hit shows the emergence of increase in quality of life across various parts of the world.

Many people around the world have vitamin D deficiency and, therefore, this has become a public concern whether vitamin D is an important factor protecting against COVID-19 infection. In this paper, the data about the roles of vitamin D on immunity and recovery from viral infections, especially novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is reviewed. METHODS The electronic databases of Pubmed, Google Scholar, Research Gate, Excerpta Media Database (EMBASE) and Medical and Health Education (Medrix) were searched. RESULTS Vitamin D is considered an important factor in immune homeostasis. Various effects have been considered for this nutrient on the immune system, particularly because of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and Cytochrome P450 Family 27 Subfamily B Member 1 (CYP27B1) expression in most of the immune cells. Vitamin D can raise cellular immunity, reduce cytokine storm and enhance antioxidants production. It also has modulatory effects on Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and might have protective functions against acute lung injuries, including COVID-19 infection. However, there are some articles against this positive effect. CONCLUSION Vitamin D supplementation is reported to be effective in the enhancement of the immune system and might be effective in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 infection, especially in those with its deficiency. However, it should be considered that vitamin D deficiency shows the overall health status of the patients and cannot be considered specific for COVID-19 infection.Recent Advances in Anti-Infective Drug Discovery.","output":"The roles of vitamin D in increasing the body's immunity and reducing injuries due to viral infections: With an emphasis on its possible role in SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to dysregulation of immune pathways.

Our patient still demonstrated viral persistence at 138 days with low polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold values and evidence of continuing viral sequence evolution indicative of ongoing virus replication. These findings have important implications for infection prevention and control recommendations in immunosuppressed patients. Immune response, including neutralizing antibody titers, T cell activity, and cytokine levels, peaked around days 44-72 after diagnosis. Anti-S trimer antibodies were low at all time points, and T cell response was attenuated by day 119.

The responses of zooplankton (counted by abundance and the activity and immuno-reactive content of free N-Acetyl-?-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase)), phytoplankton (counted by chlorophyll and phycocyanin), planktonic bacteria and fungi, and some water quality parameters were investigated in a period of 35 d. Results of the study showed that the ostracoda was more sensitive than daphnid, with time-weighted average (TWA)-based no observed effect concentrations (NOECs) to be 8.45 and 12.66 g/L in systems without humic acid addition (HA-) and to be 6.37 and 9.54 g/L in systems with humic acid addition (HA+). The duration of treatment-related effects in the ostracoda population was longer than the daphnid population (21 vs. 14 days). Besides, the data analysis indicated that the toxicity of fenoxycarb was significantly enhanced in the HA+ systems. Owing to the reduced grazing pressure, the concentrations of chlorophyll and phycocyanin increased in the two highest treatments. The increase in photosynthesis along with a reduced animal excretion led to an increase in pH and a decrease in nutrient contents. These changes seemed to have an effect on the microbial communities. For example, the abundances of some opportunistic pathogens of aquatic animals (e.g. Aeromonas and Cladosporium) and organic-pollutant-degrading microorganisms (e.g. Ancylobacter and Azospirillum) increased significantly in microbial communities, but the abundances of Pedobacter, Candidatus Planktoluna, and Rhodobacter (photosynthetic bacteria) markedly decreased.

(2) We are representatives of the whole State and the General Interest, meaning that they refuse to be assimilated to public servants among others, confined to the specific ministry where they temporarily work. (3) They reverse to their advantage the criticism against their politicization by claiming to be the only civil servants who understand the logic of politics. These identity assertions, which are attempts by the prefectoral corps to heighten its own stature with respect to rival groups and ministries, reveal its ambition to co-govern the State along with the political masters.","output":"Being a (Sub-)Prefect in Paris: The Self-Legitimization of the Prefectoral Corps Members Working Within French Core Ministries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Weather factors are effective to transmission of various diseases Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and kinds of influenza can be given as example these diseases The novel corona virus which is called COVID-19 is the most dangerous problem all around the world in these days Early studies have revealed that COVID-19 cases are affected by environmental factors Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the number of novel coronavirus cases and several weather parameters in 81 provinces of Turkey Mean incubation period of COVID-19 is in question Thus, this paper also aims to provide better understanding of the exact incubation period in Turkey by employing four different timeframe which are on the day (lag 0), 3 days ago (lag 3), 7 days ago (lag 7) and 14 days ago (lag 14) We have considered population density as a control variable The dataset cover COVID-19 cases, population density, average temperature, humidity, pressure, dew point, wind speed, and sunshine duration for 81 provinces of Turkey We find that population density has a positive correlation with COVID-19 cases We also find that in lag 3, all parameters except for sunshine duration are negatively correlated with COVID-19 cases and significant However, only 3 parameters, temperature, air pressure and dew point are negatively correlated with COVID-19 cases and significant for lag 0, lag 7 and lag 14 In addition, temperature, air pressure and dew point parameters are negative and significant in all timeframes ? 2021, King Abdulaziz University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"Impact of Weather Parameters and Population Density on the COVID-19 Transmission: Evidence from 81 Provinces of Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The goal of the present study was to explore COVID-19 related hesitancy, which represents the inability of people to return to previous levels of functioning after a major medical crisis like the current pandemic. A new questionnaire was developed to evaluate participants hesitancy. The study was conducted online in November, 2020, using convenience sampling. A total of 538 individuals from the general Greek population participated in the study and completed the Hesitancy Questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2), the Short Health Anxiety Inventory and a COVID-19-related worry question. The Hesitancy Questionnaire proved to have adequate psychometric properties. Correlation with anxiety as assessed by GAD-2 proved to be significant but low, indicating that the two scales are measuring two different concepts. The greatest hesitancy was observed in older adults for both genders (males, M = 40.86, SD = 15.24; females, M = 49.34, SD = 14.74). Women in general appeared more hesitant than men scoring higher (males, M = 36.13, SD = 15.25; females, M = 42.63, SD = 17.31) with a statistically significant difference [t(536) = ? 3.706, p = .001).

METHODS The cameras included a 5-mm 30 laparoscope (LAP), a magnetically anchored (MAGS) camera, and a flexible endoscope (ENDO). The three camera systems were evaluated using standardized optical characteristic tests. Each system was used in random order for visualization during performance of a standardized suturing task by four surgeons. Each participant performed three to five consecutive repetitions as a surgeon and also served as a camera driver for other surgeons. Ex vivo testing was conducted in a laparoscopic multiport and SSL layout using a box trainer. In vivo testing was performed only in the multiport configuration and used a previously validated live porcine Nissen model. RESULTS Optical testing showed superior resolution for MAGS at 5 and 10 cm compared with LAP or ENDO. The field of view ranged from 39 to 99. The depth of focus was almost three times greater for MAGS (6-270 mm) than for LAP (2-88 mm) or ENDO (1-93 mm). Both ex vivo and in vivo multiport combined surgeon performance was significantly better for LAP than for ENDO, but no significant differences were detected for MAGS. For multiport testing, workload ratings were significantly less ex vivo for LAP and MAGS than for ENDO and less in vivo for LAP than for MAGS or ENDO. For ex vivo SSL, no significant performance differences were detected, but camera drivers rated the workload significantly less for MAGS than for LAP or ENDO. CONCLUSION The data suggest that the improved imaging element of the next-generation MAGS camera has optical and performance characteristics that meet or exceed those of the LAP or ENDO systems and that the MAGS camera may be especially useful for SSL. Further refinements of the MAGS camera are encouraged.","output":"A randomized comparison of laparoscopic, magnetically anchored, and flexible endoscopic cameras in performance and workload between laparoscopic and single-incision surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Extracellular adenosine is produced from secreted ATP by cluster of differentiation (CD)39 and CD73. Both are critical nucleotide metabolizing enzymes of the adenosine generating pathway and are secreted by neuronal or immune cells. Adenosine plays a role in energy processes, neurotransmission, and endogenous regulation of inflammatory responses. Istradefylline is a selective adenosine A2a receptor (A2aR) antagonist used for the treatment of Parkinsons disease. We have reported that adenosine primes hypersecretion of interleukin (IL)-17A via A2aR. Istradefylline, as well as an inhibitor of CD39 (ARL67156) and an inhibitor of CD73 (AMP-CP), suppressed IL-17A production, and the administration of istradefylline to mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) led to the marked amelioration of the disease. These previous results suggest that adenosine is an endogenous modulator of neutrophilic inflammation. We investigated the effect of istradefylline, ARL67156 and AMP-CP on other mouse models of neutrophilic inflammation. Methods We tested the effect of istradefylline, ARL67156 and AMP-CP on OVA-induced neutrophilic airway inflammation or imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis in mice. These two model mice received these drugs orally or percutaneously, respectively. The production of IL-17A in the lung and ear thickness were used as an index of the effects. Results We show that istradefylline, ARL67156 and AMP-CP suppressed the OVA-induced IL-17A production in the lung and imiquimod-induced psoriasis. Conclusion These results indicate that adenosine-mediated IL-17A production plays a role in neutrophilic inflammation models, and moreover, istradefylline, ARL67156, and AMP-CP are effective in animal models of neutrophilic inflammation.

Consequently, COVID-19 pandemic has caused uncertainty about the possible increased risk of suffering SARS-CoV-2 infection that could confer IBD or its treatments. The aim of this study is to assess SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in patients with IBD as well as the existence of potential risk factors for its development. METHODS: This is a unicentric cross-sectional study developed in IBD unit of University Hospital Lozano Blesa of Zaragoza. Patients older than 18 years with established diagnosis of Crohns Disease (CD), Ulcerative Colitis (UC) or Indeterminate Colitis (IC) have been included. A blood sample has been drawn from each patient to detect IgG against SARS-CoV-2 (ELISA method) and each patient has completed a questionnaire to know symptoms related to infection and previous comorbidity. We have performed a descriptive analysis and a univariate analysis to study relationship between potential risk factors and seroconversion against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: 431 patients have been included, with a mean age of 50.2  14.1 years and a 51.3% of women. Of them, 49.7% suffer from UC, 49.2% CD and 1.2% IC. Related to the treatment, 23.5% receive anti-TNF biologic agents, 13.1% other kind of biologic agents, 9.3% immunomodulators, 7.7% combined treatment (biologic agent and immunomodulator), 33.1% other treatment and 13.3% no treatment. According to World Health Organization (WHO) definitions, 85.6% had not suffered the infection, 7.7% were confirmed cases (only 3 admitted patients) and 6.7% were probable cases. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 obtained is 8.8%, being significantly higher among confirmed cases than among probable cases (71.0% in confirmed vs 6.9% in probable; RR 10.3; p<0.001). A higher risk of seroconversion has been detected among patients without biologic agents (11.8% in patients without biologic agents vs 5.3% in patients with biologic agents; RR 2.2; p=0.021). No differences have been observed in the seroprevalence of patients with other treatments for IBD or in terms of age, active smoking, level of inflammation markers, the presence of symptoms of infection or hospital admission.

Because educational attainment (EA), which measures the number of years of schooling, is moderately heritable, we investigated the causal association of EA on the risk of COVID-19 severity using the Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. A two-sample MR analysis was performed using publicly available summary-level data sets of genome-wide association studies (GWASs). A total of 235 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were extracted as instrumental variables for the exposure of EA from the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium GWAS summary data of 766,345 participants of European ancestry. The effect of each SNP on the outcome of COVID-19 severity risk was obtained from the GWAS summary data of 1,059,456 participants of European ancestry gathered from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Using inverse variance weighted method, our MR study shows that EA was significantly associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 severity (odds ratio per one standard deviation increase in years of schooling, 0.540; 95% confidence interval, 0.376C0.777, P = 0.0009). A series of sensitivity analyses showed little evidence of bias. In conclusion, we show for the first time using a two-sample MR approach the associations between higher EA and the lower risk of COVID-19 severity in the European population. However, the genetic or epidemiological mechanisms underlying the association between EA and the risk of COVID-19 severity remain unknown, and further studies are warranted to validate the MR findings and investigate underlying mechanisms.","output":"Educational Attainment Decreases the Risk of COVID-19 Severity in the European Population: A Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public streets are the quintessential site of politics: not just marches and assemblies where rights are demanded and disrupted, but the everyday expression of collective decisions about how we live together, about who gets access to which space and for what purposes, about the role of the state and the rights and responsibilities of citizens Those collective decisions are often highly contested, so that the relative rights and responsibilities of citizens and their cities remain the subject of ongoing negotiation The rules that regulate streets are always uneven The ways those rules are interpreted--and sometimes amended--are influenced to a significant degree by popular understandings about the kinds of use (and users) that are and are not legitimate in public space Those understandings, and in turn behaviors and rules, can shift","output":"Reclaiming the streets?

METHODS: We performed a systematic review of resources accessible in English using environmental scan methods. Data sources included online databases of research publications, repositories for clinical guidelines, research projects and PtDAs, international PtDA expert lists and reference lists from relevant publications. The resource selection was from 56 screened records; 17 PtDAs were included. A data extraction sheet was applied to all eligible resources, eliciting resource characteristics, decision architecture to boost/bias thinking, indicators of quality such as International Standards for Patient Decision Aids Standards checklist and engagement with health services. RESULTS: PtDAs were developed in five countries; eleven were publically available via the Internet.

To assess the occupational injuries, we compared rates, distribution and type of exposure to blood and body fluids and NSSIs of health care workers for 2019 (pre-pandemic era) and 2020 (pandemic era) years, respectively. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our study included data collected by the 'Hospital Infection Control Committee' for the years 2019-2020. Data collected using the active surveillance method were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: During 2019 (pre-pandemic period) and 2020 (pandemic period), 112 (27.65%0) and 82 (21.4%0) NSSIs reported, respectively. Of the exposed HCWs in 2019 (pre-pandemic period), 16.8%0 (14) were doctor, 53.6%0 (60) were nurse and 47.4%0 (14) were intern doctors. In the 2020 (pandemic period), NSSIs were observed most frequently in nurses and cleaning staff, 50.24%0 and 33.64%0, respectively. Concerning the total percentage of exposure to blood and other body fluids, a slight increase was revealed from 1.48%0 to 2.62%0 in 2019 and 2020, respectively.

Despite the relatively high heterogeneity of the reviewed studies, our findings highlighted that a noteworthy proportion of patients who have suffered from SARS-CoV-2 infection present a post-COVID syndrome. The multifaceted understanding of all aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including these long-term symptoms, will allow us to respond to all the global health challenges, thus paving the way to a stronger public health.","output":"Post-COVID-19 Syndrome: The Persistent Symptoms at the Post-viral Stage of the Disease.

In order to prevent skin damage, public health advice mainly focuses on the use of sunscreens, along with wearing protective clothing and avoiding sun exposure during peak hours. Sunscreens present on the market are topical formulations that contain a number of different synthetic, organic, and inorganic UVR filters with different absorbance profiles, which, when combined, provide broad UVR spectrum protection. However, increased evidence suggests that some of these compounds cause subtle damage to marine ecosystems. One alternative may be the use of natural products that are produced in a wide range of marine species and are mainly thought to act as a defense against UVR-mediated damage. However, their potential for human photoprotection is largely under-investigated. In this review, attention has been placed on the molecular strategies adopted by marine organisms to counteract UVR-induced negative effects and we provide a broad portrayal of the recent literature concerning marine-derived natural products having potential as natural sunscreens/photoprotectants for human skin. Their chemical structure, UVR absorption properties, and their pleiotropic role as bioactive molecules are discussed. Most studies strongly suggest that these natural products could be promising for use in biocompatible sunscreens and may represent an alternative eco-friendly approach to protect humans against UV-induced skin damage.","output":"From Sea to Skin: Is There a Future for Natural Photoprotectants?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study examined the mediating effect of sense of control and the moderating effect of coronavirus stress on the relationship between life history strategy and overeating among Chinese college students during the COVID-19 period. METHODS: 3310 Chinese students (M(age) = 19.74, SD = 1.50; 47% males) completed self-reported questionnaires regarding life history strategy, sense of control, overeating, and coronavirus stress. The data were analyzed using Pearsons r correlations and moderated mediation analysis. RESULTS: The results revealed that control sense mediated the link between life history strategy and college students overeating. College students coronavirus stress moderated the associations between life history strategy and college students sense of control and between control sense and overeating. The association between life history strategy and sense of control was stronger for those with lower coronavirus stress, and the association between sense of control and overeating was stronger for those with lower coronavirus stress. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified that the critical factors were associated with overeating. On the one hand, the research deepens the application and interpretation of life history theory in the field of eating; on the other hand, it provides evidence for the prevention of overeating, and provides theoretical basis for psychological assistance among Chinese college students.","output":"Life history strategy and overeating during COVID-19 pandemic: a moderated mediation model of sense of control and coronavirus stress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Given the apparent limitation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genomes to about 30 kb, together with the complexity of DNA synthesis, it appears difficult for a dsRNA genome to encode all the information required before the transition from an RNA to a DNA genome. Ribonucleotide reductase itself, which synthesises deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides, requires complex protein radical chemistry, and RNA world genomes may have reached their limits of coding capacity well before such complex enzymes had evolved. The transition from RNA to DNA thus appears to require intermediate steps, and we suggest that the naturally occurring 2-O-methylated RNA, with chemical properties intermediate between RNA and DNA, is a suitable candidate.","output":"Methyl-RNA: an evolutionary bridge between RNA and DNA?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ORIENTATION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to an increased focus on the effectiveness of employee assistance programmes (EAPs).

At a sub-theme level, the priority of themes differed across the time periods influenced by external context and circumstance. PRACTICAL/MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS: The study found a need to clearly define employee well-being and reposition the role of EAPs within the organisation. Organisations need to broaden the scope of EAPs and through continuous education and awareness create an environment where employees feel like they can safely access these services.

METHOD: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical data and diagnosis and treatment of 8 adult cases of paragonimiasis with lung masses as the main manifestation that were diagnosed in the Oncology Department of Peoples hospital of Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture from July 2014 to July 2019. RESULT: All 8 patients were from epidemic paragonimiasis areas and had a confirmed history of consuming uncooked freshwater crabs. The clinical manifestations were mainly fever, dry cough, and chest pain. The disease durations were long, and peripheral blood eosinophil counts were elevated. The cases had been misdiagnosed as pneumonia or pulmonary tuberculosis. After years of anti-inflammatory or anti-tuberculosis treatment, the symptoms had not improved significantly. Patients eventually sought treatment from the oncology department for hemoptysis. Chest computed tomography showed patchy consolidation in the lungs, with nodules, lung masses, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: Paragonimiasis is a food-borne parasitic disease. Early clinical manifestations and auxiliary examination results are nonspecific. The parasite most often invades the lungs, and the resulting disease is often misdiagnosed as pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, or lung cancer (Acta Trop 199: 05074, 2019). To avoid misdiagnosis, clinicians should inquire, in detail, about residence history and history of unclean food and exposure to infected water and make an early diagnosis based on the inquired information and imaging examination results. For patients who have been diagnosed with pneumonia or pulmonary tuberculosis and whose symptoms do not improve significantly after anti-inflammatory or anti-tuberculosis treatments, their epidemiological history should be traced to further conduct differential diagnosis and avoid misdiagnosis.","output":"Analysis of the misdiagnosis of 8 adult cases of paragonimiasis with lung masses as the main manifestation in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The formation of small hybrid aggregates between excipient and drug molecules is one of the mechanisms that contributes to the solubilization of active principles in pharmaceutical formulations.

Both intravenous and inhaled magnesium sulphate have a clinical impact on acute severe asthma by inhibition of airway smooth muscle contraction. Besides, magnesium sulphate can dilate constricted pulmonary arteries and reduce pulmonary artery resistance. However, it may affect systemic arteries when administered intravenously. A large number of patients with covid-19 admitted to the hospital suffer from pulmonary involvement. COVID-19 can cause hypoxia due to the involvement of the respiratory airways and parenchyma along with circulatory impairment, which induce ventilation-perfusion mismatch. This condition may result in hypoxemia and low arterial blood oxygen pressure and saturation presented with some degree of dyspnoea and shortness of breath. Inhaled magnesium sulphate as a smooth muscle relaxant (natural calcium antagonist) can cause both bronchodilator and consequently vasodilator effects (via a direct effect on alveolar arterioles in well-ventilated areas) in the respiratory tract. We aim to investigate if inhaled magnesium sulphate as adjuvant therapy to standard treatment can reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatch in the respiratory tract and subsequently improve arterial oxygen saturation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN: A multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel arms design (1:1 ratio) PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18-80 years hospitalized at Masih Daneshvari Hospital and Shahid Dr. Labbafinejad hospital in Tehran and Shahid Sadoughi Hospital in Yazd will be included if they meet the inclusion criteria of the study.

Most of them do not speak English, making communication with health services difficult. They tend to live in overcrowded houses with unsanitary conditions. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, all the above resulted in high incidence and ineffective contact tracing (CT), testing and isolation by the public health teams. It was essential to develop strategies to manage and control outbreaks, and also to achieve health equity. Our experience can be useful for other countries in dealing with their multicultural communities. This intervention started in march 2020 and is still ongoing. The aims were to improve the accuracy of epidemiological surveys (ES) and CT, to more easily stop transmission, to develop the communication skills of health professionals and to improve migrant's healthcare access. For this, the focus was on digital written communication tools (Whatsapp, translation apps). It was created a toolkit to guide ES and CT tailored to the migrant population, with tips and best practices, and used translated information materials about preventive COVID-19 measures. Workshops were led with health professionals. It was stablished work with local NGOs, creating social media campaigns during crucial events (Holi holliday). As results. it was achieved a better ES output, more accurate CT and better transmission control, with noticeable differences between march 2020 and now.

Sample pooling offers huge advantages compared to single test rRT-PCR, as it reduces diagnostic costs, personnel time, burnout, and analytical run times.

Machine learning models have been proposed to accurately predict COVID-19 disease severity. Previous studies have typically tested only one machine learning algorithm and limited performance evaluation to area under the curve analysis. To obtain the best results possible, it may be important to test different machine learning algorithms to find the best prediction model. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to use automated machine learning (autoML) to train various machine learning algorithms. We selected the model that best predicted patients' chances of surviving a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we identified which variables (ie, vital signs, biomarkers, comorbidities, etc) were the most influential in generating an accurate model. METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from all patients who tested positive for COVID-19 at our institution between March 1 and July 3, 2020. We collected 48 variables from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time (ie, real-time polymerase chain reaction positivity). Patients were followed for 30 days or until death. Patients' data were used to build 20 machine learning models with various algorithms via autoML. The performance of machine learning models was measured by analyzing the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPCR). Subsequently, we established model interpretability via Shapley additive explanation and partial dependence plots to identify and rank variables that drove model predictions. Afterward, we conducted dimensionality reduction to extract the 10 most influential variables. AutoML models were retrained by only using these 10 variables, and the output models were evaluated against the model that used 48 variables. RESULTS: Data from 4313 patients were used to develop the models. The best model that was generated by using autoML and 48 variables was the stacked ensemble model (AUPRC=0.807). The two best independent models were the gradient boost machine and extreme gradient boost models, which had an AUPRC of 0.803 and 0.793, respectively. The deep learning model (AUPRC=0.73) was substantially inferior to the other models. The 10 most influential variables for generating high-performing models were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, pulse oximetry level, blood urea nitrogen level, lactate dehydrogenase level, D-dimer level, troponin level, respiratory rate, and Charlson comorbidity score. After the autoML models were retrained with these 10 variables, the stacked ensemble model still had the best performance (AUPRC=0.791). CONCLUSIONS: We used autoML to develop high-performing models that predicted the survival of patients with COVID-19. In addition, we identified important variables that correlated with mortality. This is proof of concept that autoML is an efficient, effective, and informative method for generating machine learning-based clinical decision support tools.","output":"Using Automated Machine Learning to Predict the Mortality of Patients With COVID-19: Prediction Model Development Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Reliable surveillance systems are essential for identifying disease outbreaks and allocating resources to ensure universal access to diagnostics and treatment for endemic diseases. Yet, most countries with high disease burdens rely entirely on facility-based passive surveillance systems, which miss the vast majority of cases in rural settings with low access to health care. This is especially true for malaria, for which the World Health Organization estimates that routine surveillance detects only 14% of global cases. The goal of this study was to develop a novel method to obtain accurate estimates of disease spatio-temporal incidence at very local scales from routine passive surveillance, less biased by populations' financial and geographic access to care. METHODS: We use a geographically explicit dataset with residences of the 73,022 malaria cases confirmed at health centers in the Ifanadiana District in Madagascar from 2014 to 2017. Malaria incidence was adjusted to account for underreporting due to stock-outs of rapid diagnostic tests and variable access to healthcare. A benchmark multiplier was combined with a health care utilization index obtained from statistical models of non-malaria patients. Variations to the multiplier and several strategies for pooling neighboring communities together were explored to allow for fine-tuning of the final estimates. Separate analyses were carried out for individuals of all ages and for children under five. Cross-validation criteria were developed based on overall incidence, trends in financial and geographical access to health care, and consistency with geographic distribution in a district-representative cohort. The most plausible sets of estimates were then identified based on these criteria. RESULTS: Passive surveillance was estimated to have missed about 4 in every 5 malaria cases among all individuals and 2 out of every 3 cases among children under five. Adjusted malaria estimates were less biased by differences in populations financial and geographic access to care. Average adjusted monthly malaria incidence was nearly four times higher during the high transmission season than during the low transmission season. By gathering patient-level data and removing systematic biases in the dataset, the spatial resolution of passive malaria surveillance was improved over ten-fold. Geographic distribution in the adjusted dataset revealed high transmission clusters in low elevation areas in the northeast and southeast of the district that were stable across seasons and transmission years. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding local disease dynamics from routine passive surveillance data can be a key step towards achieving universal access to diagnostics and treatment. Methods presented here could be scaled-up thanks to the increasing availability of e-health disease surveillance platforms for malaria and other diseases across the developing world.","output":"Estimating the local spatio\\\\temporal distribution of malaria from routine health information systems in areas of low health care access and reporting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serological assays to detect antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might contribute to confirming the suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients not detected with molecular assays.

In this paper, we study maximizing the network lifetime of an energy-harvesting LoRa network. Such a network is characterized by heterogeneous recharging capabilities across the nodes that is not taken into account in existing work. We propose a link-layer protocol to achieve a long-lived LoRa network which dynamically enables the nodes with depleting batteries to exploit the superfluous energy of the neighboring nodes with affluent batteries by letting a depleting node offload its packets to an affluent node. By exploiting the LoRa's capability of adjusting multiple transmission parameters, we enable low-cost offloading by depleting nodes instead of high-cost direct forwarding. Such offloading requires synchronization of wake-up times as well as transmission parameters between the two nodes which also need to be selected dynamically. The proposed protocol addresses these challenges and prolongs the lifetime of a LoRa network through three novel techniques. (1) We propose a lightweight medium access control protocol for peer-to-peer communication to enable packet offloading which circumvents the synchronization overhead between the two nodes. (2) We propose an intuitive heuristic method for effective parameter selections for different modes (conventional vs. offloading). (3) We analyze the energy overhead of offloading and, based on it, the protocol dynamically selects affluent and depleting nodes while ensuring that an affluent node is not overwhelmed by the depleting ones.

Almost 63.4% of healthcare facilities were not connected to wastewater networks and used either tight or porous cesspits. Once these cesspits are filled off, wastewater is randomly disposed into nearby valleys causing adverse environmental impacts on air, water, and land resources. Medical wastewater of hazardous substances should be treated before discharged to wastewater networks. Experts assured that although heightened procedures have been made by service providers to curb the spread of the COVID-19 disease, yet, more consistent protocols and stringent procedures are crucial. There have not been any new directives or procedures regarding the management of water supplies and wastewater services in the healthcare facilities. Stakeholder collaboration can help prevent the COVID-19 disease.","output":"Assessment of water and sanitation systems at Palestinian healthcare facilities: pre- and post-COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within the Conidae family, the piscivorous Conus species have been a hotspot target for drug discovery. Here, we assess the relevance of Conus and their other feeding habits, and thus under distinctive evolutionary constraints, to highlight the potential of neglected molluscivorous and vermivorous species in biomedical research and pharmaceutical industry. By singling out the areas with inadequate Conus disquisition, such as the Tamil Nadu Coast and the Andaman Islands, research resources can be expanded and better protected through awareness. In this study, 728 Conus species and 190 species from three other genera (1 from Californiconus, 159 from Conasprella and 30 from Profundiconus) in the Conidae family are assessed. The phylogenetic relationships of the Conidae species are determined and their known feeding habits superimposed. The worm-hunting species appeared first, and later the mollusc- and fish-hunting species were derived independently in the Neogene period (around 23 million years ago). Interestingly, many Conus species in the warm and shallow waters become polyphagous, allowing them to hunt both fish and worms, given the opportunities. Such newly gained trait is multi originated. This is controversial, given the traditional idea that most Conus species are specialized to hunt certain prey categories. However, it shows the functional complexity and great potential of conopeptides from some worm-eating species. Pharmaceutical attempts and relevant omics data have been differentially obtained. Indeed, data from the fish-hunting species receive strong preference over the worm-hunting ones. Expectedly, conopeptides from the fish-hunting species are believed to include the most potential candidates for biomedical research. Our work revisits major findings throughout the Conus evolution and emphasizes the importance of increasing omics surveys complemented with further behavior observation studies. Hence, we claim that Conus species and their feeding habits are equally important, highlighting many places left for Conus exploration worldwide. We also discuss the Conotoxin drug discovery potentials and the urgency of protecting the bioresources of Conus species. In particular, some vermivorous species have demonstrated great potential in malaria therapy, while other conotoxins from several worm- and mollusc-eating species exhibited explicit correlation with SARS-CoV-2. Reclaiming idle data with new perspectives could also promote interdisciplinary studies in both virological and toxicological fields.","output":"Biomedical Potential of the Neglected Molluscivorous and Vermivorous Conus Species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM This study analyzed the characteristics of patients with COVID-19 with major events during the first days of hospitalization. PATIENTS AND METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from consecutive patients admitted to two hospitals in Athens, Greece. The characteristics of patients with COVID-19 who suffered the primary endpoint (venous thromboembolic events, intubation, and death) during the first days of hospitalization were analyzed. RESULTS Among 95 patients included in the analysis, 21 presented with major adverse events during a median follow-up of 13 days. More than 50% of these patients presented with a major event during the first 3 days. Anticoagulation treatment was inversely associated with the cumulative incidence of the primary endpoint [hazard ratio=0.16 (95% confidence interval=0.06-0.47)]. Patients with major events were older, with lower baseline SatO2, and higher number of Wells' criteria and Charlson comorbidity index. Among these patients, those with hypertension were at higher risk for early occurrence of events ( first three days of hospitalization). CONCLUSION Major adverse events may occur early in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with a high-risk profile. Anticoagulation treatment appears to reduce this risk and thus prompt thromboprophylaxis should be employed in these patients.","output":"Early Occurrence of Adverse Events in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19 and Beneficial Effect of Anticoagulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a coronavirus-induced disease of cats, in which the immune system is known to play a crucial, but complex, role in the pathogenesis. This role is still incompletely understood, with involvement of both host and viral factors. To evaluate differential gene expression and pathway involvement in feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection and FIP, we applied next-generation RNA-sequencing of the mesenteric lymph nodes from cats with naturally-acquired FIP, as well as those with systemic FCoV infection without FIP, and those with neither. Viral infection was associated with upregulation of viral defenses regardless of the disease state, but to a greater degree in FIP. FIP was associated with higher pro-inflammatory pathway enrichment, whilst non-FIP FCoV-positive cats showed lower enrichment of humoral immunity pathways, below that of uninfected cats in the case of immunoglobulin production pathways. This host response is presumed to be protective. In FIP, downregulation of T cell-related processes was observed, which did not occur in non-FIP FCoV-positive cats. These results emphasize the importance of the hosts immune balance in determining the outcome of the FCoV infection.","output":"The effect of natural feline coronavirus infection on the host immune response: A whole-transcriptome analysis of the mesenteric lymph nodes in cats with and without feline infectious peritonitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article describes the need to confine the population to contain the pandemic that began to extend in Spain at the beginning of March, without the possibility of using the more refined tracing and isolation techniques that were applied in Germany or Iceland The confinement of the population was the only possibility and led to economic stagnation which we are only now attempting to reverse as the adopted measures are gradually scaled back The V-shaped recovery will be aided by certain measures that have been adopted, such as the ERTEs, the Spanish layoff scheme for furloughed employees, and particularly direct European aid in the form of subsidies and not credits However, a sector of the population has been left outside the system and it has been necessary to guarantee their survival by a minimum income, which has become an essential cornerstone of the welfare state ? 2020 Colegio de Ingenieros de Caminos Canales y Puertos All rights reserved","output":"Economia y sociedad en la covid-19 politica economica y garantias sociales para combatir la caida de ingresos de la poblacion. potencial de la renta minima y sus consecuencias"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Translational neuroscience aims to make discoveries about the brain that will benefit health, especially mental health. Up to now, however, translational neuroscience studies have been designed with very little input from stakeholders who have lived experience of mental health problems. To address this serious gap, stakeholder participation needs to take place at many levels, as it does in service-oriented studies. Methods: We convened a Lived Experience Advisory Panel (LEAP) in order to improve the design of a new study about peoples decision to trust in and continue with, or to stop, psychotherapy treatments. Results: The LEAP productively challenged the ecological validity and relevance of the study design, increasing its potential to improve mental health and to attract research funding. It helped determine the place of lived experience experts in multiple roles within the study throughout its duration. It also helped improve relevance by refining the framing of the therapy-like tasks within the study, and by improving the specification of the study population. LEAP discussions informed the pathways to impact first the consultation process itself, and then the new study. The LEAP convened during the COVID-19 lockdown and its remote work process, described here, demonstrates both the potential for greater involvement of stakeholders in research design, but also some difficulties which future collaborations should address. Conclusion: Involvement of relevant stakeholders very early in the process of designing this research study has improved the study design and its potential to bring positive impacts to those stakeholders.

With medical institutions closed and switch to online teaching and telehealth, many aspects of medical learning are still compromised, including core clinical rotations, clinical skills evaluation, and exams cancelation. The medical students are distressed about their continuity of education and developing the necessary skill to feel confident enough to practice in the future. The involvement of medical students as frontline workers with inadequate clinical training, the uncertainty of future, lack of knowledge, and access to personal protective equipment have aroused a sense of fear in them. They not only nurture their clinical skills from the clinical rotations but it also helps adapt to their residency program later. With the lack of clinical experience, challenges of online learning, cancelation of conferences, and on-site research, medical students are struggling to make their residency application competitive. Recruiting residents amid the pandemic is a difficult task. The uncertainty in the unprecedented situation has an immense psychological impact on medical students and residency applicants. Despite the hurdles being faced, there are many ways where medical students and residency applicants can use their knowledge to help in fighting the pandemic. They can volunteer in the field of research on COVID-19, as a contact tracer, and provide peer support to the patients through telecommunications.

We aimed to perform a meta-analysis and systematic review to estimate the incidences of complications and to compare the short- and long-term satisfaction rates following FTL. METHODS We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane library for eligible studies. The primary outcome was the incidences of complications following FTL. The secondary outcome was the satisfaction rate immediately and 6-month after FTL. The pooled incidences of complications and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using random-effects models. RESULTS A total of 26 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Swelling was the most commonly reported complication with a pooled incidence of 35%, followed by skin dimpling (10%), paresthesia (6%), thread visibility/palpability (4%), infection (2%), and thread extrusion (2%). Absorbable threads were associated with a significantly lower risk of paresthesia (3.1% vs. 11.7%) and thread extrusion (1.6% vs. 7.6%) than non-absorbable threads. Patients older than 50 years had a significantly higher risk of dimpling (16% vs. 5.6%) and infection (5.9% vs. 0.7%) than their younger counterparts. In addition, the pooled long-term satisfaction rate was significantly decreased compared to it immediately after FTL (88% vs. 98%). CONCLUSION Non-absorbable threads and older age of patients are associated with higher risks of complications. Therefore, we recommend a judicious use of non-absorbable threads and FLT in older patients. Furthermore, it should be discussed with patients preoperatively that the rejuvenation effect of FTL may not maintain in the long-term.

The clinical spectrum caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections can range from asymptomatic infection to mild undifferentiated febrile illness to severe respiratory disease with multiple complications. Elderly patients (aged 60 and above) with comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus appear to be at highest risk of a severe disease outcome. To protect against pulmonary immunopathology caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, the host primarily depends on two distinct defense strategies: resistance and disease tolerance. Resistance is the ability of the host to suppress and eliminate incoming viruses. By contrast, disease tolerance refers to host responses that promote host health regardless of their impact on viral replication. Disruption of either resistance or disease tolerance mechanisms or both could underpin predisposition to elevated risk of severe disease during viral infection. Aging can disrupt host resistance and disease tolerance by compromising immune functions, weakening of the unfolded protein response, progressive mitochondrial dysfunction, and altering metabolic processes. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying declining host defense in elderly individuals could thus pave the way to provide new opportunities and approaches for the treatment of severe COVID-19.","output":"The effects of aging on host resistance and disease tolerance to SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the publication of Peng and Nisbett's seminal paper on dialectical thinking, a substantial amount of empirical research has replicated and expanded on the core finding that people differ in the degree to which they view the world as inherently contradictory and in constant flux.

However, an important factor has been overlooked: politics. As recent studies have revealed, political beliefs could shape citizens perceptions about the pandemic.Methods: We conducted time-series cross-sectional regressions with lagged dependent variables, regional fixed effects, regional time-trends, and cluster-robust standard errors using Englands data on confirmed COVID-19 cases from 1 March to 30 June. We examined the effects of government disapproval on the time-dependent reproduction number, Rt. Disapproval was interacted with a lockdown dummy to assess whether citizens support for the government still affected the Rt under harsh interventions like lockdowns. As sensitivity tests, we used different lags (four, five, six, and seven days) on the main variables, ran the analysis without the interaction term, and used an alternative dependent variable.Findings: A percent point increase in disapproval resulted in a 0012 (95% CI 0005 to 0019;P=0014) increase in the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt). Under lockdown, a percent point rise in disapproval increased the Rt by 0008.Interpretation: Non-pharmaceutical interventions are more effective when governments are popular. Because governments both design and execute these interventions, people are less likely to abide by the restrictions designed by the government when they do not believe the government is doing a good job.Funding: No funding to report.Declaration of Interests: There are no conflicts of interest to report.Ethics Approval Statement: No approval was necessary as the study did not involve human subjects.","output":"Government Approval and the Effectiveness of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions Against COVID-19: Time-Series Cross-Sectional Regressions Upon Regions in England, U.K"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: Extensive COVID-19 information can generate information overload and confusion.

Compared to patients monitored with venous implantable Dopplers, arterial monitoring was associated with a risk of false-positives reduced by 74% (RR:0.26, 95% CI:0.12, 0.55, I2 = 40%, p = .0004) and risk of signal loss reduced by 63% (RR:0.37, 95% CI:0.24, 0.59, I2 = 26%, p < .0001). Patients being monitored with a venous implantable Doppler did not show significantly different sensitivities, specificities, true-positives, false-negatives, true-negatives, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, time to signal loss, take-backs, salvage rates, flap failures, flap failure rates, arterial, venous, vascular, and hematoma compromise compared to an arterial implantable Doppler. CONCLUSION These findings suggest arteries may be the best vessels to monitor when using an implantable Doppler following free flap microsurgical reconstruction. Caution is advised when interpreting these findings for clinical significance due to no significant differences in take-backs, SR, flap failures, and FFR.","output":"Comparison of arterial and venous implantable Doppler postoperative monitoring of free flaps: Systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on change in various fields, including in higher education This study provides an overview of the survey result of the experience of 14 lecturers of the Mathematics Education Study Program at the University of Sanata Dharma towards learning in responding to Pandemic Covid-19 The intended experience includes the strategies and technologies used in learning, learning success in terms of the achievement of objectives and student involvement, and planning for future learning The results showed that (1) all lecturers conducted distance learning by utilizing various kinds of technology both synchronous and asynchronous as a form of learning adjustment to face a pandemic (2) Although there was an adjustment in learning, most mathematics learning can run according to learning achievements (3) The Mathematics Education lecturer will implement an improvement in learning that must be carried out online The improvement is in the form of preparation and planning of learning, the use of more varied technologies, the use of more innovative methods of delivering material, adjustment of learning in terms of learning achievement and evaluation while still focusing on developing student experience","output":"Emergency remote teaching experiences of mathematics education lectures to address COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims We describe a clinical audit on alcohol detoxification, using NICE guidelines as a comparable standard. NICE guidelines recommend completing a thorough alcohol history, documentation of a physical examination including screening for Wernicke's encephalopathy, monitoring of vital signs and liver investigations. Breath alcohol level and standardised assessment of withdrawal should be completed in addition to documentation of chlordiazepoxide and thiamine prescriptions. The reported mental health service completed the first cycle of the audit as part of a large-scale, international audit on alcohol detoxification by the Prescribing Observatory for Mental Health, UK (POMH-UK). Two additional audit cycles were completed within the service to ensure continuous quality improvement and clinical effectiveness. Methods Retrospective chart reviews were performed for admissions within pre-defined 6-month periods. Inclusion criteria: ICD-10 F10 diagnosis; prescription of alcohol detoxification schedule. Results This mental health service demonstrated greater compliance with the NICE standards in comparison to other services in the POMH-UK audit. The second-cycle audit showed increased compliance in most areas compared to the initial results. The third-cycle audit focused on two specific areas that required improvement to optimise quality improvement - Breath Alcohol Level and Clinical Institute of Withdrawal Assessment, documentation of which improved from 79% to 85% and 39% to 91% respectively in the final audit cycle. Conclusion The results of this audit indicate that adherence to defined clinical standards within this mental health service exceeds that of the benchmark POMH-UK data. The effectiveness of electronic patient records in improving adherence to set clinical standards, specifically in relation to documentation of clinical parameters is evident.

Although these properties are well established, the mechanisms of action are not completely understood. In this study, GA and GRA were tested for the ability to inhibit rotavirus replication in cell culture, toward a long term goal of discovering natural compounds that may complement existing vaccines. METHODS: Epithelial cells were treated with GA or GRA various times pre- or post-infection and virus yields were measured by immunofluorescent focus assay. Levels of viral proteins VP2, VP6, and NSP2 in GRA treated cells were measured by immunoblot to determine if there was an effect of GRA treatment on the accumulation of viral protein. RESULTS: GRA treatment reduced rotavirus yields by 99% when added to infected cultures post-- virus adsorption, whereas virus yields in GA treated cultures were similar to mock treated controls. Time of addition experiments indicated that GRA-mediated replication inhibition likely occurs at a step or steps subsequent to virus entry. The amounts of VP2, VP6 and NSP2 were substantially reduced when GRA was added to cultures up to two hours post-entry.

METHODS: We conducted a two-arm randomised controlled trial on adult patients with TB during the continuation phase. In the intervention arm, patients received routine care plus phone-based weekly pill refilling and daily medication reminders. In the control arm, participants received only routine care. A covariate adaptive randomisation technique was used to balance covariates during allocation. The primary outcome was adherence to patient-centred TB treatment, and secondary outcomes included providerCpatient relationship and treatment outcomes. We applied per-protocol and intention-to-treat analysis techniques. RESULTS: We randomised 306 patients to intervention (n=152) and control (n=154) groups. Adherence to patient-centred TB treatment was 79% (110/139) in intervention and 66.4% (95/143) in control groups, with relative risk (RR) (95% lower CI) (RR=1.632 (1.162 to ); p=0.018, one tailed).

Currently, we have limited understanding of which cells become infected with SARS-CoV-2 in human tissues and where viral RNA localizes on the subcellular level. Here, we present a platform for preparing autopsy tissue for visualizing SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with amplification by hybridization chain reaction. We developed probe sets that target different regions of SARS-CoV-2 (including ORF1a and N), as well as probe sets that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic mRNAs. We validated these probe sets in cell culture and tissues (lung, lymph node, and placenta) from infected patients. Using this technology, we observe distinct subcellular localization patterns of the ORF1a and N regions. In human lung tissue, we performed multiplexed RNA FISH HCR for SARS-CoV-2 and cell-type-specific marker genes. We found viral RNA in cells containing the alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell marker gene (SFTPC) and the alveolar macrophage marker gene (MARCO) but did not identify viral RNA in cells containing the alveolar type 1 (AT1) cell marker gene (AGER). Moreover, we observed distinct subcellular localization patterns of viral RNA in AT2 cells and alveolar macrophages. In sum, we demonstrate the use of RNA FISH HCR for visualizing different RNA species from SARS-CoV-2 in cell lines and FFPE (formalin fixation and paraffin embedding) autopsy specimens. We anticipate that this platform could be broadly useful for studying SARS-CoV-2 pathology in tissues, as well as extended for other applications, including investigating the viral life cycle, viral diagnostics, and drug screening.","output":"Subcellular Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Human Tissue Reveals Distinct Localization in Alveolar Type 2 Pneumocytes and Alveolar Macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vitamin D (VITD) is a key hormone for bone health and has relevant extra-skeletal effects that might play a role in the prevention and treatment of COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19).

An automatically titrating O2-system (ATOS) has been shown to be beneficial compared with an untitrated CFOS, however, it is unknown if ATOS is superior to CFOS, titrated during exercise as stipulated by guidelines. The aim was to investigate the effects of ATOS compared with titrated CFOS on walking capacity in people with hypoxaemic COPD. METHODS Fifty participants completed this prospective randomised controlled, double-blind, crossover trial. Participants performed two endurance shuttle walk tests (ESWTs) with: (1) exercise titrated CFOS (ESWTCFOS) and (2) ATOS targeting an SpO2 of 92% (ESWTATOS). Primary outcome measure was walking time. Secondary measures were SpO2, transcutaneous-PCO2 (TcPCO2), respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR) at isotime (end of shortest ESWT) with blood gases and dyspnoea at rest and end exercise. RESULTS Participants (median (IQR): age 66 (59, 70) years, FEV1 28.8 (24.8, 35.1) % predicted, PO2 54.7 (51.0, 57.7) mm Hg, PCO2 44.2 (38.2, 47.8) mm Hg) walked significantly longer with ESWTATOS in comparison to ESWTCFOS (median effect (95% CI) +144.5 (54 to 241.5) s, p<0.001). At isotime, SpO2 was significantly higher (+3 (95% CI 1 to 4) %, p<0.001) with ATOS while TcPCO2, RR and HR were comparable. End exercise, PO2 (+8.85 (95% CI 6.35 to 11.9) mm Hg) and dyspnoea (-0.5 (95% CI -1.0 to -0.5) points) differed significantly in favour of ATOS (each p<0.001) while PCO2 was comparable.

Who was most impacted, and the duration of these impacts in patients with IBD has not been quantified to date. Methods: This is an analysis of retrospectively collected data in a large urban safety-net hospital. We identified a cohort of patients with IBD, and quantified their healthcare utilization (HU) during three distinct 90-day periods related to the COVID-19 pandemic;pre-restrictions, restriction period, and recovery period. Demographic data were collected for all patients. Health care utilization was determined by the number of IBD clinic visits (in-person and virtual), abdominal imaging scans, emergency department (ED) visits, hospital admissions, and IBD-related endoscopic procedures. Results: We identified and collected data on 311 patients were collected, during the three time periods. The demographics of this cohort were representative of our IBD population;mean age 46, 53% female, 35% Black, 44% federal or state insurance. Clinic visits declined by 60%, imaging by 50%, and endoscopy declined by 91% during the restriction period (Figure 1). Older age and Black race were significantly associated (p<0.05) with clinic absence during the restriction period. During the recovery period, healthcare utilization remained significantly reduced;clinic visits only improved by 14%, despite universal use of telemedicine (Figure 1). Neither ED visits nor hospitalizations increased in the recovery period. No demographic factor was associated with the resumption of clinic visits, ED, or endoscopy. Conclusion: Pandemic public health restrictions significantly reduced HU for patients with IBD, and these had not recovered within 90 days after the opening of restrictions.

The introduction of COVID-19 on the world agenda gave rise to an overall bad reaction against East Asia (esp. China) in online social media platforms. The social media users who spread degrading, racist, disrespectful, abusive, discriminatory, critical, abuse, harsh, offensive, etc. posts accused the Asian people of being responsible for the outbreak of COVID-19. For this reason, the development of the Hate Speech Detection (HSD) system was necessary in order to prevent the spread of these posts about COVID-19. In this article, a textual-based study on COVID-19-related hate speech (HS) sharing in online social networks was carried out with Shallow Learning (SL) and Deep Learning (DL) methods. In the first step of this study, typical Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline was applied for gathered two different datasets. This NLP pipeline was performed using bag of words, term frequency, document matrix, etc. techniques for features extraction representing datasets. Then, ten different SL and DL models were fine-tuned for HS datasets related to COVID-19. Accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F-score performance measurement criteria were calculated to compare the performance of the SL and DL algorithms for the problem of HSD. The RNN, one of the models proposed for the first and second dataset in HSD, prevailed with the highest accuracy values of 78.7% and 90.3%, respectively. Due to the promising results of all approaches operated in the HSD, they are forecasted to be chosen in the solution of many other social media and network problems related to COVID-19. ? 2022, Strojarski Facultet.

WBAN is a special category of wireless networks. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic creates the situation to monitor the patient remotely following the social distance. WBSN provides the way to effectively monitor the patient remotely with social distance. The data transmitted in WBSN are vulnerable to attacks and this is necessary to take security procedure like cryptographic protocol to protect the user data from attackers. Several physiological sensors are implanted in the human body that will collect various physiological updates to monitor the patient's healthcare data remotely. The sensed information will be transmitted wirelessly to doctors all over the world. But it has too many security threats like data loss, masquerade attacks, secret key distribution problems, unauthorized access, and data confidentiality loss. When any attackers are attacking the physiological sensor data, there is a possibility of losing the patient's information. The creation, cancellation, and clinical data adjustment will produce a mass effect on the healthcare monitoring system. Present-day cryptographic calculations are highly resistant to attacks, but the only weak point is the insecure movement of keys. In this paper, we look into critical security threats: secure key distribution. While sharing the secret key between communicating parties in the wireless body sensor networks in the conventional method like via phone or email, the attackers will catch the private key. They can decrypt and modify more sensitive medical data. It can cause a significant effect like death also. So need an effective, secure key distribution scheme for transmission of human body health related data to medical professional through wireless links. Moreover, a new enhanced BB84 Quantum cryptography protocol is proposed in this paper for sharing the secret key among communicating parties in a secure manner using quantum theory. Besides, a bitwise operator is combined with quantum concepts to secure the patient's sensed information in the wireless environment. Instead of mail and phone via sharing secret key, quantum theory with the bitwise operator is used here. Therefore, it is not possible to hack the secret key of communication. The body sensor's constrained assets as far as battery life, memory, and computational limit are considered for showing the efficiency of the proposed security framework.

METHODS: We performed 158 external validations of 104 unique CPMs across 3 domains of cardiovascular disease (primary prevention, acute coronary syndrome, and heart failure). Validations were performed in publicly available clinical trial cohorts and model performance was assessed using measures of discrimination, calibration, and net benefit. To explore potential reasons for poor model performance, CPM-clinical trial cohort pairs were stratified based on relatedness, a domain-specific set of characteristics to qualitatively grade the similarity of derivation and validation patient populations. We also examined the model-based C-statistic to assess whether changes in discrimination were because of differences in case-mix between the derivation and validation samples. The impact of model updating on model performance was also assessed. RESULTS: Discrimination decreased significantly between model derivation (0.76 [interquartile range 0.73C0.78]) and validation (0.64 [interquartile range 0.60C0.67], P<0.001), but approximately half of this decrease was because of narrower case-mix in the validation samples. CPMs had better discrimination when tested in related compared with distantly related trial cohorts. Calibration slope was also significantly higher in related trial cohorts (0.77 [interquartile range, 0.59C0.90]) than distantly related cohorts (0.59 [interquartile range 0.43C0.73], P=0.001). When considering the full range of possible decision thresholds between half and twice the outcome incidence, 91% of models had a risk of harm (net benefit below default strategy) at some threshold; this risk could be reduced substantially via updating model intercept, calibration slope, or complete re-estimation. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant decreases in model performance when applying cardiovascular disease CPMs to new patient populations, resulting in substantial risk of harm. Model updating can mitigate these risks.

In contrast to genetic adaptation that spans multiple generations as an evolutionary process, phenotypic plasticity allows acclimation within the life-time of an organism. Genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity are usually studied in isolation, however, only by including their interactive impact, we can understand acclimation and adaptation in nature. We aimed to explore the contribution of adaptation and plasticity in coping with an abiotic (salinity) and a biotic (Vibrio bacteria) stressor using six different populations of the broad-nosed pipefish Syngnathus typhle that originated from either high or low saline environments. We hypothesized that wild S. typhle populations are locally adapted to the salinity and prevailing pathogens of their native environment, and that short-term acclimation of parents to a novel salinity may aid in buffering offspring phenotypes in a matching environment. To test these hypotheses, we exposed all wild caught animals, to either high or low salinity, representing native and novel salinity conditions and allowed animals to mate. After male pregnancy, offspring was split and each half was exposed to one of the two salinities and infected with Vibrio alginolyticus bacteria that were evolved at either of the two salinities in a fully reciprocal design. We investigated life history traits of fathers (offspring survival, offspring size) and expression of 47 target genes in mothers and offspring. Pregnant males originating from high salinity exposed to low salinity were highly susceptible to opportunistic fungi infections resulting in decreased offspring size and number. In contrast, no signs of fungal infection were identified in fathers originating from low saline conditions suggesting that genetic adaptation has the potential to overcome the challenging conditions of low salinity. Genetic adaptation increased survival rates of juveniles from parents in lower salinity (in contrast to those from high salinity). Juvenile gene expression indicated patterns of local adaptation, trans-generational plasticity and developmental plasticity. The results of our study suggest that pipefish locally adapted to low salinity retain phenotypic plasticity, which allows them to also cope with ancestral salinity levels and prevailing pathogens.","output":"Pipefish locally adapted to low salinity in the Baltic Sea retain phenotypic plasticity to cope with ancestral salinity levels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Population studies have shown that rates of depressive and anxious symptoms have increased as a result of COVID\\\\19.

Objective: To evaluate the performance and validity of the COVISTIXTM rapid antigen test, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in an unselected population and compare it to PanbioTM rapid antigen test and RT-PCR. Design: This is comparative effectiveness study; samples were collected at two point-of-care facilities in Mexico City between May and August 2021. Participants: Recruited individuals were probable COVID-19 cases, either symptomatic or asymptomatic persons that were at risk of infection due to close contact to SARS-CoV-2 positive cases. Diagnostic intervention: RT-PCR was used as gold standard for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs, study subjects were tested in parallel either with the COVISTIXTM or with PanbioTM rapid antigen test. Main outcome: Diagnostic performance of the COVISTIXTM assay is adequate in all commers since its accuracy parameters were not affected in samples collected after 7 days of symptom onset, and it detected almost 65% of samples with a Ct-value between 30 and 34. Results: For the population tested with COVISTIXTM (n=783), specificity and sensitivity of the was 96.0% (CI95% 94.0-98.0) and 81% (CI95% 76.0-85.0), as for the PanbioTM (n=2202) population, was 99.0% (CI95%: 0.99-1.00) and 62% (CI%: 58.0-64.0%), respectively.

A concerning trend in the treatment of COVID-19 has emerged wherein hospitalized patients are administered broad spectrum antibiotics to stave off secondary bacterial infection. However, the clinical justification for the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for viral respiratory infection remains tenuous. Over administration of these therapies contributes to the growing frequency of antimicrobial resistance, which prior to the pandemic contributed to nearly 700,000 death per year. OBJECTIVE To describe the clinical utilization and efficacy of broad-spectrum antibiotics among hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 within 3 hospital systems in the American southwest. METHODS A multisite retrospective chart review of patients admitted to inpatient care due SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 1st , 2020 through January 31st , 2021 was conducted. Abstracted data included patient demographics, laboratory culture results, administered antibiotics, and patient outcomes. Analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics, the Pearson chi-square for categorical data, and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous data. RESULTS A total of 489 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection via nasopharyngeal sample were included in the analysis with 19.2% (94/489) diagnosed with a concurrent bacterial infection. Patients with concurrent bacterial infections were more likely to require critical care (50.0% vs 20.7%; p<0.001) and expire (28.7% vs 14.4%; p<0.001) while hospitalized. Though the rates of secondary bacterial infection were low, 83.4% of all patients were administered at least one broad spectrum antibiotic, with the most common being Azithromycin (60%; 297/489) followed by Ceftriaxone (46.6%; 228/489). Antibiotics were not preferentially administered to patients with concurrent bacterial infection (p=0.1619), nor did it show clinical efficacy for reducing mortality among the entire sample (p=0.190) or those with secondary infection (p=0.191). CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to non-specific over administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which failed to improve the rate of patient mortality even when afflicted with secondary infection. Over-administration of these drugs will continue to exacerbate the growing rates of antimicrobial resistance. Clinicians are recommended to apply early empirical approaches when selecting to employ antibiotic therapies.","output":"Multisite Clinical Utilization of Antibiotics among Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A sense of autonomy is important to ensure a good quality of life for older adults However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic challenged older adults' autonomy The government has imposed rules and regulations to slow down the spread of the virus that reduced older adults' abilities to go outside We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 older adults living alone in community-dwellings to understand the influence of the pandemic on their experiences of autonomy Our findings show that even though older adults experienced limited autonomy due to extrinsic (e g , government regulation, influence of others) and intrinsic (e g , risk perception) factors, they experienced new opportunities for autonomy through engagement in various self-chosen activities at home The insights from the study pave ways for future research and design of aging in place technology focusing on providing a sense of autonomy ? 2021 ACM","output":"Older Adults' Experiences of Autonomy during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims Long-term outcomes of early combined immunosuppression [top-down] compared to conventional management [step-up] in recently diagnosed Crohn's disease [CD] are unknown.

For 16 semesters following the 2-year trial, we recorded: clinical activity, medication use, flares, hospitalization, surgery and fistulas. Colonoscopy reports were scored as: endoscopic remission, aphthous/small ulcers or large ulcers. The primary endpoint was the proportion of semesters in remission. Results Data were available from 119/133 patients [step-up n = 60].

In England, several issues regarding the accessibility of SLPFs through the national prescribing system have been highlighted. Therefore, prescribing patterns and expenditure on all SLPFs available on prescription in England (n = 142) were examined. Their costs in comparison to regular protein-containing (n = 182) and free-from products (n = 135) were also analysed. Similar foods were grouped into subgroups (n = 40). The number of units and costs of SLPFs prescribed in total and per subgroup from January to December 2020 were calculated using National Health Service (NHS) Business Service Authority (NHSBSA) ePACT2 (electronic Prescribing Analysis and Cost Tool) for England. Monthly patient SLPF units prescribed were calculated using patient numbers with PKU and non-PKU inherited metabolic disorders (IMD) consuming SLPFs. This was compared to the National Society for PKU (NSPKU) prescribing guidance. Ninety-eight percent of SLPF subgroups (n = 39/40) were more expensive than regular and free-from food subgroups. However, costs to prescribe SLPFs are significantly less than theoretical calculations. From January to December 2020, 208,932 units of SLPFs were prescribed (excluding milk replacers), costing the NHS 2,151,973 (including milk replacers). This equates to 962 per patient annually, and prescribed amounts are well below the upper limits suggested by the NSPKU, indicating under prescribing of SLPFs. It is recommended that a simpler and improved system should be implemented. Ideally, specialist metabolic dietitians should have responsibility for prescribing SLPFs. This would ensure that patients with PKU have the necessary access to their essential dietary treatment, which, in turn, should help promote dietary adherence and improve metabolic control.","output":"Special Low Protein Foods Prescribed in England for PKU Patients: An Analysis of Prescribing Patterns and Cost"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY INTRODUCTION: The challenge of facing COVID-19 falls under all health care structures, and without specific training to health care professionals they are probably the professionals with the highest level of exposure. Regardless of the level of health care, the training of professionals aims to optimize resources and attend patients while assuring quality and security. POINT OF VIEW: This report proposes simulation training for health care professionals to update professionals for attending patients during the pandemic. This training was built with five simulated stations, considering different stages of a patient with COVID-19. This report takes advantage of different simulation techniques, such as skills training, standardized patient, medium- and high-fidelity simulator, rapid cycle of deliberate practice, and in situ simulation. DISCUSSION: Medical procedures for COVID-19 patients offer additional risk for health care professionals, especially considering exposure to procedures that generate aerosols, such as compression, mask ventilation, and orotracheal intubation. Thus, finding educational strategies that allow training is essential to simulate the evolution of COVID-19 patients in a safe manner.

By using new-generation membranes with a low energy consumption and considering wind and photovoltaic energy sources, it is possible to greatly reduce the carbon footprint of reverse osmosis plants. The objective of this study was to add a renewable energy supply to a desalination plant that uses reverse osmosis technology. During the development of this research study, photovoltaic energy was discarded as a possible source of renewable energy due to the wind conditions in the area in which the reverse osmosis plant was located; hence, the installation of a wind turbine was considered to be the best option. As it was a large-capacity reverse osmosis plant, we decided to divide the entire desalination process into several stages for explanation purposes. The desalination process of the facility consists of several phases: First, the seawater capture process was performed by the intake tower. This water was then transported and stored, before going through a physical and chemical pre-treatment process, whereby the highest possible percentage of impurities and organic material was eliminated in order to prevent the plugging of the reverse osmosis modules. After carrying out the appraisals and calculating the amount of energy that the plant consumed, we determined that 15% of the plants energy supply should be renewable, corresponding to 1194 MWh/year. As there was already a wind power installation in the area, we decided to use one of the wind turbines that had already been installedspecifically, an Ecotecnia turbine (20C150) that produced an energy of 1920 MWh /year. This meant that only a single wind turbine was required for this project.","output":"An Assessment of Renewable Energies in a Seawater Desalination Plant with Reverse Osmosis Membranes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Revisiting Charles Long's 1991 proclamation of a modern crisis of materiality, this essay examines Long's theorization of the fetish-commodity legacies, that recreated African persons into objects and commodities, as a means of understanding our present tripartite pandemic of systemic racism, environmental destruction, and COVID-19 Examining the period of, what Long elsewhere terms, the second creation, I interrogate what this crisis means for the study of religion and for our society today Building on Long's conception of soul stuff and yet moving beyond notions of human exceptionalism, I argue that to move beyond fetish and colonial legacies and realize a third creation (or, in other words, a (re-)recreation), both scholars and the public must craft a new materialism that honors the ontological reality and value of all existence ? 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","output":"The Proclamation of Charles H.

All ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Few studies had reported milder course in children however, severe course of illness has been reported. We aimed to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 in pediatric patients including diagnostic findings and therapeutic interventions in sever disease manifestation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 742 patients with SARS-CoV-2 proven infection at King Abdullah Specialist Children's Hospital, from April 2020 and July 2020. Inpatients, outpatient, including those with sever manifestation treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were included. We collected data including demographic data, comorbidities, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Among of 742 patients, 71 (9.6%) were hospitalized. The median age of patients was 75 months old and 53.6 were male. A total of 461 (62.1%) had close contact with confirmed cases, 45 (6.1%) had no contact history, and 236 (31.8%) with unknown exposure risk. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (32.5%), respiratory symptoms (21%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (10.3%). Among the entire cohort, 7 patients were admitted to PICU with COVID-19 related symptoms, five patients diagnosed with MIS-C, one patient with Kawasaki, and one patient with pneumonia. All patients received supportive therapy, no antiviral treatment had been used however, in MIS-C patients IVIG had been given to all patients, five patients received Anakinra; and one patient received tocilizumab. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are less likely to develop symptomatic or serious diseases. Among symptomatic children, the most common clinical features were fever and respiratory symptoms followed by gastrointestinal manifestations. The majority of infected children have reported contact with an infected individual. MIS-C associated with COVID-19 is a severe presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection and of a major concern as an overlapping features with other diseases could happen, making the diagnosis challenging.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, clinical characteristics, diagnostic findings and therapeutic interventions at a tertiary care center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The development of vaccines against coronaviruses has focused on the spike (S) protein, which is required for the recognition of host-cell receptors and thus elicits neutralizing antibodies. Targeting conserved epitopes on the S protein offers the potential for pan-beta-coronavirus vaccines that could prevent future pandemics. We displayed five B-cell epitopes, originally identified in the convalescent sera from recovered severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients, on the surface of the cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) and evaluated these formulations as vaccines. Prime-boost immunization of mice with three of these candidate vaccines, CPMV-988, CPMV-1173, and CPMV-1209, elicited high antibody titers that neutralized the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in vitro and showed an early Th1-biased profile (2C4 weeks) transitioning to a slightly Th2-biased profile just after the second boost (6 weeks). A pentavalent slow-release implant comprising all five peptides displayed on the CPMV elicited anti-S protein and epitope-specific antibody titers, albeit at a lower magnitude compared to the soluble formulations. While the CPMV remained intact when released from the PLGA implants, processing results in loss of RNA, which acts as an adjuvant. Loss of RNA may be a reason for the lower efficacy of the implants. Finally, although the three epitopes (988, 1173, and 1209) that were found to be neutralizing the SARS-CoV were 100% identical to the SARS-CoV-2, none of the vaccine candidates neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 in vitro suggesting differences in the natural epitope perhaps caused by conformational changes or the presence of N-linked glycans.

Adherence to hand hygiene plays a major role in infection prevention and control. These adherence rates can be improved through behaviour tracking innovations. This requires the systems to be widely implemented and accepted. Therefore, both a systematic analysis of the normative issues related and the evaluation of technology acceptance are equally important. OBJECTIVES To explore and describe relevant aspects regarding the acceptance of technology and ethical implications using a tracking device to measure and improve adherence to hand hygiene. RESEARCH DESIGN A quantitative study with a descriptive design was performed. PARTICIPANTS AND RESEARCH CONTEXT A total of 75 questionnaires were collected in three hospitals in Germany. Acceptance of technology was measured with n = 60 participants (n = 50 nurses; n = 9 physicians; n = 1 not disclosed) and ethical assessment with n = 15 participants (nurses only). ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the institutional review board. FINDINGS The acceptance of technologies improving hygiene in general was good (median = 80.5, interquartile range = 28, range: 0-100). The experience with technologies in general (median = 48.5, interquartile range = 57, range: 0-100) and the acceptance of the specific technology (mean = 82.23, standard deviation = 15.16 (range: 23-138)) was moderate. There was a significant positive correlation between the acceptance and experience of technology in general (r = 0.217, p = .025). Ethical concerns played a minor role. The need for practical support was a key topic. DISCUSSION Study participants accepted technologies improving hygiene; however, the specific device implemented was only moderately accepted. This creates specific opportunities in the implementation process for higher later acceptance. More practical support and an increase in experience may create opportunities for device implementation with high acceptance and low ethical concerns. CONCLUSION Study results indicate a vast potential for improving the implementation process of hand hygiene technologies. Ethical concerns in this study did not seem to be a relevant barrier for successful implementation of hand hygiene technologies.","output":"Hand hygiene monitoring technology: A descriptive study of ethics and acceptance in nursing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This narrative review sums up data from the SARS-CoV-2-pandemia on preexisting disease/underlying conditions/comorbidities and risk factors in children for severe COVID-19 and MIS-C/PIMS-TS as well as hospitalization and mortality.

Besides, some services sectors including utility, transportation and information services have played increasingly important roles in the networks of industry-specific volatility spillovers as of the COVID-19 out broke. By implication, firstly, being led by Chinese government, the COVID-19 is successfully contained and the work resumption is organized with a high efficiency in China. The risk of the investment demand therefore was controlled and eliminated relatively fast.

Community health workers (CHWs) and Peer Ambassadors (PAs) may be able to overcome mistrust in COVID-19 vaccine outreach. An unhoused PA program for COVID-19 vaccine outreach by CHWs was implemented in Los Angeles using a participatory academic-community partnership. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate CHW perspectives on an unhoused PA COVID-19 vaccine outreach program in Los Angeles. DESIGN: This study used a participatory community conference and qualitative focus groups to understand CHW perspectives on the PA program. The one-day conference was held in November 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Of the 42 conference participants, 19 CHWs participated in focus groups for two-way knowledge exchange between CHWs and researchers. APPROACH: Four focus groups were held during the conference, with 4-6 CHWs per group. Each group had a facilitator and two notetakers. Focus group notes were then analyzed using content analysis to derive categories of findings. CHWs reviewed the qualitative analysis to ensure that findings represented their experiences with the PA program. KEY RESULTS: The five categories of findings from focus groups were as follows: (1) PAs were effective liaisons to their peers to promote COVID-19 vaccines; (2) CHWs recognized the importance of establishing genuine trust and equitable working relationships within CHW/PA teams; (3) there were tradeoffs of integrating unhoused PAs into the existing CHW workflow; (4) CHWs had initial misgivings about the research process; and (5) there were lingering questions about the ethics of exploiting the invaluable trust unhoused PAs have with unhoused communities. CONCLUSIONS: CHWs were in a unique position to empower unhoused PAs to take a leadership role in reaching their peers with COVID-19 vaccines and advocate for long-term employment and housing needs.","output":"Community Health Worker Perspectives on Engaging Unhoused Peer Ambassadors for COVID-19 Vaccine Outreach in Homeless Encampments and Shelters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To quantitatively measure the amount of pressure induced at the calcaneus and cranial tibial surface of dogs by use of 2 cast configurations. ANIMALS 13 client- or student-owned dogs. PROCEDURES Pressure sensors were placed over the calcaneus and cranial tibial surface. Dogs then were fitted with a fiberglass cast on a pelvic limb extending from the digits to the stifle joint (tall cast). Pressure induced over the calcaneus and proximal edge of the cast at the level of the cranial tibial surface was simultaneously recorded during ambulation. Subsequently, the cast was shortened to end immediately proximal to the calcaneus (short cast), and data acquisition was repeated. Pressure at the level of the calcaneus and cranial tibial surface for both cast configurations was compared by use of paired t tests. RESULTS The short cast created significantly greater peak pressure at the level of the calcaneus (mean  SD, 0.2  0.07 MPa), compared with peak pressure created by the tall cast (0.1  0.06 MPa). Mean pressure at the proximal cranial edge of the cast was significantly greater for the short cast (0.2  0.06 MPa) than for the tall cast (0.04  0.03 MPa). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE A cast extended to the level of the proximal portion of the tibia caused less pressure at the level of the calcaneus and the proximal cranial edge of the cast. Reducing the amount of pressure at these locations may minimize the potential for pressure sores and other soft tissue injuries.","output":"Use of pressure mapping for quantitative analysis of pressure points induced by external coaptation of the distal portion of the pelvic limb of dogs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Compared with other age groups, older adults (defined here as persons aged &#8805;65 years) are at higher risk for COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality and have therefore been prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination (1,2). Ensuring access to vaccines for older adults has been a focus of federal, state, and local response efforts, and CDC has been monitoring vaccination coverage to identify and address disparities among subpopulations of older adults (2). Vaccine administration data submitted to CDC were analyzed to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination initiation among adults aged &#8805;65 years by demographic characteristics and overall. Characteristics of counties with low vaccination initiation rates were quantified using indicators of social vulnerability data from the 2019 American Community Survey.* During December 14, 2020-April 10, 2021, nationwide, a total of 42,736,710 (79.1%) older adults had initiated vaccination. The initiation rate was higher among men than among women and varied by state. On average, counties with low vaccination initiation rates (<50% of older adults having received at least 1 vaccine dose), compared with those with high rates (&#8805;75%), had higher percentages of older adults without a computer, living in poverty, without Internet access, and living alone. CDC, state, and local jurisdictions in partnerships with communities should continue to identify and implement strategies to improve access to COVID-19 vaccination for older adults, such as assistance with scheduling vaccination appointments and transportation to vaccination sites, or vaccination at home if needed for persons who are homebound.?

In particular, the purpose of the study is to investigate the relationship between the accused, the victim and offender status and the search for revenge or reconciliation following a personal offense. To test the suggested research model, we analyzed the data collected by 167 (m = 28.52; SD = 8.98) employees in different organizations using a multifactorial experimental design. The results support the influence of attributional predictions in forming revenge and reconciliation and show that they are involved in the decision to carry out revenge, but especially in the way the employee interprets the trigger situation. In conclusion, the revenge is based on a negative attributional mechanism that produces the greatest deficit of adaptation to the situation and a weakening of the perception of social support, while reconciliation seems to be based on a much more complex socio-occupational mechanism. Leaders should pay attention to organizational communication during a crisis as they could encourage hopelessness depression. Adjusting crisis communication is crucial to ensuring job satisfaction that could mitigate negative effects.","output":"Responses to Offense at Work and the Impact of Hierarchical Status: The Fault of the Leader, Causal Attributions, and Social Support During the Covid-19 Pandemic Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dynamic Capabilities View (DCV) has an illustrious history of having dominated strategic management thinking for more than two decades now (Bleady et al., 2018). However, its pillars have since begun to quake in the wake of growing cataclysmic episodes, which have made it the subject of intense scrutiny by the scholarly community. The DCV view typifies adaptive properties as strategic agility, whose essence is value creation through innovative products and novel business models instead of incremental improvement of existing models and products (Wjcik, 2015). It is instructive to note that the DCV evolved from the Resource-Based View's (RBV's) notion of Valuable, Rare, Inimitable and Non-substitutable (VRIN) resources, signaling that theory development in the strategic management space is an infinite evolutionary process characterised by continuous shifts in conceptualisation (Bleady et al., 2018;Schilke et al., 2018). However, the thinking that informed the development of DCV is increasingly being challenged by the growing realisation that every competitive advantage has a shelf-life (Wjcik, 2015). A defense of DCV is nonetheless offered by Helfat et al.

Advance care planning is essential to assist patient autonomy and prevent non-beneficial medical interventions. AIM: To describe early (taken within 72 h after hospital admission) resuscitation orders in oldest-old hospitalized with COVID-19. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of patients aged 80 years and older admitted to the acute hospital in March and April 2020 with COVID-19 were retrospectively recruited from 10 acute hospitals in Belgium. Recruitment was done through a network of geriatricians. RESULTS: Overall, 766 octogenarians were admitted of whom 49 were excluded because no therapeutic relationship with the geriatrician and six because of incomplete case report form. Early decisions not to consider intensive care admission were taken in 474/711 (66.7%) patients. This subgroup was characterized by significantly higher age, higher number of comorbidities and higher frailty level. There was a significant association between the degree of the treatment limitation and the degree of premorbid frailty (p < 0.001). Overall in-hospital mortality was 41.6% in patients with an early decision not to consider intensive care admission (67.1% in persons who developed respiratory failure vs 16.7% in patients without respiratory failure (p < 0.001)). Of 104 patients without early decision not to consider intensive care admission but who developed respiratory failure, 59 were eventually not transferred to intensive care unit with in-hospital mortality of 25.4%; 45 were transferred to the intensive care unit with mortality of 64.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatricians applied all levels of treatment in oldest-old hospitalized with COVID-19.

Although the significance remains unclear, intestinal organoid lines display heterogeneity in their growth and morphology. We hypothesized that organoids will also display variability in the degree to which they are susceptible to infectious agents. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a model, we found orders of magnitude differences in the amount of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from small intestinal and colonic organoids generated from different donors. SARS-CoV-2 burden did not correlate with demographic or clinical features associated with donors, but rather reflected the expression level of the virus receptor ACE2. Remarkably, organoid ACE2 transcript levels matched the amount of ACE2 detected in primary tissue from the same individual, indicating that certain properties of the intestinal epithelium are retained during ex vivo differentiation. Longitudinal transcriptomics of organoids identified a delayed yet robust interferon signature, the magnitude of which corresponded to the degree of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results suggest that intestinal organoids display substantial heterogeneity in their ability to support viral infections and can potentially inform mechanisms behind interindividual differences in susceptibility to infectious disease.","output":"Intestinal organoids expose heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONFERENCE PROCEEDING Proceedings of the PDA/FDA Adventitious Viruses in Biologics: Detection and Mitigation Strategies Workshop in Bethesda, MD, USA; December 1-3, 2010 Guest Editors: Arifa Khan (Bethesda, MD), Patricia Hughes (Bethesda, MD) and Michael Wiebe (San Francisco, CA) Approaches to viral safety issues for biological products have evolved during the past 50+ years. The first cell culture products (viral vaccines) relied largely on the use of in vitro and in vivo virus screening assays that were based upon infectivity of adventitious viral agents. The use of Cohn fractionation and pasteurization by manufacturers of plasma derivatives introduced the concepts that purification and treatment with physical and chemical agents could greatly reduce the risk of viral contamination of human albumin and immunoglobulin products. But the limitations of such approaches became clear for thermolabile products that were removed early in fractionation such as antihemophilic factors, which transmitted hepatitis viruses and HIV-1 to some product recipients. These successes and limitations were taken into account by the early developers of recombinant DNA (rDNA)-derived cell culture products and by regulatory agencies, leading to the utilization of cloning technology to reduce/eliminate contamination due to human viruses and purification technologies to physically remove and inactivate adventitious and endogenous viruses, along with cell banking and cell bank characterization for adventitious and endogenous viruses, viral screening of biological raw materials, and testing of cell culture harvests, to ensure virus safety. Later development and incorporation of nanofiltration technology in the manufacturing process provided additional assurance of viral clearance for safety of biotechnology products. These measures have proven very effective at preventing iatrogenic infection of recipients of biotechnology products; however, viral contamination of production cell cultures has occasionally occurred. Screening tests for viral contamination in raw materials have not proven practical by themselves to prevent contamination of cell cultures, but they can be made more effective by coupling with treatment using physical or chemical agents to further reduce the hypothetical viral loads present in cell culture raw materials. Recent advances in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology have allowed preharvest testing for specific viral agents to reduce the risk of cell culture contamination by specific viruses in the harvest material. Examples of each of these stages in the evolution of virus detection methods are described and assessed in this paper.","output":"Evolution of approaches to viral safety issues for biological products."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the in-depth research on bone repair process, and the progress in bone repair materials preparation and characterization, a variety of artificial bone substitutes have been fully developed in the treatment of bone related diseases such as bone defects.

Children with low levels of physical activity may experience health problems, such as loss of muscle mass, later in life. Thus, it may be valuable to identify declining physical function in children who do not perform the recommended amount of physical activity. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the amount of physical activity performed for 60 min per day for 5 days per week and the skeletal muscle mass index and physical function in young children. In total, 340 typically developing children aged 6C12 years (175 girls; average age, 9.51.9 years) were included in this cross-sectional study. We evaluated the proportion of children performing the recommended minimum of 60 min of daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at least 5 days per week. The skeletal muscle mass and Gait Deviation Index scores, gait speed, grip strength, Five Times Sit-to-Stand test results, Timed Up-and-Go test results, one-leg standing time, and gait efficiency were evaluated. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity with the skeletal muscle mass index, percent body fat, and physical function, after controlling for confounding factors (age and sex). A logistic regression analysis revealed that the skeletal muscle mass index was independently associated with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (odds ratio, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.17C4.71; P = 0.017). Performance of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity for 5 days per week for 60 min per day was associated with the skeletal muscle mass index score of Japanese children.

Our model employs probabilities to estimate the time evolution of infections, recoveries, and deaths. This model discriminates asymptomatic, mild/moderate, and severe cases and allows for the estimation of undiagnosed individuals. Furthermore, we compare the model curves to official data for medium-sized cities, world metropolises, and medium-sized countries, spanning a range of populations from a few million to several million individuals. Using the undiagnosed estimates we correct the case fatality rates and find that it ranges from 0.33%  0.02% to 1.14%  0.07%. Since we applied the method to cities and countries with different characteristics, the corrected case fatality rates indicate a universality that is independent of location and other social/demographic conditions. Our results agree with sample tests and seroprevalence studies, considerably changing our understanding of the COVID-19 fatality rates.

Despite all benefits, there might be some threats for younger groups spending their time in quarantine. This study aims to determine the impacts of lockdown and school closure on children's major lifestyle aspects, especially their leisure and sleep pattern during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For the purpose of this study, an online questionnaire was distributed from 14th to 31st of March 2020 among the schools and students from the first grade to the 12th grade (before university) in Fars province, southern Iran. The questionnaire consisted of five sections which included data regarding the students' general information, activity priorities, adherence to quarantine, attitude toward school closure, and sleep patterns. RESULTS: In our study, 20,697 filled questionnaires were received from the participants with an average age of 13.76 years; 29.7% of them were male, 80.6% were from urban areas, and 83.3% were from public schools. The overall first preference of students during school closure was mobile and computer games (30.1%), followed by studying (26.6%) and watching television (13.8%). Our results demonstrated that the majority of students adhered to social distancing and there was also a significant correlation among education levels and desire for schools to be closed till the end of the semester (P = 0.015). Also, regarding sleep patterns, the majority (53.5%) had above 12 h of sleep throughout the day. CONCLUSION: It seems that lockdown following COVID-19 pandemic has changed various aspects of the students' lifestyle remarkably, especially by increasing screen time and even sleep duration and pattern.

Exploring spatial and temporal variation of residential land prices and the effect of land market factors on residential land prices can help the government formulate targeted regulations and policies. This study analyzes the spatial and temporal evolution of residential land prices and the factors influencing the land market in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region based on land transaction data from 2014C2017 using exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. The results show the following:  Residential land prices in Beijing and Tianjin are significantly higher than those in other regions, while Zhangjiakou, Chengde, and western mountainous areas have the lowest residential land prices. Over time, a development trend of residential land price polycentricity gradually emerged, and the locational correlation has gradually increased.  Under the influence of the land finance model of local governments in China, three factors, namely, the land stock utilization rate, revenue from residential land transfers, and the growth of residential land transaction areas, have significantly contributed to the increase in residential land prices.  Under the land market supply and demand mechanism and government management, four indicators, namely, the land supply rate, the per capita residential land supply area, the degree of marketization of the residential land supply, and the frequency of residential land transactions, have suppressed the rise in residential land prices.  The overall effect of land market factors on residential land prices in the central and northern regions of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei is stronger than that in the southern regions, which may be related to the more active land market and stricter macromanagement policies in Beijing, Tianjin and surrounding areas.","output":"Inter-metropolitan land price characteristics and pattern in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The benefits of early virtual-reality-based home rehabilitation following total hip arthroplasty (THA) have not yet been assessed.

Many tree crown delineation methods have difficulty in closed-canopy forests and do not leverage multiple datasets. Methods to classify individual species are often accurate for common species, but perform poorly for less common species and when applied to new sites. We ran a data science competition to help identify effective methods for delineation of individual crowns and classification to determine species identity. This competition included data from multiple sites to assess the methods ability to generalize learning across multiple sites simultaneously, and transfer learning to novel sites where the methods were not trained. Six teams, representing 4 countries and 9 individual participants, submitted predictions. Methods from a previous competition were also applied and used as the baseline to understand whether the methods are changing and improving over time. The best delineation method was based on an instance segmentation pipeline, closely followed by a Faster R-CNN pipeline, both of which outperformed the baseline method. However, the baseline (based on a growing region algorithm) still performed well as did the Faster R-CNN. All delineation methods generalized well and transferred to novel forests effectively. The best species classification method was based on a two-stage fully connected neural network, which significantly outperformed the baseline (a random forest and Gradient boosting ensemble). The classification methods generalized well, with all teams training their models using multiple sites simultaneously, but the predictions from these trained models generally failed to transfer effectively to a novel site. Classification performance was strongly influenced by the number of field-based species IDs available for training the models, with most methods predicting common species well at the training sites. Classification errors (i.e., species misidentification) were most common between similar species in the same genus and different species that occur in the same habitat. The best methods handled class imbalance well and learned unique spectral features even with limited data. Most methods performed better than baseline in detecting new (untrained) species, especially in the site with no training data.

Results FBG levels were plotted in quintiles with set at < 4.74, 4.74-5.21, 5.21-5.78, 5.78-7.05, and R7.05 mmol/L. The constituent ratio of severe or critical cases in each FBG quintile was 20.7%, 1.7%, 13.8%, 27.1%, and 67.2%, respectively (P < 0.0001). When the second quintile was used as the reference, the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) (95%CI) for the risk of severe/critical condition in COVID-19 was 25.33(2.77, 231.64), 1.00 (Reference), 3.13(0.33, 29.67), 10.59(1.23, 91.24), 38.93(4.36, 347.48) per FBG quintile respectively (P < 0.001). Conclusions we provide evidence of J-shaped associations between FBG and risk of severe and critical condition in non-diabetes patients with COVID-19, with nadir at 4.74-5.78 mmol/L.","output":"J-shaped Association Between Fasting Blood Glucose Levels and COVID-19 Severity in Patients without Diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ELISA and chemiluminescence serological assays for COVID-19 are currently incorporating only one or two SARS-CoV-2 antigens. We developed an automated Western immunoblotting as a complementary serologic assay for COVID-19. The JessTM Simple Western system, an automated capillary-based assay, was used, incorporating an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 lineage 20a strain as the source of antigen, and total immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA) detection. In total, 602 sera were tested including 223 from RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, 76 from patients diagnosed with seasonal HCoVs and 303 from coronavirus-negative control sera. We also compared this assay with the EUROIMMUN? SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA kit. Among 223 sera obtained from RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, 180/223 (81%) exhibited reactivity against the nucleocapsid and 70/223 (31%) against the spike protein. Nucleocapsid reactivity was further detected in 9/76 (14%) samples collected from patients diagnosed with seasonal HCoVs and in 15/303 (5%) coronavirus-negative control samples. In the subset of sera collected more than 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms, the sensitivity was 94% and the specificity 93%, the latter value probably reflecting cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses.

With increasing usage, there has been growing concern about the prolongation of QTc interval and Torsades de Pointes (TdP) with HCQ, especially in combination with azithromycin. AIMS: This meta-analysis is planned to study the risk of QTc prolongation and Torsades de pointes (TdP) by a well-defined criterion for HCQ, CQ alone, and in combination with Azithromycin in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was made in two databases (PubMed, Embase). Three outcomes explored in the included studies were frequency of QTc > 500 ms (ms) or &#916;QTc > 60 ms (Outcome 1), frequency of QTc > 500 ms (Outcome 2) and frequency of TdP (Outcome 3). Random effects method with inverse variance approach was used for computation of pooled summary and risk ratio. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies comprising of 2138 patients were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of outcome 1, outcome 2 and outcome 3 for HCQ, CQ with or without Azithromycin were 10.18% (5.59-17.82%, I2 - 92%), 10.22% (6.01-16.85%, I2 - 79%), and 0.72% (0.34-1.51, I2 - 0%) respectively. The prevalence of outcome 2 in subgroup analysis for HCQ and HCQ + Azithromycin was 7.25% (3.22-15.52, I2 - 59%) and 8.61% (4.52-15.79, I2 - 76%), respectively. The risk ratio (RR) for outcome 1 and outcome 2 between HCQ + Azithromycin and HCQ was 1.22 (0.77-1.93, I2 - 0%) & 1.51 (0.79-2.87, I2 - 13%), respectively and was not significant. Heterogeneity was noted statistically as well clinically (regimen types, patient numbers, study design, and outcome definition). CONCLUSION: The use of HCQ/CQ is associated with a high prevalence of QTc prolongation. However, it is not associated with a high risk of TdP.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine and QTc prolongation in patients with COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article analyzes how the neoliberal policies, such as the politics of austerity (with considerable cuts to social policy expenditures including medical care and public health services) and the privatization of health services, imposed by many governments on both sides of the North Atlantic, considerably weakened the capacity of the response to the coronavirus pandemic in Italy, Spain, and the United States.","output":"The Consequences of Neoliberalism in the Current Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus-19 (2019-nCoV or COVID-19) is by far the most dangerous coronavirus ever identified for the third time in the three decades capable of infecting not only the animals but also the humans across the globe.

The molecular target approach to drug screening is widely used in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, because of the amount of knowledge now available regarding protein structure that has been obtained by computer simulation. The molecular target approach requires that the structure of target molecules, and an understanding of their physiological functions, is known. This approach to drug discovery may, however, limit the identification of novel drugs. As an alternative, the phenotypic- or pathway-screening approach to drug discovery is gaining popularity, particularly in the academic sector. This approach not only provides the opportunity to identify promising drug candidates, but also enables novel information regarding biological pathways to be unveiled. Reporter assays are a powerful tool for the phenotypic screening of compound libraries. Of the various reporter genes that can be used in such assays, those encoding secreted proteins enable the screening of hit molecules in both living cells and animals. Cell- and animal-based screens enable simultaneous evaluation of drug metabolism or toxicity with biological activity. Therefore, drug candidates identified in these screens may have increased biological efficacy and a lower risk of side effects in humans.

Recombinant complementary DNA (cDNA) representing gene 9 (the gene encoding the neutralization antigens in VP7 glycoprotein) from OSU (porcine rotavirus serotype 1) and Gottfried (porcine rotavirus serotype 2) strains were used to determine the optimal hybridization conditions which allow specific detection of group A porcine rotaviruses. Probes were prepared by excision of the inserts from the recombinant plasmids and radiolabeling of cDNA with (32)P by the random primer extension method. Probes were hybridized at various stringencies with viral RNA from different rotavirus serotypes bound to nylon membranes. Hybridization at low stringency (26% base pair mismatch for stable hybrid formation) had high sensitivity but low specificity. Hybridization at high stringency (16% base pair mismatch for stable hybrid formation) produced high specificity but decreased the sensitivity observed at low stringency. Probes were specific for rotavirus at both stringencies and did not hybridize with nucleic acids from other porcine viruses. Subgenomic gene 9 fragments were then tested to provide more specific probes. A 322 bp fragment from OSU gene 9 between nucleotides 382 and 704 and a 266 bp fragment from Gottfried gene 9 between nucleotides 230 and 496 were found to be specific as hybridization probes.

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays a key role in post-ischemic immunosuppression. Astragaloside IV (ASIV), isolated from Astragalus membranaceus, possesses immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemic injury. This study investigated the effect of ASIV on cerebral ischemia-induced peripheral immunosuppression and the underlying mechanism in a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Our results showed that ASIV significantly prevented the atrophy of spleen and the reduction of splenic cell count. Meanwhile, ASIV preserved cell numbers of splenic NK, T, and B cells in the spleen. ASIV also suppressed apoptosis of splenic cells and preserved their proliferation ability. In addition, ASIV robustly reduced the mRNA expression of TNF-, IL-1?, IL-6 and CRH in the hypothalamus, as well as the enlargement of adrenal gland and the increase of corticosterone in blood, indicating the inhibition of HPA axis by ASIV. Furthermore, ASIV did not enhance the effect of HPA inhibition on reducing splenic atrophy and preserving splenic NK, T, and B cell numbers in MCAO mice. Of note, ASIV did not attenuate splenic cell apoptosis induced by prednisolone, suggesting that ASIV may ameliorate splenic apoptosis through reducing peripheral glucocorticoid level. Our findings demonstrate that ASIV ameliorates post-ischemic peripheral immunosuppression through inhibiting the activation of HPA axis and targeting HPA activation to ameliorate peripheral immunosuppression may be a promising strategy to improve clinical outcomes of ischemic stroke.","output":"Astragaloside IV ameliorates peripheral immunosuppression induced by cerebral ischemia through inhibiting HPA axis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Score interchangeability of Computerized Fixed-Length Linear Testing (henceforth CFLT) and Paper-and-Pencil-Based Testing (henceforth PPBT) has become a controversial issue over the last decade when technology has meaningfully restructured methods of the educational assessment.

Granular analysis captures the great diversity of possible explanatory factors concealed within any single set of statistics or within clusters of countries.

However, despite decades of research, there are currently no clinically relevant antibacterial drugs targeting any of these enzymes, and there are legitimate concerns about whether they are sufficiently druggable, i.e., whether they can be adequately modulated by small and potent drug-like molecules. In the present work, in silico analyses combining evolutionary conservation and druggability are performed to determine whether these enzymes are candidates for broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. The results presented here indicate that the substrate-binding sites of most enzymes in this pathway are suitable drug targets because of their reasonable conservation and druggability scores. An exception was the substrate-binding site of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase, which was found to be undruggable because of its high content of charged residues and extremely high overall polarity. Although the presented study was designed from the perspective of broad-spectrum antibacterial drug development, this workflow can be readily applied to any antimicrobial target analysis, whether narrow- or broad-spectrum.

Healthcare providers in general practice play an important role in referring smokers to smoking cessation counselling. We chose the Netherlands as a case study to qualitatively explore which factors play a role among healthcare providers in general practice with regard to referral for smoking cessation counselling organised both inside and outside general practice. METHODS: We conducted four focus groups and 18 telephone interviews, with a total of 31 healthcare providers who work in general practice. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify relevant factors related to referral behaviours, and each factor was linked to one of the three main components of the COM-B behaviour model (i.e., capability, opportunity and motivation) as well as the six sub-components of the model. RESULTS: Dutch healthcare providers in general practice typically refer smokers who want to quit to counselling inside their own general practice without actively discussing other counselling options, indicating a lack of shared decision making. The analysis showed that factors linked to the COM-B main components capability and opportunity, such as healthcare providers skills and patients preferences, play a role in whether patients are referred to counselling inside general practice. Factors linked to all three COM-B components were found to play a role in referrals to counselling outside general practice. These included (knowledge of) the availability and quality of counselling in the region, patients requests, reimbursement, and sense of urgency to refer. The identified factors can both act as barriers and facilitators.

In this study, the quality and quantity of air-dried RNA samples from leaf, petiole and bark tissues of different olive genotypes using several RNA extraction methods were compared with lyophilized ground leaves and RNAlater-stored tissue samples before precipitation. The quality of RNA and prepared libraries were checked by several techniques including agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Agilent quality control, RT-PCR amplification of housekeeping and viral genes and high throughput sequencing. RESULTS: Although RNA value varied amongst cultivars, RNA extraction with TRIzol? Reagent in fresh extractions and samples stored in RNAlater before RNA extraction resulted in 455.26 ng/L and 63.46 ng/L (mean value of cultivars) as the highest RNA concentration averages, respectively.

The chloride-bicarbonate exchanger pendrin in ?-intercalated cells, along with sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) in distal convoluted tubules, complementarily regulate sodium chloride handling, which is controlled by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. METHODS: Using mice with mineralocorticoid receptor deletion in intercalated cells, we examined the mechanism and roles of pendrin upregulation via mineralocorticoid receptor in two different models of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation. We also used aldosterone-treated NCC knockout mice to examine the role of pendrin regulation in salt-sensitive hypertension. RESULTS: Deletion of mineralocorticoid receptor in intercalated cells suppressed the increase in renal pendrin expression induced by either exogenous angiotensin II infusion or endogenous angiotensin II upregulation via salt restriction. When fed a low-salt diet, intercalated cell-specific mineralocorticoid receptor knockout mice with suppression of pendrin upregulation showed BP reduction that was attenuated by compensatory activation of NCC. In contrast, upregulation of pendrin induced by aldosterone excess combined with a high-salt diet was scarcely affected by deletion of mineralocorticoid receptor in intercalated cells, but depended instead on hypokalemic alkalosis through the activated mineralocorticoid receptor-epithelial sodium channel cascade in principal cells. In aldosterone-treated NCC knockout mice showing upregulation of pendrin, potassium supplementation corrected alkalosis and inhibited the pendrin upregulation, thereby lowering BP. CONCLUSIONS: In conjunction with NCC, the two pathways of pendrin upregulation, induced by angiotensin II through mineralocorticoid receptor activation in intercalated cells and by alkalosis through mineralocorticoid receptor activation in principal cells, play important roles in fluid homeostasis during salt depletion and salt-sensitive hypertension mediated by aldosterone excess.","output":"Two Mineralocorticoid Receptor-Mediated Mechanisms of Pendrin Activation in Distal Nephrons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To retrospectively evaluate the interobserver variability of intensive care unit (ICU) practitioners and radiologists who used the M-BLUE (modified bedside lung ultrasound in emergency) protocol to assess coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients, and to determine the correlation between total M-BLUE protocol score and three different scoring systems reflecting disease severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained and informed consent was not required. Ninety-six lung ultrasonography (LUS) examinations were performed using the M-BLUE protocol in 79 consecutive COVID-19 patients. Two ICU practitioners and three radiologists reviewed video clips of the LUS of eight different regions in each lung retrospectively. Each observer, who was blind to the patient information, described each clip with M-BLUE terminology and assigned a corresponding score. Interobserver variability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient. Spearman's correlation coefficient analysis (R-value) was used to assess the correlation between the total score of the eight video clips and disease severity. RESULTS: For different LUS signs, fair to good agreement was obtained (ICC = 0.601, 0.339, 0.334, and 0.557 for 0-3 points respectively). The overall interobserver variability was good for both the five different readers and consensus opinions (ICC = 0.618 and 0.607, respectively).

Despite rapid developments in diagnostic methods and therapies, metastasis and resistance to administrated drugs are the main obstacles to successful treatment. Therefore, the main challenge should be the diagnosis and design of optimal therapeutic strategies for patients to increase their chances of responding positively to treatment and increase their life expectancy. In many types of cancer, a deregulation of multiple pathways has been found. This includes disturbances in cellular metabolism, cell cycle, apoptosis, angiogenesis, or epigenetic modifications. Additionally, signals received from the microenvironment may significantly contribute to cancer development. Chemical agents obtained from natural sources seem to be very attractive alternatives to synthetic compounds. They can exhibit similar anti-cancer potential, usually with reduced side effects. It was reported that natural compounds obtained from fruits and vegetables, e.g., polyphenols, flavonoids, stilbenes, carotenoids and acetogenins, might be effective against cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Several published results indicate the activity of natural compounds on protein expression by its influence on transcription factors. They could also be involved in alterations in cellular response, cell signaling and epigenetic modifications. Such natural components could be used in our diet for anti-cancer protection.

Systematic literature searches of PubMed, Embase and Web of Science through October 2021 were conducted for articles reporting AG or DAG levels in obesity and normal weight, and 34 studies with 1863 participants who met the eligibility criteria were identified. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate group differences in circulating AG and DAG levels. Pooled effect size showed significantly lower levels of baseline AG (SMD: ? 0.85; 95% CI: ? 1.13 to ? 0.57; P(SMD) < 0.001) and DAG (SMD: ? 1.06; 95% CI: ? 1.43 to ? 0.69; P(SMD) < 0.001) in obese groups compared with healthy controls, and similar results were observed when subgroup analyses were stratified by the assay technique or storage procedure. Postprandial AG levels in obese subjects were significantly lower than those in controls when stratified by different time points (SMD (30 min): ? 0.85, 95% CI: ? 1.18 to ? 0.53, P(SMD) < 0.001; SMD (60 min): ? 1.00, 95% CI: ? 1.37 to ? 0.63, P(SMD) < 0.001; SMD (120 min): ? 1.21, 95% CI: ? 1.59 to ? 0.83, P(SMD) < 0.001).

A substantial body of research has examined the status and determinants of handwashing facilities in healthcare settings and schools. However, its status at home in the community, especially in developing countries, remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the availability and factors influencing basic handwashing facilities at households in Ethiopia. METHOD: We analysed the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data. EDHS employed a two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique. Data were collected from the lowest administrative unit (kebele). A multivariable logistic regression model that allowed cluster-level random effects was employed to examine factors that affect the availability of basic handwashing facilities (water plus soap) at households. Estimates from the regression model are reported as odds ratios (ORs) with standard errors clustered at the DHS cluster level to account for a sampling methodology. RESULTS: In our sample, only 1292 (8% [95% CI, 7.6%C8.4%]) of the households had basic handwashing facilities. Compared with head of household who had no formal education, the odds of having basic handwashing facilities was higher among head of household who completed secondary level of education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.35C2.49) and higher level of education (AOR = 2.35; 95% CI: 1.63C3.39).

This study aimed to examine coagulation and fibrinolytic responses to short-duration high-intensity exercise when completed at different times of the day. Fifteen male cyclists (VO2max: 60.3  8.1 ml kg-1 min-1) completed a 4-km cycling time trial (TT) on five separate occasions at 0830, 1130, 1430, 1730 and 2030. Venous blood samples were obtained pre- and immediately post-exercise, and analysed for tissue factor (TF), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), thrombin-anti-thrombin complexes (TAT) and D-Dimer. Exercise significantly increased plasma concentrations of TF (p < .0005), TFPI (p < .0006), TAT complexes (p < .0012) and D-Dimer (p < .0003). There was a time-of-day effect in pre-exercise TF (p = .004) and TFPI (p = .031), with 0830 greater than 1730 (p .001), while 1730 was less than 2030 h (p = .008), respectively.

Adoption of this technology over time and current use within the U.S. clinical population has not been well described. METHODS: To assess the growth of capsule endoscopy within the U.S. Medicare provider population (absolute growth and on a population-adjusted basis), characterize the providers performing VCE, and describe potential regional differences in use. Medicare summary data from 2003 to 2019 were used to retrospectively analyze capsule endoscopy use in a multiple cross-sectional design. In addition, detailed provider summary files were used from 2012 to 2018 to characterize provider demographics. RESULTS: VCE use grew rapidly from 2003 to 2008 followed by a plateau from 2008 to 2019. There was significant variation in use of VCE between states, with up to 10-fold variation between states (14.6 to 156.1 per 100,000 enrollees in 2018). During this time, the adjusted VCE use on a population-adjusted basis declined, reflecting saturation of growth. CONCLUSIONS: Growth of VCE use over time follows an S-shaped diffusion of innovation curve demonstrating a successful diffusion of innovation within gastroenterology. The lack of additional growth since 2008 suggests that current levels of use are well matched to overall population need within the constraints of reimbursement. Future studies should examine whether this lack of growth has implications for access and healthcare inequities.

In this regard, the supply chain of healthcare centers should put all of their efforts into avoiding any shortages of masks and shields as these products are considered as primary ways to prevent the spread of the virus. Since, any shortages in these products would lead to irrecoverable and costly consequences in terms of the mortality rate of patients and medical staff. Therefore, healthcare centers should decide on best supplier to supply required products, considering technical, and sustainability measures. Dynamicity and uncertainty of the pandemic are other factors that add up to the complexity of the supplier selection problem. Therefore, this paper develops a novel decision-making approach using Measuring attractiveness through a categorical-based evaluation technique (MACBETH) and a new combinative distance-based assessment method to address the supplier selection problem during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to high uncertainty, vague and incomplete information for decision-making problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, the developed decision-making approach is implemented under fuzzy rough numbers as a superior uncertainty set of the traditional fuzzy set and rough numbers. Extensive sensitivity analysis tests are performed based on parameters of the decision-making approach, impacts of weight coefficients, and consistency of results in comparison to other MCDM methods. A real-life case study is investigated for a hospital in Istanbul, Turkey to show the applicability of the developed approach. Based on the results of MACBETH method, job creation and occupational health and safety systems are two top criteria.

We aimed to explore the effect and regulatory mechanism of hsa-miR-142-3p on collagen I in human scleral fibroblasts in high myopia. First, next-generation sequencing was conducted to identify 37 miRNAs differentially expressed in the aqueous humor of high myopia samples and control samples. Furthermore, hsa-miR-142-3p in the aqueous humor was found to positively relate to the ocular axial length. Besides, the results of immunofluorescence and Western blot assay indicated that hsa-miR-142-3p overexpression decreased collagen I expression in the human fetal scleral fibroblasts (HFSFs); while hsa-miR-142-3p downregulation increased collagen I. Moreover, hsa-miR-142-3p targets TGF-1 gene expression. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot analysis showed that miRNA 142-3p reduced TGF-1 expression while an inhibitor had an opposite effect. Therefore, there is an inverse relationship between changes in miR-142-3p expression levels and those of collagen1a1 in human scleral fibroblasts.

This disease mainly affects the respiratory system of the patients and can lead to pneumonia and to severe cases of acute respiratory syndrome that result in the formation of several pathological structures in the lungs. These pathological structures can be explored taking advantage of chest X-ray imaging. As a recommendation for the health services, portable chest X-ray devices should be used instead of conventional fixed machinery, in order to prevent the spread of the pathogen. However, portable devices present several problems (specially those related with capture quality). Moreover, the subjectivity and the fatigue of the clinicians lead to a very difficult diagnostic process. To overcome that, computer-aided methodologies can be very useful even taking into account the lack of available samples that the COVID-19 affectation shows. In this work, we propose an improvement in the performance of COVID-19 screening, taking advantage of several cycle generative adversarial networks to generate useful and relevant synthetic images to solve the lack of COVID-19 samples, in the context of poor quality and low detail datasets obtained from portable devices. For validating this proposal for improved COVID-19 screening, several experiments were conducted. The results demonstrate that this data augmentation strategy improves the performance of a previous COVID-19 screening proposal, achieving an accuracy of 98.61% when distinguishing among NON-COVID-19 (i.e. normal control samples and samples with pathologies others than COVID-19) and genuine COVID-19 samples.

In the paper, empirical research is presented with the aim of identifying the quality of online teaching among the students at selected secondary vocational schools. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Distance Education Technologies and the Present Situation Influenced by the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with high intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Canadian setting. METHODS We conducted a retrospective case series of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection consecutively admitted to 1 of 6 ICUs in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, between Feb. 21 and Apr. 14, 2020. Demographic, management and outcome data were collected by review of patient charts and electronic medical records. RESULTS Between Feb. 21 and Apr. 14, 2020, 117 patients were admitted to the ICU with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The median age was 69 (interquartile range [IQR] 60-75) years, and 38 (32.5%) were female. At least 1 comorbidity was present in 86 (73.5%) patients. Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 74 (63.2%) patients. The duration of mechanical ventilation was 13.5 (IQR 8-22) days overall and 11 (IQR 6-16) days for patients successfully discharged from the ICU. Tocilizumab was administered to 4 patients and hydroxychloroquine to 1 patient. As of May 5, 2020, a total of 18 (15.4%) patients had died, 12 (10.3%) remained in the ICU, 16 (13.7%) were discharged from the ICU but remained in hospital, and 71 (60.7%) were discharged home. INTERPRETATION In our setting, mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU was lower than in previously published studies. These data suggest that the prognosis associated with critical illness due to COVID-19 may not be as poor as previously reported.","output":"Baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units in Vancouver, Canada: a case series."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study is conducted to determine the status of e-learning, student satisfaction and the relationship between these two variables in Zahedan University of Medical Sciences (ZAUMS).

However, age groupings used to record and report health data vary greatly, hindering the harmonisation, comparability, and usefulness of these data, within and across countries. This variability has become especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, when there was an urgent need for rapid cross-country analyses of epidemiological patterns by age to direct public health action, but such analyses were limited by the lack of standard age categories. In this Personal View, we propose a recommended set of age groupings to address this issue. These groupings are informed by age-specific patterns of morbidity, mortality, and health risks, and by opportunities for prevention and disease intervention. We recommend age groupings of 5 years for all health data, except for those younger than 5 years, during which time there are rapid biological and physiological changes that justify a finer disaggregation. Although the focus of this Personal View is on the standardisation of the analysis and display of age groups, we also outline the challenges faced in collecting data on exact age, especially for health facilities and surveillance data. The proposed age disaggregation should facilitate targeted, age-specific policies and actions for health care and disease management.","output":"A call for standardised age-disaggregated health data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pumpkin is an important vegetable, which has potential to be used as medicinal and functional food.

However, there are no effective drugs to prevent and treat the disease. Transcriptome-based drug repositioning, identifying new indications for old drugs, is a powerful tool for drug development. Using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid transcriptome data of COVID-19 patients, we found that the endocytosis and lysosome pathways are highly involved in the disease and that the regulation of genes involved in neutrophil degranulation was disrupted, suggesting an intense battle between SARS-CoV-2 and humans. Furthermore, we implemented a coexpression drug repositioning analysis, cogena, and identified two antiviral drugs (saquinavir and ribavirin) and several other candidate drugs (such as dinoprost, dipivefrine, dexamethasone and (-)-isoprenaline). Notably, the two antiviral drugs have also previously been identified using molecular docking methods, and ribavirin is a recommended drug in the diagnosis and treatment protocol for COVID pneumonia (trial version 5C7) published by the National Health Commission of the P.R. of China. Our study demonstrates the value of the cogena-based drug repositioning method for emerging infectious diseases, improves our understanding of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease, and provides potential drugs for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"Transcriptome-based drug repositioning for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Identifying metabolic factors associated with critical disease can help to improve management of patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). High triglycerides and low HDL levels characterize the atherogenic dyslipidemia closely related to insulin resistance and diabetes. We examined associations of atherogenic dyslipidemia detected on admission with outcome of COVID-19 during hospitalization. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical reports of 118 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Rome, Italy, between March and May 2020. Clinical characteristics, inflammation markers, and glucose and lipid metabolism parameters at admission were collected. Critical disease was defined as in-hospital death or need for endotracheal intubation. Associations were tested using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Patients with critical COVID-19 (n = 43) were significantly older than those with noncritical disease (n = 75) and presented higher levels of fasting glucose, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, procalcitonin, and d-dimer (P < 0.01 for all), whereas HDL levels were lower (P = 0.003). Atherogenic dyslipidemia was more frequent in patients with critical COVID-19 (46 vs. 24%, P = 0.011), as well as diabetes (37 vs. 19%, P = 0.026), and significantly associated with death or intubation (odds ratio 2.53 [95% CI 1.16-6.32], P = 0.018). Triglycerides were significantly associated with selected inflammatory biomarkers (P < 0.05 for all) and poorer outcome of COVID-19 during hospitalization in both the overall population and the subgroup with atherogenic dyslipidemia. CONCLUSIONS: Atherogenic dyslipidemia detected on admission can be associated with critical in-hospital course of COVID-19. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the hypothetical role of insulin resistance and related lipid abnormalities in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pathogenesis. Assessment of lipid profile should be encouraged in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.","output":"Atherogenic Dyslipidemia on Admission Is Associated With Poorer Outcome in People With and Without Diabetes Hospitalized for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Theoretical calculations have been performed in order to investigate the impact of different substitution patterns on predicted photoreactivity of alkoxyamines fused to an anthraquinone chromophore.

Analogous to formally oxidized alkoxyamines, the charge-separated nN&#960;* state can undergo mesolytic cleavage or bimolecular or SN2 reactions with nucleophiles, according to the substitution patterns and other reagents present. While homolytic cleavage is in principle promoted by triplet &#960;&#960;* states, the accessible &#960;&#960;* triplet states in this system are centered on the chromophore and unreactive. We show that the reactive nN&#960;* state, which bears a negative charge, is stabilized by hydroxy substitution while amino substitution will destabilize it.

Using the lower bound on the outbreak size at the origin, we establish an upper bound on the outbreak size at the importing locality as a function of the speed of spread and the level of preparedness for the low mobility regime. We evaluate the critical levels of preparedness that stop the disease from spreading at the importing locality. Finally, we show how the benefit of preparedness diminishes under high mobility rates.

The aim of this study was to investigate if adverse MC predicts all\\\\cause mortality using data from UK Biobank. METHODS: There were 40 178 participants scanned using a 6 min magnetic resonance imaging protocol. Images were analysed for thigh fat\\\\tissue free muscle volume and muscle fat infiltration (MFI) using AMRA? Researcher (AMRA Medical, Link?ping, Sweden). For each participant, a sex, weight, and height invariant muscle volume z\\\\score was calculated. Participants were partitioned into four MC groups: (i) normal MC, (ii) only low muscle volume [<25th percentile for muscle volume z\\\\score (population wide)], (iii) only high MFI [>75th percentile (population wide, sex\\\\specific)], and (iv) adverse MC (low muscle volume z\\\\score and high MFI). Association of MC groups with mortality was investigated using Cox proportional\\\\hazard modelling with normal MC as referent (unadjusted and adjusted for low hand grip strength, sex, age, body mass index, previous diagnosis of disease (cancer, type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease), lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and Townsend deprivation index). RESULTS: Muscle composition measurements were complete for 39 804 participants [52% female, mean (SD) age 64.2 (7.6) years and body mass index 26.4 (4.4) kg/m(2)]. Three hundred twenty\\\\eight deaths were recorded during a follow\\\\up period of 2.9 (1.4) years after imaging. At imaging, adverse MC was detected in 10.5% of participants. The risk of death from any cause in adverse MC compared with normal MC was 3.71 (95% confidence interval 2.81C4.91, P < 0.001). Only low muscle volume and only high MFI were independently associated with all\\\\cause mortality [1.58 (1.13C2.21), P = 0.007, and 2.02 (1.51C2.71), P < 0.001, respectively]. Adjustment of low hand grip strength [1.77 (1.28C2.44), P < 0.001] did not attenuate the associations with any of the MC groups. In the fully adjusted model, adverse MC and only high MFI remained significant (P < 0.001 and P = 0.020) while the association with only low muscle volume was attenuated to non\\\\significance (P = 0.560). The predictive performance of adverse MC [1.96 (1.42C2.71), P < 0.001] was comparable with that of previous cancer diagnosis [1.93 (1.47C2.53), P < 0.001] and smoking [1.71 (1.02C2.84), P = 0.040].

One promising biomarker for in-hospital morbidity and mortality is cardiac troponin (cTn). METHODS: A retrospective study of 1331 adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Rush University System in Illinois, USA was performed. Patients without cTn measurement during their admission or a history of end stage renal disease or stage 5 chronic kidney disease were excluded. Using logistic regression adjusted for baseline characteristics, pre-existing comorbidities, and other laboratory markers of inflammation, cTn was assessed as a predictor of 60-day mortality and severe COVID-19 infection, consisting of a composite of 60-day mortality, need for intensive care unit, or requiring non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or intubation. RESULTS: A total of 772 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 69 (8.9%) had mild cTn elevation (> 1 to < 2x upper limit of normal (ULN)) and 46 (6.0%) had severe cTn elevation ( 2x ULN). Regardless of baseline characteristics, comorbidities, and initial c-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin, when compared to the normal cTn group, mild cTn elevation and severe cTn elevation were predictors of severe COVID-19 infection (adjusted OR [aOR] aOR 3.00 [CI: 1.51 C 6.29], p < 0.01; aOR 9.96 [CI: 2.75 C 64.23], p < 0.01, respectively); severe cTn elevation was a predictor of in-hospital mortality (aOR 2.42 [CI: 1.10 C 5.21], p < 0.05) and 60-day mortality (aOR 2.45 [CI: 1.13 C 5.25], p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In our cohort, both mild and severe initial cTn elevation were predictors of severe COVID-19 infection, while only severe cTn elevation was predictive of 60-day mortality.

One key trend is the shift from household-based to primarily out-of-home food consumption as an increasing majority of the urban poor derive their daily nutrient intake from street foods. However, few studies have yet explored the role of the ready-to-eat food vending sector in urban food systems and the diets of the urban poor. This paper investigates the interrelations between these practices and the diversity of food groups provisioned among the urban poor in developing city contexts. A social practice approach is employed to explore differentiation among informal-ready-to-eat food vending practices in the city of Ibadan, Nigeria, in terms of their daily activities, competences and resources. Applied methods include GIS mapping, food log diaries, in-depth interviews and participant observation to map and classify informal-ready-to-eat food vending practices according to the nature of food provisioned and explore the everyday performances of different informal-ready-to-eat food vending practice initiatives and their relation to dietary diversity. The results reveal three key categories among these practices: traditional, processed and unprocessedwith varying levels of diversity in the food groups on offer. Traditional food vendors offer more diversified food compared to processed food vendors and unprocessed food vendors. The results reveal that material infrastructure, cooking bargaining and purchasing skills and nutritional knowledge are key to the diversity of food groups provisioned.

Various studies have hypothesized the possible role of CD39 in COVID-19 pathophysiology since no confirmatory data shed light in this regard. Therefore, we aimed to quantify CD39 expression on COVID-19 patients exploring its association with severity clinical parameters and ICU admission, while unraveling the role of purinergic signaling on thromboinflammation in COVID-19 patients. We selected a prospective cohort of patients hospitalized due to severe COVID-19 pneumonia (n=75), a historical cohort of Influenza A pneumonia patients (n=18) and sex/age-matched healthy controls (n=30). CD39 was overexpressed in COVID-19 patients plasma and immune cell subsets and related to hypoxemia. Plasma soluble form of CD39 (sCD39) was related to length of hospital stay and independently associated with intensive care unit admission (adjusted odds ratio 1.04, 95%CI 1.0-1.08, p=0.038), with a net reclassification index of 0.229 (0.118-0.287; p=0.036). COVID-19 patients showed extracellular accumulation of adenosine nucleotides (ATP and ADP), resulting in systemic inflammation and pro-coagulant state, as a consequence of purinergic pathway dysregulation. Interestingly, we found that COVID-19 plasma caused platelet activation, which was successfully blocked by the P2Y(12) receptor inhibitor, ticagrelor. Therefore, sCD39 is suggested as a promising biomarker for COVID-19 severity.

Purposive and chain referral sampling techniques were used to recruit 368 respondents from various sectors of the profession. The proportion of respondents surveyed 197/368 (53.5 %) were from the public sector, 35.3 % from private sector, 1.1 % were unemployed and 0.8 % retired. Majority of the respondents were males (72.8 %), within 30 C39 years (39.7 %) and had 1 C10 years work experience. Respondents displayed good level of knowledge about COVID-19 (72.4 % 9.9 %, range 44.1-91.2 %), with information mostly derived from TV/Radio (81.5%) and social media (81.0 %). The overall attitude level was poor and various determinants for good attitude among respondents were if they were above 60 years (p = 0.013), possessed postgraduate qualification ( p = 0.031), worked over 30 years post DVM (p = 0.001), had household members between 5 and 10 (p = 0.012), and were resident in states on total lockdown (p = 0.024).

In the present study, we retrieved a total number of 176 complete and high-quality S glycoprotein sequences of Iranian SARS-COV-2 in public database of the GISAID and GenBank from April 2020 up to May 2021. Then, we identified the number of variables, singleton and parsimony informative sites at both gene and protein levels and discussed the possible functional consequences of important mutations on the infectivity and response to neutralizing antibodies. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to represent the relationship between Iranian SARS-COV2 and variants of concern (VOC), variants of interest (VOI) and reference sequence. We found that the four current VOCs C Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta - are circulated in different regions in Iran. The Delta variant is notably more transmissible than other variants, and is expected to become a dominant variant. However, some of the Delta variants in Iran carry an additional mutation, namely E1202Q in the HR2 subdomain that might confer an advantage to viral/cell membrane fusion process. We also observed some more common mutations such as an N-terminal domain (NTD) deletion at position I210 and P863H in fusion peptide-heptad repeat 1 span region in Iranian SARS-COV-2.

Although the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic necessitated cancellation of all in-person events across the university, the neonatal nurse practitioner students' learning needs remained the same. METHOD The onsite experience was redesigned for virtual delivery. Procedural content was accomplished through student-led small-group collaborative critical thinking activities surrounding procedural complications, and other faculty-led scenario discussions. RESULTS Students collaborated for a Complications Rounds activity (1-day) that promoted learning about procedural skills from a global perspective including safe techniques, monitoring, risks, and troubleshooting complications. CONCLUSION Procedural content can be achieved when in-person learning is not possible. The Complications Rounds approach can mitigate delays or gaps in practical experiences. Examining complications in-depth increases preparedness, promoting greater awareness of harm prevention when these present in future practice.

It is reported that at least 7000 health care workers (HCW) had lost their lives due to COVID-19 from the beginning of the pandemia till September 2020 in the world. In our country between the dates, March 11, 2020 which the first case was reported, and September 1, 2020, the date which our study has been finalized, 7428 HCW were infected by SARS-CoV-2, and 52 of them were deceased. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the contact and illness of healthcare workers working outside of the pandemic clinics in our hospital and to examine the possible transmission routes and disease prognoses. Healthcare workers who were working outside the pandemic service between March 11, 2020 and September 1, 2020 and who had a definite diagnosis of COVID-19 and all hospital staff who had contacted with these people, and HCW who had contact with patients diagnosed with COVID-19 while receiving inpatient treatment in services other than the pandemic service was evaluated and classified as low, medium and high risk according to the risk scoring defined in the published \\"Ministry of Health COVID-19 Guidelines\\". Healthcare workers who were evaluated as contacted were questioned in detail regarding the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) at the time of contact, especially suitability of the masks, contact time and shape and all the data were recorded. A total of 53 index cases (40 HCW and 13 inpatients diagnosed as COVID-19) were detected during the study period. The number of HCW contacted with these index cases was 672. In our study, we examined the data of 40 index cases and 672 contacted HCW (total of 712 HCW). Only 3 of 40 index cases (7.5%) had hospital-acquired COVID-19 infection, the other 37 cases were infected by community sources. COVID-19 was not detected in 94.2% of the contacted HCW during the follow-up while 5.8% of them had positive PCR test results. Considering the possible way of contamination among the contacted HCW who developed COVID-19 during the follow-up period, it was determined that 13.1% of the cases were a result of taken care of patients, 86.9% of the cases were a result of being in hospital social environments (drinking tea, smoking, eating, chatting in the same room without personal precautions) and in the days after the contact, it was in the form of contact with healthcare personnel diagnosed with COVID-19. When the contacted HCW were questioned about using proper masks at the time of contact, we determined that 93.3% of them used masks during patient caring procedures, however, only 48.9% used masks when they were in social areas (p<0.001). Healthcare workers face an unprecedented risk of occupational disease and death due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is also observed that prolonged pandemia period caused health workers to disregard rigorous infection control precautions in social areas of hospitals which they follow inpatient care although this has shown to be the most common way of contamination. Commonly performed in-service training and causing awareness in all areas of the hospital about following infection control precautions and PPE usage and checking the process regularly are the most important ways to prevent HCW from being affected by COVID-19.","output":"[Evaluation of Healthcare Professionals in Contact with Patients Diagnosed with COVID-19 Detected Outside of the Pandemic Service in our Hospital]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 has triggered global panic.

Basically, they break the hydrogen bonding between the duplex helix and translocate unidirectionally along the bound strand. Mostly all the helicases contain some conserved signature motifs, which act as an engine to power the unwinding. After the discovery of the first prokaryotic DNA helicase from Escherichia coli bacteria in 1976 and the first eukaryotic one from the lily plant in 1978, many more (>100) have been isolated. All the helicases share some common properties, including nucleic acid binding, NTP hydrolysis and unwinding of the duplex. Many helicases have been crystallized and their structures have revealed an underlying common structural fold for their function. The defects in helicases gene have also been reported to be responsible for variety of human genetic disorders, which can lead to cancer, premature aging or mental retardation. Recently, a new role of a helicase in abiotic stress signaling in plant has been discovered.

Although the COVID-19 survival rate is high, the number of severe cases that result in death is increasing daily. A timely prediction of at-risk patients of COVID-19 with precautionary measures is expected to increase the survival rate of patients and reduce the fatality rate. This research provides a prediction method for the early identification of COVID-19 patient's outcome based on patients' characteristics monitored at home, while in quarantine. The study was performed using 287 COVID-19 samples of patients from the King Fahad University Hospital, Saudi Arabia. The data were analyzed using three classification algorithms, namely, logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). Initially, the data were preprocessed using several preprocessing techniques. Furthermore, 10-k cross-validation was applied for data partitioning and SMOTE for alleviating the data imbalance. Experiments were performed using twenty clinical features, identified as significant for predicting the survival versus the deceased COVID-19 patients. The results showed that RF outperformed the other classifiers with an accuracy of 0.95 and area under curve (AUC) of 0.99. The proposed model can assist the decision-making and health care professional by early identification of at-risk COVID-19 patients effectively.

This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between chest computed tomography (CT) scan findings and outcomes of COVID-19 cases. Methods This cross sectional study was carried out on confirmed COVID-19 cases with clinical manifestations and chest CT scan findings based on Iran's National Guidelines for defining COVID-19. Baseline and chest CT scan characteristics of patients were investigated and their correlation with mortality was analyzed and reported using SPSS 21.0. Results 380 patients with the mean age of 53.62  16.66 years were evaluated (66.1% male). The most frequent chest CT scan abnormalities were in peripheral (86.6%) and peribronchovascular interstitium (34.6%), with ground glass pattern (54.1%), and round (53.6%) or linear (46.7%) shape. There was a significant correlation between shape of abnormalities (p = 0.003), CT scan Severity Score (CTSS) (p <0.0001), and pulmonary artery CT diameter (p = 0. 01) with mortality. The mean CTSS of non-survived cases was significantly higher (13.68  4.59 versus 8.72  4.42; <0.0001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of CTSS in predicting the patients' mortality was 0.800 (95% CI: 0.716-0.884). The best cut off point of chest CTSS in this regard was 12 with 75.82% (95% CI: 56.07%-88.98%) sensitivity and 75.78% (95% CI: 70.88%-80.10%) specificity.

METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TCZ versus placebo/control, for treatment of adults with COVID-19. Primary outcome was 28-30 days all-cause mortality. Search was conducted up to April 1st 2021. Two independent reviewers screened citations, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled. We performed subgroup analysis for patients with critical illness and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included, assessing 6,481 patients with mostly severe non-critical COVID-19 infection. TCZ was associated with a reduction in all-cause 28-30-day mortality compared to placebo/control (RR = 0.89, 95%CI 0.82-0.96). Among the subgroup of critically ill patients no reduced mortality was demonstrated (RR = 0.94, 95%CI 0.74-1.19). No mortality benefit with TCZ was demonstrated in trials that used steroids for >80% of patients. TCZ was associated with significantly reduced risk for mechanical ventilation (MV); for combined endpoint of death or MV; and for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. No significant difference in adverse events was demonstrated. Risk of serious superinfection was significantly lower with TCZ (RR = 0.57, 95%CI 0.35-0.93).

Evidence from Africa indicates that significantly less COVID-19 patients suffer from serious symptoms than in the industrialized world. We and others previously postulated a partial explanation for this phenomenon, being a different, more activated immune system due to parasite infections. Here, we aimed to test this hypothesis by investigating a potential correlation of co-infection with parasites with COVID-19 severity in an endemic area in Africa. Methods: Ethiopian COVID-19 patients were enrolled and screened for intestinal parasites, between July 2020 and March 2021. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe COVID-19. Ordinal logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between parasite infection, and COVID-19 severity. Models were adjusted for sex, age, residence, education level, occupation, body mass index, and comorbidities. Findings: 751 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were enrolled, of whom 284 (37.8%) had intestinal parasitic infection. Only 27/255 (10.6%) severe COVID-19 patients were co-infected with intestinal parasites, while 257/496 (51.8%) non-severe COVID-19 patients were parasite positive (p<0.0001). Patients co-infected with parasites had lower odds of developing severe COVID-19, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.23 (95% CI 0.17C0.30; p<0.0001) for all parasites, aOR 0.37 ([95% CI 0.26C0.51]; p<0.0001) for protozoa, and aOR 0.26 ([95% CI 0.19C0.35]; p<0.0001) for helminths. When stratified by species, co-infection with Entamoeba spp., Hymenolepis nana, Schistosoma mansoni, and Trichuris trichiura implied lower probability of developing severe COVID-19. There were 11 deaths (1.5%), and all were among patients without parasites (p = 0.009). Interpretation: Parasite co-infection is associated with a reduced risk of severe COVID-19 in African patients.

We discuss that while a model can be biased against certain protected groups (i.e., perform worse) in certain tasks, it can be at the same time biased towards another protected group (i.e., perform better). As such, current bias evaluation studies may lack a full depiction of the variable effects of a model on its subpopulations. If the goal is to make a change in a positive way, the underlying roots of bias need to be fully explored in medical AI.

We designed and implemented the CLoud-based Applications Speed Platform (CLASP) to measure performance to various networks from virtual machines in cloud regions with speed test servers that have been widely deployed on the Internet. In our five-month longitudinal measurements in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), we found that 30-70% of ISPs we measured showed severe throughput degradation from the peak throughput of the day. ? 2021 ACM.","output":"Measuring the network performance of Google cloud platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genome-wide transcriptional profiling provides a global view of cellular state and how this state changes under different treatments (e.g. drugs) or conditions (e.g. healthy and diseased).

ProTINA uses a dynamic model of the cell-type specific proteinCgene transcriptional regulation to infer network perturbations from steady state and time-series differential gene expression profiles. A candidate protein target is scored based on the gene network's dysregulation, including enhancement and attenuation of transcriptional regulatory activity of the protein on its downstream genes, caused by drug treatments. For benchmark datasets from three drug treatment studies, ProTINA was able to provide highly accurate protein target predictions and to reveal the mechanism of action of compounds with high sensitivity and specificity. Further, an application of ProTINA to gene expression profiles of influenza A viral infection led to new insights of the early events in the infection.","output":"Network perturbation analysis of gene transcriptional profiles reveals protein targets and mechanism of action of drugs and influenza A viral infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Recombinant human growth hormone has been used for more than 30 years and its indications have increased worldwide. There is concern that this treatment might increase mortality, but published data are scarce. We present data from the entire dataset of all eight countries of the Safety and Appropriateness of Growth hormone treatments in Europe (SAGhE) consortium, with the aim of studying long-term overall and cause-specific mortality in young adult patients treated with recombinant human growth hormone during childhood and relating this to the underlying diagnosis. METHODS This cohort study was done in eight European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK). Patients were classified a priori based on pre-treatment perceived mortality risk from their underlying disease and followed up for cause-specific mortality. Person-years at risk of mortality and expected rates from general population data were used to calculate standardised mortality ratios (SMRs). FINDINGS The cohort comprised 24 232 patients treated with recombinant human growth hormone during childhood, with more than 400 000 patient-years of follow-up. In low-risk patients with isolated growth hormone deficiency or idiopathic short stature, all-cause mortality was not significantly increased (SMR 11, 95% CI 09-13). In children born small for gestational age, all-cause mortality was significantly increased when analysed for all countries (SMR 15, CI 11-19), but this result was driven by the French subcohort. In patients at moderate or high risk, mortality was increased (SMR 38, 33-44; and 171, 156-187, respectively). Mortality was not associated with mean daily or cumulative doses of recombinant human growth hormone for any of the risk groups. Cause-specific mortality from diseases of the circulatory and haematological systems was increased in all risk groups. INTERPRETATION In this cohort, the largest, to our knowledge, with long-term follow-up of patients treated with recombinant human growth hormone during childhood, all-cause mortality was associated with underlying diagnosis. In patients with isolated growth hormone deficiency or idiopathic short stature, recombinant human growth hormone treatment was not associated with increased all-cause mortality. However, mortality from certain causes was increased, emphasising the need for further long-term surveillance.

Today, more than before, the health emergency due to the Covid-19 pandemy has pointed out the importance of the relationship among public space, quality of life and health. Public and semi-private spaces, especially in high-dense cities and in the most affected areas by Covid-19, represent a strong driver both for restarting and for helping cities to face the new normal age. Despite the advancement of research during the past two decades and empirical evidence about the relationship among quality of open spaces, quality of life and urban sustainability, there is still a lack of studies on how to measure the quality of open spaces. Among the several research lines, the Urban Design approach across its evolution has always focused on it, starting from aesthetic as well as technical issues and increasingly including the social and economic ones. The current paper proposes an integrated approach supported by Geographic Information System (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) able to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the quality of open spaces under the Urban Design perspective. In detail, the issue of urban quality has been divided into 5 criteria and 12 sub-criteria which consider both the characteristics of the built environment and its organization and the perception of users. The evaluation process has been structured according to the traditional steps C Intelligence, Design and Choice C and it has been applied to three different areas in the city of Milan, in order to achieve a broad measurement of urban quality with respect to various urban locations. Whats new in this research is the spatialization of the urban quality scores and their assessment based on specific value functions, that shows potentials for future implementations in the sphere of urban planning, where the proposed evaluation approach could be applied with different purposes: an evaluation model for supporting public and private planning agreements by the use of value maps;a companion guide with operational recommendations for open spaces design;a model to estimate the marginal price of the urban quality through hedonic price analyses. ? 2021, Dei Tipografia del Genio Civile.

An early diagnosis combined with optimal management offers the prospect, at least in some patients, of curing a condition previously considered irreversible. However, unlike in adults, until now no international paediatric guidelines existed. The recently published European Respiratory Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of children and adolescents with bronchiectasis attempts to address this clinical information gap. The guidelines were formulated by panel members comprised of experts from several relevant health fields, the European Lung Foundation and parents of children with bronchiectasis. Systematic reviews and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach guided the nature and strength of recommendations. The recommendations are grouped into clinically relevant topics: diagnosis, evaluating for underlying causes, defining exacerbations, management, systematic care, monitoring, reversibility and prevention. The guidelines seek to achieve: 1) optimal lung growth, 2) preserved lung function, 3) enhanced quality of life, 4) minimal exacerbations, 5) few or no complications, and 6) if possible, reversal of lung injury for each child/adolescent with bronchiectasis.

METHODS The survey questionnaire was designed by a team of experts based on a review of the literature and was distributed electronically through the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties to residents registered in all radiology residency training programs in Saudi Arabia during the academic year 2019 to 2020. Categorical variables were presented as counts and percentage. Numerical variables were presented as mean and standard deviation if normally distributed. Chi-square testing was used to compare categorical variables with the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Spearman correlation was used to correlate numerical variables at the level of significance p-value < 0.05. RESULTS A total of 109 residents completed the online survey during the study period, with a response rate of 32.2% (109/337). The mean age was 27.3 years (standard deviation, 1.86). The majority of respondents (71.5%, 78/109) reported either a severe or moderate negative impact on educational activities. Also, the majority (73.4%, 80/109) reported either a minimal or moderate negative impact on clinical activities. Residents training in the western province perceived a statistically higher negative impact on educational activities compared to their peers in other regions (p = 0.01). Residents in their second year of residency training perceived a statistically higher negative impact on their participation in clinical activities (p = 0.014). Less than half of the respondents (45.9%, 50/109) reported that they were redeployed to work in another department. The majority (80%, 40/50) reported a negative impact on their well-being.

We assessed the serum neutralizing antibody (NAb) activity against Omicron variant (Omicron NAb) among recovered COVID-19 patients with or without vaccination. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study with 135 recovered COVID-19 patients, we determined the serum NAb titers against ancestral virus or variants using a live virus NAb assay. We used the receiver operating characteristic analysis to determine the optimal cutoff for a commercially-available surrogate NAb assay. FINDINGS: Among recovered COVID-19 patients, the serum live virus geometric mean Omicron NAb titer was statistically significantly higher among BNT162b2 recipients compared to non-vaccinated individuals (85.4 vs 5.6,P < 0.0001). The Omicron seropositive rates in live virus NAb test (NAb titer 10) were statistically significantly higher among BNT162b2 (90.6% [29/32];P < 0.0001) or CoronaVac (36.7% [11/30]; P = 0.0115) recipients when compared with non-vaccinated individuals (12.3% [9/73]). Subgroup analysis of CoronaVac recipients showed that the Omicron seropositive rates were higher among individuals with two doses than those with one dose (85.7% vs 21.7%; P = 0.0045). For the surrogate NAb assay, a cutoff of 109.1 AU/ml, which is 7.3-fold higher than the manufacturer's recommended cutoff, could achieve a sensitivity and specificity of 89.5% and 89.8%, respectively, in detecting Omicron NAb. INTERPRETATION: Among individuals with prior COVID-19, one dose of BNT162b2 or two doses of CoronaVac could induce detectable serum Omicron NAb.

Retrospective studies, which have primarily been case reports and small case series, suggest that pneumothoraces may occur in 1-2% of patients with Covid-19. This potentially lethal complication is thought to more likely occur in mechanically ventilated patients and those with underlying lung disease. Our aim is to characterize the risk factor in patients hospitalized for Covid-19 who developed pneumothoraces. METHODS We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with COVID-19 admitted at 5 hospitals within the Inova Health System between March 1, 2020 and May 21, 2020. Out of the 1619 hospitalized patients with Covid-19, 22 patients (1.4%) developed pneumothorax. Data on demographic, comorbidities, inflammatory markers, ventilatory mode and treatment methods were collected. Findings are displayed in Table 1. RESULTS The median length of stay was 18.5 days with the diagnosis of pneumothorax made between days 1 and 30 of hospitalization. All pneumothoraces were diagnosed on chest x-ray, with the most common reason for obtaining chest imaging being respiratory distress and worsening hypoxia. 10 patients developed left-sided pneumothorax, 11 patients developed right-sided pneumothorax and 1 patient developed bilateral pneumothoraces. 8 out of the 22 patients (36%) died, whereas the crude mortality of all patients admitted with Covid-19 during this time span was 15.8%. The median age of our cohort was 60 years and 82% were male. Majority of the patients were Latino. The most common comorbidities in this cohort included hypertension (52%) and diabetes (32%). Notably, only 19% of the patients had underlying lung pathology such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Less than half of the patients who had pneumothoraces were ventilated. 16 (73%) patients had chest tubes placed for treatment. CONCLUSION The marked inflammatory response, fibrosis, and need for positive pressure ventilation in Covid-19 pneumonia are likely contributory to the development of pneumothorax. Unlike most cases of pneumothoraces, the etiology in patients with Covid-19 appears to be multifactorial and not directly associated with high vent settings. This is supported by the fact that many patients in our patients were on nasal cannula at time of diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial to mitigate morbidity and mortality in this population.","output":"Spontaneous pneumothorax as a complication of covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to healthcare workers increases during aerosol-generating procedures such as endotracheal intubation. Objectives We tested the effectiveness of a novel barrier mouthpiece in reducing clinician exposure to aerosols and droplets during endotracheal intubation. Design A prospective case control study was carried out, with a single operator performing eight simulated intubations with and without the device on two different high-fidelity manikin models which produced aerosols and droplets. Setting The study was performed during June 2020, at the Clinical Skills Development Service, Brisbane, Australia. Interventions Simulated scenarios included 1) intubation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation 2) intubation while pre-oxygenating via high flow nasal cannula. Photographic images were obtained during each intubation and digitally analyzed using ImageJ v2.1.0/1.53c. Patients Not applicable. Main outcome measures Aerosol and droplets were quantified using pixel counts. Overall results were expressed as means ({+/-} SD), with comparisons between groups made using a two-tailed Student's T-test under the assumption of unequal variances. A P value of [] 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results First pass intubation was achieved in all scenarios, with and without the barrier device. Pixel counts demonstrated significant overall reduction in aerosol and droplet exposure when the barrier device was used during intubation [Mean (SD) count:509 (860) vs 10169 (11600); P=0.014]. The highest exposure risk to airborne particles was observed during simulated induction, prior to laryngoscopy and intubation. Conclusions The novel barrier device was effective in reducing environmental exposure to aerosols and droplets during intubation without negatively affecting first pass intubation. The highest risk of exposure to airborne particles was during induction, before intubation takes place. Clinical trials are indicated to further test the feasibility and efficacy of this device.

Those measures, combined with the overlapping symptoms of COVID-19 disease and common viral infections in children, have led hospitals to prepare for possible changes in volume of emergency room visits by children. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine the effect of the pandemic and governmental restrictions on the use of the emergency department by pediatric patients at a university medical centre, as well as to assess the impact on the severity of initial presentations. DESIGN/METHODS: A single-centre study was conducted at a university hospital among children aged 0 to 17 who visited the emergency room. We used interrupted time series analysis to compare the average of pre-COVID-19 data (from January 1 2017, to December 31 2019) with data from the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (from January 1 to September 2020). Emergency room visits, initial triage codes, and admission and pediatric consultation rates were analyzed to assess whether there was a significant difference between periods. RESULTS: An important increase in total daily visits (+11.18, 95% CI [6.23-16.14]) was first observed with the emergence of COVID-19 cases in Canada. Then, during the strict confinement, which corresponds to an active period of COVID-19, we detected a significant drop in daily visits (-25.64, 95% CI [-30.4 to -20.66]), which continued while progressively loosening restrictions. The proportion of admissions and pediatric consultations rose slightly only throughout the time of intensive health measures (respectively +4.07% and +3.32%), but no changes in the severity of the triage codes at the emergency department were observed for all periods. Traumatic injuries also saw a significant decrease (p=0.018) when comparing data by groups of diagnosis. CONCLUSION: These results show a significantly lower number of childrens visits to the emergency room of a university medical centre, and a transient increase in pediatric care with little impact on the immediate severity of the initial presentations during strict government health measures in the first wave of COVID-19. These measures also had a beneficial effect in reducing the number of traumatic injuries.

Through an integration of obstetrical knowledge, critical care, and comparing outcomes from similar cases in the literature, we decided to expectantly manage her pregnancy and did not recommend administration of antenatal steroids. She was extubated after 23 days of mechanical ventilation and recovered from her respiratory illness. She had a full-term spontaneous vaginal delivery of a baby boy at 39 weeks gestation with excellent maternal and fetal outcomes at delivery. Conclusion: In the face of COVID-19, a new disease with unclear maternal and fetal outcomes to date, a collaboration of care teams is essential to navigate through the challenging decisions made, including timing of delivery, treatment options, and administration of steroids. Our paper is unique as there is no other published case report of a critically ill pregnant patient with COVID-19 in which delivery was deferred, and a full recovery was observed, with a vaginal delivery at term.","output":"Expectant Management of a Critically Ill Pregnant Patient with COVID-19 with Good Maternal and Neonatal Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In April 2020, there were significant reductions in prescription fills of each of the 10 most prescribed outpatient antibiotics in the United States.

Although there are outbreak reports involving mass gatherings, the contribution to overall transmission is unknown.

However, to date, prospective studies are lacking. Moreover, it is important to identify which factors modulate the stress response to the pandemic. Previously, sense of coherence (SOC) has emerged as a particularly important resistance factor. OBJECTIVE: This prospective study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and to investigate the ability of pre-outbreak SOC levels to predict changes in psychopathological symptoms. METHODS: This study assessed psychopathological symptoms and SOC before and after the COVID-19 outbreak as well as post-outbreak COVID-19-related traumatic distress in a German-speaking sample (n =1,591). Bivariate latent change score (BLCS) modeling was used to analyze pre- to post-outbreak changes in psychopathological symptoms and the ability of SOC to predict symptom changes. RESULTS: Overall, there was no change in psychopathological symptoms. However, on an individual-respondent level, 10% experienced a clinically significant increase in psychopathological symptoms and 15% met cut-off criteria for COVID-19-related traumatic distress. Using BLCS modeling, we identified a high-stress group experiencing an increase in psychopathological symptoms and a decrease in SOC and a low-stress group showing the reversed pattern. Changes in SOC and psychopathological symptoms were predicted by pre-outbreak SOC and psychopathological symptom levels. CONCLUSIONS: Although mental health was stable in most respondents, a small group of respondents characterized by low levels of SOC experienced increased psychopathological symptoms from pre- to post-outbreak. Thus, SOC training might be a promising approach to enhance the resistance to stressors.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Public Mental Health and the Buffering Effect of a Sense of Coherence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Pelvic floor functioning is an important concern for women requiring a hysterectomy for endometrial cancer. The incidence of pelvic floor symptoms has not been reported in women who have undergone a hysterectomy for early-stage endometrial cancer. OBJECTIVE We sought to evaluate pelvic floor function in women who have had surgical treatment for early-stage endometrial cancer as part of the multinational Laparoscopic Approach to Cancer of the Endometrium trial and to compare patients' outcomes who had total abdominal vs total laparoscopic hysterectomy. STUDY DESIGN A multinational, phase III, randomized noninferiority trial compared disease-free survival of patients who had total abdominal hysterectomy vs total laparoscopic hysterectomy. This substudy analyzes the results from a self-administered validated questionnaire on pelvic floor symptoms (Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory) administered preoperatively, and at follow-up visits 6, 18, 30, 42, and 54 months postoperatively. RESULTS Overall, 381 patients with endometrial cancer were included in the analysis (total abdominal hysterectomy, n = 195; total laparoscopic hysterectomy, n = 186). At 6 months postsurgery both groups experienced an improvement in Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory scores compared to presurgical pelvic floor well-being (total abdominal hysterectomy: mean change -11.17; 95% confidence interval, -17.11 to -5.24; total laparoscopic hysterectomy: mean change -10.25; 95% confidence interval, -16.31 to -4.19). The magnitude of change from baseline in pelvic floor symptoms did not differ between both treatment groups up to 54 months postsurgery. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that pelvic floor function in terms of urinary, bowel, and prolapse symptoms are unlikely to deteriorate following abdominal or laparoscopic hysterectomy and are reassuring for women undergoing hysterectomy for early-stage endometrial cancer.","output":"Pelvic floor functional outcomes after total abdominal vs total laparoscopic hysterectomy for endometrial cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dermatologic surgeons are at increased risk of contracting SARS-COV-2.

Higher risks of infection and mortality among racialized minorities are a consequence of structural racism, reflected in specific policies that date back centuries and persist today. Yet, our surveillance activities do not reflect what we know about how racism structures risk. When measuring racial and ethnic disparities in deaths due to COVID-19, the CDC statistically accounts for the geographic distribution of deaths throughout the US to reflect the fact that deaths are concentrated in areas with different racial and ethnic distributions than that of the larger US. In this commentary, we argue that such an approach misses an important driver of disparities in COVID-19 mortality, namely the historical forces that determine where individuals live, work, and play, and consequently determine their risk of dying from COVID-19. We explain why controlling for geography downplays the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on racialized minority groups in the US.

Additionally, the potential implications of these effects on COVID-19 are also addressed. The results published show that diet and obesity are two factors that effectively influence the expression of Ace2 gene in adipose tissue. However, the shifts in this gene do not always occur in the same direction, nor with the same intensity. Additionally, there is no consensus regarding the implications of increased adipose tissue ACE2 expression in health. Thus, while in some studies a protective role is attributed to ACE2 overexpression, other studies suggest otherwise. Similarly, there is much debate regarding the role played by ACE2 in COVID-19 in terms of degree of infection and disease outcomes. The greater risk of infection that may hypothetically derive from enhanced ACE2 expression is not clear since the functionality of the enzyme seems to be as important as the abundance. Thus, the greater abundance of ACE2 in adipose tissue of obese subjects may be counterbalanced by its lower activation. In addition, a protective role of ACE2 overexpression has also been suggested, associated with the increase in anti-inflammatory factors that it may produce.","output":"An Overview of Adipose Tissue ACE2 Modulation by Diet and Obesity.

Some of these variants show increased resistance to vaccine-elicited immunity, convalescent plasma, or monoclonal antibodies. In particular, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike have drawn attention. To facilitate the isolation of neutralizing antibodies and the monitoring of vaccine effectiveness against these variants, we designed and produced biotin-labeled molecular probes of variant SARS-CoV-2 spikes and their subdomains, using a structure-based construct design that incorporated an N-terminal purification tag, a specific amino acid sequence for protease cleavage, the variant spike-based region of interest, and a C-terminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. These probes could be produced by a single step using in-process biotinylation and purification. We characterized the physical properties and antigenicity of these probes, comprising the N-terminal domain (NTD), the receptor-binding domain (RBD), the RBD and subdomain 1 (RBD-SD1), and the prefusion-stabilized spike ectodomain (S2P) with sequences from SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern or of interest, including variants Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Iota, Kappa, Delta, Lambda, Mu, and Omicron. We functionally validated probes by using yeast expressing a panel of nine SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding antibodies and confirmed sorting capabilities of variant probes using yeast displaying libraries of plasma antibodies from COVID-19 convalescent donors.

Given the similarities in the systemic responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection with those observed after pandemic influenza, there is a question if a similar syndrome of post-encephalic parkinsonism could follow COVID-19 infection. Objectives To determine if prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 increased sensitivity to a mitochondrial toxin known to induce parkinsonism. Methods hACE2 mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 to induce mild to moderate disease. After 31 days recovery, mice were administered a non-lesion inducing dose of the parkinsonian toxin MPTP. Subsequent neuroinflammation and SNpc dopaminergic neuron loss was determined and compared to SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP alone. Results hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP showed no SNpc DA neuron loss following MPTP. In mice infected and recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, MPTP induced a 23% or 19% greater loss of SNpc dopaminergic neurons than SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP, respectively (p<0.05). Examination of microglial activation showed a significant increase in the number of activated microglia in the SARS-CoV-2 + MPTP group compared to SARS-CoV-2 or MPTP alone. Conclusions Our observations have important implications for long-term public health, given the number of people that have survived SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as for future public policy regarding infection mitigation. However, it will be critical to determine if other agents known to increase risk of PD also have synergistic effects with SARS-CoV-2 and if are abrogated by vaccination.

Developing a no-show prediction model for individuals seeking physical therapy care for musculoskeletal conditions has several benefits including enhancement of workforce efficiency without growing the existing provider pool, delivering guideline adherent care, and identifying those that may benefit from telehealth. The objective of this paper was to quantify the national prevalence of no-shows for patients seeking physical therapy care and to identify individual and organizational factors predicting whether a patient will be a no-show when seeking physical therapy care. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Commercial provider of physical therapy within the United States with 828 clinics across 26 states. PARTICIPANTS: Adolescent and adult patients (age cutoffs: 14C117 years) seeking non-pharmacological treatment for musculoskeletal conditions from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017 (n = 542,685). Exclusion criteria were a primary complaint not considered an MSK condition or improbable values for height, weight, or body mass index values. The study included 444,995 individuals. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of no-shows for musculoskeletal conditions and predictors of patient no-show. RESULTS: In our population, 73% missed at least 1 appointment for a given physical therapy care episode. Our model had moderate discrimination for no-shows (c-statistic:0.72, all appointments; 0.73, first 7 appointments) and was well calibrated, with predicted and observed no-shows in good agreement. Variables predicting higher no-show rates included insurance type; smoking-status; higher BMI; and more prior cancellations, time between visit and scheduling date, and between current and previous visit. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of no-shows when seeking care for musculoskeletal conditions from physical therapists highlights an inefficiency that, unaddressed, could limit delivery of guideline-adherent care that advocates for earlier use of non-pharmacological treatments for musculoskeletal conditions and result in missed opportunities for using telehealth to deliver physical therapy.","output":"Prevalence and predictors of no-shows to physical therapy for musculoskeletal conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We analyzed the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on neurologic emergencies, depending on the patients' triage score in a setting with relatively few COVID-19 cases and without lack of resources. METHODS: Consecutive patients of a tertiary care center with a dedicated neurologic emergency room (nER) were analyzed. The time period of the first lockdown in Germany (calendar weeks 12-17, 2020) was retrospectively compared to the corresponding period in 2019 regarding the number of patients presenting to the nER, the number of patients with specific triage scores (Heidelberg Neurological Triage Score), the number of patients with stroke, and the quality of stroke care. RESULTS: A total of 4330 patients were included. Fewer patients presented themselves in 2020 compared to 2019 (median [interquartile range] per week: 134 [118-143] vs. 187 [182-192]; p = 0.015).

METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two HCP participating in 71 ST procedures performed at our institution between 26th March 2020 and 27th May 2020 were identified. A COVID-19 health questionnaire was distributed among staff with their consent. Data related to the presence of COVID-19 symptoms (new onset continuous cough, fever, loss of taste and/or loss of smell) among HCP involved in ST as well as patient related data were collected. RESULTS: Of the HCP who responded, eleven (15%,11/72) reported key COVID-19 symptoms and went into self-isolation. Ten members from this group underwent a COVID-19 swab test and three tested positive. Only one HCP attended hospital for symptomatic treatment, none required hospitalisation. Sixty percent (43/72) of the responders had a COVID-19 antibody test with a positive rate of 18.6% (8/43).

OBJECTIVE: This article aims to provide a general overview over the beginning of the pandemic as well as the second wave of infections in Germany and Switzerland, regarding SARS-CoV?2 positive pregnant women hospitalized for childbirth. We therefore launched a registry to gain timely information over the dynamic situation during the SARS-CoV?2 pandemic in Germany. MATERIAL AND METHODS: As part of the COVID-19-related Obstetric Anesthesia Longitudinal Assessment (COALA) registry, centers reported weekly birth rates, numbers of suspected SARS-CoV?2 cases, as well as the numbers of confirmed cases between 16 March and 3 May 2020. Data acquisition was continued from 18 October 2020 till 28 February 2021. The data were analyzed regarding distribution of SARS-CoV?2 positive pregnant women hospitalized for childbirth between centers, calendar weeks and birth rates as well as maternal characteristics, course of disease and outcomes of SARS-CoV?2 positive pregnant women. RESULTS: A total of 9 German centers reported 2270 deliveries over 7 weeks during the first wave of infections including 3 SARS-CoV?2 positive cases and 9 suspected cases. During the second survey period, 6 centers from Germany and Switzerland reported 41 positive cases out of 4897 deliveries. One woman presented with a severe and ultimately fatal course of the disease, while another one needed prolonged ECMO treatment. Of the women 28 presented with asymptomatic infections and 6 neonates were admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit for further treatment. There was one case of neonatal SARS-CoV?2 infection. CONCLUSION: The number of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV?2 was at a very low level at the time of delivery, with only sporadic suspected or confirmed cases. Due to the lack of comprehensive testing in the first survey period, however, a certain number of asymptomatic cases are to be assumed. Of the cases 68% presented as asymptomatic or as mild courses of disease but the data showed that even in young healthy patients without the presence of typical risk factors, serious progression can occur. These outcomes should raise awareness for anesthesiologists, obstetricians, pediatricians and intensive care physicians to identify severe cases of COVID-19 in pregnant women during childbirth and to take the necessary precautions to ensure the best treatment of mother and neonate. The prospective acquisition of data allowed a timely assessment of the highly dynamic situation and gain knowledge regarding this vulnerable group of patients.","output":"COVID-19 in der geburtshilflichen An?sthesie: Prospektive Erfassung von SARS-CoV-2-Infektionen zum Zeitpunkt der Geburt sowie des peripartalen Verlaufs SARS-CoV-2-positiver Schwangerer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The pandemic has challenged educational institutions to catalyze digitalization and rapidly develop online teaching formats. The aim of the study was to evaluate the teaching offered for oral and maxillofacial surgery at our university during the pandemic and to investigate the students perceptions of the current situation. METHODS: A 38-item questionnaire with five sections (demographic information, lectures, internships, e-learning, and pandemic-related solutions/effects) was created online. Most questions were answered on a 10-point Likert scale, with 1 indicating fully agree/positive and 10 indicating totally disagree/negative. The remaining questions were either answered with yes/no, percent value, or open-ended text responses. All 3rd-5th year dental students were invited to voluntarily participate and were sent a link by email in a general mail shot. RESULTS: A total of 63.7% of the participants had no prior experience with online courses before the pandemic. The students stated that the change from face-to-face to online teaching worked very well in the last two semesters (mean = 2.73, standard deviation = 2.05). Overall, the pandemic had a rather positive influence on the acquisition of theoretical skills and a negative influence on the acquisition of practical skills (p < 0.0001). The evaluation showed that, compared to other dental clinics at our university, the department for oral and maxillofacial surgery was well prepared for the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Digitalization of oral and maxillofacial surgery teaching in dental education is possible but depends on the institutions preparatory work and technological possibilities. The students declared a high acceptance of digital learning formats and indicated an increased motivation to learn due to e-learning. The pandemics influence on the students education was rated ambivalent.

It is important to explore to what extent and how hematopoietic stem cells contribute to the impairment of peripheral lymphoid and myeloid compartments in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to assess bone marrow mononuclear cells from COVID-19 patients with peripheral blood mononuclear cells as control. The results showed that the hematopoietic stem cells in these patients were mainly in the G1 phase and prone to apoptosis, with immune activation and anti-viral responses. Importantly, a significant accumulation of immature myeloid progenitors and a dramatic reduction of lymphoid progenitors in severe cases were identified, along with the up-regulation of transcription factors (such as SPI1, LMO4, ETS2, FLI1, and GATA2) that are important for the hematopoietic stem cell or multipotent progenitor to differentiate into downstream progenitors.

However, which combination of COVID-19 vaccines offers the strongest immune response against Omicron variant is unknown. METHODS: This randomized, subject-blinded, controlled trial assessed the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of different COVID-19 vaccine booster combinations. 100 BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals were enrolled and randomized 1: 1 to either homologous (BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 + BNT162b2; BBB) or heterologous mRNA booster vaccine (BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 + mRNA-1273; BBM). Primary endpoint was the level of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and VOCs at Day 28. RESULTS: 51 participants were allocated to BBB and 49 to BBM; 50 and 48 respectively were analyzed for safety and immunogenicity outcomes. At Day 28 post-boost, mean SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody titers were lower with BBB (22,382 IU/mL 95% CI, 18,210 to 27,517) vs BBM (29,751 IU/mL 95% CI, 25,281 to 35,011, p = 0.034) as was the median level of neutralizing antibodies: BBB 99.0% (IQR 97.9 to 99.3%) vs BBM 99.3% (IQR 98.8 to 99.5%, p = 0.021). On sub-group analysis, significant differences in mean spike antibody titer and live Omicron neutralization titer was only observed in older adults.

This situation highlighted a requirement for supplementary tests for precise virus-typing. As a result, we developed a RT-PCR assay able to detect as well as type PRRSV. To provide maximal sequence information, complete viral open reading frames (ORFs 5 and 7) were targeted for amplification. The RT-PCR test was able to amplify complete PRRSV ORFs from complex materials such as boar semen containing as little as 1 TCID(50) ml(?1) of PRRSV. Typing of viruses was accomplished by any one of three strategies: (i) use of type-specific PCR primers, (ii) size determination of ORF 7 amplicons, (iii) DNA sequencing. All three typing strategies showed complete concordance with the currently used method of typing with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) when used on a panel of PRRSV field isolates covering the period 1992C1997. The ORF 7-based test had particularly desirable characteristics, namely, highly sensitive detection of PRRSV without apparent type bias, typing of the detected virus, discrimination between pure and mixed virus populations, and semi-quantitative assessment of type ratios in mixed populations, all in a single PCR reaction. In addition, the obtained sequence data were used to predict two simple and rapid strategies (single-enzyme restriction length polymorphy analysis and oligonucleotide hybridization) for confirmation of the specificity of ORF 7 RT-PCR reactions. As such, the RT-PCR assay provides a new, powerful diagnostic tool to study the population dynamics between present and emerging PRRSV-types.","output":"Sensitive detection and typing of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus by RT-PCR amplification of whole viral genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many pathogens persist in multihost systems, making the identification of infection reservoirs crucial for devising effective interventions.

Results: COVID-19 cases and deaths initially peaked in late March and April, but after a brief reduction in June cases and deaths began rising again during July and continued to climb into early August. The US policy response is best characterized by its federalist, decentralized nature. The national government has led in terms of economic and fiscal response, increasing funding for scientific research into testing, treatment, and vaccines, and in creating more favorable regulations for the use of telemedicine. State governments have been responsible for many of the containment, testing, and treatment responses, often with little federal government support. Policies that favor economic re-opening are often followed by increases in state-level case numbers, which are then followed by stricter containment measures, such as mask wearing or pausing re-opening plans.

It has now been clearly demonstrated that SARS-CoV?2 resides in the upper airways and transmits easily via aerosols and droplets, which significantly increases the risk of infection when performing upper airway procedures. Ventilated COVID-19 patients in a critical condition in the intensive care unit may require tracheotomy for long-term ventilation and to improve weaning. However, the risk of secondary infection of medical personnel performing subsequent tracheostomy care remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the risk of droplet dispersion during tracheostomy tube change and overview tracheostomy tube change in COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current literature was reviewed, quantitative and qualitative analyses of droplet formation during tracheostomy tube change in n = 8 patients were performed, and an overview of and checklist for tracheostomy tube change were compiled. RESULTS: This study demonstrates that tracheostomy tube change, in particular insertion of the new tube, may cause significant droplet formation. The aerosolization of particles smaller than 5 m was not analyzed. CONCLUSION: Our data, together with the current literature, clearly emphasize that tracheostomy care is associated with a high infection risk and should only be performed by a small group of well-trained, maximally protected healthcare personnel.","output":"Management von Patienten mit Tracheostoma w?hrend der COVID-19-Pandemie: Literaturberblick und Demonstration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the pathophysiology of the placenta and its impact on pregnancy outcome has not yet been fully elucidated.

This finding contrasted with the lack of inflammatory response in placental tissues from SARS-CoV-2-positive women with low viral tissue load and from SARS-CoV-2-negative women. Importantly, no evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was found in any newborns, suggesting that the placenta may be an effective maternal-neonatal barrier against the virus even in the presence of severe infection.

However, different reward processing dimensions may have distinct roles in these associations that may be sensible to the psychological impact of more recent stressful events. We examined these associations in the COVID-19 pandemic context. METHOD: A community sample of 419 respondents (M age = 27.32 years, SD = 8.98, 88.1% females) completed an online survey. Participants filled in self-report measures of CA, reward processing dimensions, depressive and anxiety symptoms, physical status, and psychological impact of COVID-19. RESULTS: CA was significantly associated (p < .05) with depressive (r = .20) and anxiety symptoms (r = .19), physical health (r= -.16), reward learning (r = -.11) and responsiveness (r = -.16), but not reward valuation. Reward learning mediated the association between CA and all health status indicators (i.e., higher CA predicted decreased reward learning which in turn predicted increased depressive and anxiety symptoms and poorer physical health). Psychological impact of COVID-19 did not moderate the mediating role of reward processing in the associations between CA and health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Reward learning appears to be the only reward processing dimension which cuts across depressive and anxiety symptoms, and physical health problems, providing information about their onset and maintenance.

However, it was observed that there was a statistically significant decrease in the number of operations performed during the pandemic period (p < 0.001). The treatment protocol of 14 malignancy patients was changed due to the pandemic. Of these patients, 10 were diagnosed with colorectal, 2 with gastric, 1 with breast cancer and 1 with gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Conclusion: According to the short-term results in our study, delaying surgical treatment for a while in some oncological patients and administration of systemic chemotherapy during this period when considered necessary did not have a significant negative effect on the course of the disease.

The current study determined such genetic variations and their possible impact among SARS-CoV-2 variants isolated in India. A total of 546 SARS - CoV- 2 genomic sequences (India) were retrieved from the gene bank and subjected to alignment against the Wuhan variant (NC_045512.2), the corresponding amino acid changes were analyzed using NCBI Protein-BLAST. These 546 variants revealed 841 mutations; most of these were non-synonymous 464/841 (55.1%), there was no identical variant compared to the original strain. All genes; coding and non-coding showed nucleotide changes, most of the structural genes showed frequent nonsynonymous mutations. The most affected genes were ORF1a/b followed by the S gene which showed 515/841 (61.2%) and 120/841(14.3%) mutations, respectively. The most frequent non-synonymous mutation 486/546 (89.01%) occurred in the S gene (structural gene) at position 23403 where A changed to G leading to the replacement of aspartic acid by glycine in position (D614G). Interestingly, four variants also showed deletion. The variants MT800923 and MT800925 showed 12 consecutive nucleotide deletion in position 21982-21993 resulting in 4 consecutive amino acid deletions that were leucine, glycine, valine, and tyrosine in positions 141, 142, 143, and 144 respectively.

The objectives are 1) to report the prevalence of antihistamine prescription for children less than 6 years old with acute upper respiratory infection and 2) to explore the associated factors for the prescription practice. METHODS This is a cross-sectional study. All consecutive cases of paediatric patients aged 6 or below who presented to the emergency department during a study period of one week from April 1 to July 4, 2009 with diagnosis of acute upper respiratory infection were included. Totally 162 patients were included. RESULTS Among the 162 cases, 141 (87%) patients were prescribed one antihistamine of any group. Sixty (37%) patients were prescribed two or more antihistamines. In multivariate logistic regression model, age was found to be significantly (P<0.001) associated with multiple antihistamine prescription (OR=1.042, 95%CI=1.02 to 1.06). Years of graduation of attending physician for more than 5 years was also a strong predictor of multiple antihistamine prescription (OR=4.654, 95%CI=2.20 to 9.84, P<0.001).

Current evidence on the incidence and risk factors associated with unplanned ED presentations is unclear because of substantial heterogeneity in methods reporting on this issue. The aim of this review was to examine the methodological approaches to measure the incidence of unplanned ED presentations by patients receiving systemic anti-cancer therapy in order to determine the strength of evidence and to inform future research. METHODS An electronic search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane was undertaken. Papers published in English language between 2000 and 2019, and papers that included patients receiving systemic anti-cancer therapy as the denominator during the study period were included. Studies were eligible if they were analytical observational studies. Data relating to the methods used to measure the incidence of ED presentations by patients receiving systemic anti-cancer therapy were extracted and assessed for methodological rigor. Findings are reported in accordance with the Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis (SWiM) guideline. RESULTS Twenty-one articles met the inclusion criteria: 20 cohort studies, and one cross-sectional study. Overall risk of bias was moderate. There was substantial methodological and clinical heterogeneity in the papers included. Methodological rigor varied based on the description of methods such as the period of observation, loss to follow-up, reason for ED presentation and statistical methods to control for time varying events and potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS There is considerable diversity in the population and methods used in studies that measure the incidence of unplanned ED presentations by patients receiving systemic anti-cancer therapy. Recommendations to support the development of robust evidence include enrolling participants at diagnosis or initiation of treatment, providing adequate description of regular care to support patients who experience toxicities, reporting reasons for and characteristics of participants who are lost to follow-up throughout the study period, clearly defining the outcome including the observation and follow-up period, and reporting crude numbers of ED presentations and the number of at-risk days to account for variation in the length of treatment protocols.","output":"Methodological approaches to measuring the incidence of unplanned emergency department presentations by cancer patients receiving systemic anti-cancer therapy: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increased alcohol consumption among Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our health systems in the short and longer term, through increased hospitalizations due to alcohol-related illness, addiction, violence and accidents.

The aim of this study was to determine negative attitudes and intentions and their predictors towards COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: This was cross sectional survey, that targeted 1011 Egyptians aged 18 years and above, from 24 governorates, during the period from 7 January 2021, to 30 March 2021. Using a convenient sampling technique, the data were collected through an online self-administered, structured questionnaire, which was composed of two main sections, that involved sociodemographic and health related factors, intentions, and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 29.35  10.78 years, (16.6 %) of them had COVID-19. (54%) of respondents, reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and 21% of them reported vaccine non-acceptance while (27.1%) of participants preferred receiving Pfizer vaccine. (51.8%) of the respondents expressed strong worries about unforeseen effects of the vaccine which was associated with younger age groups, married, females, absence of history of allergy to food or drugs, perceived susceptibility to COVID 19 and never having flu vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with female sex, urban residence, university/post graduate, married respondents, those never had flu vaccine, and those did not have confidence in the ability of health system to control the epidemic. Female sex, urban residence and having concerns about unforeseen effects were predictors for vaccine hesitancy and vaccine non-acceptance. CONCLUSION: The observed high level of worries about unforeseen effects of COVID-19 vaccines and widespread vaccine hesitancy amongst Egyptians and its predictors should be considered during implementation of public health intervention campaigns to change negative attitudes and improve acceptance and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in Egypt.","output":"Attitudes and intentions towards COVID-19 vaccines and associated factors among Egyptian adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modulation of immune responses by nutrients is an important area of study in cellular biology and clinical sciences in the context of cancer therapies and anti-pathogen-directed immune responses in health and disease.

We study 163 cities, chosen from four different continents, and report a global trend where the epidemic risk induced by human mobility increases consistently in those cities where mobility flows are predominantly between high population density centers. We apply our framework to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, providing a plausible explanation for the observed heterogeneity in the spreading process across cities. Based on this insight, we propose realistic mitigation strategies (less severe than lockdowns), based on modifying the mobility in cities. Our results suggest that an optimal control strategy involves an asymmetric policy that restricts flows entering the most vulnerable areas but allowing residents to continue their usual mobility patterns.The evolution of epidemic outbreaks in urban settings is known to stem from the interplay between demographic, structural, and economical characteristics.

The Portuguese health authorities are currently using some decision analysis-like techniques to assess the impact of this pandemic and implementing measures for each county, region, or the whole country. Such decision tools led to some criticism and many stakeholders asked for novel approaches, in particular those having in consideration dynamical changes in the pandemic behavior arising, e.g., from new virus variants or vaccines.

DATA SOURCES CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO (1980-2021) were searched for studies reporting the association of risk factors with delirium incidence/prevalence for patients receiving specialist palliative care. Study risk of bias and certainty of evidence for each risk factor were assessed. RESULTS Of 28 included studies, 16 conducted only univariate analysis, 12 conducted multivariate analysis. The evidence for delirium risk factors was limited with low to very low certainty. POTENTIALLY MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS Opioids and lower performance status were positively associated with delirium, with some evidence also for dehydration, hypoxaemia, sleep disturbance, liver dysfunction and infection. Mixed, or very limited, evidence was found for some factors targetted in multicomponent prevention interventions: sensory impairments, mobility, catheter use, polypharmacy (single study), pain, constipation, nutrition (mixed evidence). NON-MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS Older age, male sex, primary brain cancer or brain metastases and lung cancer were positively associated with delirium.

At this stage, there are still cases of COVID-19 infection in some countries and regions, in which ischemic stroke (IS) is a risk factor for new coronavirus pneumonia, and patients with COVID-19 infection have a dramatically elevated risk of stroke. At the same time, patients with long-term IS are vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and have more severe disease, and carotid atherosclerosis is an early lesion in IS. METHODS: This study used human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived monolayer brain cell dataset and human carotid atherosclerosis genome-wide dataset to analyze COVID-19 infection and carotid atherosclerosis patients to determine the synergistic effect of new coronavirus infection on carotid atherosclerosis patients, to clarify the common genes of both, and to identify common pathways and potential drugs for carotid atherosclerosis in patients with COVID-19 infection RESULTS: Using several advanced bioinformatics tools, we present the causes of COVID-19 infection leading to increased mortality in carotid atherosclerosis patients and the susceptibility of carotid atherosclerosis patients to COVID-19. Potential therapeutic agents for COVID-19 -infected patients with carotid atherosclerosis are also proposed.

This has provided a rationale for beneficial modulation of the microbiome. One approach being explored for modulating the microbiota in diseased individuals is transferring microbiota or microbiota constituents from healthy donors via microbiome transplantation. The great success of fecal microbiome transplantation for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections has encouraged the application of this procedure for the treatment of other diseases such as vaginal disorders via transplantation of vaginal microbiota, or of skin pathologies via the transplantation of skin microbiota.

This study analyses three phenomena: causes attributed to unemployment; processes for coping with unemployment; and the emotional impact of joblessness. Using an SEM approach, a model is created in which unemployment normalization acts as a mediator between locus of control and emotions. Method: questionnaires from 260 unemployed people in Luxembourg provided data on perceived control, coping, and emotions. Participants who attribute their situation to bad luck, believe more strongly that unemployment is due to external factors beyond their control, and recognize unemployment as being a common occurrence in life. Such cognitive attribution of unemployment has effects on job seekers' emotions. Those who perceive unemployment in a more positive light experience more positive emotions and fewer negative affects. Negative perceptions of unemployment have no effect on the generation of positive emotion, but have an influence on negative affects. Finally, the influence of perceived-control on emotion is not direct, but is mediated by processes of unemployment normalization. Understanding how unemployed people perceive and experience their situations could help them be more effective in their search for new employment.","output":"Normalization as a mediator of emotion during unemployment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic and control measures may have increased the risk of abusing addictive substances as well as addictive behaviors.

Due to the increased workforce brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been changes in the number of patients and the quality of follow-up. The primary aim of our study is to examine the effects of the first year of the pandemic on pressure ulcer follow-up and treatment strategies for patients hospitalized in non-COVID intensive care units (ICU). The secondary aim is to examine the effect of nutritional support. Methods: The data of 120 patients who were followed up in the non-COVID ICU for at least 2 weeks between January--March 2021(Group 1) and January--March 2020 (Group 2) and followed up with PUs were retrospectively analyzed. In addition to the demographic data and comorbidities of the patients, admission from the nursing home, stages of PUs at admission, changes in stages, and nutritional parameters were recorded. Results: While an increase in the PU stage was detected in 24 patients in Group 1, no increase in the stage of the wound was observed in Group 2 (32.0 vs 0, p=0.000). The transferrin value measured during hospitalization was found to be lower in Group 1 (1.23 vs 1.43, p=0.008). In Group 1, the prealbumin value decreased (0.9 vs 0.2, p=0.008) on day 15 compared with the hospitalization and C-reactive protein value increased. In Group 2, the albumin value was found to be lower (2.5 vs 2.3, p=0.047) on day 15 compared with the day of hospitalization. Conclusion: In the first year of the pandemic, there was an increase in the existing pressure ulcer stage and a decrease in the nutritional status in patients hospitalized in the ICU for non-COVID reasons. We believe that this might be due to the increased patient care needs and the burnout of healthcare staff due to the COVID pandemic.

As a result of these cellular changes, also molecular changes occur. These changes, that include increase of glucocorticoids and decrease of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, have the unfortunate effect that they decrease the cognitive abilities needed for the individual to solve the stressful situation. Such cognitive abilities like reappraisal and their adaptation mechanisms turn out to be substantially impaired while they are needed for regulation of the negative emotions. However, antidepressant treatments and some other therapies have proved to be quite effective for the strengthening of such cognitive abilities. This study introduces an adaptive causal network model for this phenomenon where a subject loses his or her cognitive abilities (negative metaplasticity) due to long-term stress and re-improve these cognitive abilities (positive metaplasticity) through mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT).

However, the sources of aerosol Fe and controlling factors of Fe solubility in megacities remain poorly understood. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic causes large changes in human activities, which provides a unique opportunity to answer these key issues. Field observations were conducted before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown in Hangzhou, China. Our results show that in the COVID-19 lockdown stage, the concentrations of total Fe (FeT, 75.0 ng m?3) and soluble Fe (FeS, 5.1 ng m?3) in PM2.5 decreased by 78% and 62%, respectively, compared with those (FeT 344.7 ng m?3, FeS 13.5 ng m?3) in the pre-lockdown stage. The sharp reduction (81%) in on-road vehicles was most responsible for the aerosol Fe decrease. Surprisingly, the Fe solubility increased by a factor of 1.9, from 4.2% in the pre-lockdown stage to 7.8% in the COVID-19 lockdown stage.

Instead, a network of regulatory proteins mediate dynein's interaction with cargo and modulate dynein's ability to engage with and move on the microtubule track. A flurry of research over the past decade has revealed the function and mechanism of many of dynein's regulators, including Lis1, dynactin, and a family of proteins called activating adaptors.

This is illustrated by the recent introduction and subsequent spread of West Nile virus in the USA, and outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in South-East Asia. It is therefore becoming increasingly important that national (and potentially regional) governments should not only have robust systems in place to reduce the risk of disease introductions, but that they need to also consider how to identify and deal with outbreaks of pathogens in wild and domestic animals. In this chapter we will discuss the roles of risk assessment and contingency planning in the management of exotic disease risks involving wild mammals. The principal purpose of contingency planning is to ensure that a State of preparedness exists in the event of a disease introduction. This requires that the most likely risks of pathogen introduction are identified, that there are adequate means of detecting the pathogen's presence, and that a set of instructions exists describing the best available methods for its rapid and cost-effective containment and control. Contingency planning will involve some of the approaches to disease surveillance (Chapter 10) and management (Chapters 6C8) discussed in other chapters, and so will entail many of the associated challenges, costs and benefits. However, as the aim of a contingency plan is likely to be the rapid containment and subsequent elimination of a pathogen (that is either exotic or endemic but emergent) within a restricted area, the methods of management should reflect this urgency. This may mean that it is appropriate to deploy more severe or costly measures over a short period than would be considered for the sustained control of an endemic pathogen.","output":"Risk Assessment and Contingency Planning for Exotic Disease Introductions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 is a global disease that occurred at the end of 2019 and it has shown its effects all over the world in a very short time.

The soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), a known inflammatory and immune mediator in several renal and cardiovascular conditions, has recently been shown to correlate with acute kidney injury and severe respiratory failure in COVID-19. To date, no study has investigated the association between suPAR and thromboembolism in COVID-19. Purpose: To evaluate associations between suPAR, thromboembolic complications, and mortality in COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a random sample of 109 patients among those hospitalised at a tertiary medical centre comprising three hospitals between March and June 2020 for COVID-19 who had blood samples collected and stored on admission. Serum suPAR was measured using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay. Baseline (hospital admission) variables extracted from electronic medical records included age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), history of cardiovascular disease (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and pulmonary embolism [PE]), serum creatinine, serum D-dimer, incident DVT/PE, and death during hospitalization. Patients were subsequently grouped by su- PAR quartiles. Associations between suPAR, thromboembolic complications (PE and/or DVT), and overall mortality were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Among the 109 patients, mean age was 56 (standard deviation [SD], 16) years, 34 (39%) were women, mean BMI was 35 (SD, 8) kg/m2, 78 (71%) had coexisting cardiovascular disease, median creatinine level was 1.2 (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.8-2.3) mg/dl, median D-dimer level was 1.5 (IQR, 0.8-6.4) g/ml, and median suPAR level was 10.1 (IQR: 4.1-14.4) pg/mL. Seven (6%) patients were found to have PE, 18 (17%) developed PE/DVT, and 22 (20%) died during the admission (Table). Per quartile higher suPAR level, there was higher risk for PE or DVT (OR=2.02, 95% CI 1.07-3.83, p=0.03). Compared to those in the lowest suPAR quartile, patients in the highest quartile had 11.1 times higher risk for PE/DVT (OR=11.1, 95% CI 1.51-81.8, p=0.02, Figure). SuPAR is also associated with overall mortality, with 2.25 times higher risk of death seen per quartile increase in suPAR level (OR= 2.25, 95% CI 1.24-4.06, p=0.007).

We perform an exploratory study to understand the variability of the whole coding region of possible proximal evolutionary neighbours of SARSCoV-2. We consider seven (07) human coronavirus strains from six different species as a candidate for our study. First, we observe a good variability of nucleotides across candidate strains. We did not find a significant variation of GC content across the strains for codon position first and second. However, we interestingly see huge variability of GC-content in codon position 3rd (GC3), and pairwise mean GC-content (SARSCoV, MERSCoV), and (SARSCoV-2, hCoV229E) are quite closer. While observing the relative abundance of dinucleotide feature, we find a shared typical genetic pattern, i.e., high usage of GC and CT nucleotide pair at the first two positions (P12) of codons and the last two positions (P23) of codons, respectively. We also observe a low abundance of CG pair that might help in their evolution bio-process. Secondly, Considering RSCU score, we find a substantial similarity for mild class coronaviruses, i.e., hCoVOC43, hCoVHKU1, and hCoVNL63 based on their codon hit with high RSCU value ( 1.5), and minim number of codons hit (count-9) is observed for MERSCoV. We see seven codons ATT, ACT, TCT, CCT, GTT, GCT and GGT with high RSCU value, which are common in all seven strains. These codons are mostly from Aliphatic and Hydroxyl amino acid group. A phylogenetic tree built using RSCU feature reveals proximity among hCoVOC43 and hCoV229E (mild). Thirdly, we perform linear regression analysis among GC content in different codon position and ENC value. We observe a strong correlation (significant p-value) between GC2 and GC3 for SARSCoV-2, hCoV229E and hCoVNL63, and between GC1 and GC3 for hCoV229E, hCoVNL63, SARSCoV.

METHODS In this observational study, we compared the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with poor 3-month outcome (modified Rankin Scale scores 3-6), death, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) based on the criteria of the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II trial. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Patients without IVT treatment served as a comparison group. RESULTS Among 4,780 IVT-treated patients, 1,217 (25.5%) had a low GFR (<60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). A GFR decrease by 10 mL/min/1.73 m(2) increased the risk of poor outcome (OR [95% CI]): (ORunadjusted 1.20 [1.17-1.24]; ORadjusted 1.05 [1.01-1.09]), death (ORunadjusted 1.33 [1.28-1.38]; ORadjusted 1.18 [1.11-1.249]), and sICH (ORunadjusted 1.15 [1.01-1.22]; ORadjusted 1.11 [1.04-1.20]). Low GFR was independently associated with poor 3-month outcome (ORadjusted 1.32 [1.10-1.58]), death (ORadjusted 1.73 [1.39-2.14]), and sICH (ORadjusted 1.64 [1.21-2.23]) compared with normal GFR (60-120 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). Low GFR (ORadjusted 1.64 [1.21-2.23]) and stroke severity (ORadjusted 1.05 [1.03-1.07]) independently determined sICH. Compared with patients who did not receive IVT, treatment with IVT in patients with low GFR was associated with poor outcome (ORadjusted 1.79 [1.41-2.25]), and with favorable outcome in those with normal GFR (ORadjusted 0.77 [0.63-0.94]). CONCLUSION Renal function significantly modified outcome and complication rates in IVT-treated stroke patients. Lower GFR might be a better risk indicator for sICH than age. A decrease of GFR by 10 mL/min/1.73 m(2) seems to have a similar impact on the risk of death or sICH as a 1-point-higher NIH Stroke Scale score measuring stroke severity.","output":"IV thrombolysis and renal function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Presently, there are no approved drugs or vaccines to treat COVID-19 which has spread to over 200 countries and is responsible for over 3,65,000 deaths worldwide.

Importantly, inhibitors of these proteases were shown to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we perform virtual screening of 14010 phytochemicals produced by Indian medicinal plants to identify natural product inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. We built a homology model of TMPRSS2 as an experimentally determined structure is not available. AutoDock Vina was used to perform molecular docking of phytochemicals against TMPRSS2 model structure and cathepsin L crystal structure. Potential phytochemical inhibitors were filtered by comparing their docked binding energies with those of known inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. Further, the ligand binding site residues and non-covalent protein-ligand interactions were used as an additional filter to identify phytochemical inhibitors that either bind to or form interactions with residues important for the specificity of the target proteases. We have identified 96 inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and 9 inhibitors of cathepsin L among phytochemicals of Indian medicinal plants. The top inhibitors of TMPRSS2 are Edgeworoside C, Adlumidine and Qingdainone, and of cathepsin L is Ararobinol.

RESULTS The SARS-antibodies could be used as the diagnostic evidence. During the 6 months after discharge, the titers of SARS-antibodies were high, but they lowered along with passage of time. At the first recheck, the CD4(+) lymphocyte count was lower than normal level in 55.9% of patients, the CD3(+) lymphocyte count was lower than normal level in 31.2% of patients, and the CD8(+) lymphocyte count was lower than normal level in 14.0% of patients. At the second recheck, the levels of T cell subsets recovered to normal level in the most patients. CONCLUSION T cell subsets, and the number of leukocyte are abnormal in some patients convalescent from SARS. All the indexes examined recover to normal levels half year after discharge.

Fully covered self-expandable metal stents (FCSEMSs) have been used for the treatment of AL. It is still unknown whether FCSEMSs affect anastomosis healing negatively by causing ischemia. In an animal study, we investigated the metabolic effects over a FCSEMS covering a stapled colon anastomosis. Methods Seven pigs were investigated using microdialysis after laparotomy, colon resection, and anastomosis with stent placement. Measurements were done at the proximal and distal ends of the anastomosis and at a reference catheter placed at the small intestine. Measurements of glucose, pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, and the lactate/pyruvate ratio (L/P) were carried out. Results Lactate and L/P were significantly higher at the oral part of the anastomosis, while glucose showed a small declining tendency. At the distal part of the anastomosis, glucose decreased significantly after the resection but did not reach zero. Lactate increased significantly whereas L/P increased only slightly. Glycerol levels were stable. Conclusion Colon resection caused initially hypermetabolism in the intestinal ends next to the resection site. This hypermetabolism neither deteriorated nor turned into ischemia during the initial postoperative course, but the start of hypoxemia could not be excluded during the study and after the placement of an FCSEMS.","output":"Fully covered self-expandable metal stent placed over a stapled colon anastomosis in an animal model: A pilot study of colon metabolism over the stent."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper offers a summary of the latest studies on healthcare scheduling problems including patients admission scheduling problem, nurse scheduling problem, operation room scheduling problem, surgery scheduling problem and other healthcare scheduling problems.

Heart failure (HF), namely the reduction of left ventricular function, is one of the major cardiovascular disease entities. It is chronically progressing with relapsing acute decompensations and an overall grave prognosis that is little different if not worse than most malignant diseases. Interestingly acute metabolically and/or immunologically challenging events like infections or major surgical procedures will cause relapses in the course of preexisting chronic heart failure, decrease the patients wellbeing and worsen myocardial function. HF itself and or its progression has been demonstrated to be driven at least in part by inflammatory pathways that are similarly turned on by infectious or non-infectious stress responses. These thus add to HF progression or relapse. TNF- plasma levels are associated with disease severity and progression in HF. In addition, several cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6) are involved in deteriorating left ventricular function. Those observations are based on clinical studies using inhibitors of cytokines or their receptors or they stem from animal studies examining the effect of cytokine mediated inflammation on myocardial remodeling in models of heart failure. This short review summarizes the known underlying immunological processes that are shared by and drive all: chronic heart failure, select infectious diseases, and inflammatory stress responses.

General and Internal Medicine ? Surgery OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course BACKGROUND: The novel COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a highly infectious disease that originated in Wuhan, China, and has rapidly spread throughout the world. In addition to respiratory complications, the virus has also been implicated in damage to other organ systems as well as coagulopathy. The present report describes the first presumptive case of COVID-19-associated acute superior mesenteric artery thrombosis and acute intestinal ischemia. CASE REPORT: A 55-year old man presented to the emergency department with nausea, generalized abdominal pain and diarrhea; he denied having a fever or any respiratory symptoms. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed bilateral pulmonary ground-glass opacities. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and ceftriaxone, and was discharged home after five days of inpatient treatment. One week later, the patient returned with recurrent nausea, vomiting and worsening diffuse abdominal pain. A CT scan of the abdomen showed a 1.6-cm clot, causing high grade narrowing of the proximal superior mesenteric artery and bowel ischemia. The patient emergently underwent exploratory laparotomy, thromboembolectomy and resection of the ischemic small bowel. A post-operative complete hypercoagulable workup was unrevealing. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the absence of respiratory symptoms, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may show atypical presentations, such as gastrointestinal symptoms.

So far, the gold standard for assessing the quality of the generated images has been human expert ratings. However, due to limitations of human assessment in terms of cost, scalability, and the limited sensitivity of the human eye to more subtle statistical relationships, a more automated approach towards evaluating GANs is required. New method We investigated to what extent visual quality can be assessed using image quality metrics and we used group analysis and spatial independent components analysis to verify that the GAN reproduces multivariate statistical relationships found in real data. Reference human data was obtained by recruiting neuroimaging experts to assess real Magnetic Resonance (MR) images and images generated by a Wasserstein GAN. Image quality was manipulated by exporting images at different stages of GAN training. Results: Experts were sensitive to changes in image quality as evidenced by ratings and reaction times, and the generated images reproduced group effects (age, gender) and spatial correlations moderately well. We also surveyed a number of image quality metrics which consistently failed to fully reproduce human data. While the metrics Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE) showed good overall agreement with human assessment for lower-quality images (i.e. images from early stages of GAN training), only a Deep Quality Assessment (QA) model trained on human ratings was sensitive to the subtle differences between higher-quality images.

Workup at 3 and 12 months following admission consisted of clinical review, pulmonary function testing, 6-min walk distance (6MWD), muscle strength, chest computed tomography (CT) and quality of life questionnaires. We evaluated factors correlating with recovery by linear mixed effects modelling. Results Of 695 patients admitted, 299 and 226 returned at 3 and 12 months, respectively (median age 59 years, 69% male, 31% severe disease). About half and a third of the patients reported fatigue, dyspnoea and/or cognitive impairment at 3 and 12 months, respectively. Reduced 6MWD and quadriceps strength were present in 20% and 60% at 3 months versus 7% and 30% at 12 months. A high anxiety score and body mass index correlated with poor functional recovery. At 3 months, diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and total lung capacity were below the lower limit of normal in 35% and 18%, decreasing to 21% and 16% at 12 months;predictors of poor DLCO recovery were female sex, pre-existing lung disease, smoking and disease severity.

The identification of the causal effect exploits the variation in the number of active workers across municipalities induced by the economic lockdown. The difference-in-difference empirical design compares outcomes in municipalities above and below the median variation in the share of active population before and after the lockdown within a province, also controlling for municipality-specific dynamics, daily-shocks at the provincial level and municipal unobserved characteristics. Our results show that the intensity of the economic lockdown is associated to a statistically significant reduction in mortality by Covid-19 and, in particular, for age groups between 40-64 and older. Back of the envelope calculations indicate that 4,793 deaths were avoided, in the 26 days between April 5 to April 30, in the 3,518 municipalities which experienced a more intense lockdown. Assuming linearity, a 1 percentage point reduction in the share of active population caused a 1.32 percentage points reduction in mortality by Covid-19.

Both methods have a different approach to caries, and it is not possible to know which one of them is the best to use in clinical practice to assess restorations in children. Thus, the present protocol aims to evaluate the effect of the use of the FDI and CARS criteria in the assessment of caries lesions around restorations in primary teeth on outcomes related to oral health in children and costs resulting from the assessments. Methods and analysis: A total of 626 restorations of children from three to 10 years were randomly assessed and are being treated following the FDI criteria (FDI group) or CARS criteria (CARS group). Participants will be followed-up after six, 12, 18, and 24 months. The primary outcome will be the need for a new intervention in the evaluated restorations. This outcome consists of several components, and each of these events will be analyzed separately as secondary outcomes. The changes in children's oral health-related quality of life and the cost of the restoration dental treatments will also be analyzed as secondary outcomes.

In this work, we developed the first SARS-CoV-2 tiling array that captures the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome at single nucleotide resolution and offers the opportunity to detect point mutations. A thorough bioinformatics protocol of two base calling methods has been developed to accompany this array. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the tiling array, we genotyped all genomic positions of eight SARS-CoV-2 samples. Using high-throughput sequencing as the benchmark, we show that the tiling array had a genome-wide accuracy of at least 99.5%. From the tiling array analysis results, we identified the D614G mutation in the spike protein in four of the eight samples, suggesting the widespread distribution of this variant at the early stage of the outbreak in the United States. Two additional nonsynonymous mutations were identified in one sample in the nucleocapsid protein (P13L and S197L), which may complicate future vaccine development. With around $5 per array, supreme accuracy, and an ultrafast bioinformatics protocol, the SARS-CoV-2 tiling array makes an invaluable toolkit for combating current and future pandemics.

Therefore, the objective of the present study is to prepare pumpkin seed derived peptides and to evaluate the effect of structure and surface properties on the zinc binding behavior of the pumpkin seed protein hydrolysate (PSPH), as well as their gastrointestinal stability. Briefly, different PSPHs were prepared using enzymatic hydrolysis method with bromelain, papain, flavourzyme, alcalase, and pepsin. The particle size, zeta potential, surface hydrophobicity, degree of hydrolysis, ATR-FTIR spectra, and zinc binding capacity were determined. The representative samples were chosen to characterize the binding energy and surface morphology of PSPH-Zn. At last, the in vitro gastrointestinal stability of PSPH and PSPH-Zn were evaluated. Our results showed that peptides hydrolyzed by papain had the largest average molecular weight, smallest particle size, highest hydrophobicity, and the greatest zinc binding capacity. Zinc showed better gastrointestinal stability in PSPHs chelates than in its salt. Meanwhile, PSPH-Zn with higher zinc binding capacity showed better stability. The result of this study indicated pumpkin seed hydrolyzed by papain may be used as a potential source for zinc fortification.

The coronaviral N7-MTase is unique for its physical linkage with an exoribonuclease (ExoN) harbored in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) of coronaviruses. In this study, the structure-function relationships of the N7-MTase were analyzed by deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nsp14. The results showed that the ExoN domain is closely involved in the activity of the N7-MTase, suggesting that coronavirus N7-MTase is different from all other viral N7-MTases, which are separable from other structural domains located in the same polypeptide. Two of the 12 critical residues identified to be essential for the N7-MTase were located at the N terminus of the core ExoN domain, reinforcing a role of the ExoN domain in the N7-MTase activity of nsp14. The other 10 critical residues were distributed throughout the N7-MTase domain but localized mainly in the S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-binding pocket and key structural elements of the MTase fold of nsp14. The sequence motif DxGxPxA (amino acids [aa] 331 to 338) was identified as the key part of the SAM-binding site.

RESULTS: Twenty-two pulmonary embolisms were diagnosed during the control period and 99 in the pandemic, 74 of which were associated with COVID-19. Of all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 5.3% had a pulmonary embolism, with a delay between the two diagnoses of 9.1  8.4 days.

Recent drug development has been in part guided by Lipinskis Rule of 5 (Ro5) even though many approved drugs do not comply to these rules. With Covid-19 vaccine development strategy dramatically accelerating drug development perhaps it is timely to question the generic drug development process itself to find a more efficient, cost effective, and successful approach. It is widely believed that drugs permeate cells via two methods: phospholipid bilayer diffusion and carrier mediated transporters. However, emerging evidence suggests that carrier mediated transport may be the primary mechanism of drug uptake and not diffusion as long believed. Computational biology increasingly assists drug design to achieve desirable absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and toxicity (ADMET) properties. Perfecting drug entry into target cells as a prerequisite to intracellular drug action is a logical and compelling route and is expected to reduce drug attrition rates, particularly gaining favour amongst chronic lifelong therapeutics. Novel drug development is rapidly expanding from the utilisation of beyond the rule of five (bRo5) to pulsatile drug delivery systems and fragment based drug design. Utilising transporters as drug targets and advocating bRo5 molecules may be the solution to increasing drug specificity, reducing dosage and toxicity and thus revolutionising drug development.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We prospectively evaluated 155 patients with a single thyroid nodule classified as B IV. Immediate molecular testing and/or thyroid surgery was offered, except when the patient (i) could not afford molecular testing/rejected the surgery, (ii) had a high surgical risk, (iii) had other disorders/comorbidities which needed to be addressed with higher priority, and (iv) had undetectable serum calcitonin levels, in whom active surveillance (AS) was performed. RESULTS From 155 patients, only two patients could afford molecular testing; 84% (n = 130) underwent immediate thyroid surgery: lobectomy was performed in only 8% (n = 10). AS was the initial management for 15% (n = 23) of the patients. The frequency of tumor enlargement was 14% (n = 3), after a median of 42 months (range, 7-72) of follow-up, without any evidence of lymph node or clinical distant metastases development. Deferred surgery was performed in 4 patients (17%) after a median of 24 months (range, 12-48) of AS. Follicular adenoma was diagnosed in three and a follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma in one patient, all of them without evidence of disease after 12 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Despite current guidelines does not support AS for indeterminate Bethesda IV nodules, our findings showed that most of these patients had excellent outcomes, in a setting where lobectomy was not the preference and the access to molecular testing was limited.

Given their density and available infrastructure, refugee and internally displaced person (IDP) settlements can be particularly susceptible to disease spread. In this paper we present an agent-based modeling approach to simulating the spread of disease in refugee and IDP settlements under various non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies. The model, based on the June open-source framework, is informed by data on geography, demographics, comorbidities, physical infrastructure and other parameters obtained from real-world observations and previous literature. The development and testing of this approach focuses on the Coxs Bazar refugee settlement in Bangladesh, although our model is designed to be generalizable to other informal settings. Our findings suggest the encouraging self-isolation at home of mild to severe symptomatic patients, as opposed to the isolation of all positive cases in purpose-built isolation and treatment centers, does not increase the risk of secondary infection meaning the centers can be used to provide hospital support to the most intense cases of COVID-19. Secondly we find that mask wearing in all indoor communal areas can be effective at dampening viral spread, even with low mask efficacy and compliance rates. Finally, we model the effects of reopening learning centers in the settlement under various mitigation strategies. For example, a combination of mask wearing in the classroom, halving attendance regularity to enable physical distancing, and better ventilation can almost completely mitigate the increased risk of infection which keeping the learning centers open may cause. These modeling efforts are being incorporated into decision making processes to inform future planning, and further exercises should be carried out in similar geographies to help protect those most vulnerable.","output":"Operational response simulation tool for epidemics within refugee and IDP settlements: A scenario-based case study of the Coxs Bazar settlement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background : characteristic feature of COVID-19 during its progression in severity is the cytokine storm (via interleukin-6, IL-6) which is responsible for secondary acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [4].

We previously showed that a single inducible phospholipase, PLA2G2D, is associated with a proresolving/antiinflammatory response in the lungs, and increases with age. Survival was increased in naive Pla2g2d-/- mice infected with SARS-CoV resulting from augmented respiratory dendritic cell (rDC) activation and enhanced priming of virus-specific T cells. Here, in contrast, we show that intranasal immunization provided no additional protection in middle-aged Pla2g2d-/- mice infected with any of the 3 pathogenic human coronaviruses because virtually no virus-specific antibodies or follicular helper CD4+ T (Tfh) cells were produced. Using MERS-CoV-infected mice, we found that these effects did not result from T or B cell intrinsic factors. Rather, they resulted from enhanced, and ultimately, pathogenic rDC activation, as manifested most prominently by enhanced IL-1? expression. Wild-type rDC transfer to Pla2g2d-/- mice in conjunction with partial IL-1? blockade reversed this defect and resulted in increased virus-specific antibody and Tfh responses. Together, these results indicate that PLA2G2D has an unexpected role in the lungs, serving as an important modulator of rDC activation, with protective and pathogenic effects in respiratory coronavirus infections and immunization, respectively.","output":"Coronavirus-specific antibody production in middle-aged mice requires phospholipase A2G2D"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We perform time-frequency wavelet-based analysis to explore how the media coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic influenced the volatility of the Islamic equity indices, covering various sectors of economic activity.

The problem of distinguishing these two parameterizations of the model becomes more severe in the presence of effective mitigation measures.

Patients at two academic medical centers with COVID-19 who required venovenous-ECMO support for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were evaluated retrospectively. During the study period, 33 patients required ECMO support; 16 (48.5%) were discharged alive, 13 died (39.4%), and 4 (12.1%) had ongoing care. Eleven patients had ICH (33.3%). All ICH events occurred in patients who received intravenous anticoagulation. The ICH group had higher C-reactive protein (pa??=a??0.04), and procalcitonin levels (pa??=a??0.02), and IL-6 levels (pa??=a??0.05), lower blood pH before and after ECMO (pa??<a??0.01), and higher activated partial thromboplastin times throughout the hospital stay (pa??<a??0.0001). ICH-free survival was lower in COVID-19 patients than in patients on ECMO for ARDS caused by other viruses (49% vs 79%, pa??=a??0.02).

This study reports 30-day mortality and pulmonary complication rates in patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This international, multicentre, cohort study at 235 hospitals in 24 countries included all patients undergoing surgery who had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed within 7 days before or 30 days after surgery. The primary outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality and was assessed in all enrolled patients. The main secondary outcome measure was pulmonary complications, defined as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or unexpected postoperative ventilation. FINDINGS: This analysis includes 1128 patients who had surgery between Jan 1 and March 31, 2020, of whom 835 (740%) had emergency surgery and 280 (248%) had elective surgery. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed preoperatively in 294 (261%) patients. 30-day mortality was 238% (268 of 1128). Pulmonary complications occurred in 577 (512%) of 1128 patients; 30-day mortality in these patients was 380% (219 of 577), accounting for 817% (219 of 268) of all deaths. In adjusted analyses, 30-day mortality was associated with male sex (odds ratio 175 [95% CI 128-240], p<00001), age 70 years or older versus younger than 70 years (230 [165-322], p<00001), American Society of Anesthesiologists grades 3-5 versus grades 1-2 (235 [157-353], p<00001), malignant versus benign or obstetric diagnosis (155 [101-239], p=0046), emergency versus elective surgery (167 [106-263], p=0026), and major versus minor surgery (152 [101-231], p=0047). INTERPRETATION: Postoperative pulmonary complications occur in half of patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection and are associated with high mortality. Thresholds for surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic should be higher than during normal practice, particularly in men aged 70 years and older. Consideration should be given for postponing non-urgent procedures and promoting non-operative treatment to delay or avoid the need for surgery.

The inaccessibility of center-based rehabilitation further aggravated their motor dysfunctions as well as mental distress, leading to exacerbation of motor and non-motor symptoms, high healthcare utilization and worsened health-related quality of life (HRQOL). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and preliminary effects of the mHealth-delivered home-based mindfulness yoga program on functional balance, motor symptoms, mental health and HRQOL in patients with PD. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective, single-arm, non-randomized feasibility study adopted a sequential explanatory mixed-method design. Adults (aged  18) with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinsons disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage I to III) who were able to stand unaided and walk with or without an assistive device were enrolled via convenience sampling. INTERVENTION: Home-based mindfulness yoga training were delivered via video-conferencing software (Zoom) in eight bi-weekly 90-min sessions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: This current study measured functional balance, motor symptoms, perceived balance confidence, perceived freezing of gait symptoms, anxiety and depression, mindfulness and HRQOL using a tele-assessment approach at baseline and 1-week post-intervention. All participants were invited to attend qualitative individual interviews to explore their experience of using online mindfulness yoga program as a lifestyle intervention for PD rehabilitation. RESULTS: Among the ten patients, 80% completed the program with an adherence rate of 98.4%. All participants were able to learn and practice mindfulness yoga following the eight bi-weekly online mindfulness yoga training sessions, without any significant adverse events. Tele-assessment of outcomes were feasible and uneventful. Qualitative feedback revealed participants had a high preference of using the tele-rehabilitation approach to stay mindful and being active, both physically and socially, while confronting the changes brought by COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The mHealth-delivered home-based mindfulness yoga intervention was feasible, safe, and well-accepted among people with PD to relieve the burden brought by COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies should adopt a design with enhanced rigor, a comparison group, and enlarged sample size to evaluate the efficacy of the program in patients with long-term neurological conditions and/or physical impairments.

The response is modeled by assuming that the rate of change of the reproduction number is proportional to the negative deviation of the incidence rate from an intervention threshold. This delay dynamical system exhibits damped oscillations in one part of the parameter space, and growing oscillations in another, and these are separated by a surface where the solution is a strictly periodic nonlinear oscillation. For the COVID-19 pandemic, the tipping transition from damped to growing oscillations occurs for response delays of about one week, and suggests that, without vaccination, effective control and mitigation of successive epidemic waves cannot be achieved unless NPIs are implemented in a precautionary manner, rather as a response to the present incidence rate. Vaccination increases the quiet intervals between waves, but with delayed response, future flare-ups can only be prevented by establishing a post-pandemic normal with lower basic reproduction number.","output":"The Tipping Effect of Delayed Interventions on the Evolution of COVID-19 Incidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: to analyze elements of the follow-up care provided to premature children amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: qualitative study from the perspective of philosophical hermeneutics, interpreting experiences with childcare provided at home. Twelve mothers and 14 children aged two years old were interviewed online via a text messaging application. Data were analyzed by interpreting meanings. RESULTS: weaknesses stood out in the follow-up care provided to children such as gaps of communication, lack of guidance and delayed immunizations, while care intended to meet health demands was interrupted. Vulnerability aspects affecting child development included: social isolation measures that impeded the children from socializing with their peers, increased screen time, the manifestation of demanding behaviors and irritation and the mothers experiencing an overload of responsibilities. The elements that strengthened maternal care included the mothers being attentive to contagion, enjoying greater experience and satisfaction with the maternal role, spending more time with their children, and recognizing respiratory signs and symptoms, especially fever. CONCLUSION: follow-up care provided to children in stressful situations implies implementing practices that support the wellbeing of children and families, decreasing the likelihood of children being exposed to development deficits, and detecting signs and symptoms timely.

We observed many neutrophils infiltrating the heart muscle after myocardial infarction. Most of these had viable morphology and only few showed signs of nuclear de-condensation, a hallmark of early NET formation. The abundance of NETs was the lowest in acute myocardial infarction when compared to other examined diseases. Since cardiac oxygen supply is abruptly abrogated in acute myocardial infarction, we hypothesized that the resulting tissue hypoxia increased the longevity of the neutrophils. Indeed, the viable cells showed increased nuclear hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) content, and only neutrophils with low HIF-1 started the process of NET formation (chromatin de-condensation and nuclear swelling). Prolonged neutrophil survival, increased oxidative burst and reduced NETs formation were reproduced under low oxygen tensions and by HIF-1 stabilization in vitro.

Cognitive deficits have been linked to the depletion of dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway, but pharmacological treatments for PD have little evidence of improving or delaying cognitive decline. Therefore, exploring non-pharmacological treatment options is important. There have been some promising results of cognitive training interventions in PD, especially for improvements in working memory and executive functions. Yet, existing studies are often underpowered, lacking appropriate control condition, long term follow-up, a thorough description of the intervention and characteristics of the participants. Working memory updating training has previously shown to increase striatal activation in healthy young and old participants as well as dopaminergic neurotransmission in healthy young participants. In the light of dopamine dysfunction in PD, with negative effects on both motor and cognitive functions it is of interest to study if an impaired striatal system can be responsive to a non-invasive, non-pharmacological intervention. METHODS AND DESIGN: The iPARK trial is a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial with a parallel-group design that aims to recruit 80 patients with PD (during the period 02/2017-02/2023). Included patients need to have PD, Hoehn and Yahr staging I-III, be between 45 to 75 years of age and not have a diagnosis of dementia. All patients will undergo 30 sessions (6-8 weeks) of web-based cognitive training performed from home. The target intervention is a process-based training program targeting working memory updating. The placebo program is a low dose short-term memory program. A battery of neuropsychological tests and questionnaires will be performed before training, directly after training, and 16 weeks after training. DISCUSSION: We expect that the iPARK trial will provide novel and clinically useful information on whether updating training is an effective cognitive training paradigm in PD. Further, it will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of cognitive function in PD and provide answers regarding cognitive plasticity as well as determining critical factors for a responsive striatal system.

Previous research has found, furthermore, that existing international and domestic civil-military guidelines hold limited relevance during public health emergencies, including epidemics and pandemics, currently evidenced by the observable lack of coherence and high variance in both international and domestic military approaches to supporting COVID-19 responses worldwide. Methods This article presents a comparative analysis of three of these approachesin China, the United Kingdom, and the Philippinesand maps these countries military contributions to the COVID-19 response across a number of domains. Results Analysis of these case studies provides important insights into the ways that CME exists in unacknowledged contexts and forms;how militaries, particularly domestic forces acting as first responders, play an important role in major health crisis contexts;the confusion surrounding how to understand various non-military armed and security actors;and how pandemics, in particularand other types of largescale health emergencies more broadlyrepresent a unique domain for CME that tests both the international system and international norms.

However, within the time constraints of dermatological clinics, depressive symptoms in psoriasis patients are often overlooked and thus underdiagnosed. The Two Questions Test may serve as a quick screening tool for an initial assessment of depressive burden in these patients. We evaluated its usefulness in the clinical context analyzing the records of patients starting systemic treatment for psoriasis with a selective interleukin (IL)23- or IL17A-inhibitor. In a total sample of N = 139 patients, baseline Two Questions Test scores were analyzed together with measures of psoriatic and psychiatric symptoms. In addition, the development of the Two Questions Test scores over the course of the first 28 weeks of treatment was assessed. No association was found between the Two Questions Test scores and skin symptoms measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index and the visibility of skin lesions. However, skin related quality of life analyzed with the Dermatology Life Quality Index was associated with the Two Questions Test scores. In addition, the longitudinal analysis revealed improvement in Two Questions Test outcomes over the course of patients' treatment.

In this study, an immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual radiography simulation tool was piloted in an undergraduate Radiography curriculum and user feedback retrieved. METHODS: The 3D virtual simulation tool by Virtual Medical Coaching Ltd was introduced to first year radiography students (n = 105). This technology guided students through a comprehensive process of learning anatomy, radiographic positioning and pathology. Students then X-rayed a virtual patient in the VR suite using HTC Vive Pro? headsets and hand controllers. Instant feedback was provided. An online survey was later disseminated to students to gather user feedback. Thematic and descriptive statistical analyses were applied. RESULTS: A response rate of 79% (n = 83) was achieved. Most respondents (58%) reported enjoying VR simulation, whilst some felt indifferent towards it (27%). Ninety-four percent would recommend this tool to other students. The mean length of time it took for students to feel comfortable using the technology was 60 min (10C240 min). Most respondents (58%) desired more VR access. Students attributed enhanced confidence in the areas of beam collimation (75%), anatomical marker placement (63%), centring of the X-ray tube (64%) and exposure parameter selection (56%) to their VR practice. Many students (55%) advocated the use of VR in formative or low stakes assessments. Issues flagged included technical glitches, inability to palpate patient and lack of constructive feedback. CONCLUSION: Student feedback indicates that 3D virtual radiography simulation is a valuable pedagogical tool in radiography education IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: 3D immersive VR simulation is perceived by radiography students to be a valuable learning resource.

In this study, we used a two-year dataset from a longitudinal field study of peridomestic wild bird populations in the United Arab Emirates during which thousands of birds from various species were captured, sampled and tested for Newcastle disease virus exposure using a serological test. We developed a multi-event capture-recapture model to estimate important demographic and epidemiological parameters of the disease. The modelling outputs provided important insights into the understanding of Newcastle disease dynamics in peridomestics birds, which varies according to ecological and epidemiological parameters, and useful information in terms of surveillance strategies. To our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to model the dynamics of Newcastle disease in wild bird populations by combining longitudinal capture data and serological test results.

In this article, we propose a novel deep learning-based solution using chest X-rays which can help in rapid triaging of COVID-19 patients. The proposed solution uses image enhancement, image segmentation, and employs a modified stacked ensemble model consisting of four CNN base-learners along with Naive Bayes as meta-learner to classify chest X-rays into three classes viz.

This study aimed to explore the rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity in saliva and gastrointestinal fluids to which endoscopy medical staff are exposed. METHODS: The study was a single-center cross-sectional study. From June 1 to July 31, 2020, all patients who underwent GIE at Yokohama City University Hospital were registered. All patients provided 3 mL of saliva. For upper GIE, 10 mL of gastric fluid was collected through the endoscope. For lower GIE, 10 mL of intestinal fluid was collected through the endoscope. The primary outcome was the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and gastrointestinal fluids. We also analyzed serum-specific antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 and patients' background information. RESULTS: A total of 783 samples (560 upper GIE and 223 lower GIE samples) were analyzed.

It has been reported to be somewhat more efficient and durable than laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). However, it is considered more invasive and, therefore, more hazardous. There is a lack of unity in complication reporting following bariatric surgery. Thus, there is a possible misconception regarding the relative safety of the two major bariatric procedures performed worldwide. This may have contributed to a shift in practice with LSG gaining momentum \\"at the expense\\" of LRYGBP. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative safety of primary LSG and LRYGBP according to the Clavien-Dindo complication grading system. METHODS A total of 2651 and 554 patients underwent primary LSG and LRYGBP, respectively at three high-volume centers. Thirty-day perioperative complications were recorded and graded. Length of hospital stays (LOS) and readmission rates were collected as well. RESULTS Complications occurred in 110 (3.7%) and 24 (4.3%) patients following LSG and LRYGBP, respectively (p = 0.9). No significant difference was found between the groups regarding overall and complication-grade-specific rates. Individual complication types were unevenly distributed, but not significantly so. Patients with complications were older than those without (47 and 43 years, respectively; p = 0.01). Gender was not a risk factor for complication. Median LOS and readmission rates were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS LSG and LRYGBP are equally safe, at least in the perioperative period.

Not surprisingly, many viruses encode deISGylating activities to antagonize its effect. Here we show that infection by Zika, SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses induce ISG15-modifying enzymes. While influenza and Zika viruses induce ISGylation, SARS-CoV-2 triggers deISGylation instead to generate free ISG15. The ratio of free versus conjugated ISG15 driven by the papain-like protease (PLpro) enzyme of SARS-CoV-2 correlates with macrophage polarization toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype and attenuated antigen presentation.

Critics argue that VAT reductions are ineffective because of limited pass-through of temporary measures to consumer prices and in presence of lockdown measures. Advocates emphasize positive effects on durables and stress that a VAT reduction can at least partly substitute for a limited monetary policy response under the ZLB. We build a DSGE model which is capable to address these channels. Our model distinguishes between sectors directly and indirectly affected by the lockdown. This allows us to trace economic spillovers of lockdown measures to the rest of the economy and the differentiated impact of VAT measures on both sectors. We disaggregate consumption into durables and non-durables for both financially constrained and unconstrained households and we allow for imperfect pass-through of VAT measures into consumer prices. In general, if we include the durable investment channel we find robust sizeable effects of VAT changes on consumption even under a limited VAT pass-through. For the specific situation in Germany, we analyze the impact of the VAT reduction in conjunction with the lockdowns in 2020 Q2 to Q4. We use non-linear solution techniques to solve the model in the presence of a ZLB, forced savings and a lockdown constraint. We find a VAT short-term multiplier of one, which reduces over the medium term. Thus, the temporary VAT reduction is an effective instrument in the short-term but not efficient with regard to medium-term budget sustainability. Furthermore, we can show that the VAT reduction is able to mimic the macroeconomic effects of a central bank reaction according to a Taylor rule in case of a lockdown shock. However, compared to the monetary policy reaction the VAT reduction has only small direct effects on private investments.","output":"Temporary VAT Reduction during the Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Molecular testing such as nasopharyngeal viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (NVP) is available now in most hospitals and widely used to identify respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in solid organ transplantation (SOT) recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective multicenter study at 8 hospitals from March 1, 2016, to April 30, 2019. We included all adult SOT recipients who were admitted to the hospitals and had their first NVP post transplantation. RESULTS: A total of 102 adult SOT recipients were enrolled. NVP test was positive in 33 (32.4%) SOT recipients and negative in 69 (67.6%). Median age was more than 60 years old with female predominance in both groups. The majority of patients who had positive NVP were hospitalized either in fall or winter seasons (91%). RVI symptoms were documented in about 73% of the positive NVP group. Rhinovirus was the most common identified virus (48.4%). On logistic regression analysis, clinical presentation in fall or winter seasons, presenting with upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms and taking prednisone &#8805;10 mg/d were significantly associated with positive NVP.

SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the novel coronavirus, previously dubbed 2019-nCoV, and now officially named SARS-CoV-2, are the causative agents of the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 disease outbreaks, respectively. Safe vaccines that rapidly induce potent and long-lasting virus-specific immune responses against these infectious agents are urgently needed. The coronavirus spike (S) protein, a characteristic structural component of the viral envelope, is considered a key target for vaccines for the prevention of coronavirus infection. METHODS: We first generated codon optimized MERS-S1 subunit vaccines fused with a foldon trimerization domain to mimic the native viral structure. In variant constructs, we engineered immune stimulants (RS09 or flagellin, as TLR4 or TLR5 agonists, respectively) into this trimeric design. We comprehensively tested the pre-clinical immunogenicity of MERS-CoV vaccines in mice when delivered subcutaneously by traditional needle injection, or intracutaneously by dissolving microneedle arrays (MNAs) by evaluating virus specific IgG antibodies in the serum of vaccinated mice by ELISA and using virus neutralization assays. Driven by the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, we utilized this strategy to rapidly develop MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines and tested their pre-clinical immunogenicity in vivo by exploiting our substantial experience with MNA MERS-CoV vaccines. FINDINGS: Here we describe the development of MNA delivered MERS-CoV vaccines and their pre-clinical immunogenicity. Specifically, MNA delivered MERS-S1 subunit vaccines elicited strong and long-lasting antigen-specific antibody responses. Building on our ongoing efforts to develop MERS-CoV vaccines, promising immunogenicity of MNA-delivered MERS-CoV vaccines, and our experience with MNA fabrication and delivery, including clinical trials, we rapidly designed and produced clinically-translatable MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines within 4 weeks of the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 sequence. Most importantly, these MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines elicited potent antigen-specific antibody responses that were evident beginning 2 weeks after immunization. INTERPRETATION: MNA delivery of coronaviruses-S1 subunit vaccines is a promising immunization strategy against coronavirus infection. Progressive scientific and technological efforts enable quicker responses to emerging pandemics. Our ongoing efforts to develop MNA-MERS-S1 subunit vaccines enabled us to rapidly design and produce MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines capable of inducing potent virus-specific antibody responses. Collectively, our results support the clinical development of MNA delivered recombinant protein subunit vaccines against SARS, MERS, COVID-19, and other emerging infectious diseases.","output":"Microneedle array delivered recombinant coronavirus vaccines: Immunogenicity and rapid translational development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Justifying draconian measures during the Covid-19 pandemic was difficult not only because of the restriction of individual rights, but also because of its economic impact.

Novel vaccines will be required to reach global targets and reverse setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic. We estimated the impact of novel tuberculosis vaccines in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), under alternative delivery scenarios. Methods We calibrated a tuberculosis model to 105 LMICs (93% of global incidence). Vaccine scenarios were implemented as Basecase: routine vaccination of 9-year-olds and a one-time vaccination campaign for ages []10 with country-specific introduction between 2028[ndash]2047 and 5-year scale-up to target coverage; Accelerated Scale-up: as Basecase, but all countries introducing in 2025 with instant scale-up; and Routine Only: as Basecase, but routine vaccination only. Vaccines protected against disease for 10-years, with 50% efficacy. Findings The Basecase scenario reduced tuberculosis incidence (19.5% [95% uncertainty range=18.3-21.6%]) and mortality (20.6% [19.2-23.4%]) rates in 2050 and prevented 3.6 (3.3-3.9) million deaths before 2050, including 1.6 million in the WHO South-East Asian region. The Accelerated Scale-up scenario reduced tuberculosis incidence (25.2% [23.9-27.5%]), mortality (26.7% [25.2-29.9%]), and prevented 7.9 (7.3-8.5) million deaths. The Routine Only scenario reduced tuberculosis incidence (9.9% [9.0-11.6%]), mortality (9.9% [8.9-12.3%]), and prevented 1.1 (0.9-1.2) million deaths. Interpretations Novel tuberculosis vaccines could have substantial impact, which will vary depending on delivery strategy. Including a campaign will be crucial for rapid impact. Accelerated introduction similar to the pace of COVID-19 vaccines could approximately double the lives saved before 2050.

The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-associated diarrhea remains poorly understood. We hypothesize that crosstalk between enterocytes and the enteric nervous system (ENS) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated diarrhea. We studied the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and release of Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), which act on enteric neurons and stimulate the production of neurotransmitters. The influence of ER stress and enteric neuron-derived vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) on the expression of electrolyte transporter Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) was also examined. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020) was propagated in Vero-E6 cells. Caco-2, a human colon epithelial cell line, expresses the essential SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and was thus used for infection (MOI, ~0.01). We used Western blotting to assess the expression of ER stress (phospho-PERK and Xbp1s) and DAMP (HMGB1) markers at 48 hours post-infection. Primary mouse enteric neurons were co-cultured with Caco-2 cells, pre-treated for 24 hours with 2 M tunicamycin to induce ER stress. Supernatants from enteric neurons were used to assess the expression of VIP by ELISA. Primary enteric neurons were treated with HMGB1 or ATP (another form of DAMPs), and the expression of c-FOS, a marker of neuronal activity, was determined by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. Results: We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection of Caco-2 cells led to increased expression of phospho-PERK and Xbp1s. Compared to uninfected control, infected Caco-2 cells secreted HMGB1 into culture media, indicating epithelial production of DAMPs in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Tunicamycin was used to induce ER-stress and secretion of HMGB1 by Caco-2, mimicking SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, enteric neurons co-cultured with tunicamycin-treated Caco-2 cells secreted significantly higher levels of VIP. Treating Caco-2 cells with tunicamycin or VIP on the basolateral side led to decreased surface NHE3 expression, suggesting a potential impairment of intestinal electrolyte/fluid absorption. More-over, HMGB1 and ATP both increased the expression of phospho-c-FOS in cultured enteric neurons, indicating DAMP-induced neuronal activation. Conclusions: Our findings demon-strate that enterocytes infected by SARS-CoV-2 release DAMPs with the capacity to induce VIP secretion by the enteric neurons, which in turn acts on enterocytes and inhibits apical localization of NHE3. These findings establish basic mechanisms relevant to diarrheal disease in COVID-19 patients and identify potential targets for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection of the gastrointestinal tract.","output":"Fr134 SARS-COV-2 INDUCES EPITHYELIAL-NEURONAL CROSSTALK STIMULATING VASOACTIVE INTESTINAL PEPTIDE RELEASE AS A POTENTIAL MECHANISM OF COVID-19-ASSOCIATED DIARRHEA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses are a class of RNA viruses that can cause respiratory and intestinal infections in animals and humans.

DESIGN AND SETTING A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over feasibility trial in Melbourne, Australia. INTERVENTIONS After two-week run-in participants were randomized to either ZS (encapsulated granules; 2 g daily) or placebo for four weeks. After four-weeks wash-out, participants swapped to the other treatment for four weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Sleep quality assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Quality of life, mood, functional impairment and sleep parameters were also assessed. RESULTS Twelve participants were randomized and completed both periods of cross-over (six in each sequence). Feasibility endpoints were acceptable. Improvements for sleep quality measured on the PSQI were statistically significant during the ZS treatment periods compared to placebo (t = -2.276, df = 10, 95% CI -3.3 to -0.04, p = 0.046). There was no evidence of any significant carryover effects. However, there were period effects. Other outcomes showed no statistically significant difference between the treatments. Subjective sleep parameters measured on sleep diaries showed improvements after ZS in terms of total sleep time, sleep efficiency and sleep onset latency, but not after placebo.

Since then, 3 280 000 cases have been confirmed and 75.305 people have died. We aimed to clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics related with poor short-term prognosis in patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Observational, retrospective single-center study including consecutive patients (40yo) diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 through PCR, since March 2nd to 20th 2020 in our center in Spain. The primary endpoint (PE) was the combined of all-cause death or need for orotracheal intubation within the first 30 days of infection symptoms. Results: 704 patients were included (table). A follow-up period of thirtydays was fully completed in 692 of 704 patients (98.3%). At the end of this period, 148 patients (21.4%) met the PE;they were older, more frequently male, obese and smokers. Patients who met the PE had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, peripheral and cerebrovascular disease, cancer and lung pathologies. They received more frequently therapies with reninangiotensin system inhibitors, betablockers, calcium channel blockers and statins, as well as antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies Multivariate analysis showed that age (OR 1.99 for every 10 years, 95% CI [1.637-2.4], p<0.001), female sex (OR 0.49, [0.30-0.80], p=0.004), diabetes (OR 2.09, [1.17-3.71], p=0.012), lung disease (OR 1.99, [1.14- 3.44], p=0.014) and body mass index (OR 1.33 for each 5 kg/m2 increased, [1.05-1.68], p=0.017) were predictors of the PE. Hypertension was not significantly related to the PE (OR 1.55, [0.93-2.60], p=0.09) Conclusion: In our group of patients with SARS-CoV-2, age, male sex, diabetes, lung disease and obesity were found to be independent predictors of the combined of all case death or need for orotracheal intubation within the first 30 days of infection symptoms.

Due to the highly contagious nature of the virus, the World Health Organization has recommended that people comply with a set of preventive measures to reduce the infection rate (e.g., social distancing, wearing a face mask, thorough personal hygiene). However, people typically differ in the extent to which they are willing to comply with such recommendations, as they imply certain personal restrictions. The present study aimed to investigate whether narcissism levels and message framing strategies affect individuals willingness to accept personal restrictions and, consequently, comply with a set of preventive health behaviors. Results reveal that people high (vs. low) in grandiose narcissism are less likely to accept personal restrictions and comply with preventive health behaviors, with negative (vs. positive) message framing constituting a more effective strategy for convincing such individuals to comply with said restrictions and behaviors. This effect can be explained through a more pronounced willingness of participants high in grandiose narcissism to accept personal restrictions to protect themselves (egoistic motivation) but not through a willingness to protect vulnerable people (altruistic motivation). Our findings suggest that individuals who remain uncooperative during pandemics could be more effectively addressed with adapted message framing strategies and incentives tailor-made for their distinct personalities.","output":"Selfless or Selfish?

Previously, we found that MHV-JHM neurovirulence was marked by diminished expression of interferon- (IFN-) mRNA and a reduced presence of CD8 T cells in the CNS concomitant with heightened macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 transcript levels and greater macrophage infiltration relative to MHV-A59 infection. Here, the ability of the S and non-spike genes to regulate these immune responses was evaluated using chimeric viruses. Chimeric viruses WTR13 and S4R22 were made on MHV-A59 variant backgrounds and, respectively, contained the S gene of MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM. Unexpectedly, genes other than S appeared to modulate events critical to viral replication and survival. Unlike unresolving MHV-JHM infections, the clearance of WTR13 and S4R22 infections coincided with strong IFN- transcription and an increase in the number of CD8 T cells infiltrating into the CNS. However, despite the absence of detectable viral titers, approximately 40% of S4R22-infected mice succumbed within 3 weeks, indicating that the enhanced mortality following S4R22 infection was not associated with high viral titers. Instead, similar to the MHV-JHM infection, reduced survival following S4R22 infection was observed in the presence of elevated MIP-1 and MIP-1 mRNA accumulation and enhanced macrophage numbers within infected brains. These observations suggest that the S protein of MHV-JHM influences neurovirulence through the induction of MIP-1- and MIP-1-driven macrophage immunopathology.","output":"Mouse hepatitis virus neurovirulence: evidence of a linkage between S glycoprotein expression and immunopathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) typically present with respiratory symptoms, but little is known about the disease's potential neurological complications.We report a case of Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) following a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, in association with leptomeningeal enhancement.

However, there is little data on the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on chemosensory function. METHODS: Twenty three SARS-CoV-2-positive patients diagnosed in spring 2020 with subjective hyposmia (out of 57 positive patients, 40.3%) were compared to SARS-CoV-2-positive patients without hyposmia (n = 19) and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients (n = 14). Chemosensory function was assessed by the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT), Taste Strips (TS), Visual Analogue Scales (VAS), and the SNOT-22. The initial cohort with hyposmia were also examined at 8 weeks and 6 months after initial examination. RESULTS: There were no differences between the SARS-CoV-2-positive cohort without hyposmia and negative controls in terms of BSIT (8.5  2.6 vs. 10.2  1.8), TS (3.4  0.6 vs. 3.9  0.3) or VAS (2.1  1.3 vs. 1.1  0.5); yet the SNOT-22 was significantly elevated (27.7  11.2 vs. 16.4  10.8).

All CTs were evaluated by two expert radiologists, in consensus, at the same reading session, using a computer-aided tool for quantification of the pulmonary disease. The parameters obtained using the computer tool included the healthy residual parenchyma, ground glass opacity, consolidation, and total lung volume. Results: statistically significant differences (p value  0.05) were found among quantified volumes of healthy residual parenchyma, ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, and total lung volume, considering different clinical conditions (stable, improved, and worsened). Statistically significant differences were found among quantified volumes for healthy residual parenchyma, GGO, and consolidation (p value  0.05) between dead patients and discharged patients. CT was not performed on cadavers; the death was an outcome, which was retrospectively included to differentiate findings of patients who survived vs. patients who died during hospitalization. Among discharged patients, complete disease resolutions on CT scans were observed in 62/129 patients with lung disease involvement 5%; lung disease involvement from 5% to 15% was found in 40/129 patients, while 27/129 patients had lung disease involvement between 16 and 30%.

It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made governments and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using nonpharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation, and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number and effective reproduction numbers were computed with and without interventions, respectively, and were used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin's maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population. While, the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to reduce the virus to the barest minimum.","output":"Controlling the Spread of COVID-19: Optimal Control Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Most studies of the epidemic cycles of the pandemic of Sars-CoV-2, or COVID-19 as it became known, define the beginning of specific cycles in countries from the laboratory identification of the first cases of infection, however, there is the awareness that cycles may have started earlier, without proper identification.

The Logistic Model it is used to obtain three parameters of the epidemic cycle of COVID-19, namely: the final count for the total infected, the daily infection rate and the lag time. Complimentary, a novel inventory model is proposed to calculate the number of infective persons, as well as to determine the incubation period. Methods: The data on epidemic cycles of Germany, Italy, and Sweden are treated previously by the Moving Average Method with Initial value (MAMI), then a variation of the Logistic Model, obtained through curve-fitting, is used to obtain the three parameters. The inventory model is introduced to calculate the actual number of infected persons and the behavior of the incubation period is analyzed. Results: After comparing data from the three countries it is possible to determine the actual probable dates of the beginning of the epidemic cycles for each one, determine the size of the incubation period, as well as to determine the total number of infective persons during the cycle.

We find that CIP in pandemic time can significantly increase capacity to tens or even thousands of times of normal capacity in a short period, which can enhance firmsbrand values and profiles and improve their social impacts and benefits. We provide managerial insights and guidance to firms with potential CIP capability and governments in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this study, we report the Cp values of lithium and valproic acid (VPA), alone and in combination, mostly in bipolar patients admitted to an Italian clinical center of the University of Pisa during the years 2016C2020, which include 12,294 samples of VPA, 7449 of lithium and 1118 of both in combination. Lithium and VPA are the most utilized drugs in treating bipolar disorders, and their TDM is strongly recommended by recent guidelines. In relation to lithium Cp monitoring, several studies have underlined that 0.5C0.8 mmol/L is the optimal range for chronic treatment, and below 0.4 mmol/L, it is unlikely to produce a clinical response. For VPA, the therapeutic range is 50C100 g/mL and a linear correlation between Cp and clinical efficacy has been proposed, where below 50 g/mL, the clinical efficacy of VPA has not been proven thus far. Toxic levels of both drugs were rarely found in our study, while a high percentage of patients, about one-third, had sub-therapeutic Cp during their treatments. In addition, in several cases of patients receiving multiple blood sampling, the initial subtherapeutic Cp changed only partially without reaching its therapeutic window. In relation to age, we found a higher percentage of lithium and VPA Cp values in range in the adolescents than in the adults and elderly groups. No differences were reported when analyzing the distribution of Cp values in males and females. In conclusion, this present study suggests that TDM is widely used by many specialists, but there is still a window of improvement for optimizing pharmacological treatments in clinical practice.","output":"A 5-Year Study of Lithium and Valproic Acid Drug Monitoring in Patients with Bipolar Disorders in an Italian Clinical Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ion channels are necessary for correct lysosomal function including degradation of cargoes originating from endocytosis.

Protein precipitation as sample preparation, without the need of a time-consuming deglucuronidation step for the quantification of 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide, resulted in a simple and rapid assay suitable for clinical practice with a total runtime of only 1.1 min. The four components and the isotope-labeled internal standards were separated on a C18 column and detection was performed with a triple-stage quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in positive ionization mode. The method was validated based on the \\"Guidance for Industry Bioanalytical Method Validation\\" (Food and Drug Administration, FDA) and the \\"Guideline on bioanalytical method validation\\" of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Linearity was proven over the ranges of 5-1500 g/L for midazolam, 1-hydroxymidazolam and 4-hydroxymidazolam and 25-5000 g/L for 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide, using a sample volume of 100 L. Matrix comparison indicated that the assay is also applicable to other human matrices like EDTA and heparin plasma and urine. Stability experiments showed good results for the stability of midazolam, 1-hydroxymidazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide in serum, EDTA and heparin plasma and urine stored for 7 days under different conditions. At room temperature, 4-hydroxymidazo-lam is stable for 7 days in EDTA plasma, but stable for only 3 days in serum and heparin plasma and less than 24 h in urine. All four compounds were found to be stable in serum, EDTA plasma, heparin plasma and urine for 7 days after sample preparation and for 3 freeze-thaw cycles.

We aimed to measure racial and socioeconomic disparities in the prioritization of CRC screening or adenoma surveillance during the COVID reopening period. METHODS We identified CRC screening or surveillance colonoscopies performed during two time periods: (1) 9 June 2019-30 September 2019 (pre-COVID) and (2) 9 June 2020-30 September 2020 (COVID reopening). We recorded the procedure indication, patient age, sex, race/ethnicity, primary language, insurance status and zip code. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors independently associated with undergoing colonoscopy in the COVID reopening era. RESULTS We identified 1473 colonoscopies for CRC screening or adenoma surveillance; 890 occurred in the pre-COVID period and 583 occurred in the COVID reopening period. In total 342 (38.4%) pre-COVID patients underwent adenoma surveillance and 548 (61.6%) underwent CRC screening; in the COVID reopening cohort, 257 (44.1%) underwent adenoma surveillance and 326 (55.9%) underwent CRC screening (P = 0.031). This increased proportion of surveillance procedures in the reopening cohort was statistically significant on multivariable analysis [odds ratio (OR), 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.001-1.58]. Black patients comprised 17.4% of the pre-COVID cohort, which declined to 15.3% (P = 0.613). There was a trend toward an inverse association between reopening phase colonoscopy and Medicaid insurance compared with commercial insurance (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.49-1.04). No significant associations were found between reopening phase colonoscopy and the remaining variables.

Often there is a trade-off between these two values, as the faster a decision is made, the less information is considered. This paper presents a deep learning model pipeline that balances these two values with the primary goal of classifying human lung X-rays into three categories: pneumonia, covid-19 and normal. Through this process, we tried to explore whether the quality of an image can enhance the learning process to a greater extent as opposed to having larger number of images. For this purpose, we follow two approaches by viewing quality and quantity as competing objectives to increasing the level of information obtained. The first is through increasing the number of X-ray images in the dataset, and the second is through improving the quality of the X-ray images. In the first approach, our goal is achieved using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate plasmatic covid-19 class X-rays, while in the second approach, we improve the resolution of the X-ray images. To find the hyperparameters in both approaches that lead to better system performance, we exploit the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Rapid training and hyperparameter tuning better perform through this algorithm. Our experiments depict the performance that our models, based on the two approaches, achieved. Accuracy reaches 93% while sensitivity reaches 90% over Covid-19 cases.

In this review, the effects of COVID-19 infection on CVD were summarized as follows: (I) angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in the attack on vascular endothelial cells by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), leading to endothelial damage and increased subintimal inflammation, which are followed by hemorrhage or thrombosis; (II) SARS-CoV-2 could alter the expression/activity of ACE2, consequently resulting in the disruption of renin-angiotensin system which is associated with the occurrence and progression of atherosclerosis; (III) upregulation of neutrophil extracellular traps has been detected in COVID-19 patients, which is closely associated with immunothrombosis; (IV) the inflammatory cascade induced by SARS-CoV-2 often leads to hypercoagulability and promotes the formation and progress of atherosclerosis; (V) antiphospholipid antibodies are also detected in plasma of some severe cases, which aggravate the thrombosis through the formation of immune complexes; (VI) hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients may trigger CVD by increasing oxidative stress and blood viscosity; (VII) the COVID-19 outbreak is a global emergency and causes psychological stress, which could be a potential risk factor of CVD as coagulation, and fibrinolysis may be affected.

To address this gap in knowledge we evaluate neural targets defined by activation and functional connectivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex-anchored cognitive control circuit, regions of the default mode network and attention circuit, and interactions with the subgenual anterior cingulate. We evaluate whether these targets and interactions between them change in a dose-dependent manner, whether changes in these neural targets correspond to changes in cognitive behavioral performance, and whether baseline and early change in neural target and cognitive behavioral performance predict subsequent symptom severity, suicidality, and quality of life outcomes. This study is designed as a pragmatic, mechanistic trial partnering with the National Clinical TMS Program of the Veterans Health Administration. METHODS: Target enrollment consists of 100 veterans with pharmacoresistant Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). All veterans will receive a clinical course of TMS and will be assessed at baseline pre-TMS commencement, first week after initiation of TMS (targeting five sessions) and post-treatment at the completion of TMS (targeting 30 sessions). Veterans will be assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a cognitive behavioral performance battery, and established questionnaires. Multivariate linear mixed models will be used to assess whether neural targets change with TMS as a function of dose (Aim 1), whether extent and change of neural target relates to and predicts extent of behavioral performance (Aim 3), and whether extent of neural target change predicts improvement in symptom severity, suicidality, and quality of life (Aim 3). For all three aims, we will also assess the contribution of baseline moderators such as biological sex and age. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, our study will be the first pragmatic, mechanistic observational trial to use fMRI imaging and cognitive-behavioral performance as biomarkers of TMS treatment response in pharmacoresistant MDD. The results of this trial will allow providers to select suitable candidates for TMS treatment and better predict treatment response by assessing circuit connectivity and cognitive-behavioral performance at baseline and during early treatment.

METHODS: The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) surveyed IC fellows training in both accredited and advanced non\\\\accredited programs, as well as their program directors (PD). RESULTS: 135 IC fellows and 152 PD responded. All respondents noted reductions in procedural volumes beginning in March 2020. At that time, only 43% of IC fellows had performed > 250 PCI. If restrictions were lifted by May 15, 2020 78% of IC fellows believed they would perform > 250 PCI, but fell to only 70% if restrictions persisted until the end of the academic year. 49% of IC fellows felt that their procedural competency was impaired by COVID\\\\19, while 97% of PD believed that IC fellows would be procedurally competent at the end of their training. Most IC fellows (65%) noted increased stress at work and at home, and many felt that job searches and/or existing offers were adversely affected by the pandemic.

We sought to assess the independent association of ARDS with in-hospital mortality among intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis. METHODS: We studied two prospective sepsis cohorts drawn from the Early Assessment of Renal and Lung Injury (EARLI; n = 474) and Validating Acute Lung Injury markers for Diagnosis (VALID; n = 337) cohorts. ARDS was defined by Berlin criteria. We used logistic regression to compare in-hospital mortality in patients with and without ARDS, controlling for baseline severity of illness. We also estimated attributable mortality, adjusted for illness severity by stratification. RESULTS: ARDS occurred in 195 EARLI patients (41%) and 99 VALID patients (29%). ARDS was independently associated with risk of hospital death in multivariate analysis, even after controlling for severity of illness, as measured by APACHE II (odds ratio [OR] 1.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02, 2.67), p = 0.04 in EARLI; OR 2.12 (CI 1.16, 3.92), p = 0.02 in VALID). Patients with severe ARDS (P/F < 100) primarily drove this relationship. The attributable mortality of ARDS was 27% (CI 14%, 37%) in EARLI and 37% (CI 10%, 51%) in VALID. ARDS was independently associated with ICU mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and ventilator-free days.

Assessing unmet needs is crucial to achieving quality cancer care and patient satisfaction. In this study, we aimed to identify gaps in supportive care needs among adult cancer survivors seen at King Hussein Cancer Center in Amman, Jordan, explore predictors of unmet needs and assess the relationship between unmet supportive care needs and quality of life of adult cancer survivors. We confirmed the presence of several unmet needs in this population of cancer survivors that were evident in many domains. Late-stage diagnosis and quality of life as reported by study participants provided additional and independent information for unmet needs in several domains. Overall, this needs assessment identified problem areas for targeting interventions across the Jordanian cancer survivor population and understanding these findings highlights opportunities for intervention to address gaps in care. ABSTRACT: Background: Cancer survivors are often underprepared for what to expect post-treatment, and there are knowledge gaps regarding cancer survivors supportive care needs in Jordan and neighboring Arab countries. This study aimed to identify gaps in supportive care needs among adult cancer survivors seen at King Hussein Cancer Center in Amman, Jordan, and explore predictors of unmet needs. Methods: This was an observational cross-sectional study using a modified version of the Supportive Care Needs Survey 34 item short form (SCNS-SF34). Results: Two hundred and forty adult cancer survivors completed the study questionnaire. The assessed needs were highest in the financial domain, including covering living expenses, managing cancer treatment adverse effects and co-morbidities. The least prevalent reported needs were in sexuality and reproductive consultations. Late-stage diagnosis was independently associated with higher physical, psychological, health system/information, financial and overall need scores, with p-values of 0.032, 0.027, 0.052, 0.002 and 0.024, respectively.

Fields such as finance (fraud detection), information security (intrusion detection), healthcare, and others all benefit from anomaly detection. Intuitively, anomalies in time series are time points or sequences of time points that deviate from normal behavior characterized by periodic oscillations and long-term trends. For example, the typical activity on e-commerce websites exhibits weekly periodicity and grows steadily before holidays. Similarly, domestic usage of electricity exhibits daily and weekly oscillations combined with long-term season-dependent trends. How can we accurately detect anomalies in such domains while simultaneously learning a model for normal behavior? We propose a robust offline unsupervised framework for anomaly detection in seasonal multivariate time series, called AURORA. A key innovation in our framework is a general background behavior model that unifies periodicity and long-term trends. To this end, we leverage a Ramanujan periodic dictionary and a spline-based dictionary to capture both seasonal and trend patterns. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. AURORA has significant advantages over existing models for anomaly detection, including high accuracy (AUC of up to 0.98), interpretability of recovered normal behavior ([Formula: see text] accuracy in period detection), and the ability to detect both point and contextual anomalies. In addition, AURORA is orders of magnitude faster than baselines.","output":"AURORA: A Unified fRamework fOR Anomaly detection on multivariate time series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The transmission and evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are of paramount importance in controlling and combating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2's evolutionary characteristics and general trend. In this work, we present a comprehensive genotyping analysis of existing SARS-CoV-2 mutations. We reveal that host immune response via APOBEC and ADAR gene editing gives rise to near 65% of recorded mutations. Additionally, we show that children under age five and the elderly may be at high risk from COVID-19 because of their overreaction to the viral infection. Moreover, we uncover that populations of Oceania and Africa react significantly more intensively to SARS-CoV-2 infection than those of Europe and Asia, which may explain why African Americans were shown to be at increased risk of dying from COVID-19, in addition to their high risk of COVID-19 infection caused by systemic health and social inequities.

The Ochsner Health population is 31% black non-Hispanic and 65% white non-Hispanic. The primary outcomes were hospitalization and in-hospital death. RESULTS: A total of 3626 patients tested positive, of whom 145 were excluded (84 had missing data on race or ethnic group, 9 were Hispanic, and 52 were Asian or of another race or ethnic group). Of the 3481 Covid-19-positive patients included in our analyses, 60.0% were female, 70.4% were black non-Hispanic, and 29.6% were white non-Hispanic. Black patients had higher prevalences of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease than white patients. A total of 39.7% of Covid-19-positive patients (1382 patients) were hospitalized, 76.9% of whom were black. In multivariable analyses, black race, increasing age, a higher score on the Charlson Comorbidity Index (indicating a greater burden of illness), public insurance (Medicare or Medicaid), residence in a low-income area, and obesity were associated with increased odds of hospital admission. Among the 326 patients who died from Covid-19, 70.6% were black.

Using the murine MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we previously demonstrated that antagonism of the chemokine receptor CXCR7 blocks endothelial cell sequestration of CXCL12, thereby enhancing the abluminal localization of CXCR4-expressing leukocytes. CXCR7 antagonism led to decreased parenchymal entry of leukocytes and amelioration of ongoing disease during EAE. Of note, animals that received high doses of CXCR7 antagonist recovered to baseline function, as assessed by standard clinical scoring. Because functional recovery reflects axonal integrity, we utilized diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to evaluate axonal injury in CXCR7 antagonist- versus vehicle-treated mice after recovery from EAE. METHODS: C57BL6/J mice underwent adoptive transfer of MOG-reactive Th1 cells and were treated daily with either CXCR7 antagonist or vehicle for 28 days; and then evaluated by DTI to assess for axonal injury. After imaging, spinal cords underwent histological analysis of myelin and oligodendrocytes via staining with luxol fast blue (LFB), and immunofluorescence for myelin basic protein (MBP) and glutathione S-transferase- (GST-). Detection of non-phosphorylated neurofilament H (NH-F) was also performed to detect injured axons. Statistical analysis for EAE scores, DTI parameters and non-phosphorylated NH-F immunofluorescence were done by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test. For all statistical analysis a p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In vivo DTI maps of spinal cord ventrolateral white matter (VLWM) axial diffusivities of na?ve and CXCR7 antagonist-treated mice were indistinguishable, while vehicle-treated animals exhibited decreased axial diffusivities. Quantitative differences in injured axons, as assessed via detection of non-phosphorylated NH-F, were consistent with axial diffusivity measurements. Overall, qualitative myelin content and presence of oligodendrocytes were similar in all treatment groups, as expected by their radial diffusivity values. Quantitative assessment of persistent inflammatory infiltrates revealed significant decreases within the parenchyma of CXCR7 antagonist-treated mice versus controls. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that CXCR7 antagonism not only prevents persistent inflammation but also preserves axonal integrity.

Cytoplasmic viral RNA is recognized by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors, which trigger type I interferon (IFN) production. Secreted type I IFN activates ubiquitously expressed type I IFN receptor and induces IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). To suppress viral replication, several nucleases degrade viral RNA. RNase L is an ISG with endonuclease activity that degrades viral RNA, producing small RNA that activates RIG-I, resulting in the amplification of type I IFN production. Moreover, recent studies have elucidated novel links between viral RNA recognition and degradation. The RNA exosome is a protein complex that includes nucleases and is essential for host and viral RNA decay. Although the small RNAs produced by the RNA exosome do not activate RIG-I, several accessory factors of the RNA exosome promote RIG-I activation. Zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is an accessory factor that recognizes viral RNA and promotes viral RNA degradation via the RNA exosome. ZAPS is an alternative splicing form of ZAP and promotes RIG-I oligomerization and ATPase activity, resulting in RIG-I activation. DDX60 is another cofactor involved in the viral RNA degradation via the RNA exosome. The DDX60 protein promotes RIG-I signaling in a cell-type specific manner. These observations imply that viral RNA degradation and recognition are linked to each other. In this review, I discuss the links between recognition and degradation of viral RNA.","output":"Links between recognition and degradation of cytoplasmic viral RNA in innate immune response."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To report changes in adult hospital admission rates for acute ENT infections following the introduction of COVID-19-related physical interventions such as hand washing, use of face masks and social distancing of 2-m in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study comparing adult admissions with acute tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, epiglottitis, glandular fever, peri-orbital cellulitis, acute otitis media, acute mastoiditis, retropharyngeal abscess and parapharyngeal abscess in the 1-year period after the introduction of COVID-related physical interventions (2020C2021) with a 1-year period before this (2019C2020) in three UK secondary care ENT departments. RESULTS: In total, there were significantly fewer admissions for ENT infections (n = 1073, 57.56%, p < 0.001; RR 2.36, 95% CI [2.17, 2.56]) in the 2020C2021 period than in the 2019C2020 period. There were significant reductions in admissions for tonsillitis (64.4%; p < 0.001), peritonsillar abscess (60.68%; p < 0.001), epiglottitis (66.67%; p < 0.001), glandular fever (38.79%; p = 0.001), acute otitis media (26.85%; p = 0.01) and retropharyngeal and/or parapharyngeal abscesses (45.45%; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates a sizeable reduction in adult admissions for ENT infections since the introduction of COVID-19-related physical interventions. There is evidence to support the use of physical interventions in the prevention of viral transmission of respiratory disease. Preventing ENT infections requiring admission through simple physical interventions could be of great benefit to the quality of life of patients and economical benefit to healthcare systems.","output":"A multicentre retrospective cohort study on COVID-19-related physical interventions and adult hospital admissions for ENT infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Guidelines and evidence suggest primary care clinicians should give opportunistic interventions to motivate weight loss, but these rarely occur in practice. We sought to examine why by systematically reviewing qualitative research examining general practitioners' ('GPs') and nurses' views of discussing weight with patients. We systematically searched English language publications (1945-2018) to identify qualitative interview and focus group studies. Thematic methods were used to synthesise the findings from these papers. We synthesised the studies by identifying second-order themes (explanations offered by the original researchers) and third-order constructs (new explanations which went beyond those in the original publications). Quality assessment using the Joanna Briggs checklist was undertaken. We identified 29 studies (>601 GPs, nurses and GP trainees) reporting views on discussing weight with patients. Key second-order themes were lack of confidence in treatments and patients' ability to make changes, stigma, interactional difficulty of discussing the topic and a belief of a wider societal responsibility needed to deal with patients with overweight and obesity. The third-order analytical theme was that discussions about weight were not a priority, and other behavioural interventions, including those relating to smoking, often took precedent. GPs and nurses reported that noting body mass index measurements at every consultation alongside a framework to deliver interventions would likely increase the frequency and perceived efficacy of behavioural weight interventions. GPs and nurses acknowledge the importance of obesity as a health issue, but this is insufficient, particularly amongst GPs, for them to construe this as a medical problem to address with patients in consultations. Strategies to implement clinical guidelines need to make tackling obesity a clinical priority. Training to overcome interactional difficulties, regular weighing of patients and changing expectations and understanding of weight loss interventions are also probably required.","output":"A systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies exploring GPs' and nurses' perspectives on discussing weight with patients with overweight and obesity in primary care."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several health organizations, mainly in Western countries, have recently authorized the use of a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine for patients previously vaccinated with mRNA vaccines, with criteria that do not always coincide. The COVID Scientific Committee of the Illustrious College of Physicians of Madrid (ICOMEM) has received and asked several questions about this situation, to which the group has tried to give answers, after deliberation and consensus. The efficacy of the vaccines administered so far is beyond doubt and they have managed to reduce, fundamentally, the severe forms of the disease. The duration of this protection is not well known, is different in different individuals and for different variants of the virus and is not easily predictable with laboratory tests. Data on the real impact of a supplementary or booster dose in the scientific literature are scarce for the moment and its application in large populations such as those in the state of Israel may be associated with a decrease in the risk of new and severe episodes in the short observation period available. We also lack sufficient data on the safety and potential adverse effects of these supplementary doses and we do not know the ideal time to administer them in different situations. In this state of affairs, it seems prudent to administer supplemental doses to those exposed to a higher risk, such as immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. On the other hand, we consider that this is not the time to accelerate, on the spur of the moment, a massive administration of a third dose to other population groups that are less exposed and at lower risk, without waiting for adequate scientific information, which will undoubtedly arrive gradually.

The study further explores the satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) and particulate matter (PM) relationship using an advanced statistical model. The PM data used in this study is obtained from ground-based monitoring stations being maintained by the South African Air Quality Informative System (SAAQIS) network. Within Durban, PM2.5 and PM10 showed an increasing trend toward the south. The annual mean PM2.5 (PM10) ranged between 15 and 24 g m-3 (37 and 54 g m-3) across the four study sites in Durban. Winter is observed to be the most polluted season among all, with daily mean PM levels exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) standards. PM2.5, PM10, and the PM2.5/PM10 ratios exhibited pronounced diurnal variations. Concentration Weighted Trajectory (CWT) analysis identified the potential non-local source regions and long-range transportation pathways of PM. Investigation into the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on PM revealed a maximum of 15% reduction compared to a business-as-usual (BAU) year. The observed reduction in PM during lockdown is compared and contrasted with that observed in other cities worldwide.

In Brazil, the first COVID-19 case was diagnosed in February 2020, and since then, the number of cases and deaths has increased exponentially, reaching 2.610.102 confirmed cases and 91.263 deaths on July 31st. Most people have a mild to moderate respiratory illness, but the clinical evolution may be severe in older adults and patients with comorbidities, such as cancer. There are few reports of COVID-19 in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This ongoing study aims to collect data about COVID-19 in CML patients from Brazil and their outcomes. Methods: This is an observational, multicentric, ongoing register study. Hematologists from private and public CML reference centers from different regions of Brazil were invited to report their cases of COVID-19 in CML patients. Altogether, those centers are responsible for the care of approximately 4336 CML patients. COVID-19 was classified as mild/moderate, severe (defined as tachypnoea [30 breaths per min], oxygen saturation 93% at rest, or PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300 mm Hg) and critical (respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, septic shock, or other organ dysfunction or failure that requires intensive care). Results: Between March and July 2020, 24 institutions contributed to this analysis, and reported 28 COVID-19 cases in CML patients. Eighteen centers were from the South and Southeast regions, 5 from Northeast, and one from the Central region. There were 19 cases (67.9%) from the Southeast region, 8 (28.6%) from the Northeast, one from South (3.6%). The median age was 54 years (24-79), with 13 (44%) older than 60. Male patients were predominant (67.9%). There was one patient in the accelerated phase. There were two cases of COVID-19 simultaneous to CML diagnosis, 10 using imatinib, 7 dasatinib, 6 nilotinib, one ponatinib, one asciminib, and one patient in treatment-free remission after imatinib discontinuation. The median time of CML diagnosis was 7.0 years (0-26). Current CML response was: no hematologic response (n=8), hematologic response (n=4), major molecular response (n=9), MR4.0 or MR5.0 (n= 7). Eleven patients interrupted treatment temporarily during COVID. COVID-19 was confirmed by RT-PCR of oral and nasal swab collection (20) or serologic test (07). One case is suspect, awaiting confirmation. The majority of the patients presented at least one comorbidity (60%): hypertension (7), diabetes (3), chronic renal failure (1), dyslipidemia (2), arterial disease (2), cirrhosis (1), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/emphysema (2), pulmonary hypertension (1), HTLV1 (1), obesity (n=1). COVID-19 severity: mild/moderate (19), severe/critic (9). Five out of 9 (55%) of the severe/critic cases were older than 60, 4/9 presented comorbidities and 5/9 (55%) had no major molecular response (MMR)(one was in accelerated phase, one newly diagnosed, and 3 with only hematologic response). Among the mild/moderate cases, 12/19 had optimal response (63%) and 7/19 (36%) had no hematologic response. Twenty-one patients recovered, 4 are still hospitalized, and 3 died from COVID: one newly diagnosed case with high leukocytes counts and with a simultaneous bacterial infection, one elderly patient with comorbidities treated with imatinib and one patient treated with nilotinib, with hematologic response. A fourth patient in the accelerated phase died 2 months after discharge, from disease progression and pulmonary infection. Conclusion: Although the sample size is still small to make conclusions regarding COVID-19 behavior in CML patients, the most severe cases occurred in patients not in MMR. The continued register of the cases will increase our knowledge about this disease and how to manage these patients.

This article presents a retrospective review of biologically active compounds of plant origin that can inhibit the reproduction of CoVs, which makes them potential candidates for creating medicinal antiviral preparations against severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 infections. A literature review of articles from highly rated journals was performed using public databases. The search was carried out using keywords related to CoVs, targets for therapy, and plant as antiviral agents. Although inhibition of viral replication is often considered the common mechanism of antiviral activity exerted by most natural products, several plant-derived compounds show specific activity for particular target viruses. In this context, certain classes of plant preparations can serve as a basis for designing modern antiviral agents. In addition, a large number of plant compounds that are potentially active against CoVs are the main components of certain common dietary supplements that can be used to improve the resistance of a population against certain respiratory infections. In this review, we have attempted to characterize the main groups of biologically active plant compounds that have the potential to disrupt the key stages of CoV replication.

We report on a qualitative exploration of the experiences of older adults attempting to register for vaccination. We engaged in a think-aloud protocol with six participants over age 65 over Zoom as they used the New York state vaccination portal. Authentication requirements were: Medicare ID, DOB, address, and phone (optional). For this cohort, Social Security numbers were the default Medicare ID. We found that a privacy-enhanced authentication option exists, but efforts to use privacy-preserving enrollment were confounded by security-enhancing timeouts. Choosing to use the time-consuming privacy-preserving authentication increased the risk that available vaccines were taken. As a result, older adults reliant on volunteers to enroll revealed sensitive information and risked identity theft. A design that was meant to be privacy-enhancing by offering multiple avenues for authentication and ensuring logout via timeouts created a system where the more secure option was not effectively available due to a competing security mechanism. This was exacerbated by a counter counting down the number of vaccine sites available, similar to a well-known stress condition used to create cognitive load in laboratory experiments. All six participants used privacy-sensitive information to enroll; provided adequate information for identity theft; and all six encountered stop points.

On the other hand, high loads of SARS-CoV-2 are shed from the nasal cavity before and after symptoms onset. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a scoping review on the available evidence on tolerable nasal disinfectants with encouraging health outcomes against SARS-CoV-2, i.e., agents effective against at least two different viruses beyond SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Online databases were searched to identify papers published during 2010C2020. Publications were selected if they were relevant to the scoping review. The review was narrative, describing for each treatment the mechanism(s) of action, tolerability, in vitro and in vivo evidence of the effects against SARS-CoV-2 and whether the product had been marketed. RESULTS: Eight treatments were scrutinized: hypothiocyanite, lactoferrin, N-chlorotaurine, interferon-alpha, povidone-iodine, quaternary ammonium compounds, alcohol-based nasal antiseptics and hydroxychloroquine. In vitro viricidal effect against SARS-CoV-2 was reported for povidone-iodine. Inhibition of other coronaviruses was described for lactoferrin, hydroxychloroquine and quaternary ammonium compound. No treatment has been tested against SARS-CoV-2 in randomized controlled clinical trials thus far. However, interferon-alpha, lactoferrin and hydroxychloroquine were tested in one-arm open label uncontrolled clinical trials. Oxidant activity (hypothiocyanite, N-chlorotaurine and povidone-iodine), enhancement of endocytic and lysosomal pH (quaternary ammonium compounds and hydroxychloroquine) and destruction of the viral capsid (quaternary ammonium compounds, alcohol-based nasal antiseptics) were the main mechanisms of action. Lactoferrin and interferon-alpha had subtle biological mechanisms. With the exception of N-chlorotaurine, the others are products available on the market. CONCLUSIONS: Effective and safe chemo-prophylactic drugs against SARS-CoV-2 do not exist yet but most eligible candidates are already in the market. Whilst the human nasal cavity is the port of entry for SARS-CoV-2, the mouth is involved as exit site through emission of respiratory droplets. The well-known hand-to-nose-to-hand cycle of contamination requires appropriate additional strategies for infection control. To narrow down the subsequent laboratory and clinical investigations, a case-control approach could be employed to compare the use of candidate drugs among individuals testing positive and negative to COVID-19 swabs.","output":"Nasal Disinfection for the Prevention and Control of COVID-19: A Scoping Review on Potential Chemo-preventive Agents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV- 2) is a novel virus that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19). High-throughput sequencing technologies such as whole genome sequencing (WGS) and sequencing of viral genome DNA are being implemented to identify and report on genetic factors that may influence variability in symptom severity and immune response among patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Genome sequencing has been useful for clinical diagnostic purposes, and can reveal other useful information such as disease risk factors that might lead to disease prevention or patient management strategies. UsingWGS and bioinformatics software tools, we describe a novel pipeline for the analysis of medically relevant genetic results and other findings identified in COVID-19 positive individuals, and the generation of a genome report that can effectively communicate these results to patients and their physicians. Study design: Enrollment will include up to 1500 patients with a positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab. Blood samples will be collected at baseline, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year after diagnosis. Antibody isotype (IgG, IgA, and IgM), titers, and viral neutralization will be analyzed. DNA will be isolated from blood lymphocytes and host genomes will be sequenced. Whole genomes will be assessed using ACMG criteria for the interpretation of pathogenic sequence variation using in-house and third-party software tools, and publicly available disease and control databases. Comprehensive gene panels will be implemented to allow for patients to receive clinically significant findings, including risk factor and carrier status, from multiple categories of potential genetic conditions including blood and immunology, endocrine, metabolic/mitochondrial, musculoskeletal, hearing loss, neurology, cardiology, ophthalmology, renal, skin, and gastrointestinal disorders. Common disease risk will be assessed using polygenic risk scores calculated for 6 diseases (atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer). Pharmacogenomic gene variants that alter metabolizer phenotype and drug response in individuals will be reported, in addition to patient HLA-type. The genomic predictions fromABO and Rh blood types will be summarized and reported. Largescale continental ancestry estimation will be performed using publicly available reference populations. Finally, using viral genome DNA sequencing, the SARS-CoV-2 viral lineage will be identified and reported. An appointment with the study genetic counsellor will be scheduled to discuss results identified in the genome report and manage appropriate clinical referrals if necessary. Serology results will be reported. Regression models will examine associations between antibody response (titer, antigen target, viral neutralization ability), physiological response (biochemical, hematological and clinical characteristics), patient outcomes, viral lineage and genomic results. Significance: This study will link clinically relevant genomic results, in addition to other biological and serological characteristics, to potential factors that contribute to variability in SARS-CoV-2 outcomes.

Location Mount Kenya (Kenya) and Rwenzori Mountains (Uganda). Methods The species composition of Afroalpine chironomid communities was assessed using recent larval death assemblages extracted from the surface sediments of 11 high\\\\mountain lakes between 2900 and 4575 m. Results were compared with similar faunal data from 68 East African lakes at low and middle elevation (750C2760 m), and with literature records of Chironomidae species distribution in sub\\\\Saharan Africa, the Palaearctic region and elsewhere. All recovered taxa were fully described and illustrated. Results The 11\\\\lake analysis yielded 1744 subfossil chironomid larvae belonging to 16 distinct taxa of full\\\\grown larvae, and three taxa of less differentiated juveniles. Eleven of these 16 are not known to occur in African lakes at lower elevation, and eight taxa (or 50% of total species richness) appear restricted to the specific habitat of cold lakes above 3900 m, where night\\\\time freezing is frequent year\\\\round. The faunal transition zone coincides broadly with the Ericaceous zone of terrestrial vegetation (c. 3000C4000 m).

Main conclusions Chironomid communities in glacier\\\\fed lakes on Africa's highest mountains are highly distinct from those of lowland African lakes, and potentially unique on a continental scale. By virtue of excellent preservation and their spatial and temporal integration of local community dynamics, chironomid larval death assemblages extracted from surface sediments are powerful biological indicators for monitoring the hydrological and ecological changes associated with the current retreat and loss of Africa's glaciers.","output":"ORIGINAL ARTICLE: Taxonomy and diversity of Afroalpine Chironomidae (Insecta: Diptera) on Mount Kenya and the Rwenzori Mountains, East Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemic of the coronavirus COVID-19 and the introduction of restrictive measures in many industries have given a negative path for the construction industry The State Duma of the Russian Federation has not yet approved the draft strategy for the innovative development of the construction industry in the Russian Federation The construction industry is experiencing another stage of the crisis This determines the importance of monitoring and analyzing the concepts of the construction market and its main segments, because they largely determine the development policy of the Russian construction industry","output":"Analysis of the concept of the construction market and its segments in Russia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1,2-Substituted benzimidazoles were prepared by simply stirring a mixture of copper catalysts, N-substituted o-phenylenediamines, sulfonyl azides and terminal alkynes.

The detection of helium for a low density planet would be strong evidence for the presence of a primary atmosphere accreted from the protoplanetary nebula because large amounts of helium are not expected in the secondary atmospheres of rocky planets. We used Keck+NIRSPEC to obtain high-resolution transit spectroscopy of the planets GJ1214b, GJ9827d, and HD97658b around the 10,833 Ang He triplet feature. We did not detect helium absorption for any of the planets despite achieving a high level of sensitivity. We used the non-detections to set limits on the planets' thermosphere temperatures and atmospheric loss rates by comparing grids of 1D models to the data. We also performed coupled interior structure and atmospheric loss calculations, which suggest that the bulk atmospheres (winds) of the planets would be at most modestly enhanced (depleted) in helium relative to their primordial composition. Our lack of detections of the helium triplet for GJ1214b and GJ9827d are inconsistent with the predictions of models for the present day mass loss on these planets at more than 5 sigma confidence. Higher signal-to-noise data would be needed to detect the helium feature predicted for HD97658b. We identify uncertainties in the EUV fluxes of the host stars and the lack of detailed mass loss models specifically for cool and metal-enhanced atmospheres as the main limitations to the interpretation of our results.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study on a convenient sample of adults residing in Cyprus during the Spring 2020 lockdown. Participants completed an anonymous online questionnaire incorporating six validated tools regarding the following lifestyle behaviours before and during lockdown: adherence to the Mediterranean diet, physical activity, stress and social support levels, sleep pattern and use of risky substances such as smoking and alcohol. Median total scores for each lifestyle pillar before and during lockdown were compared using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and stratified analyses for sociodemographic characteristics were performed. Results: Of 745 participants, 74% were female and median age was 39 years. Overall participants reported significantly higher perceived stress score (22 v 25, p<0.01), lower social support score (71 v 68, p<0.001), and worse sleep quality score (4 v 5, p<0.01) during lockdown. Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence was moderate and increased significantly only in those practicing religious fasting (score of 6 v 7, p<0.01). Total minutes spent sitting increased (120 v 180, p<0.01) although overall physical activity score did not significantly change. Smoking intensity increased during lockdown whilst frequency of alcohol consumption decreased (p trend =0.03 and <0.01, respectively). Conclusion: Lifestyle was adversely affected by the COVID-19 lockdown in Cyprus. Evidence from this study supports development of holistic lifestyle interventions during and following the pandemic to reduce short and long-term NCD risks by building on lifestyle behaviour strengths and addressing longstanding and emerging gaps and needs.","output":"Lifestyle Habits of Adults During The COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown in Cyprus: Evidence From a Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Acute invasive fungal sinusitis (AIFS) is a rapidly progressive disease, whose delayed identification results in poor outcomes, especially in immunocompromised individuals. A surge in of AIFS in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic has lent additional morbidity and mortality to an already precarious clinical scenario. Early detection of AIFS in individuals who are symptomatic/ at risk can allow early therapy, enabling better patient outcomes. Our study aims to determine optimal soft-tissue markers on CT for the early detection of AIFS. METHODS: In this case-control study, 142 patients with equal distribution of subjects were chosen based on histopathological diagnosis of AIFS; and their non-contrast CT scans were retrospectively assessed to determine the diagnostic utility of specific soft-tissue markers that would enable diagnosis of AIFS. RESULTS: A total of nine markers with adequate sensitivity and specificity were identified, including pterygopalatine and sphenopalatine fossae, inferior orbital fissure and nasolacrimal duct involvement, premaxillary thickening, retro-antral and orbital stranding, and infratemporal muscle oedema. It was determined that the combined occurrence of any three out of nine markers was 91.5% sensitive and 95.9% specific for diagnosis of AIFS (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Early, accurate detection of AIFS in predisposed individuals is possible with identification of soft-tissue markers on NECT, enabling early intervention. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Being the aggressive disease that it is, AIFS may be managed early if the index of suspicion is held high via CT imaging; which our diagnostic checklist aims at enabling.","output":"Utilizing CT soft-tissue markers as a screening tool for acute invasive fungal sinusitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Doubling in size since the 1970s, the aging needs of the African immigrant population are not fully understood. This qualitative study examined experiences of aging and retirement planning for African immigrant older adults in the United States (U.S.). Specifically, it explored the factors, processes, and ultimate decision of where these older adults planned to retire. Secondary analysis of semi-structured interviews with 15 older African immigrants in the BaltimoreCWashington Metropolitan area was conducted. Data was analyzed using thematic analyses in NVivo. The majority of participants were women, with a mean age of 64. Three overarching themes with ten sub-themes were identified. The themes included: (1) cultural identity, which indicated the participants comfort with the U.S. society and culture; (2) decision making, meaning factors that impact participants choice of retirement location; and (3) decision made, meaning the final choice of where participants would like to retire. Age-friendliness for immigrant older adults in the U.S. is complex and it includes traditional domains such as physical and sociocultural environment (e.g., housing, transportation, and income). However, immigrant age-friendliness also needs to include wider contextual aspects such as political climate of their country of origin, immigrant status, family responsibilities, and acculturation in the U.S. More research is needed to better understand and facilitate age-friendly environments and transnational aging of immigrant older adults.","output":"Where to Retire?

We hypothesized that our analysis of a US nationally representative pharmacy claims database would identify increased incidence of lapses in OAC refills during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified individuals with atrial fibrillation prescribed OAC in 2018. We used pharmacy dispensing records to determine the incidence of 7\\\\day OAC gaps and 15\\\\day excess supply for each 30\\\\day interval from January 1, 2019 to July 8, 2020. We constructed interrupted time series analyses to test changes in gaps and supply around the pandemic declaration by the World Health Organization (March 11, 2020), and whether such changes differed by medication (warfarin or direct OAC), prescription payment type, or prescriber specialty. We identified 1 301 074 individuals (47.5% women; 54% age 75 years). Immediately following the COVID\\\\19 pandemic declaration, we observed a 14% decrease in 7\\\\day OAC gaps and 56% increase in 15\\\\day excess supply (both P<0.001). The increase in 15\\\\day excess supply was more marked for direct OAC (69% increase) than warfarin users (35%; P<0.001); Medicare beneficiaries (62%) than those with commercial insurance (43%; P<0.001); and those prescribed OAC by a cardiologist (64%) rather than a primary care provider (48%; P<0.001).

Study Design A total of 48 neonates were admitted to Tongji Hospital and HuangShi Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital from January 17 to March 4, 2020. The neonates were divided into three groups according to the mothers' conditions: neonates born to mothers with confirmed COVID-19, neonates born to mothers with clinically diagnosed COVID-19, and neonates born to mothers without COVID-19. The clinical data of mothers and infants in the three groups were collected, compared, and analyzed. Results The deliveries occurred in a negative pressure isolation room, and the neonates were separated from their mothers immediately after birth for further observation and treatment. None of the neonates showed any signs of fever, cough, dyspnea, or diarrhea. SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of the throat swab and feces samples from the neonates in all three groups was negative. No differences were detected in the whole blood cell, lymphocytes, platelet, and liver and renal function among the three groups.

In this work, we have designed Ce doped Cu-Al layered double hydroxide (CAC-LDH) ultrathin them through a bottom-up synthesis method, and further loaded them with indocyanine green (ICG). The synthesized ICG/CAC-LDH was used as a Fenton-catalyst and photothermal agent. With the Fenton activity, the ICG/CAC-LDH nanosheets could decompose H2O2 and exhibit a low KM value (1.57 mM) and an ultra-high Vmax (4.88  10-6 M s-1) value. Due to the presence of oxidized metal ions, ICG/CAC-LDH could induce intracellular GSH depletion and reduce Cu2+ and Ce4+ to Cu+ and Ce3+, respectively. The generated Cu+ and Ce3+ further reacted with local H2O2 to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals (BOH) via the Fenton reaction. Owing to the obviously enhanced absorption of ICG/CAC-LDH at 808 nm, the photothermal efficiency of ICG/CAC-LDH increased significantly compared with ICG (T = 34.7 C vs. 28.3 C). In vitro studies substantiate the remarkable CDT/PTT efficacy, with complete apoptosis of HepG2 cancer cells (the cell viability is less than 2%) treated with 25 g mL-1 of ICG/CAC-LDH.

The aim of this study was a detailed analysis of the outcomes of colonoscopic eFTR in different hospitals from different care levels in correlation with the number of endoscopists performing eFTR. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this case series, the data of all patients who underwent eFTR between November 2014 and June 2019 (performed by a total of 22 endoscopists) in 7 hospitals were analyzed retrospectively regarding rates of technical success, R0 resection, and procedure-related complications. RESULTS Colonoscopic eFTR was performed in 229 patients (64.6% men; average age 69.3  10.3 years) mainly on the basis of the following indication: 69.9% difficult adenomas, 21.0% gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, and 7.9% subepithelial tumors. The average size of the lesions was 16.3 mm. Technical success rate of eFTR was achieved in 83.8% (binominal confidence interval 78.4-88.4%).

However, internationally comparative data regarding the financial impact on individuals is sparse. Therefore, we conducted a survey of the financial impact of the pandemic on individuals, using an international cohort that has been well-characterized prior to the pandemic. METHODS: Between August 2020 and September 2021, we surveyed 24,506 community-dwelling participants from the Prospective Urban-Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study across high (HIC), upper middle (UMIC)-and lower middle (LMIC)-income countries. We collected information regarding the impact of the pandemic on their self-reported personal finances and sources of income. FINDINGS: Overall, 32.4% of participants had suffered an adverse financial impact, defined as job loss, inability to meet financial obligations or essential needs, or using savings to meet financial obligations. 8.4% of participants had lost a job (temporarily or permanently); 14.6% of participants were unable to meet financial obligations or essential needs at the time of the survey and 16.3% were using their savings to meet financial obligations. Participants with a post-secondary education were least likely to be adversely impacted (19.6%), compared with 33.4% of those with secondary education and 33.5% of those with pre-secondary education. Similarly, those in the highest wealth tertile were least likely to be financially impacted (26.7%), compared with 32.5% in the middle tertile and 30.4% in the bottom tertile participants. Compared with HICs, financial impact was greater in UMIC [odds ratio of 2.09 (1.88C2.33)] and greatest in LMIC [odds ratio of 16.88 (14.69C19.39)]. HIC participants with the lowest educational attainment suffered less financial impact (15.1% of participants affected) than those with the highest education in UMIC (22.0% of participants affected). Similarly, participants with the lowest education in UMIC experienced less financial impact (28.3%) than those with the highest education in LMIC (45.9%). A similar gradient was seen across country income categories when compared by pre-pandemic wealth status. INTERPRETATION: The financial impact of the pandemic differs more between HIC, UMIC, and LMIC than between socio-economic categories within a country income level. The most disadvantaged socio-economic subgroups in HIC had a lower financial impact from the pandemic than the most advantaged subgroup in UMIC, with a similar disparity seen between UMIC and LMIC. Continued high levels of infection will exacerbate financial inequity between countries and hinder progress towards the sustainable development goals, emphasising the importance of effective measures to control COVID-19 and, especially, ensuring high vaccine coverage in all countries.

Initial studies of posttraumatic stress (PTS) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have found that approximately one-third of patients may experience significant PTS symptoms including flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance, disrupted sleep, and low mood. We aim to better characterize PTS in IBD and its relationship with patient outcomes in a large cohort of patients with IBD. METHODS: Adult patients registered with the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation/University of North Carolina IBD Partners database were invited to complete a supplementary survey between February and July 2020. The Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5th edition was administered as a supplemental survey. Additional data from IBD Partners included disease severity, surgery and hospital history, demographics, and health care utilization. RESULTS: A total of 797 patients participated (452 with Crohn disease, 345 with ulcerative colitis). No impacts on response patterns because of the COVID-19 pandemic were found. Although 5.6% of the sample reported an existing PTS diagnosis because of IBD experiences, 9.6% of participants met the full IBD-related PTS diagnostic criteria per the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5th edition. Female patients, younger patients, those with less educational attainment, non-White patients, and Hispanic patients reported higher levels of PTS symptoms. Patients with higher PTS symptoms were more likely to have been hospitalized, have had surgery, have more severe symptoms, and not be in remission. Increased PTS was also associated with increased anxiety, depression, pain interference, fatigue, and health care utilization. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings support prior research that approximately one-quarter to one-third of patients with IBD report significant symptoms of PTS directly from their disease experiences, and certain demographic groups are at higher risk. In addition, PTS is associated with several IBD outcomes. Patients with higher PTS symptoms are less likely to be in remission and may utilize more outpatient gastrointestinal services. Intervention trials to mitigate PTS symptoms in patients with IBD are warranted.","output":"Posttraumatic Stress in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Prevalence and Relationships to Patient-Reported Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been a call to action from much of the community to urgently investigate stress and well-being during the global health crisis instigated by COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess Twitter engagement by academic NM/NR programs in the United States. METHODS: We measured Twitter engagement by the academic NM/NR community, accounting for various NM/NR certification pathways. The Twitter presence of NM/NR programs at both the department and program director level was identified. Tweets by programs were cross-referenced against potential high-yield NM- or NR-related hashtags, and tabulated at a binary level. A brief survey was done to identify obstacles and benefits to Twitter use by academic NM/NR faculty. RESULTS: For 2019-2020, 88 unique programs in the United States offered NM/NR certification pathways. Of these, 52% (46/88) had Twitter accounts and 24% (21/88) had at least one post related to NM/NR. Only three radiology departments had unique Twitter accounts for the NM/molecular imaging division. Of the other 103 diagnostic radiology residency programs, only 16% (16/103) had a presence on Twitter and 5% (5/103) had tweets about NM/NR. Only 9% (8/88) of NM/NR program directors were on Twitter, and three program directors tweeted about NM/NR. The survey revealed a lack of clarity and resources around using Twitter, although respondents acknowledged the perceived value of Twitter engagement for attracting younger trainees. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is minimal Twitter engagement by the academic NM/NR community. The perceived value of Twitter engagement is counterbalanced by identifiable obstacles. Given radiologists overall positive views of social medias usefulness, scant social media engagement by the NM community may represent a missed opportunity. More Twitter engagement and further research by trainees and colleagues should be encouraged, as well as the streamlined use of unique hashtags.","output":"Twitter Use by Academic Nuclear Medicine Programs: Pilot Content Analysis Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of human genetic and proteomic research has increased the interest in alternative head-and-neck cancer (HNC) detection methods.

The aim of this study was to compare the postoperative course after TAPP and TEP, focusing on immediate postoperative pain, incidence of postoperative urinary retention (POUR), and chronic pain. Methods This study retrospectively analyzed a consecutive series of 344 inguinal hernia patients who were treated with laparoscopic surgery between November 2016 and December 2019 at a single tertiary referral center. Results Patient demographics did not differ significantly between the groups. The operation time was significantly shorter in the TEP group than in the TAPP group (43.1  14.9 minutes vs. 63.5  16.5 minutes, p < 0.001). The postoperative pain scores were significantly lower in the TEP group than in the TAPP group immediately (3.6  1.3 vs. 4.4  1.1, p < 0.001) and 6 hours (1.5  1.4 vs. 2.3  1.8, p < 0.001) after the operation. The other complications did not differ significantly between the groups.

The EUs attempts to securitise China as an existential threat across multiple issue areas have been triggered by a combination of long-term trends and specific sets of precipitating events, which contributed to galvanising the EUs collective securitising discourses and subsequent policy initiatives. However, this research finds that the EUs securitising moves and relevant speech acts have not resulted in a coherent audience response among the EU member states.

Importantly, our results suggested that MERS-CoV efficiently infected T cells from the peripheral blood and from human lymphoid organs, including the spleen and the tonsil. We further demonstrated that MERS-CoV infection induced apoptosis in T cells, which involved the activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. Remarkably, immunostaining of spleen sections from MERS-CoVCinfected common marmosets demonstrated the presence of viral nucleoprotein in their CD3(+) T cells.

Among compounds proposed to fight the SARS-CoV-2-related disease (COVID-19), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), already effective in Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), have been proposed on the basis of their antiviral action already demonstrated against SARS-CoV-1. Very few cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Ph+ ALL and in CML Italian cohorts; authors suggested that this low rate of infections might depend on the use of TKIs, but the biological causes of this phenomenon remain unknown. In this study, the CML model was used to test if TKIs would sustain or not the viral replication and if they could damage patient immunity. Firstly, the infection and replication rate of torquetenovirus (TTV), whose load is inversely proportional to the host immunological control, have been measured in CML patients receiving nilotinib. A very low percentage of subjects were infected at baseline, and TTV did not replicate or at least showed a low replication rate during the follow-up, with a mean load comparable to the measured one in healthy subjects. Then, after gene expression profiling experiments, we found that several antiviral genes, such as CD28 and IFN gamma, were upregulated, while genes with proviral action, such as ARG-1, CEACAM1, and FUT4, were less expressed during treatment with imatinib, thus demonstrating that TKIs are not detrimental from the immunological point of view. To sum up, our data could offer some biological explanations to the low COVID-19 occurrence in Ph+ ALL and CML patients and sustain the use of TKIs in COVID-19, as already proposed by several international ongoing studies.","output":"Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Play an Antiviral Action in Patients Affected by Chronic Myeloid Leukemia: A Possible Model Supporting Their Use in the Fight Against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by dysregulated intestinal immune responses and constitutes a major clinical challenge in need of new treatment modalities to improve patient care. Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is the predominant Ca2+ influx pathway in T cells and other immune cells, regulating many of their functional properties. It is currently unknown whether the pharmacologic blockade of SOCE represents a suitable drug-target for IBD treatment. Design: Using mass and flow cytometry the effects of SOCE inhibition on lamina propria (LP) immune cells of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) were investigated.Primary organoid cultures served to study the impact of SOCE inhibition on the function, differentiation and survival of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). T cell transfer models of colitis were applied to examine how the genetic or pharmacologic ablation of SOCE affects the clinical course of IBD in mice. Results: We observed that the LP of IBD patients is characterized by an enrichment of innate lymphoid cells (ILC), CD4+ and CD8+ effector- as well as T regulatory cells producing IL-17 and TNF. The pharmacologic inhibition of SOCE attenuated the production of pathogenic cytokines including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-17, TNF and IFN{gamma} by human colonic T cells and ILC, reduced the production of IL-6 by B cells and the production of IFN{gamma} by myeloid cells, without affecting the viability, differentiation and function of primary IEC. T cell-specific genetic deletion of the SOCE signaling components Orai1, Stim1 or Stim2 revealed that the magnitude of SOCE correlates with the function of T cells and intestinal inflammation in mice. Moreover, the pharmacologic inhibition of SOCE alleviated the clinical course of colitic mice.

One of the factors of the unique therapeutic effect of methylene blue is its redox properties, allowing implementation of alternative electron transport: the dye accepts electrons from reducing equivalents in mitochondria and transfer them to other components of the respiratory chain or molecular oxygen. Azure I, an N-dimethylated metabolite of methylene blue, is potentially a more effective compound than methylene blue, but its ability for alternative electron transport has not been studied yet. We have shown that in contrast to methylene blue, azure I is unable to restore the membrane potential in isolated mouse brain mitochondria, inhibited by rotenone and, therefore, is unable to perform bypass of the respiratory chain complex I. Moreover, addition of azure I does not affect the rate of mitochondrial respiration in contrast to methylene blue, which increases the rate of non-phosphorylation respiration. At the same time, both dyes stimulate an increase in H(2)O(2) production. Thus, only methylene blue is capable of alternative electron transport, while azure I does not produce complex I bypass.

We develop a unified modeling framework to quantify and compare electricity usage changes in 58 countries and regions around the world from January-May 2020. We find that daily electricity demand declined as much as 10% in April 2020 compared to modelled demand, controlling for weather, seasonal and temporal effects, but with significant variation. Clustering techniques show that four impact groups capture systematic differences in timing and depth of electricity usage changes, ranging from a mild decline of 2% to an extreme decline of 26%. These groupings do not align with geography, with almost every continent having at least one country or region that experienced a dramatic reduction in demand and one that did not. Instead, we find that such changes relate to government restrictions and mobility. Government restrictions have a non-linear effect on demand that generally saturates at its most restrictive levels and sustains even as restrictions ease. Mobility offers a sharper focus on electricity demand change with workplace and residential mobility strongly linked to demand changes at the daily level. Steep declines in electricity usage are associated with workday hourly load patterns that resemble pre-COVID weekend usage.

Since minimally invasive techniques usually involve suturing of the diaphragm, most surgeons use a video-assisted approach with a minithoracotomy. Herein we describe our completely thoracoscopic technique for diaphragmatic plication including outcome. METHODS We present our technique and experience for completely thoracoscopic diaphragmatic plication for the treatment of symptomatic diaphragmatic paralysis in six consecutive patients. The surgical technique basically consisted of stapling of the abundant diaphragm and reinforcement of the staple line using a self-locking thread. Primary outcome measure was the postoperative result (flattened diaphragm) and resolution of symptoms. Secondary outcome was improvement of lung function values 3 months after surgery. RESULTS Between June 2015 and March 2016, six patients have been operated for symptomatic diaphragmatic paralysis, with one of them suffering from additional transdiaphragmatic hernia. Flattening of the diaphragm was achieved in all 6 patients with resolution of their pre-existing symptoms within days after surgery and without any surgical complications. Lung function volumes measured 3 months postoperative improved markedly with an increase in FEV1 as well as FVC of 540 ml (SD  193 ml) and 776 ml (SD  121 ml), respectively.

The median neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was 11.6 in the deceased patients, it was significantly higher than the surviving patients (p < 0.001). The values of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and ferritin were significantly higher among the deceased patients. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and the international normalized ratio were significantly longer in the deceased group compared with the surviving group. Logistic regression analysis showed age > 65 years, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, and hypertension as the independent predictors of mortality. The rate of abnormal inflammatory and hematologic-coagulation parameters increased with the COVID-19 severity. Age > 65 years, hypertension, activated partial thromboplastin time and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio were the independent predictors of mortality.","output":"Hematological and Inflammatory Parameters to Predict the Prognosis in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our aim was to report our telemedicine experience with type 1 diabetes patients using insulin pumps who fasted for Ramadan 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The study was aimed to observe the current sero-prevalence status of MERS-CoV, assess the presence of active cases through detection RNA Viral particle and investigate possible risk factors of MERS-CoV in camels. A total of 589 sera were collected and tested with indirect Enzyme linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (iELISA). Result The overall seroprevalance of MERS-CoV was 87.3% (n=514/589, 95% CI: 84.5-89.9). Association of different risk factors with seroprevalance revealed that origin (X2=13.39,P=0.001), sex (X2=4.5 P=0.034), age ((X2=185.7, P=0.001) season (X2=41.7, P=0.000) and reproduction status (X2=96.1, P=0.001) displayed a statistical significant difference among the groups (P<0.05) while herd size did not show a Significant difference among groups (p>0.05). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, age (OR=7.39, 95% CI:3.43-15.91), season (OR=4.83, 95% CI:-2.14-10.90), and in adult female camel reproduction status (OR=7.39,95% C I:3.43-15.91) showed statistically significant difference among the groups for MERS CoV antibody detection while risk factors of origin, animal sex and herd size difference were statistically insignificant. A total of 857 nasal swab samples were collected for the detection of MERS-CoV RNA particle. However, all swab samples tested by Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique were Negative for the virus. Conclusion In conclusion, the present study revealed a high seroprevalance of MERS CoV in adult camels. However, in spite of high seroprevalance the lack of any RNA viral particle in the study suggests the need for further in depth longitudinal study to detect the circulating virus focusing on juveniles and young camels whereby seroprevalance of antibody is low when compared with adult camel in order to get the active virus before the camel develop antibody. Moreover, the zoonotic significance and potential transmission routes of MERS CoV to pastoral communities should also be investigated and design strategy for the preparedness in control of the diseases in Ethiopia.","output":"1Cross Sectional Study of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers-Cov Infection) in Camels at Selected Sites of Amibara District, Afar Region, Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the perception of using Blackboard Collaborate-based Instruction (BCI) by Saudi EFL majors and teachers during the crisis of COVID-19 pandemic.

This is conducted by probing the benefits and challenges of using Blackboard Collaborate as a digital platform through which the different university courses are taught. The study, therefore, seeks to highlight the role of a computerbased instruction, by shedding light on the opportunities and challenges of incorporating latest technologies into the pedagogy of learning and teaching English as a foreign language in the Saudi universities. Two methodological instruments are used to collect data: the first is electronic questionnaires to test both students' and teachers' attitudinal perception towards the use of Blackboard in the learning/teaching process;and the second is an interview conducted with 29 staff members affiliated to 5 different Saudi universities concerning the use of Blackboard as a digital platform of teaching various university courses. Results reveal that despite the challenges that encounter both students and teachers in managing the process of learning and teaching via Blackboard Collaborate amid COVID-19, which are ascribed to some technical and academic reasons, this digital platform proves useful and conductive to better learning outcomes as it offers a bendable learning environment through which participants can flexibly manage their learning, both synchronously and asynchronously, by attending their classes, accessing their courses materials, participating in discussions, and sitting for examinations.","output":"The Perception of Blackboard Collaborate-Based Instruction by EFL Majors/Teachers Amid COVID-19: A Case Study of Saudi Universities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe international strategies of multinational enterprises are increasingly augmented by insights on, and approaches to, external stakeholders and nonmarket dynamics. The rise of populism and increased geopolitical uncertainty have accelerated these efforts, particularly for business leaders anticipating and engaging external agents, events, and issues that challenge the strategic objectives of their enterprises.Design/methodology/approachIn this paper we explain why the increased preponderance of populism and geopolitical uncertainty are concurrently posing an existential threat to the post-Cold War global economy predicated on free trade and (relatively) open borders and, consequently, challenging the structures and strategies of international business.FindingsWe provide an overview of the four papers in our special issue and consider how each advances insights on how multinational enterprises effectively navigate the nonmarket uncertainties of the contemporary global economy. We then advance four important areas for international business research on multinational nonmarket strategies: (i) resilience and legitimacy;(ii), diversification;(iii), market and nonmarket strategy integration;and (iv), institutional arbitrage.Research limitations/implicationsWe anticipate that nonmarket strategy scholars can build on these themes to assess how nonmarket strategies can better enable multinational enterprises to survive and thrive in an age of heightened global risk and uncertainty.Originality/valueThis paper and the related special issue provides novel theoretical insights by drawing attention to the relatively under-researched realm of multinational enterprise nonmarket strategy, particularly in populist contexts and during periods of geopolitical uncertainty. Importantly, we identify four promising domains C resilience and legitimacy, diversification, the integration of market and nonmarket strategy, and institutional arbitrage C for international business scholars investigating nonmarket strategy to consider.

The clinicopathological characteristics of these subjects were analyzed. Genotyping of 4 SNPs (rs1050903, rs2855512, rs11959928, and rs2255280) of the Dab2 gene was performed in all subjects with an improved multiplex ligase detection reaction method.The distribution of the genotype, dominant model (AA vs. AC + CC), as well as allele frequencies of both rs2855512 and rs2255280, was significantly different between CAD patients and control subjects in Han population but not in Uyghur population. AA genotype may be a risk factor for CAD. For Han population, statistical significant correlation between dominant model for both SNPs (AA) and CAD was found after multivariate adjustment. After multivariate adjustment in the Han population, we speculate that rs285512 A allele and rs2255280 A allele may be potentially associated with the onset of coronary heart disease. Individuals with the AA genotype had an OR of 1.44 (95% CI: 1.10-1.88, P = .01, rs2855512) and 1.41 (95% CI: 1.08-1.85, P = .01, rs2255280) for CAD compared with individuals with the AC or CC genotype, respectively.Our data indicates that the AA genotype of rs2855512 and rs2255280 in the Dab2 gene may be a genetic marker of CAD risk in Chinese Han population.","output":"Dab2 gene variant is associated with increased coronary artery disease risk in Chinese Han population."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 33-year-old man presented repeatedly with severe abdominal pain and diarrhoea.

This study aimed to explore the association between the concentration of air pollution and daily internal medicine outpatient visits registered for the treatment of circulatory and respiratory symptoms in Zhoushan, China using a time-series method. Methods: We validated and acquired the daily internal medicine outpatient visits records between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019, from the Zhoushan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Zhejiang, China. Further, we collected the daily average records of the ambient air pollutants from the Zhoushan Environmental Monitoring Centre within the same duration. A generalized additive model with the natural splines was constructed to explore the association between the ambient air pollutants and daily internal medicine outpatient visits. Further, we conducted a lag analysis by using the distributed lag non-linear model to estimate the time-delayed effects of the air pollutants on the daily internal medicine outpatient visits. Results: A total of 2,190,258 daily internal medicine outpatient visits with a mean of 202.4 visits per day were recorded. The non-linear relationships were found among particulate matter(2.5) (PM(2.5)), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), and the daily internal medicine outpatient visits. Overall, PM(2.5) was positively correlated with the daily internal medicine outpatient visits.

We conduct a systematic audit of YouTube's recommendation system using a hundred thousand sock puppets to determine the presence of ideological bias (i.e., are recommendations aligned with users' ideology), its magnitude (i.e., are users recommended an increasing number of videos aligned with their ideology), and radicalization (i.e., are the recommendations progressively more extreme). Furthermore, we design and evaluate a bottom-up intervention to minimize ideological bias in recommendations without relying on cooperation from YouTube. We find that YouTube's recommendations do direct users -- especially right-leaning users -- to ideologically biased and increasingly radical content on both homepages and in up-next recommendations. Our intervention effectively mitigates the observed bias, leading to more recommendations to ideologically neutral, diverse, and dissimilar content, yet debiasing is especially challenging for right-leaning users. Our systematic assessment shows that while YouTube recommendations lead to ideological bias, such bias can be mitigated through our intervention.","output":"YouTube, The Great Radicalizer?

However, passengers making multiple trips in a short time period must repeatedly make travel mode choices, purchase tickets, and wait for buses for each trip, which may negatively affect their preference for PT. In order to improve the attractiveness of PT, especially for passengers requiring multiple trips in a short time period, this paper proposes the one e-ticket customized bus service mode for passengers with multiple trips (OECBSM-PMT) by customized buses (CBs). Besides, a CB-routing optimization model for the OECBSM-PMT is also developed in this paper, formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming based on a vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery and time windows (VRPPDTW). The model aims to maximize the profit and minimize the costs of operation with considering passengers with multi-trip requests, homogeneous CB fleets with pickup/delivery-time-window constraints, and mixed loads. A service effectiveness identification procedure based on genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to cope with the calculation considering the characteristics of passengers with multiple trips. Finally, the proposed model and algorithm are verified and analyzed using the case of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games. It can be found from the results that the method can provide an optimized CB route plan and timetable, and the algorithm GA-I obtains better solutions than other solving strategies in most instances.

At last, more women may enter the world economy and benefit from financial products and markets as others have for generations before them. However, the risks of digital finance as a method to achieve financial inclusion are not insignificant C including personal security issues such as vulnerability to scams, and inappropriate products for their financial circumstances. There are also broader implications for communities and society. Despite increased financial inclusion globally and improved access to digital financial services, inequality and inequity across societies in both developed and emerging economies persists. The risks and consequences of the growth and spread of digital finance must therefore be anticipated and mitigated in order for women to achieve financial inclusion and ultimately financial well-being. Through an ethical analysis of digital finance as a method to achieve financial inclusion of women, this chapter concludes that policy makers, established financial institutions, new providers, NGOs, and philanthropists engaged in the development and promotion of digital finance should recognize a concurrent responsibility to actively mitigate the forces that could threaten the well-being of women.

The purpose of this study was to describe trusted sources of COVID-19 information and claims seen and believed about COVID-19 early in the pandemic among U.S. adults. Then, we assessed the impact of believing such claims on engaging in personal protective actions (PPA). Methods: We used baseline data from the CHASING COVID Cohort (n = 7,070) collected March 28, 2020 to April 20, 2020 to describe trusted sources of COVID-19 information as well as claims circulating on social media that had been seen and believed. We used Poisson regression to determine the association of believing certain claims with engaging in a higher number of PPA. Results: The top three trusted sources of COVID-19 information were the CDC (67.9%), the WHO (53.7%), and State Health Departments (53.0%). Several COVID-19 claims circulated on social media had been seen, e.g., that the virus was created in a laboratory (54.8%). Moreover, substantial proportions of participants indicated agreement with some of these claims. In multivariable regression, we found that belief in certain claims was associated with engaging in a higher number of PPA. For example, believing that paper masks would prevent transmission of the virus was associated with engaging in a higher number of protective actions ({beta} = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.004 - 0.046). Conclusions: Results suggest the need for public health leadership on social media platforms to combat misinformation and supports social media as a tool to further public health interventions.","output":"Spread and sources of information and misinformation about COVID-19 early during the pandemic in a U.S. national cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dengue virus infection poses a growing public health and economic burden in a number of tropical and subtropical countries. Dengue circulates as a number of quasispecies, which can be divided by serology into four groups or serotypes. An interesting feature of Dengue, recognized over five decades ago, is that most severe cases that show hemorrhagic fever are not suffering from a primary infection. Instead, they are reinfected with a virus of different serotype. This observation poses considerable problems in vaccine design, and it is therefore imperative to gain a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying this immunological enhancement of disease. In this study, we examined a T cell epitope restricted by HLA-A*24, a major MHC class I allele, in Southeast Asia in a cohort of children admitted to a hospital with acute Dengue infection. The cytokine profiles and the degranulation capacity of T cells generated to this epitope are defined and compared across different viral serotypes. Cross-reactive Dengue-specific T cells seem to show suboptimal degranulation but high cytokine production, which may contribute to the development of the vascular leak characteristic of Dengue hemorrhagic fever.","output":"T cell responses in dengue hemorrhagic fever: are cross-reactive T cells suboptimal?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus that has infected millions of people across the world.

The approximate sources were projected through a radiologically anthropomorphic phantom to provide detailed dose distributions within a targeted lung volume (approximate right middle lobe). After accounting for the reported exposure levels, mean lung doses fell in a relatively narrow range: 30-80 cGy. Variation in patient dimensions and other details are expected to result in an uncertainty on the order of  20%.

The goal of this study was to (a) investigate the attitudes and perceptions of safety among the employees and safety managers of Corona virus treatment hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and (b) identify the factors that inhibit safe work behaviors. Methods: Two qualitative data collection approaches, namely key informant interviews and individual in-depth interviews, were used to collect data for this study. Twenty-five participants were recruited from three Corona virus treatment facilities using a modified convenience sampling strategy, and interviews were conducted to gain a detailed understanding of factors that serve as barriers to safe work behavior. The interviews were recorded and transcribed in Amharic (the local language) and then translated into English. Open Code 4.02 was used for thematic analysis. Results: Poor safety management and supervision, unsafe work environment, and perceptions, skills, and training level of employees were established as the major factors associated with the prevailing unsafe work behavior among environmental service employees. Conclusions: The present study showed that different types of personal and environmental factors may discourage safe work behavior among environmental service workers.

Head-to-head comparison of the efficacy of these vaccines in immunocompromised patients is lacking. METHODS: Parallel, two-arm (allocation 1:1), open-label, non-inferiority randomised clinical trial nested into the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study. Patients living with HIV (PLWH) or solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR; i.e. lung and kidney) from these cohorts were randomised to mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2. The primary endpoint was antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S1) protein receptor binding domain (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay, Roche; cut-off 0.8 units/ml) 8 weeks after second vaccination. In addition, antibody response was measured with the Antibody CORonavirus Assay 2 (ABCORA 2). RESULTS: 430 patients were randomised and 412 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (341 PLWH and 71 SOTR). The percentage of patients showing an immune response was 92.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 88.4-95.8%; 186/202) for mRNA-1273 and 94.3% (95% CI 91.2-97.4; 198/210) for BNT162b2 (difference: 2.2%; 95% CI -7.1 to 2.7), fulfilling non-inferiority of mRNA-1273. With the ABCORA 2 test 89.1% had an immune response to mRNA-1273 (95% CI 84.8-93.4%; 180/202) and 89.5% to BNT162b2 (95% CI 85.4-93.7%; 188/210).

With one of the highest excess death rates globally, Ecuador had a comparatively low number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, which may have been influenced by limited availability of data for decision-making due to low laboratory capacity. METHODS: We examine de-identified data on 55,063 individuals with suspected COVID-19 between February 27 and April 30, 2020 included in the RT-PCR testing database collected by the Ministry of Health. Processing times and rates per province, and the number of pending tests, were tallied cumulatively. We assessed the relationship between sample shipping, laboratory capacity and case completion using a negative binomial generalized linear model. RESULTS: The national average time for case completion was 3 days; 12.1% of samples took 10 days to complete; the national average daily backlog was 29.1 tests per 100,000 people. Only 8 out of 24 provinces had authorized COVID-19 processing laboratories but not all processed samples. There was an association between samples coming from outside the processing laboratory province, the number of other samples present at the laboratory during processing, and the amount of time needed to process a sample. Samples from another province took 1.29 times as long to process, on average. The percentage of pending results on April 30 was 67.1%. CONCLUSION: A centralized RT-PCR testing system contributes to critical delays in processing, which may mask a case burden higher than reported, impeding timely awareness, and adequate clinical care and vaccination strategies and subsequent monitoring.

A comparison of hazard ratio (HR) was performed between COVID-19 patients and a retrospective cohort of pneumonia patients hospitalized in 2019 in Korea. RESULTS: Among 10,448 COVID-19 patients, ARBs and ACEIs were prescribed in 1,231 (11.7%) and 57 (0.6%) patients, respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, and history of comorbidities, the ARB group showed neutral association (HR, 1.034; 95% CI, 0.765 to 1.399; p = 0.8270) and the ACEI groups showed no significant associations likely owing to the small population size (HR, 0.736; 95% CI, 0.314 to 1.726; p = 0.4810). When comparing HR between COVID-19 patients and a retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized with pneumonia in 2019, the trend of ACEIs showed similar benefits, whereas the protective effect of ARBs observed in the retrospective cohort was absent in COVID-19 patients. Meta-analyses showed significant positive correlation with survival of ACEIs, whereas a neutral association between ARBs and mortality. CONCLUSION: Although ARBs or ACEIs were not associated with fatal outcomes, potential beneficial effects of ARBs observed in pneumonia were attenuated in COVID-19.","output":"Different therapeutic associations of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with usual pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Low-income families are reported to have a limited knowledge of food safety and resources to follow food safety practices compared with the rest of the population. This paper evaluated a virtual food safety educational program targeting food handlers in low-income families. Trained native speakers of English and Spanish delivered course materials in both languages. A total of 60 individuals participated in the program, with 30 participants in each language group. Most were female, and most had fewer than three children. After the program, participants food safety knowledge and self-reported safe food practice behavior scores increased significantly from 5.32 to 7.43 (out of 8.00) and from 24.78 to 29.30 (out of 35.00), respectively. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) was used to understand individuals behavior change intention of food safety practices. All the TPB constructs scores, including attitudes toward the behavior, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, and behavior change intentions, were improved significantly; however, only the subjective norms and perceived behavioral control were significantly correlated with the behavior change intentions. This virtual educational program improved low-income individuals food safety knowledge and changed their food safety attitudes and behaviors, giving a path to develop and evaluate more virtual food safety educational programs in the future.","output":"An Evaluation of a Virtual Food Safety Program for Low-Income Families: Applying the Theory of Planned Behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The clinical effect of Qili Qiangxin capsule combined with sacubitril-valsartan on patients with chronic heart failure was studied. We selected 108 patients with chronic heart failure in our hospital from March 2016 to January 2020 and divided them into a control group and a study group according to the random table method, with 54 cases in each. The control group took sacubitril and valsartan orally, and the study group took Qili Qiangxin pill on the basis of sacubitril and valsartan. The course of the treatment for 2 groups is 4 weeks. We compared the total effective rate of the treatment of the 2 groups for 4 weeks, cardiac function (left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)) before and after 4 weeks of treatment, 6 min walking distance (6MWT), changes in cTnI and NT-proBNP levels, and adverse reactions. The total effective rate in the study group (90.74%) is higher than that in the control group (72.22%) (P0.05). After 4 weeks of treatment, the study group LVESV (45.23  2.98 mm) and LVEDV (43.38  4.01 mm) are lower than those of the control group ((49.98  2.56 mm) and (50.75  3.49 mm), respectively), while LVEF (47.38  2.78%) is higher than that in the control group (42.08  3.24%) (P  0.05). After 4 weeks of treatment, the study group 6MWT (476.58  31.25 m) of patients with chronic heart failure is higher than that of the control group (396.52  24.52 m) (P 0.05).

METHODS: This double-blind, phase III study randomized (1:1) subjects with active RA to receive 40 mg (100 mg/ml) CT-P17 or European Union-sourced reference adalimumab subcutaneously every 2 weeks (Q2W) until week (W) 24 [treatment period (TP) 1]. Thereafter, subjects receiving reference adalimumab were randomized (1:1) to continue reference adalimumab or switch to CT-P17 from W26 (both Q2W until W48; TP2). Subjects receiving CT-P17 in TP1 continued CT-P17. W0CW24 results were previously reported; we present W26CW52 findings. End points were efficacy (including joint damage progression), pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity. RESULTS: Of 607 subjects who initiated TP2 treatment, 303 continued CT-P17, 153 continued reference adalimumab and 151 switched to CT-P17. Efficacy improvements up to W24 were maintained during TP2; efficacy was comparable among groups. At W52, 20% improvement in ACR response rates were 80.5% (continued CT-P17), 77.8% (continued reference adalimumab) and 82.2% (switched to CT-P17). Joint damage progression was minimal. Mean trough serum adalimumab concentrations were similar among groups. CT-P17 and reference adalimumab safety profiles were numerically similar and switching did not affect immunogenicity. At W52, 28.4% (continued CT-P17), 27.0% (continued reference adalimumab) and 28.3% (switched to CT-P17) of subjects were anti-drug antibody-positive.

Spatial heterogeneities exist in seroprevalence and active infections across India. Using a spatially explicit age-stratified model of Karnataka at the district level, we study three spatial vaccination allocation strategies under different vaccination capacities and a variety of non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) scenarios. The models are initialised using on-the-ground datasets that capture reported cases, seroprevalence estimates, seroreversion and vaccine rollout plans. The three vaccination strategies we consider are allocation in proportion to the district populations, allocation in inverse proportion to the seroprevalence estimates, and allocation in proportion to the case-incidence rates during a reference period. The results suggest that the effectiveness of these strategies (in terms of cumulative cases at the end of a four-month horizon) are within 2% of each other, with allocation in proportion to population doing marginally better at the state level. The results suggest that the allocation schemes are robust and thus the focus should be on the easy to implement scheme based on population. Our immunity waning model predicts the possibility of a subsequent resurgence even under relatively strong NPIs. Finally, given a per-day vaccination capacity, our results suggest the level of NPIs needed for the healthcare infrastructure to handle a surge.","output":"Strategies to Mitigate COVID-19 Resurgence Assuming Immunity Waning: A Study for Karnataka, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The breakdown of a deadly infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus (named SARS n-CoV2) back in December 2019 has shown no respite to slow or stop in general. This contagious disease has spread across different lengths and breadths of the globe, taking a death toll to nearly 700k by the start of August 2020. The number is well expected to rise even more significantly. In the absence of a thoroughly tested and approved vaccine, the onus primarily lies on obliging to standard operating procedures and timely detection and isolation of the infected persons. The detection of SARS n-CoV2 has been one of the core concerns during the fight against this pandemic. To keep up with the scale of the outbreak, testing needs to be scaled at par with it. With the conventional PCR testing, most of the countries have struggled to minimize the gap between the scale of outbreak and scale of testing. Method One way of expediting the scale of testing is to shift to a rigorous computational model driven by deep neural networks, as proposed here in this paper. The proposed model is a non-contact process of determining whether a subject is infected or not and is achieved by using chest radiographs; one of the most widely used imaging technique for clinical diagnosis due to fast imaging and low cost. The dataset used in this work contains 1428 chest radiographs with confirmed COVID-19 positive, common bacterial pneumonia, and healthy cases (no infection). We explored the pre-trained VGG-16 model for classification tasks in this. Transfer learning with fine-tuning was used in this study to train the network on relatively small chest radiographs effectively. Results Initial experiments showed that the model achieved promising results and can be significantly used to expedite COVID-19 detection. The experimentation showed an accuracy of 96% and 92.5% in two and three output class cases, respectively. Implication for practice Its simplicity drives the proposed deep neural network model, the capability to work on small image dataset, the non-contact method with acceptable accuracy is a potential alternative for rapid COVID-19 testing that can be adapted by the medical fraternity considering the criticality of the time along with the magnitudes of the outbreak Conclusion We believe that this study could be used as an initial screening, which can help healthcare professionals to treat the COVID patients by timely detecting better and screening the presence of disease.","output":"Automatic detection of COVID-19 from chest radiographs using deep learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic damaged crude oil markets and amplified the consequences of uncertainty stemming from the Russia-Saudi Arabia oil price war in March-April of 2020.

The event study method, a well-established analytical tool to measure the impacts of a given event on markets, is used in this study. The results indicate that information leakage plays an important role in the impacts of the price war. The outbreak of and truce following the price war have asymmetrical impacts on the markets; negative impacts generated by information leakage during the outbreak are generally more durable than the positive ones it generated during the truce. Furthermore, the magnitude of the impacts on futures markets is negatively correlated with the time-to-maturity of futures. Finally, negative crude oil prices affect West Texas Intermediate crude oil markets the most.

Some states have taken actions to mitigate shortages of PPE and staffing in nursing homes, including creating dedicated long\\\\term care (LTC) teams and supporting staffing capacity. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether state actions and nursing home characteristics are associated with shortages of PPE and staffing. DESIGN AND SETTING: Facility\\\\level data, released July 31, 2020, from the Nursing Home COVID\\\\19 Public File, were combined with data from other sources. Our sample was the 13,445 facilities with information about PPE and staffing shortages for each of the 5 weeks between the week ending June 21, 2020, and the week ending July 19, 2020. Associations between facility characteristics and shortages were examined using descriptive statistics and logistic regression models. MEASUREMENTS: Outcome variables were whether or not a facility lacked a 1\\\\week supply of PPE (PPE shortage) and whether or not a facility had a staffing shortage during 1 or more weeks over the 5\\\\week study period. RESULTS: Over the 5\\\\week study period, 27.6% of facilities reported 1 or more weeks of PPE shortage, 30.2% of facilities reported at least 1 week of staffing shortage, and 46.5% of facilities lacked PPE and/or staff. Facilities located in states in the Northeast PPE Consortium or with LTC teams were modestly less likely to have had a PPE shortage, and facilities located in states that implemented processes to match job seekers with LTC facilities were marginally significantly less likely to have had a staffing shortage.

Derived by technological treatment of antibodies to interferon gamma, histamine, and CD4, Ergoferon was previously proved to modulate its molecular targets promoting effective antiviral protection. The data of 282 patients with oral temperature 38.0C plus mild to moderate severity of flu-like nonspecific and nasal/throat/chest symptoms were included in intention-to-treat analysis (n = 140, Ergoferon group; n = 142, placebo group). Time to alleviation of all ARI symptoms was the primary endpoint, and 8 outcome measures were estimated as the secondary endpoints. Respiratory viruses were confirmed in 57.1% (Ergoferon) and 54.9% (Placebo) of patients. Compared to placebo, Ergoferon reduced time to alleviation of all ARI symptoms (4.5  1.7 versus 5.2  2.2 days in placebo; p=0.026) including fever (2.8  1.5 vs 3.4  2.0; p=0.031), flu-like nonspecific (4.0  1.8 vs 4.7  2.2, p=0.022), and nasal/throat/chest (4.3  2.0 versus 5.0  2.3; p=0.024) symptoms. Ergoferon add-on therapy decreased the mean total symptom severity score (according to 4-point scale for each symptom), ARI severity, frequency of antipyretic use, and percentage of complication requiring antibiotics and increased the percentage of recovered patients.

METHODS: Expression of miR-541 was detected by quantitative real-time PCR, and its prognostic value was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The biological function of miR-541 was examined by analyzing its effects on OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion.

Methods: This retrospective study was conducted by review of the electronic medical records for 9,565 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in the Mount Sinai Health system between March 1 2020 and March 30 2021. The primary outcome of interest was the in-hospital mortality. Acute kidney injury was defined as any increase of creatinine by more than 0.3mg/dL or to more than 1.5 times baseline. A propensity score analysis (matching and weighting by inverse probability treatment weights) and multiple imputation was performed. Results: Of the 1,443 patients, 420 (29.1%) had therapeutic anticoagulation therapy. The 1,023 (70.9%) patients with prophylactic anticoagulation were older and had more comorbidities. After matching by propensity score (N=334 in each group), in-hospital mortality was not significantly different between patients with therapeutic anticoagulation and those with prophylactic anticoagulation (26.9% vs. 22.8%, P=0.24). Furthermore, IPTW and multiple imputation for missing data did not change the result (therapeutic versus prophylactic;odds ratio [95% confidential interval]: 1.14 [0.83-1.59], P=0.40];1.20 [0.84-1.73], P=0.31, respectively). Interestingly, patients with therapeutic anticoagulation had higher rate of acute kidney injury as compared to patients with prophylactic anticoagulation (26.6% vs. 16.8%, P=0.003). Conclusions: In conclusion, prophylactic versus therapeutic anticoagulation showed similar inhospital mortality of COVID-19 patients treated with steroids and remdesivir, but therapeutic anticoagulation increased the risk of acute kidney injury compared to prophylactic anticoagulation.","output":"Prophylactic versus therapeutic anticoagulation for survival of patients with covid-19 on steroid and remdesivir"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a case of a hospitalised patient with COVID-19 who developed subacute thyroiditis in association with SARS-COV-2 infection.

This study evaluated changes in daily number of Kentucky emergency medical services (EMS) runs for opioid overdose between January 14, 2020 and April 26, 2020. METHODS: We evaluated the statistical significance of the changes in the average daily EMS opioid overdose runs in the 52 days before and after the COVID-19 state of emergency declaration, March 6, 2020. RESULTS: Kentucky EMS opioid overdose daily runs increased after the COVID-19 state emergency declaration. In contrast, EMS daily runs for other conditions leveled or declined. There was a 17% increase in the number of EMS opioid overdose runs with transportation to an emergency department (ED), a 71% increase in runs with refused transportation, and a 50% increase in runs for suspected opioid overdoses with deaths at the scene. The average daily EMS opioid overdose runs with refused transportation increased significantly, doubled to an average of 8 opioid overdose patients refusing transportation every day during the COVID-19-related study period. CONCLUSIONS: This Kentucky-specific study provides empirical evidence for concerns that opioid overdoses are rising during the COVID-19 pandemic and calls for sharing of observations and analyses from different regions and surveillance systems with timely data collection (e.g., EMS data, syndromic surveillance data for ED visits) to improve our understanding of the situation, inform proactive response, and prevent another big wave of opioid overdoses in our communities.","output":"Signal of increased opioid overdose during COVID-19 from emergency medical services data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mental health of university students is a public health concern, as psychopathology has significantly risen among this population. Mindfulness-based programs may support their mental health, though more research is needed. We used a two-armed pilot randomized controlled trial to study the feasibility, preliminary effectiveness, and potential mechanisms of a brief 6-week instructor-led mindfulness- and compassion-based program (MCBP for University Life) on perceived stress and psychological distress. Thirty undergraduate psychology students participated (15 in the intervention group, and 15 as wait-list controls). Those in the intervention arm engaged well with the course and formal at-home practice, attending at least five sessions and meditating between 4C6 days per week. Significant improvements in perceived stress, psychological distress, mindfulness skills, decentering, self-compassion, and experiential avoidance were found at the end of the intervention, while the wait-list group remained unchanged. There were significant differences between the two groups in those variables at post-test, favoring the intervention arm with major effects. Reductions in stress were mediated by improvements in mindfulness skills, decentering, and self-compassion; meanwhile reductions in psychological distress were mediated by improvements in decentering. These results suggest that this intervention might be feasible and effective for university students, but more high-quality research is needed.","output":"Feasibility, Effectiveness, and Mechanisms of a Brief Mindfulness- and Compassion-Based Program to Reduce Stress in University Students: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate the performance of three antibody kits for novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and to investigate the feasibility and advantages of them in clinical application. Methods: A total of 104 patients who were admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital with COVID-19 from January to February 2020 were selected as research group. Fifty-one healthy subjects were selected during the same period as negative control group. Serum antibodies (IgM/IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 were detected using two kinds of colloidal gold kits (A and B kits) and one chemiluminescence kit (C kit). The positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in different samples from patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The clinical sensitivity of A kit to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG was 77.88% (81/104) and 65.38% (68/104), respectively, and the clinical specificity was 70.59% (36/51) and 100.00% (51/51). However, the false positive rate in IgM detection was as high as 29.41% (15/51). The sensitivity of B kit to test total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was 63.46% (66/104), and the clinical specificity was 94.12% (48/51). The clinical sensitivity of C kit to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG were respectively 31.73% (33/104) and 64.42% (67/104), and the clinical specificity were both 98.04% (50/51). There was a moderate correlation between the detection results of two colloidal gold kits and the chemiluminescence kit with the Kappa values of 0.462 and 0.587 (Z=6.157, P&lt;0.01; Z=7.345, P&lt;0.01). C kit had the highest positive detection rate for IgG, and would be more reliable to be used for IgG detection in COVID-19 patients 14 d after onset. The total positive detection rate of nucleic acid in all types of samples was 63.46% (66/104). The highest positive detection rate was in throat swabs or sputum samples, followed by those in blood samples and anal swabs. No viral nucleic acid was detected in urine samples for the time being. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies could be detected in the early or late stage of COVID-19. The method of antibody detection has the advantages of shorter detection time, simple operation and high biological safety, indicating that it could be used as a supplementary or auxiliary detection for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 cases with negative nucleic acid test results.

Few studies have attempted to calculate years of life lost (YLL) to COVID-19 and compare it with YLL due to other causes in different countries. METHODS: We calculated YLL to COVID-19 from week10 to week52 in 2020 for eight European countries by methods defined by the WHO. We calculated excess YLL by subtracting the average YLL from 2017 to 2019 to the YLL in 2020. Our analysis compared YLL to COVID-19 and the excess YLL of non-COVID-19 causes across countries in Europe. RESULTS: Portugal registered 394,573 cases and 6619 deaths due to COVID-19, accounting for 25,395 YLL in just 10 months. COVID-19 was responsible for 6.7% of all deaths but accounted for only 4.2% of all YLL. We estimate that Portugal experienced an excess of 35,510 YLL (+ 6.2%), of which 72% would have been due to COVID-19 and 28% due to non-COVID-19 causes. Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands experienced excess YLL to non-COVID-19 causes. We also estimated that Portugal experienced an excess of 10,115 YLL due to cancer (3805), cardiovascular diseases (786) and diseases of the respiratory system (525). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has had a major impact on mortality rates in Portugal, as well as in other European countries.

However, the complex interrelationships between these exposures in childhood are unclear. We therefore assessed the clustering of trajectories of household poverty and family adversities and their impacts on adolescent health outcomes. METHODS: We used longitudinal data from the UK Millennium Cohort study on 11564 children followed to age 14 years. Family adversities included parent reported domestic violence and abuse, poor mental health and frequent alcohol use. We used a group-based multi-trajectory cluster model to identify trajectories of poverty and family adversity for children. We assessed associations of these trajectories with child physical, mental and behavioural outcomes at age 14 years using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for confounders. FINDINGS: Six trajectories were identified: low poverty and family adversity (432%), persistent parental alcohol use (77%), persistent domestic violence and abuse (34%), persistent poor parental mental health (119%), persistent poverty (226%) and persistent poverty and poor parental mental health (111%). Compared with children exposed to low poverty and adversity, children in the persistent adversity trajectory groups experienced worse outcomes; those exposed to persistent poor parental mental health and poverty were particularly at increased risk of socioemotional behavioural problems (adjusted odds ratio 64; 95% CI 50 C 83), cognitive disability (aOR 21; CI 15 C 28), drug experimentation (aOR 28; CI 18 C 42) and obesity (aOR 18; CI 13 C 25).

We have reviewed previously published studies on SARS and recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), confirming that many other organs besides the lungs are vulnerable to the virus. ACE2 catalyzes angiotensin II conversion to angiotensin-(1-7), and the ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/MAS axis counteracts the negative effects of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which plays important roles in maintaining the physiological and pathophysiological balance of the body. In addition to the direct viral effects and inflammatory and immune factors associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis, ACE2 downregulation and the imbalance between the RAS and ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/MAS after infection may also contribute to multiple organ injury in COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which binds to ACE2, is a potential target for developing specific drugs, antibodies, and vaccines. Restoring the balance between the RAS and ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/MAS may help attenuate organ injuries. SARS-CoV-2 enters lung cells via the ACE2 receptor.

Vaccine hesitancy is linked to scientifically unfounded fears around the MMR vaccine and autism which are often fuelled by misinformation spread on social media. To counteract the effects of misinformation about vaccines and in particular the falling vaccination rates, much research has focused on identifying the antecedents of vaccine hesitancy. As antecedents of vaccine hesitancy are contextually dependent, a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to be successful in non-WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, and Democratic) populations, and even in certain (non-typical) WEIRD sub-populations. Successful interventions to reduce vaccine hesitancy must be based on understanding of the specific context. To identify potential contextual differences in the antecedents of vaccine hesitancy, we review research from three non-WEIRD populations in East Asia, and three WEIRD sub-populations. We find that regardless of the context, mistrust seems to be the key factor leading to vaccine hesitancy.

Challenges of resource allocation frequently lead to ethical concerns of healthcare inequity. To tackle this, such developing nations continually need to implement healthcare innovation, coupled with capacity building to ensure new strategies continue to be developed and executed. The COVID-19 pandemic has made significant demands of healthcare systems across the world-to provide equitable healthcare to all, to ensure public health principles are followed, to find novel solutions for previously unencountered healthcare challenges, and to rapidly develop new therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19. Countries worldwide have struggled to accomplish these demands, especially the latter two, considering that few nations had long-standing systems in place to ensure processes for innovation were on-going before the pandemic struck. The crisis represents a critical juncture to plan for a future. This future needs to incorporate a vision for the implementation of healthcare innovation, coupled with capacity building to ensure new strategies continue to be developed and executed. In this paper, the case of the massive Indian healthcare system is utilized to describe how it could implement this vision. An inclusive, ethically-resilient framework has been broadly laid out for healthcare innovation in the future, thereby ensuring success in both the short- and the long-term.","output":"Delivering High-Quality, Equitable Care in India: An Ethically-Resilient Framework for Healthcare Innovation After COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While many techniques for outlier detection have been proposed in the literature, the interpretation of detected outliers is often left to users. As a result, it is difficult for users to promptly take appropriate actions concerning the detected outliers. To lessen this difficulty, when outliers are identified, they should be presented together with their explanations. There are survey papers on outlier detection, but none exists for outlier explanations. To fill this gap, in this paper, we present a survey on outlier explanations in which meaningful knowledge is mined from anomalous data to explain them. We define different types of outlier explanations and discuss the challenges in generating each type. We review the existing outlier explanation techniques and discuss how they address the challenges. We also discuss the applications of outlier explanations and review the existing methods used to evaluate outlier explanations.

A deeper understanding of the susceptibility of Omicron variant to vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies is urgently needed for risk assessment. METHODS: Omicron variant strains HKU691 and HKU344-R346K were isolated from patients using TMPRSS2-overexpressing VeroE6 cells. Whole genome sequence was determined using nanopore sequencing. Neutralization susceptibility of ancestral lineage A virus and the Omicron, Delta and Beta variants to sera from 25 BNT162b2 and 25 Coronavac vaccine recipients was determined using a live virus microneutralization assay. RESULTS: The Omicron variant strain HKU344-R346K has an additional spike R346K mutation, which is present in 8.5% of strains deposited in GISAID database. Only 20% and 24% of BNT162b2 recipients had detectable neutralizing antibody against the Omicron variant HKU691 and HKU344-R346K, respectively, while none of the Coronavac recipients had detectable neutralizing antibody titer against either Omicron isolate. For BNT162b2 recipients, the geometric mean neutralization antibody titers(GMT) of the Omicron variant isolates(5.43 and 6.42) were 35.7-39.9-fold lower than that of the ancestral virus(229.4), and the GMT of both Omicron variant isolates were significantly lower than those of the Beta and Delta variants. There was no significant difference in the GMT between HKU691 and HKU344-R346K. CONCLUSIONS: Omicron variant escapes neutralizing antibodies elicited by BNT162b2 or Coronavac. The additional R346K mutation did not affect the neutralization susceptibility. Our data suggest that the Omicron variant may be associated with lower COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness.","output":"Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant by sera from BNT162b2 or Coronavac vaccine recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Besides mimicking bio-chemical and multi-scale communication mechanisms, molecular communication forms a theoretical framework for virus infection processes.

This has resulted in a cessation of normal face-to-face services and patient advice can only be offered by remote means. A service evaluation was carried out to assess the quality of information published on websites and social media pages of specialist orthodontic practices in London, against General Dental Council guidance on communication and advertising and the British Orthodontic Society (BOS) COVID-19 specific guidance for orthodontics in primary care in relation to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study also aimed to provide a gold standard template for orthodontic practices to aid in the delivery of information on a digital platform during the current (COVID-19) pandemic and future possible spikes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All orthodontic practices providing care in the London region were identified from a CQC Database and subsequently checked against predetermined criteria based on the BOS guidance and the GDC Guidance on Ethical Advertising. RESULTS: Of the 83 orthodontic practices sampled; 78 had a website of which 18 (23.1%) were non-compliant with GDC guidance. Facebook pages were identified for 62 orthodontic practices. 17 practices did not provide any update in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was more frequently carried out on practice websites (78.2%) compared to Facebook pages (33.9%). A number of practices were identified as having novel strategies to manage communication during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Variation was observed in information published by practices despite the regularly updated, blanket information provided by the BOS. Communication may have been delivered by a different means during the pandemic which this study did not account for. In addition, the sampling method may not have identified all practices within the London region, however the sample size seems appropriate to draw meaningful conclusions.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has had a global impact on all facets of medicine, which has ultimately affected the medical community in a significant manner. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of research regarding the effects of COVID-19 on trauma and acute care surgery injury and admission rates. We conducted this study to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on both pediatric and adult trauma admissions, injury types, and mechanisms of injury. Materials and methods Data from the Trauma Registry was extracted for all adult (>15 years) and pediatric (<15 years) patients who consulted trauma surgery, acute care surgery, or orthopedic surgery at our center in the year immediately prior to the pandemic (March 1, 2019-February 29, 2020) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, 2020-February 28, 2021). Patient demographics, cause of injury, injury type and mechanism, and procedures performed were recorded. Results We documented a 4.2% increase in adult encounters compared to the preceding year. There was a significant difference in the distribution of mechanism of injury of adult patients between the two time periods, with the most changes seen in motor-vehicle auto, gunshot, and other vehicle injuries. However, no significant difference was seen in trauma type or intent (assault, self-inflicted, unintentional). Pediatric encounters increased by 6.4% during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Overall, there was no detectable association between the distribution of encounters by the mechanism of injury and the time period for pediatric encounters. Conclusion This retrospective review of trauma encounters through both pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods outlines the differences in factors such as demographics, injury mechanisms, and injury types between the two time periods. Overall, we expected a decrease in orthopedic-related trauma admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, there was actually an increase of 4.1% in adult encounters and that of 6.4% in pediatric encounters. Our study lays out possible trends in injury patterns that can be correlated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown period. This information is useful for the healthcare system in that it demonstrates that resources should not be cut down or removed from surgical specialties. At level I facilities, resources need to be allocated for and continued to be provided to emergency rooms and operative services, including supplies and staffing. These departments need to be well-equipped to handle an increased number of trauma patients.","output":"An Assessment of the Impact of SARS-CoV-2 on a Level 1 Trauma Center Including Subgroup Analysis of Orthopedic Injuries and Mechanism of Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work we dissected the osteoinductive properties of selected, PLGA-based scaffolds enriched with gel-derived bioactive glasses (SBGs) of either binary SiO2-CaO or ternary SiO2-CaO-P2O5 system, differing in CaO/SiO2 ratio (i.e. high -or low-calcium SBGs). To assess the inherent ability of the scaffolds to induce osteogenesis of human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC), the study was designed to avoid any osteogenic stimuli beyond the putative osteogenic SBG component of the studied scaffolds. The bioactivity and porosity of scaffolds were confirmed by SBF test and porosimetry. Condition media (CM) from BMSC-loaded scaffolds exhibited increased Ca and decreased P content corresponding to SBGs CaO/SiO2 ratio, whereas Si content was relatively stable and overall lower in CM from scaffolds containing binary SBGs. CM from cell-loaded scaffolds containing high-calcium, binary SBGs promoted migration of BMSC and BMP-response in reporter osteoblast cell line. BMSC culture on these scaffolds or the ones containing ternary, low-calcium SBGs resulted in the activation of BMP-related signaling and expression of several osteogenic markers. Ectopic bone formation was induced by scaffolds containing binary SBGs, but high-calcium ones produced significantly more osteoid. Scaffolds containing ternary SBGs negatively influenced the expression of osteogenic transcription factors and Cx43, involved in cell-cell interactions. High-calcium scaffolds stimulated overall higher Cx43 expression. We believe the initial cell-cell communication may be crucial to induce and maintain osteogenesis and high BMP signaling on the studied scaffolds. The presented scaffolds' biological properties may also constitute new helpful markers to predict osteoinductive potential of other bioactive implant materials.","output":"Molecular Indicators of Biomaterials Osteoinductivity - Cell Migration, BMP Production and Signalling Turns a Key."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein is known to mediate receptor interaction and immune recognition and thus it is considered as a major target for vaccine design.

We collected the data of COVID-19 patients who were diagnosed between January 1, 2020 and June 4, 2020 and those of the control population. The income levels of all individuals as of February 2020 were extracted, and study participants were classified into four groups based on quartiles: Q1 (the lowest) to Q4 (the highest). Data were statistically analyzed using multivariable logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: In total, 122,040 individuals-7669 and 114,371 individuals in the COVID-19 and control groups, respectively-were included in the final analysis. The multivariable logistic regression model showed that the Q1 group had a 1.19-fold higher risk of contracting COVID-19 than the Q4 group, whereas the Q2 and Q3 groups showed no significant differences. In the 20-39 years age group, compared with the Q4 group, the Q3 and Q2 groups showed 11 and 22% lower risks of contracting COVID-19, respectively.

Chronological analysis revealed that the top 4a?m of the core span the last ~600a?years. Three distinct sediment units (U1: 400-200, U2: 200-140, U3: 140-15) were identified based on the downcore element concentration variation. The lower unit (400-200a?cm, ~1450-1700a?CE) shows an upward increase of Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cr and Cd metal contents, which are strongly correlated with Al. Enrichment factor (EF) analysis indicates that metals detected in this unit are derived primarily from natural sources.

When the virus is lymphotropic, understanding the pathogenic process of the viral disease becomes complicated because virus/lymphocyte interactions can alter the cell's integrity and subsequently induce immunodeficiency. The immune system plays an important role in the outcome of acute disease induced by the mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3). The use of attenuated escape mutants provides a tool to study the role of viral properties involved in its pathogenicity. We selected MHV3 mutants by virtue of their resistance to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies (mAb), in order to study their pathogenic properties. We reported that two MHV3 escape mutants were attenuated in their pathogenic properties according to inoculation site and with regard to survival time and ability to deplete T- and B-cell subpopulations in the spleen, thymus and bone marrow of susceptible Balb/c mice. The highly attenuated CL12 mutant could not induce depletion in T or B cells following intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intranasal (i.n.) inoculations, at three days postinfection. The less attenuated 51.6 mutant, however, maintained the ability to deplete T and B cells following i.p. inoculation, as described with the pathogenic MHV3. In contrast, no depletion of T cells following i.n. inoculation was induced with this mutant, although B lineage cells decreased. The use of such mutants enabled us to examine the role of each compartment of the immune system, since the highly attenuated CL12 mutant induced no immunodeficiency, as defined by immune cell depletion, whereas the less attenuated 51.6 mutant maintained its ability to decrease only the B-cell compartment after i.n. inoculation.

Aberrant DNA methylation acts as a vital role in RCC progression through regulating the gene expression, yet little is known about the role of methylation and its association with prognosis in RCC. The purpose of this study is to explore the DNA methylation-driven genes for establishing prognostic-related molecular clusters and providing a basis for survival prediction. In this study, 5,198 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 270 DNA methylation-driven genes were selected to obtain 146 differentially expressed DNA methylation-driven genes (DEMDGs). Two clusters were distinguished by consensus clustering using 146 DEMDGs. We further evaluated the immune status of two clusters and selected 106 DEGs in cluster 1. Cluster-based immune status analysis and functional enrichment analysis of 106 DEGs provide new insights for the development of RCC. To predict the prognosis of patients with RCC, a prognostic model based on eight DEMDGs was constructed. The patients were divided into high-risk groups and low-risk groups based on their risk scores. The predictive nomogram and the web-based survival rate calculator (http://127.0.0.1:3496) were built to validate the predictive accuracy of the prognostic model. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed to annotate the signaling pathways in which the genes are enriched. The correlation of the risk score with clinical features, immune status, and drug susceptibility was also evaluated. These results suggested that the prognostic model might be a promising prognostic tool for RCC and might facilitate the management of patients with RCC.","output":"Molecular Characterization, Tumor Microenvironment Association, and Drug Susceptibility of DNA Methylation-Driven Genes in Renal Cell Carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wildfire management in the US relies on a complex nationwide network of shared resources that are allocated based on regional need. While this network bolsters firefighting capacity, it may also provide pathways for COVID-19 transmission between fire sites. We develop an agent-based model of COVID-19 built on historical wildland fire assignments using detailed dispatch data from 2016-2018, which form a network of firefighters dispersed spatially and temporally across the US. We use this model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission under several intervention scenarios including vaccination and social distancing. We find vaccination and social distancing are effective at reducing transmission at fire incidents. Under a scenario assuming High Compliance with recommended mitigations (including vaccination), infection rates, number of outbreaks, and worker days missed are effectively negligible. Under a contrasting Low Compliance scenario, it is possible for cascading outbreaks to emerge leading to relatively high numbers of worker days missed. The current set of interventions in place successfully mitigate the risk of cascading infections between fires, and off-assignment infection may be the dominant infection concern in the 2021 season.

Surprisingly, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has apparently required little to no significant adaptation to humans since the start of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to October 2020. Here we assess the types of natural selection taking place in Sarbecoviruses in horseshoe bats versus the early SARS-CoV-2 evolution in humans. While there is moderate evidence of diversifying positive selection in SARS-CoV-2 in humans, it is limited to the early phase of the pandemic, and purifying selection is much weaker in SARS-CoV-2 than in related bat Sarbecoviruses. In contrast, our analysis detects evidence for significant positive episodic diversifying selection acting at the base of the bat virus lineage SARS-CoV-2 emerged from, accompanied by an adaptive depletion in CpG composition presumed to be linked to the action of antiviral mechanisms in these ancestral bat hosts. The closest bat virus to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 (sharing an ancestor about 1976), is a recombinant with a structure that includes differential CpG content in Spike; clear evidence of coinfection and evolution in bats without involvement of other species. While an undiscovered \\"facilitating\\" intermediate species cannot be discounted, collectively, our results support the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 being capable of efficient human-human transmission as a consequence of its adaptive evolutionary history in bats, not humans, which created a relatively generalist virus.","output":"Natural selection in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats created a generalist virus and highly capable human pathogen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The accumulation of refuse in urban and agricultural areas provides parasitic vermin with new feeding sources and also creates for them partly entirely new biotopes.

With respect to the spread of pathogens by vermin via the refuse route, we must distinguish between vermin infesting either the human body, the houses, communities or our environment. Among the human vermin and house species, cockroaches, house gnats and house flies are the most important genera for the spread of pathogens via refuse. Cockroaches transmit bacteria (e.g. Salmonella), viruses (e.g. enterovirus, rota and corona viruses), fungi (e.g. Trichophyton and Candida) and worm eggs (e.g. Ascaris lumbricoides). House flies and house gnats take up all infection carriers from refuse and transmit the pathogens, as a rule, purely mechanically. Rats and mice are the most important species among community vermin. These rodents act both as mechanical and biological vehicles of infectious diseases. A case in point is lymphocytic chorio-meningitis and three different types of hemorrhagic fever in man.

ObjectiveWe sought to identify the persistent symptoms of COVID-19 in frontline workers at Right to Care (RTC) South Africa who have past the acute phase of illness with a view to establishing rehabilitation programs for its employees and the community at large. MethodsThis was a cross-sectional survey. We analysed data from 207 eligible COVID-19 positive RTC frontline workers who participated in a post-COVID online self-administered survey. The survey was active for two months. Frequencies and median were calculated for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. ResultsThe survey response rate was 30% (62 out of 207); of the 62 respondents with a median age of 33.5 years (IQR= 30-44 years), 47 (76%) were females. The majority (n=55; 88.7%) self-isolated and 7 (11.3%) were admitted to hospital at time of diagnosis. The most common comorbid condition reported was hypertension particularly among workers aged 45-55 years. Headache, body ache, fatigue, loss of smell, dry cough, fever, and loss of appetite were the most common reported symptoms at time of diagnosis. Persistent symptoms were characterized by fatigue, anxiety, difficulty sleeping, chest pain, muscle pain and brain fog, being the six most reported. ConclusionThe impact of persistent/Long COVID-19 on the health of frontline workers could have direct impact in health service delivery. Given the rise in cases of COVID-19 in South Africa and the world at large, the prevalence of Long COVID is likely to be substantial and therefore need for rehabilitation programs targeted at each of the persistent (Long) COVID symptoms is critical.","output":"Persistent Symptoms Among Frontline Health Workers Post-acute COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on 764 households with young children in Wuhan, China, where the COVID-19 pandemic started, this study investigated how household chaos during the pandemic was associated with the mental health problems of children and their caregivers.

A total of 110 bulk soil samples from the yam rhizosphere and 48 yam tubers were collected from seven counties in Jiangxi and Shandong provinces. Standard protocols were used to extract nematodes from soil and tubers and identified at the genus level. In this study, 16 species and 13 nematode genera were recorded. The five most prominent species on the yam rhizosphere according to mean population densities were Pratylenchus coffeae (291/individuals), Meloidogyne (262/individuals), Rotylenchulus reniformis (225/individuals), Merlinius (224/individuals), and Helicotylenchus dihystera (171/individuals). In the tubers, the three most prominent species were Pratylenchus coffeae (415/individuals), Meloidogyne (331/individuals), and Rotylenchulus reniformis (115/individuals). These species were verified with appropriate molecular analysis. The high prevalence of the ectoparasite (Merlinius spp.) on the rhizosphere of yam also revealed that Merlinius spp. May be more important to yam than previously thought.

In times of the corona pandemic surgery and rehabilitation appointments were cancelled or delayed leading to a more difficult access to auditory rehabilitation. Newly implemented hygiene modalities due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have changed medical aftercare and the rehabilitation process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of rehabilitation under corona conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An anonymous survey of adult cochlear implant patients was carried out by a non-standardized questionnaire. Demographics were analyzed and the quality of medical aftercare, speech therapy, technical aftercare, psychological support and the hygiene modalities were compared to previous rehabilitation stays. RESULTS: In total 109 patients completed the questionnaire. The quality of rehabilitation and individual therapy were rated as qualitatively similar or improved. The threat of the pandemic and fear of corona were rated unexpectedly high with 68% and 50%, respectively. The hygiene measures during the rehabilitation stay eased subjective fears at the same time. The majority of patients were annoyed by wearing face masks but visors, protection shields and social distancing were more tolerated. CONCLUSION: The implementation of the new hygiene modalities within the therapeutic rehabilitation setting was well-accepted by patients allowing access to auditory rehabilitation.

Several factors contribute to T cell migration, including the expression of chemokines in the inflamed tissue that attract T cells through their expression of chemokine receptors. Here we investigated CD8(+) T cell profile in the spinal cord in a mouse model of herpes simplex virus type 2 neuroinflammation. Mice were infected with HSV-2 and sacrificed when showing signs of neuroinflammation. Cells and/or tissue from spinal cord, spleen, and blood were analyzed for expression of activation markers, chemokine receptors, and chemokines. High numbers of CD8(+) T cells were present in the spinal cord following genital HSV-2-infection. CD8(+) T cells were highly activated and HSV-2 glycoprotein B -specific effector cells, some of which showed signs of recent degranulation. They also expressed high levels of many chemokine receptors, in particular CCR2, CCR4, CCR5, and CXCR3. Investigating corresponding receptor ligands in spinal cord tissue revealed markedly increased expression of the cognate ligands CCL2, CCL5, CCL8, CCL12, and CXCL10. This study shows that during herpesvirus neuroinflammation anti-viral CD8(+) T cells accumulate in the CNS. CD8(+) T cells in the CNS also express chemotactic receptors cognate to the chemotactic gradients in the spinal cord. This indicates that anti-viral CD8(+) T cells may migrate to infected areas in the spinal cord during herpesvirus neuroinflammation in response to chemotactic gradients.","output":"CD8(+) T cells in the central nervous system of mice with herpes simplex infection are highly activated and express high levels of CCR5 and CXCR3"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since early 2020, COVID-19 has grown to affect the lives of billions globally.

METHODS: Cross-sectional survey. RESULTS: The response rate was 14.5%. Of 1,521 HCP with a known profession, 607 (39.9%) were nursing personnel, 480 (31.6%) physicians, 171 (11.2%) paramedical personnel, 72 (4.7%) supportive personnel, and 191 (12.6%) administrative personnel. Overall, 803 of 1,571 HCP (51.1%) stated their intention to get vaccinated while 768 (48.9%) stated their intention to decline vaccination. Most HCP (71.3%) who reported intent to get vaccinated noted contributing to the control of the pandemic and protecting their families and themselves as their reasons, while the most common reason for reporting intent to decline vaccination was inadequate information about the vaccines (74.9%), followed by concerns about vaccine safety (36.2%).Logistic regression analysis revealed that the probability of intending to get vaccinated increased with male gender, being a physician, history of complete vaccination against hepatitis B, history of vaccination against pandemic A (H1N1) in 2009-2010, belief that COVID-19 vaccination should be mandatory for HCP, and increased confidence in vaccines in general during the COVID-19 pandemic. The following factors were associated with a lower intention to get vaccinated: no vaccination against influenza the past season, no intention to get vaccinated against influenza in 2020-2021, and no intention to recommend COVID-19 vaccination to high-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to built safety perception towards COVID-19 vaccines and raise vaccine uptake rates by HCP, and thus to protect the healthcare workforce and the healthcare services.","output":"Determinants of intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 among healthcare personnel in hospitals in Greece"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanolipoprotein particles known as nanodiscs (NDs) have emerged as versatile and powerful tools for the stabilization of membrane proteins permitting a plethora of structural and biophysical studies. Part of their allure is their flexibility to accommodate many types of lipids and precise control of the composition. However, little is known about how variations in lipid composition impact their structures and dynamics. Herein, we investigate how the introduction of the anionic lipid POPG into POPC NDs impacts these features. Small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS) of variable-composition NDs are complemented with molecular dynamics simulations to interrogate how increasing the concern of POPG impacts the ND shape, structure of the lipid core, and the dynamics of the popular membrane scaffold protein, MSP1D1(-). A convenient benefit of including POPG is that it eliminates D2O-induced aggregation observed in pure POPC NDs, permitting studies by SANS at multiple contrasts. SAXS and SANS data could be globally fit to a stacked elliptical cylinder model as well as an extension of the model that accounts for membrane curvature. Fitting to both models supports that the introduction of POPG results in strongly elliptical NDs; however, MD simulations predict the curvature of the membrane, thereby supporting the use of the latter model. Trends in the model-independent parameters suggest that increases in POPG reduce the conformational heterogeneity of the MSP1D1(-), which is in agreement with MD simulations that show that the incorporation of sufficient POPG suppresses disengagement of the N-terminal helix from the lipid core. These studies highlight novel structural changes in NDs in response to an anionic lipid and will inform the interpretation of future structural studies of membrane proteins embedded in NDs of mixed lipid composition.","output":"Structures and Dynamics of Anionic Lipoprotein Nanodiscs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-also known as COVID-19-is primarily known for respiratory illness.

Previous studies have highlighted the importance of distinguishing between DNA methylation in discrete functional regions; however, integrated non-promoter DNA methylation and gene expression analyses across a wide number of tumor types and corresponding normal tissues have not been performed. Through integrated analysis of gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, we examined 32 tumor types and identified 57 tumor suppressors and oncogenes out of 260 genes exhibiting a correlation of > 0.5 between gene body methylation and gene expression in at least 1 tumor type. The lymphocyte-specific gene CARD11 exhibits robust association between gene body methylation and expression across 19 of 32 tumor types examined. It is significantly overexpressed in kidney renal cell carcinoma (KIRC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumor tissues in comparison to respective control samples; and is significantly associated with lower overall survival in KIRC. Contrary to its canonical function in lymphocyte NF-kB activation, CARD11 activates the mTOR pathway in KIRC and LUAD, resulting in suppressed autophagy. Furthermore, demethylation of a CpG island within the gene body of CARD11 decreases gene expression. Collectively, our study highlights how DNA methylation outside the promoter region can impact tumor progression.

However, knowledge about the persistence and anamnestic responses following SARS-CoV-2-mRNA vaccinations is limited in these patients. METHODS: In a prospective, open-label, phase four trial we analyzed S1-specific IgG, neutralizing antibodies and cytokine responses in previously non-infected patients with cancer or autoimmune disease during primary mRNA vaccination and up to one month after booster. RESULTS: 263 patients with solid tumors (SOT, n=63), multiple myeloma (MM, n=70), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, n=130) and 66 controls were analyzed. One month after the two-dose primary vaccination the highest non-responder rate was associated with lower CD19(+) B-cell counts and was found in MM patients (17%). S1-specific IgG levels correlated with IL-2 and IFN- responses in controls and IBD patients, but not in cancer patients. Six months after the second dose, 18% of patients with MM, 10% with SOT and 4% with IBD became seronegative; no one from the control group became negative. However, in IBD patients treated with TNF- inhibitors, antibody levels declined more rapidly than in controls. Overall, vaccination with mRNA-1273 led to higher antibody levels than with BNT162b2. Importantly, booster vaccination increased antibody levels >8-fold in seroresponders and induced anamnestic responses even in those with undetectable pre-booster antibody levels. Nevertheless, in IBD patients with TNF- inhibitors even after booster vaccination, antibody levels were lower than in untreated IBD patients and controls. CONCLUSION: Immunomonitoring of vaccine-specific antibody and cellular responses seems advisable to identify vaccination failures and consequently establishing personalized vaccination schedules, including shorter booster intervals, and helps to improve vaccine effectiveness in all patients with secondary immunodeficiencies.

Accessibility of diagnostic testing for COVID-19 has been limited by intermittent shortages of supplies required for testing, including flocked nasopharyngeal (FLNP) swabs. METHODS: We developed a 3D-printed nasopharyngeal (3DP) swab as a replacement of the FLNP swab. The performance of 3DP and FLNP swabs were compared in a clinical trial of symptomatic patients at three clinical sites (n=291) using three SARS-CoV-2 EUA tests: a modified version of the CDC Real-time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel and two commercial automated formats, Roche Cobas and NeuMoDx. RESULTS: The cycle threshold (C(t)) values from the gene targets and the RNase P gene control in the CDC assay showed no significant differences between swabs for both gene targets (p=0.152 and p=0.092), with the RNase P target performing significantly better in the 3DP swabs (p & 0.001). The C(t) values showed no significant differences between swabs for both viral gene targets in the Roche cobas assay (p=0.05 and p=0.05) as well as the NeuMoDx assay (p=0.401 and p=0.484).

METHODS A general population sample (n = 607, age 23-72 years, smokers 18.8%) with proper dynamic spirometry and TLC measurements, was included. Accuracy of two main categories of RSP to identify TLC < LLN were evaluated: traditional RSPs (definition 1: FVC < 80% of predicted and FEV1 /FVC  0.7 and definition 2: FVC < LLN and FEV1 /FVC  LLN) and RSPs defined by Youden's method (definition 3: FVC < 85.5% of predicted and FEV1 /FVC  LLN and definition 4: FVC Z-score < -1.0 and FEV1 /FVC  LLN). RESULTS The prevalence of restrictive lung function (TLC < LLN) was 5.3%. The most accurate cut-offs for FVC to identify TLC < LLN were 85.5% for FVC% of predicted, and -1.0 for FVC Z-score. The traditional RSP definitions 1 and 2 had higher specificity (95.0% and 96.9%) but substantially lower sensitivity compared to RSP definitions 3 and 4. CONCLUSION Based on the GLI reference values, the RSP definition FVC < LLN and FEV1 /FVC  LLN yielded the highest specificity and may appropriately be used to rule out restrictive lung function. The RSP definition with the most favourable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, FVC < 85.5% of predicted and FEV1 /FVC  LLN, may serve as an alternative with higher sensitivity for screening.","output":"Restrictive spirometry versus restrictive lung function using the GLI reference values."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infected cancer patients (CP) show worse outcomes compared with non-cancer patients (NCP). The humoral immune response (HIR) of CP against SARS-CoV-2 is not well characterized. To better understand it, we conducted a serological study of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 CP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unicentric, retrospective study enrolling adult SARS-CoV-2 patients admitted to a central hospital from March 15 to June 17, 2020, whose serum samples were quantified for anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain or spike protein immunoglobulin (Ig) M, G and A antibodies. The aims of the study were to assess the HIR to SARS-CoV-2, correlate it with different cancer types, stages and treatments, clarify the interplay between HIR of CP and clinical outcomes and to compare the HIR of SARS-CoV-2 CP and NCP. RESULTS: We included 72 SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects (19 CP, 53 controls). About 90% of controls revealed a robust serological response. Among CP, a strong response was verified in 57.9% of them, with 42.1% showing a persistently weak response. Treatment with chemotherapy within 14 days before positivity was the only factor statistically shown to be associated with persistently weak serological responses among CP. No significant differences in outcomes were observed between CP with strong and weak responses. All IgG, IgM, IgA and total Ig antibody titers were significantly lower in CP when compared with NCP. CONCLUSIONS: A significant part of CP develops a proper HIR. Recent chemotherapy treatment may be associated with weak serological responses among CP. CP have a weaker SARS-CoV-2 antibody response compared with NCP.

However, a mild dose of the purified form of BoNT has been known to attenuate chronic cough, dyspnoea, pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, abnormal circulation, cardiac defects and various neurological deficits that have been recognised as the prominent clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Considering the fact, this review article provides 1) an overview on the SARS-CoV-2 mediated pathological impact on the lungs, heart and brain, 2) signifies the therapeutic uses of BoNTs against pulmonary failure, cardiac arrest and neurological deficits, and 3) emphasize the rationality for the possible use of BoNT to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and manage COVID-19.","output":"Perspectives for the use of therapeutic Botulinum toxin as a multifaceted candidate drug to attenuate COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 patients suffering sudden worsening of clinical conditions have an atypical peripheral pulmonary arterial obstruction at computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA), poorly associated to deep venous thrombosis (DVT), suspicious for thrombotic in situ nature rather than embolic.","output":"Did we turn a blind eye?

There is no scientific evidence and clinical trials to indicate that possible therapies have shown results in suspected or confirmed patients other than the use of immunizations. Given the above, some substances are being studied to be applied to contain their spread and further damage. This work aims to perform an in silico study of amoxicillin, widely known as an antibiotic and used to prevent bacterial infections and a possible biomarker made from a complex with Europium (Eu). It was shown to have the ability to interact with the COVID-19 protein in Mpro protease as ligands. The study was conducted using the AutoDock Vina with Lamarckian genetic model algorithm (GA) combined with the estimation of grid-based energy in rigid and flexible conformation. Compared to affinity energy, amoxicillin presented ? 7. 7 kcal/mol, which was better than its co-crystallized ligand in the study. The Europium complex, where its synthesis was also demonstrated in this work, presented energy of ? 6. 3 kcal/mol with hydrogen bonds and possible color change when UV light was applied. For the choice of the best poses in the simulation, the neural network parameter, NNScore2, was used. It can be affirmed that this study is still introductory but promising both in the treatment and identification of the virus.

Mobility limitations and closure of non-essential public places (restaurants, open-air markets, etc.) affected peoples' food environment (FE) and thus their food purchasing practices (FPPs). This study aimed to explore changes in FPPs of French households during lockdown and associations with individual and environmental factors. METHODS: In April of 2020 households from the Mont'Panier cross-sectional study (n = 306), a quota sampling survey conducted in the south of France, were asked to complete an online questionnaire about their FPPs during lockdown and related factors, including perceived FE (distance to closest general food store, perception of increased food prices, etc.). Objective FE (presence, number, proximity, and density of food outlets) was assessed around participant's home using a geographical information system. Multiple correspondence analysis based on changes in frequency of use and quantity of food purchased by food outlet, followed by a hierarchical cluster analysis, resulted in the identification of clusters. Logistic regression models were performed to assess associations between identified clusters and household's sociodemographic characteristics, perceived, and objective FE. RESULTS: Five clusters were identified. Cluster Supermarket (38% of the total sample), in which households reduced frequency of trips, but increased quantity bought in supermarkets during lockdown, was associated with lower incomes and the perception of increased food prices. Cluster E-supermarket (12%), in which households increased online food shopping with pickup at supermarket, was associated with higher incomes. Cluster Diversified (22%), made up of households who reduced frequency of trips to diverse food outlet types, was associated with the perception of increased food prices. Cluster Organic Food Store (20%), in which households did not change frequency of trips, nor quantity purchased in organic food stores, was associated with being older (35C50 y vs. <35 y). Finally, cluster Producer (8%), which includes households who regularly purchased food from producers, but mostly reduced these purchases during lockdown, was associated with the presence of an organic food store within a 1-km walking distance around home. CONCLUSION: This study highlighted diverse changes in FPPs during lockdown and overall more significant associations with perceived than with objective FE indicators.","output":"Changes in Food Purchasing Practices of French Households During the First COVID-19 Lockdown and Associated Individual and Environmental Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global COVID-19 pandemic has claimed the lives of more than 450,000 US citizens. Dysregulation of the immune system underlies the pathogenesis of COVID-19, with inflammation mediated local tissue injury to the lung in the setting of suppressed systemic immune function. To define the molecular mechanisms of immune dysfunction in COVID-19 we utilized a systems immunology approach centered on the circulating leukocyte phosphoproteome measured by mass cytometry. COVID-19 is associated with wholesale activation of a broad set of signaling pathways across myeloid and lymphoid cell populations. STAT3 phosphorylation predominated in both monocytes and T cells and was tightly correlated with circulating IL-6 levels. High levels of STAT3 phosphorylation was associated with decreased markers of myeloid cell maturation/activation and decreased ex-vivo T cell IFN-gamma production, demonstrating that during COVID-19 dysregulated cellular activation is associated with suppression of immune effector cell function. Collectively, these data reconcile the systemic inflammatory response and functional immunosuppression induced by COVID-19 and suggest STAT3 signaling may be the central pathophysiologic mechanism driving immune dysfunction in COVID-19.","output":"Dysregulation of the Leukocyte Signaling Landscape during Acute COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oil price is primarily determined by global supply and demand forces as well as governments policies and action or inaction of institutions like OPEC. However, in recent times, it has become evident that public health is a vital factor influencing demand and in turn oil price. In US, oil price reached a negative value for the first time in history by April 2020. Personnel and public health have been shown to have profound effect on operational expenditure (OPEX) of organizations, this in turn affecting the profitability of such organizations. Extra measures involving cost, had to be taken by organizations all over the world to ensure health and safety of their personnel in their sites. In Nigeria, effect of covid-19 measures for companies were, shut in of production, declaration of force majeure on ongoing contracts, slashing of costs, suspension on evaluation of future projects, profile assets for sale, remote/tele working, etc. Huge costs were also incurred as a part of corporate social responsibility for host communities/states where they operate. The consequential outcome is that there are reports of lower than planned profitability and liquidity positions. This paper examines action taken during this covid crisis and their impact on the financial status of their organizations. Using a quantitative and descriptive research design, an online survey has been used to gather information from respondents from different oil and gas companies of cost incurred by them. Secondary data was also obtained from quarterly reports of some companies of the oil majors to show their profitability comparing Q1-Q4 of 2019 and 2020.

From a pathophysiological perspective, SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha) that leads to systemic inflammation and consequent increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) caused by atheromatous plaque rupture and significant myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 tropism to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system through the ACE2 receptor induces myocarditis that may rapidly progress to left ventricular dysfunction and hemodynamic instability. Myocardial inflammation with pericardial involvement, i.e. , myopericarditis, can progress to cardiac tamponade and obstructive shock. These cardiovascular complications, which are associated with a worse prognosis and higher mortality, can be associated with clinical manifestations, electrocardiographic changes, and troponin values similar to AMI. Thus, the diagnosis and treatment of patients with acute chest pain and dyspnea admitted to the emergency department is a significant challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Millions of people and businesses have been placed in lockdown where the main aim is to stop the spread of the virus. As an extreme phenomenon, the lockdown has triggered a global economic shock at an alarming pace, conveying sharp recessions for many countries. In the meantime, the lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have drastically changed energy consumption patterns and reduced CO2 emissions throughout the world. Recent data released by the International Monetary Fund and International Energy Agency for 2020 further forecast that emissions will rebound in 2021.

Few studies have investigated gender differences in ACS admissions and outcomes during pandemics and have presented divergent results. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on male and female hospitalizations and in-hospital outcomes in patients presenting with ACS. Methodology We designed a retrograde, single-center trial gathering data for ACS hospitalizations during the lockdown (March 9, 2020, to April 30, 2020) compared with the same timeframe of 2019. ACS hospitalizations were subgrouped as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI (NSTEMI), and unstable angina (UA). We calculated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) to compare all-ACS and subgroups for male and female hospitalizations and the risk ratio (RR) to compare overall male/female mortality. Results This study included 321 ACS patients (238 males, 83 females) during the COVID-19 lockdown and 550 patients (400 males, 150 females) during 2019. The IRRs of all-ACS/males/females were significantly lower during the COVID-19 period at 0.58 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.44-0.76), 0.59 (95% CI = 0.43-0.75), and 0.55 (95% CI = 0.37-0.74), respectively. The IRR for STEMI was significantly lower among females (0.59 (95% CI = 0.39-0.89)), but not among males (0.76 (95% CI = 0.55-1.08)) The IRR for NSTEMI was not significantly lower, meanwhile it was significantly lower for UA among both males and females. The overall ACS mortality increased during the COVID-19 period (7.4% vs. 3.4%; RR = 2.16 (95% CI = 1.20-3.89)). Important increase was found in males (7.45% vs. 2.5%; RR = 3.02 (95% CI = 1.42-6.44)), but not in females (7.2% vs. 6%; RR = 1.20 (95% CI = 0.44-3.27). Conclusions The admissions of ACS reduced similarly in males and females during the COVID-19 pandemic. The admissions of STEMI reduced predominantly in females. We identified a substantial increase in the overall ACS mortality, but predominantly in males, reducing the differences between males and females.

The study population comprised patients hospitalized with COVID\\\\19 (3 March 2020 to 31 December 2020) with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and an available HbA1c  6 months before the first positive PCR test. All patients had at least 30 days of follow\\\\up. Among patients with diabetes, HbA1c was categorized as <48 mmol/mol, 48 to 53 mmol/mol, 54 to 58 mmol/mol, 59 to 64 mmol/mol (reference) and >64 mmol/mol.

In this work, we demonstrate that human MAPKs, i.e. extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), are CO(2) sensors and CO(2) is an efficient anti-inflammatory compound that exerts its effects through inactivating ERK1/2 in cultured endothelial cells when the CO(2) concentration is elevated. CO(2) is a potent inhibitor of cellular proinflammatory responses caused by H(2)O(2) or the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.

Since December 2019, the new pathogen has rapidly spread globally, with over 65 million cases reported to the beginning of December 2020, including over 1.5 million deaths. Unfortunately, currently, there is no specific and effective treatment for COVID-19. As SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike proteins (S) to bind to a host cell-surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2(ACE2), and this interaction is proved to be responsible for entering a virus into host cells, it makes an ideal target for antiviral drug development. In this work, we design three very short peptides based on the ACE2 sequence/structure fragments, which may effectively bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein and may, in turn, disrupt the important virus-host protein-protein interactions, blocking early steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two of our peptides bind to virus protein with affinity in nanomolar range, and as very short peptides have great potential for drug development.","output":"Native Structure-Based Peptides as Potential Protein-Protein Interaction Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein and Human ACE2 Receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, universities around the world have been compelled to rethink how they design and implement student assessment strategies.

To address this we created CBTIweb.org, an online training platform for providers to learn the basics of sleep, assessing insomnia, and CBT-I. The present study assessed the reach of CBTIweb by examining engagement, knowledge acquisition, and perceived acceptability. Participants who registered for CBTIweb self-reported their practice setting and personal characteristics (i.e. degree, profession, licensure status).

In the first three months after launching CBTIweb, 2586 providers registered and 624 of these completed the training within three months of registering. Chi-square tests of independence revealed no differences in completion rates by education or profession, though trainees were more likely to initiate and complete treatment than licensed providers.

Due to the lack of vaccines and antiviral drugs, it is now a huge public health burden around the world. In order to screen large compound libraries for the identification of novel antivirals targeting DENV, it is essential to develop a high throughput screening (HTS) amenable assay. Here, we present the development, optimization and validation of a cytopathic effect-based assay against Dengue virus serotype-2 (DENV-2). The assay conditions, including cell culturing conditions, DMSO tolerance and the multiplicity of infection, were optimized in both 96- and 384-well plates. Assay robustness and reproducibility were determined under the optimized conditions in 96-well plate, including Z'-value of 0.71, signal-to-background ratio of 6.88, coefficient of variation of 6.3% in mock-infected cells and 12.3% in DENV-2 infected cells.

It is critical to understand the risks of airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission under different epidemiological scenarios and operation strategies for schools to make informed decisions to mitigate infection risk. Through scenario-based analysis, this study estimates the airborne infection risk of SARS-CoV-2 in 111,485 U.S. public and private schools and evaluates the impacts of different intervention strategies, including increased ventilation, air filtration, and hybrid learning. Schools in more than 90% of counties exhibit infection risk of higher than 1%, indicating the significance of implementing intervention strategies. Among the considered strategies, air filtration is found to be most effective: the school average infection risk when applying MERV 13 is over 30% less than the risk levels correlating with the use of increased ventilation and hybrid learning strategies, respectively. For most schools, it is necessary to adopt combined intervention strategies to ensure the infection risk below 1%.

Considering that very few studies, if not none, allude to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), this study aims to determine the explanatory factors for both loyalty and non-loyalty within the Kisantu health mutual insurance in DRC and to identify any specific factors in the urban-rural Congolese context. PURPOSE OF RESEARCH: We conducted a five-year prospective study, starting in 2013, among 320 households, selected among a cohort of 2202 households. Using the SPSS? 21.0 software, the association between loyalty and socio-demographic, socioeconomic variables and the degree of satisfaction with insurance products, as well as the motivations with respect to targeted loyalty, was sought. RESULTS: Thus, we found that the sociodemographic characteristics were not associated with loyalty of payments. In contrast, statistically significant relations were found between loyalty and socioeconomic characteristics, including occupation, estimated income, as the motivations expressed with regard to loyalty (P  0.001). In a logistic regression model, occupation, estimated household income of $100 or above were twice more likely to be loyal than those with an income below $100. Protection by income has not been identified as a predictor in the studies included in our survey of the literature, but it proved to be significantly associated with loyalty in the present study. On the other hand, beyond the fidelity factors observed in this study, aspects relating to the management of mutual health insurance, which have appeared as predictors in other contexts, are not identified as such in our community. CONCLUSIONS: In an urban - rural context in DR Congo where the majority of the population has a low and unstable income, and considering the low amount of contribution to the Kisantu health mutual, 4.2% of the median household income, it will be necessary therefore rethink the place of health spending in households and the extension of solidarity in the form of uniform or income-based contributions.","output":"[Factors associated with loyalty in the mutual health of Kisantu in Democratic Republic of the Congo]./ Facteurs de fidlisation dans la mutuelle de sant de Kisantu en Rpublique dmocratique du Congo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We consider a global (location independent) model of pandemic growth which generalizes the SIR model to accommodate important features of the COVID-19 pandemic, notably the implementation of pandemic reduction measures.

Typically, the individuals are scattered across different locations, and available quarantine vehicles are limited. Therefore, it is challenging to efficiently schedule the vehicles to transfer the individuals to isolated regions to control the spread of the epidemic. In this paper, we formulate such a quarantine vehicle scheduling problem for high-risk individual transfer, which is more difficult than most well-known vehicle routing problems. To efficiently solve this problem, we propose a hybrid algorithm based on the water wave optimization (WWO) metaheuristic and neighborhood search. The metaheuristic uses a small population to rapidly explore the solution space, and the neighborhood search uses a gradual strategy to improve the solution accuracy. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms several existing algorithms and obtains high-quality solutions on real-world problem instances for high-risk individual transfer in Hangzhou, China, during the peak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19).","output":"Quarantine Vehicle Scheduling for Transferring High-Risk Individuals in Epidemic Areas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Eight iatrogenic thyroid pseudoaneurysms (ITPAs) after thyroid biopsy are reported.

Using COVID-19 as a case study, we developed a query-bot information retrieval system with user-feedback to allow clinicians to ask natural questions to retrieve data from patient notes. Materials and Methods We applied clinicalBERT, a pre-trained contextual language model, to our dataset of patient notes to obtain sentence embeddings, using K-Means to reduce computation time for real-time interaction. Rocchio algorithm was then employed to incorporate user-feedback and improve retrieval performance. Results In an iterative feedback loop experiment, MAP for final iteration was 0.93/0.94 as compared to initial MAP of 0.66/0.52 for generic and 1./1. compared to 0.79/0.83 for COVID-19 specific queries confirming that contextual model handles the ambiguity in natural language queries and feedback helps to improve retrieval performance. User-in-loop experiment also outperformed the automated pseudo relevance feedback method. Moreover, the null hypothesis which assumes identical precision between initial retrieval and relevance feedback was rejected with high statistical significance (p ? 0.05). Compared to Word2Vec, TF-IDF and bioBERT models, clinicalBERT works optimally considering the balance between response precision and user-feedback. Discussion Our model works well for generic as well as COVID-19 specific queries. However, some generic queries are not answered as well as others because clustering reduces query performance and vague relations between queries and sentences are considered non-relevant. We also tested our model for queries with the same meaning but different expressions and demonstrated that these query variations yielded similar performance after incorporation of user-feedback.

The CPP programme aims to develop socially engaged artists who contribute to the world as performance-makers, educators, advocates and active citizens. In these months where there was a palimpsest of crises, all clamouring for our attention, we had to consider what it means to make art and educate artists in the context of a pandemic. When the UK-wide lockdown happened at the end of March our working practices as we knew them ceased and we had to find ways to deliver our curriculum online and encourage our student artists to be responsive, creative and curious about what the move to digital platforms could offer our artforms. Conceived through the conceptualisation of online spaces as utopias/dystopias, this article disseminates the way in which our learning and teaching has adapted to respond to the challenge of social distancing and isolation and how we have found new ways of working, training and being a community of artists in these unprecedented circumstances. CPP is an interdisciplinary performance-making degree focused on the generation of new and original performances that sit outside of traditional theatre and is committed to exploring the ecological and social function of performance and how performance can be an 'act of community.'

Effective audits can establish a framework for reporting research efforts, ensuring accurate reporting, and spearheading quality improvement. Although a variety of data auditing models and standards exist, barriers to effective auditing including costs, regulatory requirements, travel, and design complexity must be considered. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Congenital Cardiac Research Collaborative conducted a virtual data training initiative and remote source data verification audit on a retrospective multicentre dataset. CCRC investigators across nine institutions were trained to extract and enter data into a robust dataset on patients with tetralogy of Fallot who required neonatal intervention. Centres provided de-identified source files for a randomised 10% patient sample audit. Key auditing variables, discrepancy types, and severity levels were analysed across two study groups, primary repair and staged repair. RESULTS: Of the total 572 study patients, data from 58 patients (31 staged repairs and 27 primary repairs) were source data verified. Amongst the 1790 variables audited, 45 discrepancies were discovered, resulting in an overall accuracy rate of 97.5%. High accuracy rates were consistent across all CCRC institutions ranging from 94.6% to 99.4% and were reported for both minor (1.5%) and major discrepancies type classifications (1.1%). CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that implementing a virtual multicentre training initiative and remote source data verification audit can identify data quality concerns and produce a reliable, high-quality dataset.

Two subgroups of HRSV (A and B) routinely cocirculate. Most research has been performed with HRSV-A strains because these are easier to culture than HRSV-B strains. In this study, we aimed to compare the replicative fitness and HRSV-induced innate cytokine responses of HRSV-A and HRSV-B strains in disease-relevant cell culture models. We used two recombinant (r) clinical isolate-based HRSV strains (A11 and B05) and one recombinant laboratory-adapted HRSV strain (A2) to infect commercially available nasal, bronchial, and small-airway cultures. Epithelial cells from all anatomical locations were susceptible to HRSV infection despite the induction of a dominant type III interferon response. Subgroup A viruses disseminated and replicated faster than the subgroup B virus. Additionally, we studied HRSV infection and innate responses in airway organoids (AOs) cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI). Results were similar to the commercially obtained bronchial cells. In summary, we show that HRSV replicates well in cells from both the upper and the lower airways, with a slight replicative advantage for subgroup A viruses. Lastly, we showed that AOs cultured at ALI are a valuable model for studying HRSV ex vivo and that they can be used in the future to study factors that influence HRSV disease severity. IMPORTANCE Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the major cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young infants and causes almost 200,000 deaths per year. Currently, there is no vaccine or treatment available, only a prophylactic monoclonal antibody (palivizumab). An important question in HRSV pathogenesis research is why only a fraction (1 to 3%) of infants develop severe disease. Model systems comprising disease-relevant HRSV isolates and accurate and reproducible cell culture models are indispensable to study infection, replication, and innate immune responses. Here, we used differentiated AOs cultured at ALI to model the human airways. Subgroup A viruses replicated better than subgroup B viruses, which we speculate fits with epidemiological findings that subgroup A viruses cause more severe disease in infants. By using AOs cultured at ALI, we present a highly relevant, robust, and reproducible model that allows for future studies into what drives severe HRSV disease.","output":"Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus Subgroup A and B Infections in Nasal, Bronchial, Small-Airway, and Organoid-Derived Respiratory Cultures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the Covid-19 pandemic, a strategy to minimise face-to-face (FtF) visits and limit viral spread is essential.

However, no commercial vaccines that are specific for this type of IBV are currently available. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel vaccines that prevent QX-like IBV infection. RESULTS: A recombinant Mareks disease virus (MDV), rMDV-S1, that expresses the S1 subunit of the spike (S) protein from the QX-like infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was constructed by inserting the IBV S1 gene into the genome of the CVI988/Rispens strain of MDV. Specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens that were vaccinated with rMDV-S1 were protected when challenged with the QX-like IBV. They were observed to have mild clinical signs of disease, a short virus-shedding period and low mortality.

Viral infections alone do not lead to virus-induced malignancies, as both genetic and host safety factors are also involved in the occurrence of malignancies. Acquired immune responses, through the differentiation of Th17 cells, form the novel components of the Th17 cell pathway when reacting with viral infections all the way from the beginning to its final stages. As a result, instead of inducing the right immune responses, these events lead to the suppression of the immune system. In fact, the responses from Th17 cells during persistent viral infections causes chronic inflammation through the production of IL-17 and other cytokines which provide a favorable environment for tumor growth and its development. Additionally, during the past decade, these cells have been understood to be involved in tumor progression and metastasis. However, further research is required to understand Th17 cells' immune mechanisms in the vast variety of viral diseases.

Given both vaccines and therapeutics are designed around Wuhan-1 Spike, this raises the theoretical possibility of virus escape, particularly in immunocompromised individuals where prolonged viral replication occurs. Here we report chronic SARS-CoV-2 with reduced sensitivity to neutralising antibodies in an immune suppressed individual treated with convalescent plasma, generating whole genome ultradeep sequences by both short and long read technologies over 23 time points spanning 101 days. Although little change was observed in the overall viral population structure following two courses of remdesivir over the first 57 days, N501Y in Spike was transiently detected at day 55 and V157L in RdRp emerged. However, following convalescent plasma we observed large, dynamic virus population shifts, with the emergence of a dominant viral strain bearing D796H in S2 and H69/V70 in the S1 N-terminal domain NTD of the Spike protein. As passively transferred serum antibodies diminished, viruses with the escape genotype diminished in frequency, before returning during a final, unsuccessful course of convalescent plasma. In vitro, the Spike escape double mutant bearing H69/V70 and D796H conferred decreased sensitivity to convalescent plasma, whilst maintaining infectivity similar to wild type. D796H appeared to be the main contributor to decreased susceptibility, but incurred an infectivity defect. The H69/V70 single mutant had two-fold higher infectivity compared to wild type and appeared to compensate for the reduced infectivity of D796H. Consistent with the observed mutations being outside the RBD, monoclonal antibodies targeting the RBD were not impacted by either or both mutations, but a non RBD binding monoclonal antibody was less potent against H69/V70 and the double mutant.

It may lead to severe disease and death, and often requires antimicrobial treatment. Antimicrobial treatment is known to be related to antimicrobial resistance, which poses a threat to public health; therefore, efforts to better understand the causes of airway infection must be undertaken. Many different pathogens may be responsible for disease onset, including viruses. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of respiratory viruses in Swiss veal calves and to identify risk factors for infection. In a convenience sample of 764 swabs, prevalence rates were determined for bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV, 2.1%), bovine parainfluenza-3 virus (BPI3V, 3.3%), bovine coronavirus (BCoV, 53.5%), influenza D virus (IDV, 4.1%), and influenza C virus (ICV, 0%). Due to the high prevalence rate, risk factors were investigated for BCoV. Younger calves tested positive more frequently than older calves. Increasing group size was associated with increasing probability for occurrence of BCoV. To summarize, different viral pathogens circulate in veal calves. ABSTRACT: The prevention of bovine respiratory disease is important, as it may lead to impaired welfare, economic losses, and considerable antimicrobial use, which can be associated with antimicrobial resistance. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of respiratory viruses and to identify risk factors for their occurrence. A convenience sample of 764 deep nasopharyngeal swab samples from veal calves was screened by PCR for bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza-3 virus (BPI3V), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), influenza D virus (IDV), and influenza C virus (ICV). The following prevalence rates were observed: BRSV, 2.1%; BPI3V, 3.3%; BCoV, 53.5%; IDV, 4.1%; ICV, 0%. Logistic mixed regression models were built for BCoV to explore associations with calf management and housing. Positive swab samples were more frequent in younger calves than older calves (>100 days; p < 0.001). The probability of detecting BCoV increased with increasing group size in young calves. Findings from this study suggested that young calves should be fattened in small groups to limit the risk of occurrence of BCoV, although an extended spectrum of risk factors for viral associated respiratory disorders such as nutritional aspects should be considered in future studies.","output":"Prevalence of BRD-Related Viral Pathogens in the Upper Respiratory Tract of Swiss Veal Calves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The GeroCovid Study is a multi-setting, multinational, and multi-scope registry that includes the GeroCovid home and outpatients' care cohort.

METHODS: Prospectively recorded patients in an electronic web registry provided by BlueCompanion Ltd. Up to October 31, 2020, the sample included 90 patients receiving regular care from the Center for Cognitive Disorders and Dementia in Catanzaro Lido, Italy. It was made of 52 ambulatory outpatients and 38 home care patients, mean age 83.3  7.54 years. Participants underwent a multidimensional assessment at baseline (T0) and after 90 days (T1). For each patient, we administered the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for cognitive functions, the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental ADL (IADL) scales for functional capabilities, the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) for comorbidities and their impact on patients' health, the 5-items Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) for mood, and the Euro Quality of Life (EuroQoL) for perceived quality of life. Contacts with both ambulatory and home care patients were managed in person or via telephone, preferably through video calls (WhatsApp or FaceTime). RESULTS: Contacts with patients were kept at T0 through telephone. At T1, visits were made in person for over 95% out of the cases. The ADL, IADL, CIRS, GDS, MMSE, and EuroQoL changed slightly between T0 and T1. Most of the patients were clinically stable over time on the majority of the scales explored, but behavioral changes were found in 24.4% of patients and anxiety and insomnia in 17.7% of patients.

The relationship between sex and renal ACE2 expression in humans with kidney disease is a gap in current knowledge. METHODS: We studied renal tubulointerstitial microarray data and clinical variables from subjects with FSGS enrolled in the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) study. We compared relationships between ACE2 expression and age, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR), interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and genes implicated in inflammation and fibrosis in male and female subjects. RESULTS: ACE2 mRNA expression was lower in the tubulointerstitium of males compared to females (P = 0.0026). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that ACE2 expression was related to sex and eGFR but not to age or treatment with renin angiotensin system blockade. ACE2 expression is also related to interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy, in males but not in females. Genes involved in inflammation (CCL2 and TNF) correlated with ACE2 expression in males (TNF: r = -0.65, P < 0.0001; CCL2: r = -0.60, P < 0.0001) but not in females. TGFB1, a gene implicated in fibrosis correlated with ACE2 in both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: Sex is an important determinant of ACE2 expression in the tubulointerstitium of the kidney in FSGS. Sex also influences the relationships between ACE2, kidney fibrosis, and expression of genes involved in kidney inflammation.","output":"Sex and kidney ACE2 expression in primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: A NEPTUNE study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) typically presents as a respiratory illness, co-existent cardiovascular symptomatology associated with an elevated serum troponin level has been identified as a risk factor for adverse outcomes. Our study addressed the need to correlate serum cardiovascular biomarkers with tissue pathology based on autopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 13 patients, we reviewed the clinical history and measurements of serum troponin and other biomarkers and correlated them with autopsy findings. RESULTS: At autopsy, the 13 COVID-19 patients exhibited evidence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and cardiomegaly (heart weights ranged from 380 to 1170 grams). Of the 13 patients, three had elevated troponin I and evidence of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (cases 4, 5, and 11), while six had elevated troponin I without evidence of severe CAD (cases 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9), and four had no clinical or pathological evidence of CAD. Of note, cases 7 and 9 had significantly elevated troponin I levels (8.84 ng/mL and 4.94 ng/mL, respectively). Several cases showed focal degenerative change or damage of cardiomyocytes. However, none of the cases had evidence of lymphocytic myocarditis. CONCLUSION: Although we observed elevated biomarkers of heart failure in some cases, it was not a consistent finding and did not correlate with evidence of myocarditis. The elevated biomarkers may reflect non-ischemic heart damage as a consequence of COVID-19 infection.","output":"COVID-19 Cardiac Injury: An Important Cause of COVID-19 Related Morbidityand Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The fact that SAARS-Cov2 virus enters cells through ACE2 receptors and the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors (RAASi) upregulate the ACE2 receptors, there was speculation that use of RAASi may lead increased cellular entry of the virus. There was a pause for a brief period of the use of RAASi in COVID 19 patients. But clinically the speculation has been found to be incorrect. Different professional societies come up with the assertion to continue to use RAASi. As the hesitancy among the clinicians appears to continue and there is no first hand data regarding the safety of the use of RAASi in Bangladeshi population, the study was undertaken to evaluate the safety of RAASi in COVID 19 patients. Aims & Methods This study was a prospective, observational multi-center study to evaluate the outcome of COVID-19 patients receiving RAAS inhibitors. Adult Hypertensive patients (age 18 years) with diagnosed COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR test who have a history of taking either ACE inhibitor/ARB or any other anti-hypertensive medication. Evaluation of outcome was assessed by rate of hospitalization, requirement of oxygen therapy, requirement of high flow nasal cannula, admission to ICU and mortality between two groups. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows, version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results: We collected data from 147 Covid-19 positive patients confirmed by RT-PCR. Among them, 117 (79.6%) had a history of taking RAAS inhibitor and 30 had history of taking other antihypertensive medications. Of them, two-third patients had more than 50 years of age and more than half of the patients had overweight or obesity. Other than hypertension they had several comorbidities such as Diabetes Mellitus (45.4%), Ischemic Heart Diseases (35.4%), Asthma or COPD (15%) etc. Rate of hospitalization had no statistical difference between RAAS inhibitor group and other hypertensive group (48.7% vs 46.70% respectively;p-value-0.841). There was no statistical difference between two groups in terms of requirement of oxygen therapy (p-value-0.297), High Flow Nasal Cannula (p-value-0.430), intensive care unit (p-value-0.194) and death (p-value-0.383) also. Almost half and one-third of the patients had persistence of symptoms even after 14 days and 28 days respectively. Fatigue, cough, breathlessness, loss of appetite and taste were the most common symptoms among those. Conclusion: In our study we found that RAAS inhibitor treatment had no adverse effect on the outcome of COVID-19 patients compared with other antihypertensive drugs. Patients may continue receiving ACEIs and ARBs for the treatment of any indication for RAASi without an increased risk of worse outcomes.","output":"Evaluation of outcome of Coronavirus disease 2019 patients receiving RAAS inhibitors (OCRAS study): A prospective observational study of Bangladeshi hypertensive patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Though the lungs are predominantly affected in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, extra-pulmonary manifestations can occur. Extra-pulmonary manifestations of the central and peripheral nervous system need to be recognised as they can strongly determine the outcome. This mini-review summarises and discusses previous and recent findings about neuro-COVID. The spectrum of central nervous system disease in COVID-19 patients is much broader than so far anticipated. Peripheral nerves and the skeletal muscle are less predominantly affected. In the vast majority of the cases, there is no direct attack of the virus towards vulnerable structures, which explains why various manifestations of the nervous system manifest favourably to immune suppression or immune modulation. Overall, the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of CNS/PNS involvement in COVID-19 is wider than believed.

N95 decontamination and reuse programs provide one potential solution to this problem. Unfortunately, a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of decontamination on the fit of various N95 models using a quantitative fit test (QNFT) approach is lacking. AIMS: 1) To investigate the effects of up to eight rounds of vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) decontamination on the fit of N95 respirators currently in use in a hospital setting. 2) To examine if N95 respirators worn by one user can adapt to the face shape of a second user with no compromise to fit following VHP decontamination. METHODS: The PortaCount Pro+ Respirator Fit Tester Model 8038 was used to quantitatively define functional integrity, measured by fit, of N95 respirators following decontamination with VHP. FINDINGS: There was an observable downward trend in the functional integrity of Halyard Fluidshield 46727 N95 respirators throughout eight cycles of decontamination with VHP. Functional integrity of 3M 1870 N95 respirators was significantly reduced after the respirator was worn, decontaminated with VHP, and then quantitatively fit tested on a second user. Furthermore, we uncovered inconsistencies between qualitative fit test and QNFT results that may have strong implications on the fit testing method used by institutions.

This vaccine hesitancy is an important factor affecting our ability to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : The objective of the study was to examine the attitudes and willingness among US Veterans toward receiving COVID-19 vaccination. The study used a quantitative qualitative mixed methods design with a telephone survey and then in-depth interviews in a subset of those surveyed. Participants were unvaccinated Veterans (N=184) selected randomly from a registry of patients who had received VA healthcare during the pandemic and had a diagnostic test for COVID-19. The primary outcome was willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccination. Survey data collection and in-depth interviews were conducted by telephone. Analyses of the survey data compared the primary outcome with demographics, clinical data, and survey responses using bivariate and multiple regression analyses. A subset (N=10) of those surveyed, participated in an in-depth interview. Interview transcripts were analyzed to derive themes using qualitative content analysis. Results: : Almost 40% of participants disagreed they would receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Participants who were younger, female, and had fewer comorbid conditions more likely (P<0.05) to disagree with COVID-19 vaccination. In multiple regression willingness to accept vaccination was associated with reliance on a doctor or family members recommendation and with a belief that vaccines are effective. In-depth interviews revealed several barriers to COVID-19 vaccination, including lack of trust in the government and vaccine manufacturers, concerns about the speed of vaccine development, fear of side effects and fear the vaccine was a tool of racism. Conclusions: : This study illustrates the complexity of patients deliberation about COVID-19 vaccination and may help physicians and other health care providers understand patients perspectives about COVID-19 vaccination.

PURPOSE: (1) Synthesize the available data regarding anorectal motility patterns in children following repair of Hirschsprung disease. (2) Evaluate the reported anorectal manometry protocols. DATA SOURCES: We performed a systematic review of four databases: Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and PubMed. STUDY SELECTION: This systematic review was performed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Studies reporting results of post-operative anorectal manometry in children with Hirschsprung disease were evaluated for inclusion.

Currently, more than 100 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide, with over 2.4 million mortalities. The pandemic affects people of all ages but older individuals and those with severe chronic illnesses, including cancer patients, are at higher risk. PATIENT CONCERNS: The impact of cancer treatment on the progression of COVID-19 is unclear. Therefore, we assessed the effects of chemotherapy on COVID-19 outcomes for 2 cancer patients. On January 24, 2020, a level I response to a major public health emergency was initiated in Hubei Province, China, which includes Enshi Autonomous Prefecture that has a population of 4.026 million people. As of April 30, 2020, 252 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 11 asymptomatic carriers were identified in Enshi. DIAGNOSIS: Among the confirmed cases and asymptomatic carriers, 2 patients were identified who were previously diagnosed with malignant tumors, including one with hepatocellular carcinoma and the other with cardia carcinoma. INTERVENTIONS: These 2 patients were receiving or just completed chemotherapy at the time of their COVID-19 diagnosis. OUTCOMES: Both patients were followed and presented favorable outcomes. The positive outcomes for these 2 patients could be partially explained by their recent chemotherapy that impacted their immune status. Also, their relatively younger ages and lack of comorbidities were likely factors in their successful recovery from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Anticancer treatment might enhance a patient's ability to respond favorably to COVID-19 infection. However, anticancer treatment is likely to impact immune function differently in different individuals, which can influence disease outcomes.","output":"The impact of recent chemotherapy on immunity in 2 COVID-19 cases with gastrointestinal tumors: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Periodontitis is a common inflammatory disease that affects the teeth-supporting tissue and causes bone and tooth loss. Moreover, in a worldwide population, periodontal disease is often associated with cardiovascular diseases. Emerging studies have reported that one of the major pathogens related to periodontitis is Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), which triggers the inflammatory intracellular cascade. Here, we hypothesized a possible protective effect of ascorbic acid (AA) in the restoration of the physiological molecular pathway after exposure to lipopolysaccharide derived from P. gingivalis (LPS-G). In particular, human gingiva-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hGMSCs) and endothelial-differentiated hGMSCs (e-hGMSCs) exposed to LPS-G showed upregulation of p300 and downregulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), proteins associated with DNA methylation and histone acetylation. The co-treatment of AA and LPS-G showed a physiological expression of p300 and DNMT1 in hGMSCs and e-hGMSCs. Moreover, the inflammatory process triggered by LPS-G was demonstrated by evaluation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their intracellular localization. AA exposure re-established the physiological ROS levels. Despite the limitations of in vitro study, these findings collectively expand our knowledge regarding the molecular pathways involved in periodontal disease, and suggest the involvement of epigenetic modifications in the development of periodontitis.","output":"Role of ascorbic acid in the regulation of epigenetic processes induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis in endothelial-committed oral stem cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Covid-19 pandemic is characterized by extreme variability in the outcome distribution and mortality rates across different countries. Some recent studies suggested an inverse correlation with BCG vaccination at population level, while others denied this hypothesis. In order to address this controversial issue, we performed a strict epidemiological study collecting data available on a global scale, considering additional variables such as cultural-political factors and adherence to other vaccination coverages. Methods: Data on 121 countries, accounting for about 99% of Covid-19 cases and deaths globally, were from John's Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, United Nations, Human Freedom Report, and BCG Atlas. Statistical models used were Ordinary Least Squares, Tobit and Fractional Probit, implemented on Stata/MP16 software. Results: Based on our results, countries where BCG vaccination is or has been mandated in the last decades have seen a drastic reduction in Covid-19 diffusion (-80% on average) and mortality (-50% on average), even controlling for relative wealth of countries and their governmental health expenditure. A significant contribution to this reduction (respectively -50% and -13% on average) was also associated to the outbreak onset during summer, suggesting a possible influence of seasonality. Other variables turned out to be associated, though to a lesser extent. Conclusions: Relying on a very large dataset and a wide array of control variables, our study confirms a strong and robust association between Covid-19 diffusion and mortality with BCG vaccination and a set socio-economic factors, opening new perspectives for clinical speculations and public health policies.","output":"BCG vaccination and socioeconomic variables vs Covid-19 global features: clearing up a controversial issue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The problems experienced by the psychologists while conducting psychological assessment during the COVID-19 era and the individual solutions offered for those problems have been examined within this study by taking into consideration the ethical principles. 50 participants working actively during the COVID-19 era have been reached out within the scope of the study.

Compared with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the computer-aided diagnosis machine learning algorithm based on medical images can vastly ease the burden on clinicians. Even so, despite existing hundreds of millions of confirmed cases worldwide, there has not been a mature, large scale, high quality, single standard shared image data set yet, which can lead to some problems. For instance, 1) Because the sources of medical images and the collection standards are not guaranteed, features extracted by the neural network may not be very ideal. 2) Due to the small number of samples, some outliers (e.g., blurry medical images, inconspicuous symptoms) may significantly descend the performance of the model. To address these problems, we propose an adaptive self-paced transfer learning (ASPTL) algorithm in this paper. Specifically, inspired by the process of human learning from easy to difficult, we also evaluated the learning difficulty of the samples. Samples with no obvious disease features or wrong labels are relatively difficult to diagnose, and the samples that are easy to diagnose are selected adaptively in the iterative process.

The pervasiveness of the new essential service models is expanding, and includes self-driving cars, smart homes, smart cities, as well as promoting the development of some traditional fields such as agriculture, healthcare, and transportation; the development of IoT devices has not shown any sign of cooling down. On the one hand, several studies are coming up with many scenarios for IoT platforms, but some critical issues related to performance, speed, power consumption, availability, security, and scalability are not yet fully resolved. On the other hand, IoT devices are manufactured and developed by different organizations and individuals; hence, there is no unified standard (uniformity of IoT devices), i.e., sending and receiving messages among them and between them and the upper layer (e.g., edge devices). To address these issues, this paper proposes an IoT Platform called BMDD (Broker-less and Microservice architecture, Decentralized identity, and Dynamic transmission messages) that has a combination of two architectural models, including broker-less and microservices, with cutting-edge technologies such as decentralized identity and dynamic message transmission. The main contributions of this article are five-fold, including: (i) proposing broker-less and microservice for the IoT platform which can reduce single failure point of brokering architecture, easy to scale out and improve failover; (ii) providing a decentralized authentication mechanism which is suitable for IoT devices attribute (i.e., mobility, distributed); (iii) applying the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model for the authorization process; (iv) exploiting the gRPC protocol combined with the Kafka message queue enhances transmission rates, transmission reliability, and reduces power consumption in comparison with MQTT protocol; and (v) developing a dynamic message transmission mechanism that helps users communicate with any device, regardless of the manufacturer, since it provides very high homogeneity.","output":"BMDD: a novel approach for IoT platform (broker-less and microservice architecture, decentralized identity, and dynamic transmission messages)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In the U.S., strong ethnic/racial, socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic breastfeeding (BF) inequities persist, and African American and Hispanic women are less likely to meet their breastfeeding goals compared to White women. This systematic review (SR) was designed to answer the question: What is the impact of breastfeeding interventions targeting ethnic/racial minority women in the U.S. on improving BF initiation, duration and exclusivity rates? METHODS The SR was conducted following the Institute of Medicine Guidelines and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. The study protocol was developed and registered a priori in PROSPERO (ID#CRD42020177764). The electronical databases searched was MEDLINE All (Ovid). Search strategies were led by the team's expert public health librarian using both controlled vocabulary and free text queries and were tested against a validated set of relevant papers included in existing reviews. The GRADE methodology was used to assess the quality of the studies. RESULTS We included 60 studies that had randomized (n = 25), observational (n = 24), quasi-experimental (n = 9), or cross-sectional (n = 2) designs. The studies focused on populations that were multi-ethnic/racial (n = 22), only Hispanic (n = 24), only Black (n = 13), and only American Indian (n = 1). The study interventions were classified following the socioecological model: macrosystem/policy level (n = 6); community level (n=51), which included healthcare organizations (n = 34), The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) (n = 9), and community organizations/public health institutions (n = 8); and interpersonal level (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS Policy and community level interventions delivered through WIC, healthcare facilities, and community agencies) are likely to improve BF outcomes among women of color. The combination of interventions at different levels of the socioecological model has not been studied among minority women in the U.S. Implementation science research is needed to learn how best to scale up and sustain effective BF interventions, taking into account the needs and wants of minority women. Thus, it is strongly recommended to conduct large scale implementation research studies addressesing how to strengthen the different health and social environments surrounding women of color in the U.S. to improving their BF outcomes.","output":"Impact of breastfeeding interventions among United States minority women on breastfeeding outcomes: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human vision involves selectively directing the eyes to potential objects of interest. According to most prominent theories, selection is the quantal outcome of an ongoing competition between saliency-driven signals on the one hand, and relevance-driven signals on the other, with both types of signals continuously and concurrently projecting onto a common priority map. Here, we challenge this view. We asked participants to make a speeded eye movement towards a target orientation, which was presented together with a non-target of opposing tilt. In addition to the difference in relevance, the target and non-target also differed in saliency, with the target being either more or less salient than the non-target. We demonstrate that saliency- and relevance-driven eye movements have highly idiosyncratic temporal profiles, with saliency-driven eye movements occurring rapidly after display onset while relevance-driven eye movements occur only later. Remarkably, these types of eye movements can be fully separated in time: We find that around 250 ms after display onset, eye movements are no longer driven by saliency differences between potential targets, but also not yet driven by relevance information, resulting in a period of non-selectivity, which we refer to as the attentional limbo. Binomial modeling further confirmed that visual selection is not necessarily the outcome of a direct battle between saliency- and relevance-driven signals. Instead, selection reflects the dynamic changes in the underlying saliency- and relevance-driven processes themselves, and the time at which an action is initiated then determines which of the two will emerge as the driving force of behavior.

In this paper, a stethoscope is utilized as an internal sound sensor which are capable of noise reduction and affordable as IoT solutions. After the stethoscope was assembled with a microphone, a frequency range for measurement was identified as 0~255Hz using the swept-sine technique. Two stethoscope sensors were attached to an industrial robot, and the capability of noise reduction is verified by similarity of Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms from sounds with and without existence of factory noise. Next, impact tests were performed to detect collision when the robot was stationary, and collisions by human hand during robot operation were detected from STFT spectrogram analysis. Finally, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model from the spectrograms was established to estimate a rotating joint axis during operation, showing 91% and 90.83% accuracy for each stethoscope, respectively.","output":"Development of internal sound sensor using stethoscope and its applications for machine monitoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several clinical practice guidelines exist for the management of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, but the use and overuse of medications and medical tests with insufficient evidence of effectiveness remains substantial.

METHODS: This was a prevalence-based cost-of-illness multicentric study performed from the societal perspective during 2016-2017. A case was defined as a laboratory-confirmed RSV infection with hospitalization. All costs and use of resources were collected directly from medical invoices and health records. RESULTS: This study included 193 patients with a diagnosis of RSV. The average hospital stay duration was 5.55 days. The major contributors to hospitalization costs were room costs (31.5%), drugs (21.8%), and indirect costs (14.9%). Medications with the highest costs were nebulization with a hypertonic solution and systemic antibiotics. In total, 96% of ?-lactam antibiotics, 90% of bronchodilators, and 86% of corticosteroids and epinephrine were classified as inappropriate. CONCLUSION: RSV infection in Colombia places a high economic burden on the health system.

We anticipate that post-total knee arthroplasty kinesiophobia may have an impact on patients postoperative pain scores, knee function, and ability to care for themselves in daily life. The purpose of this study is to conduct a micro-video intervention via WeChat to verify the impact of this method on the rapid recovery of patients with kinesiophobia after total knee arthroplasty during neo-coronary pneumonia. METHODS: Using convenience sampling method, 78 patients with kinesiophobia after artificial total knee arthroplasty who met the exclusion criteria were selected and randomly grouped, with the control group receiving routine off-line instruction and the intervention group receiving micro-video intervention, and the changes in the relevant indexes of the two groups of patients at different time points on postoperative day 1, 3 and 7 were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences in the scores of kinesiophobia, pain, knee flexion mobility (ROM) and ability to take care of daily life between the two groups on the first postoperative day (P > .05). On postoperative day 3 and 7, there were statistical differences in Tampa Scale for kinesiophobia, pain, activities of daily living scale score and ROM between the two groups (P < .01), and the first time of getting out of bed between the two groups (P < .05), and by repeated-measures ANOVA, there were statistically significant time points, groups and interaction effects of the outcome indicators between the 2 groups (P < .01), indicating that the intervention group reconstructed the patients postoperative kinesiophobiaand hyperactivity.

Methods: We here report the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a total number of 209 native kidney diseases requiring renal biopsy for diagnosis in a retrospective observational study from a tertiary hospital in Germany.

Baseline research shows nearly 89.3% of very low birth weight (VLBW, < 1500 g) infants suffer from AH in China. Therefore, a prospective multicentric quality improvement (QI) initiative to reduce regional AH and improve outcomes among VLBW neonates was implemented. METHODS: The study used a sequential PlanDoStudyAct (PDSA) approach. Clinical data were collected prospectively from 5 NICUs within the Sino-Northern Neonatal Network (SNN) in China. The hypothermia prevention bundle came into practice on January 1, 2019. The clinical characteristics and outcomes data in the pre-QI phase (January 1, 2018C December 31, 2018) were compared with that from the post-QI phase (January 1, 2019CDecember 31, 2020). Clinical characteristics and outcomes data were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 750 in-born VLBW infants were enrolled in the study, 270 in the pre-QI period and 480 in the post- QI period, respectively. There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics of infants between these two phases. Compared with pre-QI period, the incidence of AH was decreased significantly after the QI initiative implementation in the post-QI period (95.9% vs. 71.3%, P < 0.01). Incidence of admission moderate-to-severe hypothermia (AMSH, < 36) also decreased significantly, manifesting a reduction to 38.5% in the post-QI (68.5% vs 30%, P < 0.01). Average admission temperature improved from after QI (35.5 [Formula: see text] 0.7 vs. 36.0 [Formula: see text] 0.6, P < 0.01). There was no increase in proportion the number of infants with a temperature of > 37.5 C or thermal burns between the two groups. The risk ratio of mortality in infants during the post-QI period was significantly lower in the post-QI period as compared to the pre-QI period [adjusted risk ratio (aRR): 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.13C0.50]. The risk ratio of late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS) also significantly lowered in the post-QI period (aRR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.50C0.87). CONCLUSION: Implementation of multicentric thermoregulatory QI resulted in a significant reduction in AH and AMSH in VLBW neonates with associated reduction in mortality. We gained a lot from the QI, and successfully aroused the attention of perinatal medical staff to neonatal AH. This provided a premise for continuous quality improvement of AH in the future, and might provide a reference for implementation of similar interventions in developing countries.

Despite the efforts, the understanding of the many facets of the pandemic is still rather limited. In the present manuscript, we have monitored the evolution of the lethality rate in Italy by using the data collected over the last three months. Our data indicate that there is a striking correlation between the number of infected people of a certain week and the deaths of the following one. Despite the overall simplicity of the applied approach and its many approximations, the analysis of the Italian scenario provides some interesting insights into the pandemic. Indeed, we have found that the lethality rate is virtually unchanged over the last two months. This implies that the reduction of the deaths is strictly connected to the decrease of cases. Unfortunately, the present study does not support the idea that the virus potency has lowered in the last weeks, as our data demonstrate that the likelihood of a fatal outcome after the infection has not decreased in the recent outbreak evolution. Moreover, we show that the lethality rate is still very high in the country ({approx}13.5%). Since this number is remarkably higher if compared to the actual lethality estimates made worldwide, this finding suggests that the number of detected cases may be a gross underestimation of the actual infected people, likely due to the presence of a significant number of non-symptomatic or paucisymptomatic individuals in the population.","output":"Analysis of the time evolution of SARS-CoV-2 lethality rate in Italy: Evidence of an unaltered virus potency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The organ tropism of MHV-A59, a murine coronavirus, was studied in 4-6 week-old C57BL/6 mice inoculated by different routes and with various amounts of virus.

Its complications are usually self-limited consisting mostly of local skin burns. This report presents a major complication, a femur shaft fracture following an osteoid osteoma radiofrequency ablation. The fracture occurred approximately one year after the ablation at the site of the osteoid osteoma. Discussion Few case reports have been published regarding subtrochanteric femur fracture after ablation of an osteoid osteoma. To our knowledge this is the first report of a femoral shaft fracture following an ablation. Another unique characteristic of the presented case is the late presentation, approximately one year following ablation. Factors which may have contributed to the fracture include lateral entry point of the drill which may have weakened the femur when taking its biological and mechanical properties into account, and the fact that the patient was a soldier who was allowed to continue his military training only six weeks after the ablation. Conclusion Radiofrequency ablation is an effective and relatively safe technique in treating osteoid osteomas, however the physician should be aware of the fracture risk involved, consider mechanical and biologic factors of the bone prior to drilling, and be very conservative when recommending return to high level activity. In addition, a close follow-up should be carried on after the procedure in order to supervise bone remodeling.","output":"Femur shaft fracture following osteoid osteoma radiofrequency ablation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) cause one of the most important and rapidly emerging mosquito-borne viral diseases in humans.

World Health Organization (WHO)-defined aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) are thought to increase the risk of aerosol transmission to HCWs, but there are presently insufficient data to quantify risk accurately or establish a hierarchy of risk-prone procedures. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study measured the amount of H1N1 (2009) RNA in aerosols in the vicinity of H1N1 positive patients undergoing AGPs to help quantify the potential risk of transmission to HCWs. There were 99 sampling occasions (windows) producing a total of 198 May stages for analysis in the size ranges 0.86C7.3 m. Considering stages 2 (4C7.3 m) and 3 (0.86C4 m) as comprising one sample, viral RNA was detected in 14 (14.1%) air samples from 10 (25.6%) patients. Twenty three air samples were collected while potential AGPs were being performed of which 6 (26.1%) contained viral RNA; in contrast, 76 May samples were collected when no WHO 2009 defined AGP was being performed of which 8 (10.5%) contained viral RNA (unadjusted OR = 2.84 (95% CI 1.11C7.24) adjusted OR = 4.31 (0.83C22.5)). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: With our small sample size we found that AGPs do not significantly increase the probability of sampling an H1N1 (2009) positive aerosol (OR (95% CI) = 4.31 (0.83C22.5). Although the probability of detecting positive H1N1 (2009) positive aerosols when performing various AGPs on intensive care patients above the baseline rate (i.e. in the absence of AGPs) did not reach significance, there was a trend towards hierarchy of AGPs, placing bronchoscopy and respiratory and airway suctioning above baseline (background) values. Further, larger studies are required but these preliminary findings may be of benefit to infection control teams.","output":"Influenza Aerosols in UK Hospitals during the H1N1 (2009) Pandemic C The Risk of Aerosol Generation during Medical Procedures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyze the transmission routes, possible viral reservoirs in the oral cavity and considerations about dental care of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection We also analyze the protocols required before and after a dental procedure, aiming to increase the awareness of dentists about the importance of virus spread prevention among health care workers and patients The evaluation of symptoms associated with SARS- CoV-2 such as fever, fatigue, dry cough, myalgia, dyspnea, and the inquiry about possible contacts with infected people is of utmost importance The tongue and oral mucosa are important viral reservoirs and the transmission of the virus occurs primarily by saliva droplets Therefore, elective dental care should be postponed, attending only dental emergencies during this period, incorporating the use of protective personal equipment (PPE) and using manual instruments to prevent the production of aerosols","output":"[Dental care during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It's no secret that the pandemic has had far\\\\ranging and potentially devastating effects on higher education.

Recent promising work has demonstrated patient-physician racial concordance in populations of colour as a potential area of focus for addressing health inequities for diverse communities. The impact of shared cultural experiences and cultural competency leads to mutual respect, trust, and improved communication between patients and physicians guiding their care. This approach is dependent on the availability of physicians of colour and similarly other healthcare providers. The Temerty Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto has attempted to address the deficit in its own community through a two-pronged approach: mentorship through the Community of Support (COS) and the Summer Mentorship Program (SMP), and the implementation of the Black Student Application Program (BSAP). These initiatives have significantly increased Black medical student representation and continue to have considerable impact on Black communities in the surrounding area. Through partnerships with community organizations that support the ethos of these programs, the vision of a more culturally diverse physician workforce in Canada has been reinforced. The adoption of similar programs across Canadian medical schools can lead to better representation within medicine and help contribute to a necessary culture shift within the ranks of medical institutions.

In this retrospective study, we assessed respiratory bacterial co-infections in lower respiratory tract samples taken from intensive care unit-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, by comparing the conventional culture approach to an innovative molecular diagnostic technology. A total of 230 lower respiratory tract samples (i.e., bronchial aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavages) were taken from 178 critically ill COVID-19 patients. Each sample was processed by a semi-quantitative culture and by a multiplex PCR panel (FilmArray Pneumonia Plus panel), allowing rapid detection of a wide range of clinically relevant pathogens and a limited number of antimicrobial resistance markers. More than 30% of samples showed a positive bacterial culture, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus the most detected pathogens. FilmArray showed an overall sensitivity and specificity of 89.6% and 98.3%, respectively, with a negative predictive value of 99.7%. The molecular test significantly reduced the turn-around-time (TAT) and increased the rates of microbial detection. Most cases missed by culture were characterized by low bacterial loads (10(4)C10(5) copies/mL). FilmArray missed a list of pathogens not included in the molecular panel, especially Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (8 cases).

Mobile crowdsourcing could potentially meet the future massive health care IoT (mH-IoT) demands by enabling anytime, anywhere sense and analyses of health-related data to tackle such a pandemic situation. However, data reliability and availability are among the many challenges for the realization of next-generation mH-IoT, especially in COVID-19 epidemics.

Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has proven its strengths to provide intelligent data reliability and availability. The action-state learning procedure of RL-based frameworks enables the learning system to enhance the optimal use of the information as the time passes and data increases. In this article, we propose an RL-based crowd-to-machine (RLC2M) framework for mH-IoT, which leverages crowdsourcing and an RL model (Q-learning) to address the health care information processing challenges.

A novel, inventory perspective of COVID-19 is proposed, with random inflow, random losses and retrials (recurrent cases) and delayed/distributed exit, with randomly varying fractions of the exit distribution. A minimal construal, it enables representation of COVID-19 evolution with close fit of national incidence profiles, including single and multiple pattern outbreaks, oscillatory, periodic or non-periodic evolution, followed by retraction, leveling off, or strong resurgence. Furthermore, based on asymptotic laws, the minimum number of variables that must be monitored for identifying CaL and IR is determined and a real-time identification method is presented. The method is data-driven, utilizing the entry rate to HCUs and scaled, or dimensionless variables, including the mean residence time of symptomatic carriers in CaL and the mean residence time in CaL of patients entering HCUs. As manifested by several robust case studies of national COVID-19 incidence profiles, it provides efficient identification in real-time under unbiased monitoring error, without relying on any model. The propagation factor, a stochastic process, is reconstructed from the identified trajectories of CaL and IR, enabling evaluation of control measures.

The disease generally consists of three different clinical types in humans: visceral (kala-azar, VL), cutaneous (CL) and mucocutaneous leishmaniosis (MCL). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), leishmaniosis is still one of the world's most neglected diseases. It has been nearly 13-14 years since the completion of the first complete genome sequence of a Leishmania parasite. However, much information about these parasites remains to be elucidated, such as the causes of differences in tissue tropism. The aim of this study is to perform the whole-genome sequencing of Leishmania infantum causing cutaneous leishmaniosis from a Turkish isolate with next-generation sequencing technology. METHODS: Genomic sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. The TruSeq Nano DNA Low Throughput Library Prep Kit, compatible with the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, was used to generate the library. Synthesis sequencing (SBS) was performed with a HiSeq Rapid SBS Kit v2 to generate single-fragment reads (2  150 bp; PE) with two fragment end-to-end assemblies. Bioinformatics analyses were performed on the Geneious 11.0.5. ( www.genius.com ) platform. RESULTS: In our study, a high-quality whole-genome sequence (WGS) of L. infantum was successfully generated, and a total of 32,009,137 base pairs of genomic DNA from 36 chromosomes were obtained. The resulting genomic DNA sequence was submitted to the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) database and registered under the name Leishmania infantum_TR01 (Lin_TR01). The following accession numbers were assigned by NCBI to the 36 chromosomes of the Lin_TR01 genome: CP027807, CP027810, CP027808, CP027811, CP027809, CP027812, CP027813, CP027814, CP027817, CP027818, CP027819, CP027815, CP027821, CP027816, CP027823, CP027820, CP027822, CP027824, CP027825, CP027826, CP027827, CP027828, CP027829, CP027830, CP027831, CP027832, CP027833, CP027834, CP027835, CP027836, CP027837, CP027838, CP027839, CP027840, CP027841, CP027842. As a result of the annotation of the Lin_TR01 genome, 3153 polymorphisms, 8324 genes, 8199 CDSs, 8109 mRNAs, 67 tRNAs, 11 rRNAs and 58 ncRNA were identified. Among the 8199 CDS obtained, 5278 encode hypothetical proteins. CONCLUSION: In this study, a high-quality WGS of Leishmania infantum was successfully obtained for the first time in Turkey. According to a review of WGS studies on this subject, the Lin_TR01 strain is the first strain to be isolated from cutaneous leishmaniosis. The reference genome of L. infantum JPCM5 (Peacock et al., 2007) was obtained from a visceral leishmaniosis case, in accordance with the classical tissue and organ tropism of the species.

The parameters of the model are learned using a multitask learning approach that leverages both data on the number of deaths across a set of regions, and cellphone data on individuals' mobility patterns specific to each region. Using this model, we propose a nonlinear optimal control problem aiming to find the optimal mobility-based intervention strategy that curbs the spread of the epidemic while obeying a budget on the economic cost incurred. We also show that the solution to this nonlinear optimal control problem can be efficiently found, in polynomial time, using tools from geometric programming. Furthermore, in the absence of a straightforward mapping from human mobility data to economic costs, we propose a practical method by which a budget on economic losses incurred may be chosen to eliminate excess deaths due to over-utilization of hospital resources.

It was developed for predicting the symptomatic effectiveness of the BNT162b2 (Comirnaty) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Vaxzevria) vaccines but could apply to other vaccines and effectiveness types. Direct prediction within the framework uses levels of vaccine-induced neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants to fit efficacy and effectiveness estimates from studies with a given vaccine. Indirect prediction uses a model fitted for one vaccine to predict the effectiveness of another. The directly predicted effectiveness of Comirnaty against the Delta variant was 44.8% (22, 69) after one and 84.6% (64, 97) after two doses, which is close to 45.6% and 85.5%, the average estimates from effectiveness studies with the vaccine.

This technique is associated with increased staff/patient contact and patient discomfort. We examined the correlation of the capillary blood glucose results obtained by the POCT device (Accuchek Inform II) with the serum glucose values obtained by the hospital laboratory and with the glucose readings obtained by the FDA-waived for in-patient use (because of COVID-19 pandemic) Freestyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). Methods: For this prospective cohort study fifty-two adult participants who were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and admitted to non-critical units were recruited. Among them, 41 (79%) were male, 50 (96%) had type 2 diabetes mellitus. CGMS sensors were placed on patients' arms, POCT and serum glucose measurements were taken as ordered. Descriptive statistics were calculated and linear mixed models were used to determine correlation. Results: There were a total of 467 Accuchek-Libre pairs with a highly statistically significant association between pairs, p<0.0001. There were also 44 serum glucose -Libre pairs, with a highly statistically significant association, p<0.0001. On average, for each unit increase in Libre glucose level, there was a 0.92 unit increase in Accuchek glucose level as well as a 1.05 unit increase in serum glucose level. Conclusion: These findings indicate excellent correlation between the standard POCT and the CGMS as well as between serum glucose and the CGMS values. Because of the advantages of the CGMS glucose readings over blood capillary glucose testing (reduced patient discomfort and reduced staff exposure to patients during the pandemic) hospitals should consider replacing capillary blood glucose testing with CGMS.","output":"Reliability of the freestyle libre continuous monitoring system in the inpatient setting: Implications for the covid-19 surge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: TANDEM is a randomised controlled trial of a complex healthcare intervention to improve the psychological and physical health of people living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and anxiety and/or depression.

Here, we describe the protocol for the process evaluation commissioned alongside the trial. A realist approach that includes attention to describing contexts and mechanisms has been adopted. METHODS: We set up a multi-disciplinary team to develop and deliver the process evaluation. The mixed-methods design incorporates quantitative process data; monitoring of intervention fidelity; qualitative interviews with patients, carers, health professionals (facilitators) and clinical supervisors about their perspectives on acceptability of the intervention; and exploration with all stakeholders (including management/policy-makers) on future implementation. Normalisation process theory (NPT) will inform data collection and interpretation with a focus on implementation. Quantitative process data will be analysed descriptively. Qualitative interview data will be analysed before the trial outcomes are known using analytic induction and constant comparison to develop themes.

The aim of the present study was to examine whether there is a relation between handedness and the depth of the olfactory sulcus (OS) and reinvestigate whether there is a lateralization of OS depth. METHODS: Forty-two healthy volunteers (mean age 24.1 years; 23 right-handed and 19 left-handed) participated. The subjects' brains were scanned using magnetic resonance imaging to assess OS depth. Normal olfactory function was ascertained using the Sniffin' Sticks odor identification test. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in OS depth between right- and left-handed participants (right-handed mean: right OS depth = 11.3 mm, left OS = 10.6 mm; left-handed mean: right OS = 11.3 mm, left OS = 11.0 mm). Across all subjects, OS depth was significantly larger on the right side compared to the left. CONCLUSION: Handedness has no major influence on OS depth. The present study confirmed that the right OS is deeper compared to the left OS, possibly indicating a right-sided lateralization of the olfactory system.

While the health needs of forcibly displaced people have been characterized in the literature, more still needs to be done globally to translate this knowledge into effective policies and actions, particularly in neurology. Methods: In 2020, a global network of published experts on neurological disease and refugees was convened. Nine physician experts from nine countries (2 low, 1 lower-middle income, 5 upper-middle, 1 high income) with experience treating displaced people originating from 18 countries participated in three survey and two discussion rounds in accordance with the Delphi method. Results: A consensus list of priority interventions for treating neurological conditions in displaced people was created, agnostic to cost considerations, with the ten highest ranking tests or treatments ranked as: computerized tomography scans, magnetic resonance imaging scans, levetiracetam, acetylsalicylic acid, carbamazepine, paracetamol, sodium valproate, basic blood tests, steroids and anti-tuberculous medication. The most important contextual considerations (100% consensus) were all economic and political, including the economic status of the displaced persons country of origin, the host country, and the stage in the asylum seeking process. The annual cost to purchase the ten priority neurological interventions for the entire displaced population was estimated to be 220 million USD for medications and 4.2 billion USD for imaging and tests.

METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of all MT patients between January 2015 and May 2018. Successful recanalization was defined as a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score of 2b-3. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) was defined according to European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study 3. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2 at 3 months indicated good outcome. RESULTS MT was performed in 410 patients: 221 DTC and 189 DS. Median NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 16 and premorbid mRS score was 0. Thrombolysis was applied in 62.2% with the same time from symptom onset in both groups (94.5 vs 95 minutes). Successful recanalization (79.3% vs 77.8%) and NIHSS score reduction from admission to discharge (16-7 vs 17-6) were comparable. Time delay from onset to revascularization was 96 minutes in DS (212 vs 308 minutes, p = 0.001). At follow-up, DTC patients had a trend to better outcome (33.5% vs 24.3%, p = 0.056). Neither sICH (6.3% vs 5.9%, p = 0.840) nor mortality (31.2% vs 34.4%, p = 0.387) differed between the groups. CONCLUSION DS patients benefit from MT without relevant safety concerns, but with a trend to unfavorable outcome compared to DTC patients.

We aimed to summarize the evidence regarding the use of frailty tools in COVID-19, assessing the risk of frail patients for in-hospital and 30-day mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and length of hospitalization (LOH). Methods: The protocol was prospectively registered via PROSPERO (CRD42021241544). Studies reporting on frailty in COVID-19 patients were eligible. We compared in-hospital and 30-day mortality, lengths of stay and ICU admission in frail and non-frail COVID-19 patients. We also compared average frailty in COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors. MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Scopus, CENTRAL, and Web of Science were searched up to 3 February 2021 with terms related to COVID-19 and frail*. Search, selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted in duplicate by two independent review authors. The QUIPS tool was used for the risk of bias assessment. Odds ratios (OR) and weighted mean differences (WMD) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random effect model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 and  2 tests. Results: From 1693 records identified, 27 were included in the qualitative and 21 in the quantitative synthesis. Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was used in 24 studies, the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) by one and the Frail Non-Disabled questionnaire by another one. One study reported both CFS and HFRS. We found that frail patients (CFS 5C9) compared to non-frail patients (CFS 1C4) have a higher risk for both in-hospital (OR: 2.77;CI: 1.86C4.15) and 30-day mortality (OR: 1.47;CI:1.05C2.06). Frail patients (CFS 5C9) were less likely to be admitted to ICU (OR 0.05, CI: 0.01C0.16). Statistical heterogeneity was not present for CFS 5C9 30-day mortality OR and ICU admission OR (CFS 1C3 vs 4C9), and was moderate for in-hospital mortality WMD. Quantitative synthesis for LOH was not feasible. Most studies carried a high risk of bias.

This workflow started with the throat swab of the COVID-19 patient, combined reverse transcript PCR, and multi-amplification in one-step to shorten the experiment time, then can quickly and steadily obtain high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome within 24 h. A comprehensive evaluation of the method was conducted in 42 samples: the sequencing quality of the method was correlated well with the viral load of the samples; high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome could be obtained stably in the samples with Ct value up to 39.14; data yielding for different Ct values were assessed and the recommended sequencing time was 8 h for samples with Ct value of less than 20; variation analysis indicated that the method can detect the existing and emerging genomic mutations as well; Illumina sequencing verified that ultra-deep sequencing can greatly improve the single read error rate of Nanopore sequencing, making it as low as 0.4/10,000 bp. In summary, high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome can be acquired by utilizing the amplicon amplification and it is an effective method in accelerating the acquisition of genetic resources and tracking the genome diversity of SARS-CoV-2.

He enjoyed school and loved playing outdoors. He had been progressing well with his life and neither his parents nor school had any concerns for him. Following the COVID-19 pandemic and school closures, Michael began to became more conscious of daily hygiene safety advice. However, things escalated to a very difficult level. Initially, he manifested extreme levels of anxiety with heightened levels of distress. He ran away from open doors or windows for fear he would catch the virus, insisted on changing his clothes several times per day, would become distressed if anyone touched him accidentally while he was outside and could spend hours afterwards crying and screaming.In June 2020 he showed profound refusal to engage in basic care tasks and a dramatic social withdrawal, and ultimately required admission to hospital. He refused to eat and drink, stopped washing and toileting himself, lay in bed with the covers over this head, became non-verbal and refused to engage with any conversation or games. He showed prolonged periods of screaming. Ultimately this reached a level requiring TPN and PEG feeding and a low stimulation environment. Diagnosis of pervasive refusal disorder, secondary to severe COVID-19 related anxiety was made.DiscussionPervasive refusal disorder is a rare and potentially life threatening condition in children. It is described as a profound psychological response to uncontrollable events such as grief, abuse, parental conflict and migration. In this case, it was the threat of the global pandemic. Through treatment in low stimulation environments, with consistent communication and rehabilitation and medication, followed by individual and family therapies when patients are more able, patients show a slow, but generally complete recovery.

In the face of a global pandemic, palliative care teams are uniquely placed to support patients with cancer who also have COVID-19. This may include managing severe symptoms such as dyspnea and agitation, as well as guiding advance care planning and goals of care conversations. In tandem, there is a need for palliative care teams to continue to provide care to patients with advanced cancer who are COVID-negative but who are at higher risk of infection and adverse outcomes related to COVID-19.

METHODS: A departmental guideline was developed for radiologists that specified reporting terminology and required communication for patients with imaging findings suggestive of COVID-19, on the basis of patient test status and imaging indication. In this retrospective study, radiology reports completed from March 1, 2020, to May 3, 2020, that mentioned COVID-19 were reviewed. Reports were divided into patients with known COVID-19, patients with \\"suspected\\" COVID-19 (having an order indication of respiratory or infectious signs or symptoms), and \\"unsuspected patients\\" (other order indications, eg, trauma or non-chest pain). The primary outcome was the percentage of COVID-19 reports using recommended terminology; the secondary outcome was percentages of suspected and unsuspected patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Relationships between categorical variables were assessed using the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Among 77,400 total reports, 1,083 suggested COVID-19 on the basis of imaging findings; 774 of COVID-19 reports (71%) used recommended terminology. Of 574 patients without known COVID-19 at the time of interpretation, 345 (60%) were eventually diagnosed with COVID-19, including 61% (315 of 516) of suspected and 52% (30 of 58) of unsuspected patients. Nearly all unsuspected patients (46 of 58) were identified on CT. CONCLUSIONS: Radiologists rapidly adopted recommended reporting terminology for patients with suspected COVID-19. The majority of patients for whom radiologists raised concern for COVID-19 were subsequently diagnosed with the disease, including the majority of clinically unsuspected patients. Using unambiguous terminology and timely notification about previously unsuspected patients will become increasingly critical to facilitate COVID-19 testing and contact tracing as states begin to lift restrictions.","output":"Radiologist Reporting and Operational Management for Patients With Suspected COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In view of the current pandemic by SARS-CoV-2 it deems essential to understand the key concepts about the infection: its epidemiological origin, presentation, clinical course, diagnosis and treatment (still experimental in many cases).

However, their widespread implementation is hindered by VR induced symptoms and effects (VRISE) and the lack of skills in VR software development. This study offers guidelines for the development of VR software in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology, by describing and discussing the stages of the development of Virtual Reality Everyday Assessment Lab (VR-EAL), the first neuropsychological battery in immersive VR. Techniques for evaluating cognitive functions within a realistic storyline are discussed. The utility of various assets in Unity, software development kits, and other software are described so that cognitive scientists can overcome challenges pertinent to VRISE and the quality of the VR software. In addition, this pilot study attempts to evaluate VR-EAL in accordance with the necessary criteria for VR software for research purposes. The VR neuroscience questionnaire (VRNQ; Kourtesis et al., 2019b) was implemented to appraise the quality of the three versions of VR-EAL in terms of user experience, game mechanics, in-game assistance, and VRISE. Twenty-five participants aged between 20 and 45 years with 12-16 years of full-time education evaluated various versions of VR-EAL. The final version of VR-EAL achieved high scores in every sub-score of the VRNQ and exceeded its parsimonious cut-offs. It also appeared to have better in-game assistance and game mechanics, while its improved graphics substantially increased the quality of the user experience and almost eradicated VRISE.

The article highlights the natural history, anatomy, embryology, imaging, clinical implications, and neurosurgical significance of these lesions, which the authors believe represent a continuum, with different entities characterized by distinct embryopathologic features. The indications and surgical management options are discussed for these individual intracranial pathologies with relevant illustrations, and a novel classification is proposed for persistent falcine sinus (PFS). The role of neurointervention and/or microsurgery in specific cases such as sinus pericranii and enlarged emissary veins of the skull is highlighted. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and developmental anatomy of these lesions can reduce treatment morbidity and mortality. Some patients, including those with vein of Galen malformations (VOGMs), can present with the added systemic morbidity of a high-output cardiac failure. Although VOGM is the most studied and classified of the above-mentioned eDVAs, the authors believe that grouping the former with the other venous anomalies/abnormalities listed above would enable the clinician to convey the exact morphophysiological configuration of these lesions, predict their natural history with respect to evolving venous hypertension or stroke, and extrapolate invaluable insights from VOGM treatment to the treatment of other eDVAs. In recent years, many of these symptomatic venous malformations have been treated with endovascular interventions, although these techniques are still being refined. The authors highlight the broad concept of eDVAs and hope that this work will serve as a basis for future studies investigating the role of evolving focal venous hypertension/global intracranial hypertension and possibilities of fetal surgical intervention in these cases.","output":"A review of extraaxial developmental venous anomalies of the brain involving dural venous flow or sinuses: persistent embryonic sinuses, sinus pericranii, venous varices or aneurysmal malformations, and enlarged emissary veins."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chest computed tomography (CT) was reported to improve the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) as compared to chest X-ray (CXR). The aim of this study is to describe the CT-patterns of CAP in a large population visiting the emergency department and to see if some of them are more frequently missed on CXR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an ancillary analysis of the prospective multicenter ESCAPED study including 319 patients. We selected the 163 definite or probable CAP based on adjudication committee classification; 147 available chest CT scans were reinterpreted by 3 chest radiologists to identify CAP patterns. These CT-patterns were correlated to epidemiological, biological and microbiological data, and compared between false negative and true positive CXR CAP. RESULTS: Six patterns were identified: lobar pneumonia (51/147, 35%), including 35 with plurifocal involvement; lobular pneumonia (43/147, 29%); unilobar infra-segmental consolidation (24/147, 16%); bronchiolitis (16/147, 11%), including 4 unilobar bronchiolitis; atelectasis and bronchial abnormalities (8/147, 5.5%); interstitial pneumonia (5/147, 3.5%). Bacteria were isolated in 41% of patients with lobar pneumonia-pattern (mostly Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumonia) versus 19% in other patients (p = 0.01). Respiratory viruses were equally distributed within all patterns. CXR was falsely negative in 46/147 (31%) patients. Lobar pneumonia was significantly less missed on CXR than other patterns (p = 0.003), especially lobular pneumonia and unilobar infra-segmental consolidation, missed in 35% and 58% of cases, respectively. CONCLUSION: Lobar and lobular pneumonias are the most frequent CT-patterns. Lobar pneumonia is appropriately detected on CXR and mainly due to Streptococcus pneumoniae or Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Chest CT is very useful to identify CAP in other CT-patterns.

Results: A total of 280 references were retrieved, and 28 papers met our inclusion criteria, for a total of 436,799 college students. Thirteen studies involved non-Chinese college students, and 15 studies involved Chinese college students. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress was 29% (95% CI, 19-25%), 37% (95% CI, 32-42%), and 23% (95% CI, 8-39%), respectively. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative psychological effect on college students, and the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among Chinese college students is lower than among non-Chinese college students.","output":"Anxiety, depression, and stress prevalence among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 runs a severe disease associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome in a subset of patients, and a hyperinflammatory response developing in the second week contributes to the worse outcome. Inflammatory features are mostly compatible with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) observed in other viral infections despite resulting in milder changes. Early detection and treatment of MAS may be associated with a better outcome. However, available criteria for MAS associated with other causes have not been helpful. Objectives: To identify distinct features of MAS associated with COVID-19 using a large database enabling to assess of dynamic changes. Methods: PCR-confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 patients followed between March and September 2020 constituted the discovery set. Patients considered to have findings of MAS by experienced physicians and given anakinra or tocilizumab were classified as the MAS group and the remaining patients as the non-MAS group. The MAS group was then re-grouped as the cases with exact-MAS and borderline-MAS cases by the study group. Clinical and laboratory data including the Ct values of the PCR test were obtained from the database, and dynamic changes were evaluated especially for the first 14 days of the hospitalization. The second set of 162 patients followed between September-December 2020 were used as the replication group to test the preliminary criteria. In the second set, hospitalization rules were changed, and all patients required oxygen support and received dexamethasone 6mg/day or equivalent glucocorticoids. Daily changes were calculated for the laboratory items in MAS, borderline, and non-MAS groups to see the days differentiating the groups, and ROC curves and lower and upper limits (10-90%) of the selected parameters were calculated to determine the cutoff values. Results: A total of 769 PCR-confirmed hospitalized patients were analysed, and 77 of them were classified as MAS and 83 as borderline MAS patients. There was no statistically significant difference in the baseline viral loads of MAS patients compared to the non-MAS group according to the Ct values. Daily dynamic changes in the MAS group differed from the non-MAS group especially around the 6th day of hospitalization, and more than a twofold increase in ferritin and a 1.5-fold increase in D-dimer levels compared to the baseline values help to define the MAS group. Twelve items selected for the criteria are given in Table 1 below. The total score of 45 provided 79.6% sensitivity for the MAS (including borderline cases) and 81.3% specificity around days 5 and 6 in the discovery set, and a score of 60 increased the specificity to 94.9% despite a decrease in sensitivity to 40.8%. The same set provided a similar sensitivity (80.3%) in the replication, but a lower specificity (47.4-66% on days 6 to 9) due to a group of control patients with findings of MAS possibly masked by glucocorticoids. Conclusion: This study defined a set of preliminary criteria using the most relevant items of MAS according to the dynamic changes in the parameters in a group of COVID-19 patients. A score of 45 would be helpful to define a possible MAS group with reasonable sensitivity and specificity to start necessary treatments as early as possible.","output":"Preliminary criteria for macrophage activation syndrome associated with coronavirus disease-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized as highly contagious and deadly; however there is no credible and convenient biomarker to predict the severity of the disease. The aim of the present study was to estimate whether the CRP level is able to act as a marker in indicating the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: Patients who complained cough or chest pain with or without fever were enrolled after laboratory confirmed of SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid via qRT-PCR. Chest computed tomography (CT) was then performed to classify the patients into mild, moderate and severe pneumonia groups according to the interim management guideline. Then linear regression models were applied to analyze the association between c-reactive protein (CRP) levels and severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: When compared to mild pneumonia, the adjusted-Odds Ratio were 11.46, p = 0.029 and 23.40, p = 0.025 in moderate and severe pneumonia, respectively. The area under receiver operation curve was 0.898 (95% CI 0.835, 0.962, p < 0.001). Higher plasma CRP level indicated severe COVID-19 pneumonia and longer inpatients duration. CONCLUSIONS: The level of plasma CRP was positively correlated to the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. Our findings could assist to discern patients of moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia from the mild ones. Our findings may be useful as an earlier indicator for severe illness and help physicians to stratify patients for intense care unit transfer.","output":"Plasma CRP level is positively associated with the severity of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction:Community engagement is important for advancing Clinical and Translational Science (CTS), but face-to-face engagement has limited reach and scale We examined the feasibility of a novel virtual Facebook community platform for public engagement on health research statewide in Minnesota Methods:The Facebook platform, MN Research Link, was evaluated from June 19, 2019 to June 30, 2020 Facebook advertisements and boosts were used to recruit followers Content, based on prior formative work, included health research information and interactive postings (e g , live interviews with researchers) Standard metrics obtained from Facebook analytics included participation (followers), content reach (views), and engagement (likes, shares, comments, clicks) Results:During the 12-month period, we acquired 1406 followers (31% rural residents), with a retention of followers of 99 7% Mean number of views per month was 9379 83 (Mdn = 2791, range 724C41,510) Engagement metrics indicated a mean of 535 2 likes, shares, comments, and/or clicks per month (Mdn = 296 5, range 55C1535) The page continued to acquire new followers, but a slight decrease in engagement was observed in the final months after state COVID-19 mitigation strategies were implemented Conclusion:As the complexity of CTS continues to grow, along with social distancing measures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of virtual digital platforms to reach and engage community stakeholders in conversations about health and research has increasing importance Preliminary findings from this program evaluation indicate that a Facebook community platform is feasible to engage Minnesota residents in conversations around health and research topics Future work will evaluate its potential for reach, scale, and sustainability","output":"Feasibility of a virtual Facebook community platform for engagement on health research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Neglected occupational health and safety aspects in batik industries cause their workers to have an increased risk of lead exposure.

The fusion process of two cell aggregates is commonly studied as the coalescence of two viscous drops. However, tissues are complex materials and can exhibit viscoelastic behaviour. It is known that elastic effects can prevent the complete fusion of two drops, a phenomenon known as arrested coalescence. Here we report the presence of this phenomenon in stem cell aggregates and provide a theoretical framework which agrees with the experiments. In addition, agent-based simulations show that cell protrusion activity controls a solid-to-fluid phase transition, revealing that arrested coalescence can be found in the vicinity of an unjamming transition. By analysing the dynamics of the fusion process and combining it with nanoindentation measurements, we obtain the effective viscosity, shear modulus and surface tension of the aggregates.

Herein, a mathematical model demonstrates that the large amount of pulmonary venous admixture observed in patients with early COVID-19 can be reasonably explained by a combination of pulmonary embolism, ventilation-perfusion mismatching in the noninjured lung, and normal perfusion of the relatively small fraction of injured lung. Although underlying perfusion heterogeneity exacerbates existing shunt and ventilation-perfusion mismatch in the model, the reported hypoxemia severity in early COVID-19 patients is not replicated without either extensive perfusion defects, severe ventilation-perfusion mismatch, or hyperperfusion of nonoxygenated regions.","output":"Modeling lung perfusion abnormalities to explain early COVID-19 hypoxemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A nurse as well as a midwife belong to independent professions which inherently involve performing numerous tasks and functions in various areas and in various positions, which simultaneously requires from these professions respecting the rules of law In health-threatening conditions, for example during a pandemic, especially when all social groups are exposed to danger and when danger arises unexpectedly, nurses become an important link in the process of providing health security to everybody who needs it In such situations nurses are obliged to perform their professional duties as well as possible and, at the same time, they have to tackle numerous family responsibilities No matter if they take direct care of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus or those possibly suffering from COVID-19, work as university lecturers teaching prospective nurses or hold managerial positions, they always face professional difficulties and dilemmas or even real dangers Although the challenges which nurses face during the pandemic tend to change week by week, nurses, with time, learn to respond to them for the sake of other people's welfare","output":"A Polish nurse during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic - various aspects of following a nursing profession"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (coronavirus disease-2019) pandemic has changed care delivery for patients with end-stage kidney disease.

The initial results and long-term results were investigated by meta-analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-five articles (n = 196,486) were included. The ROSC rate in the ETI group (ES = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.38-0.59) was significantly higher than that in the SGA group (ES = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.20-0.34) and BMV group (ES = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.17-0.31). The rate of ROSC upon admission to the hospital in the ETI group (ES = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13-0.42) was significantly higher than that in the SGA group (ES = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.13-0.23) and BMV group (ES = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.10-0.22).

Recently, three randomized clinical trials on COVID-19 treatments were completed, one for lopinavir-ritonavir and two for remdesivir. One trial reported that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery, while the other two showed no benefit of the treatment under investigation. However, several statistical issues in the original design and analysis of the three trials are identified, which might shed doubts on their findings and the conclusions should be evaluated with cautions. Objective: From statistical perspectives, we identify several issues in the design and analysis of three COVID-19 trials and reanalyze the data from the cumulative incidence curves in the three trials using more appropriate statistical methods. Methods: The lopinavir-ritonavir trial enrolled 39 additional patients due to insignificant results after the sample size reached the planned number, which led to inflation of the type I error rate. The remdesivir trial of Wang et al. failed to reach the planned sample size due to a lack of eligible patients, while the bootstrap method was used to predict the quantity of clinical interest conditionally and unconditionally if the trial had continued to reach the originally planned sample size. Moreover, we used a terminal (or cure) rate model and a model-free metric known as the restricted mean survival time or the restricted mean time to improvement (RMTI) in this context to analyze the reconstructed data due to the existence of death as competing risk and a terminal event. The remdesivir trial of Beigel et al. reported the median recovery time of the remdesivir and placebo groups and the rate ratio for recovery, while both quantities depend on a particular time point representing local information. We reanalyzed the data to report other percentiles of the time to recovery and adopted the bootstrap method and permutation test to construct the confidence intervals as well as the P values. The restricted mean time to recovery (RMTR) was also computed as a global and robust measure for efficacy. Results: For the lopinavir-ritonavir trial, with the increase of sample size from 160 to 199, the type I error rate was inflated from 0.05 to 0.071. The difference of terminal rates was -8.74% (95% CI [-21.04, 3.55]; P=.16) and the hazards ratio (HR) adjusted for terminal rates was 1.05 (95% CI [0.78, 1.42]; P=.74), indicating no significant difference. The difference of RMTIs between the two groups evaluated at day 28 was -1.67 days (95% CI [-3.62, 0.28]; P=.09) in favor of lopinavir-ritonavir but not statistically significant. For the remdesivir trial of Wang et al., the difference of terminal rates was -0.89% (95% CI [-2.84, 1.06]; P=.19) and the HR adjusted for terminal rates was 0.92 (95% CI [0.63, 1.35]; P=.67). The difference of RMTIs at day 28 was -0.89 day (95% CI [-2.84, 1.06]; P=.37). The planned sample size was 453, yet only 236 patients were enrolled. The conditional prediction shows that the HR estimates would reach statistical significance if the target sample size had been maintained, and both conditional and unconditional prediction delivered significant HR results if the trial had continued to double the target sample size. For the remdesivir trial of Beigel et al., the difference of RMTRs between the remdesivir and placebo groups up to day 30 was -2.7 days (95% CI [-4.0, -1.2]; P<.001), confirming the superiority of remdesivir. The difference in recovery time at the 25th percentile (95% CI [-3, 0]; P=.65) was insignificant, while the differences manifested to be statistically significant at larger percentiles. Conclusions: Based on the statistical issues and lessons learned from the recent three clinical trials on COVID-19 treatments, we suggest more appropriate approaches for the design and analysis for ongoing and future COVID-19 trials.","output":"Statistical Issues and Lessons Learned from COVID-19 Clinical Trials with Lopinavir-Ritonavir and Remdesivir"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, many countries all over the world are facing the second wave of COVID-19.

METHODS A 34-question American Council of Academic Plastic Surgeons-approved survey was distributed on April 29, 2020, to attendings in academic plastic surgery programs in the United States. Variables were controlled whenever multiple attending responses were submitted from the same program. RESULTS A total of 113 attendings, including 30 (27.8%) program directors, responded to the survey. Most respondents were located in the northeast (41.4%). The average percentage of elective case volume was 23% of pre-COVID states. Those who reported a decrease in emergent surgical case volume (55.2%) estimated it to be at an average of 45% of the normal. Almost all the respondents (95.6%) agreed that they were working fewer hours than usual, and 40.9% of those reported a decrease of more than 20 hours per week of work.

This project aimed to describe the women who died in the UK during or up to a year after the end of pregnancy, to compare the quality of care received by women from different aggregated ethnic groups, and to identify any structural or cultural biases or discrimination affecting their care. METHODS: National surveillance data was used to identify all 1894 women who died during or up to a year after the end of pregnancy between 2009 and 18 in the UK. Their characteristics and causes of death were described. A Confidential Enquiry was undertaken to describe the quality of care women received. The care of a stratified random sample of 54 women who died during or up to a year after the end of pregnancy between 2009 and 18, (18 from the aggregated group of Black women, 19 from the Asian aggregated group and 17 from the White aggregated group) was re-examined specifically to describe any structural or cultural biases or discrimination identified. FINDINGS: There were no major differences causes of death between women from different aggregated ethnic groups, with cardiovascular disease the leading cause of death in all groups. Multiple areas of bias were identified in the care women received, including lack of nuanced care (notable amongst women from Black aggregated ethnic groups who died), microaggressions (most prominent in the care of women from Asian aggregated ethnic groups who died) and clinical, social and cultural complexity (evident across all ethnic groups). INTERPRETATION: This confidential enquiry suggests that multiple structural and other biases exist in UK maternity care. Further research on the role of microaggressions is warranted.

METHODS an experience report on the construction of a distance course aimed at graduates and residents of a nursing faculty at a public university located in the city of Rio de Janeiro. RESULTS the course's conception, operationalization and implementation were the result of a collective work that culminated in a non-formal, virtual and problematic teaching process, which reached a participation rate of 82% of enrolled students. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS even in times of social isolation, the course promoted collaborative learning of knowledge about COVID-19 and strengthened the relationship between professors and students.

Changes in life expectancy are also used to assess mortality trends, but mortality change is incompatible with the assumptions underpinning that intuitive interpretation of life expectancy. To provide an alternative, I return to the two main interpretations of the period life table. The first interpretation, as a synthetic-cohort life table, allows for forward-looking probabilistic statements regarding the individual life course. The second interpretation, as stationary population characteristics, yields standardized demographic indicators of the (past) reference period. Interpreting life table indicators such as life expectancy in the first manner is often more appealing, but only the second one makes sense during temporary mortality shocks. The absolute change in life expectancy can then be interpreted as the standardized value of the average lifespan reduction in a past death cohort.","output":"Interpreting Changes in Life Expectancy During Temporary Mortality Shocks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: We aimed to better understand the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in non-critically ill hospitalized patients secondarily presenting with clinical deterioration and increase in oxygen requirement. Methods: : We consecutively enrolled patients without clinical or biological evidence for superinfection, without left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and for whom a pulmonary embolism was discarded by computed tomography pulmonary angiography. We investigated lung ventilation and perfusion (LVP) by LVP scintigraphy, and, 24 hours later, left and right ventricular function by 99m Tc-labelled albumin gated-blood-pool scintigraphy with late (60 mn) tomographic albumin images on the lungs to evaluate lung albumin retention that could indicate microvascular injuries with secondary edema. Results: : We included 13 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. All had CT evidence of organizing pneumonia and normal LV ejection fraction.No patient demonstrated preserved ventilation with perfusion defect (mismatch), which may eliminate a distal lung thrombosis. Patterns of ventilation and perfusion were heterogeneous with sometimes healthy lung segments paradoxically hypoperfused and hypoventilated while both normal perfusion and ventilation were maintained in segments with organizing pneumonia (n=4). Lung albumin retention in area of organizing pneumonia was observed in 9 patients, indicating microvascular injuries, vessel permeability increase and secondary edema. Conclusion: In hospitalized non-critically ill patients without pulmonary embolism or LV dysfunction, various types of damage may contribute to clinical deterioration including microvascular injuries and secondary edema, broncho and vasoconstriction of area not involved by organizing pneumonia while no evidence was found for significant distal thrombosis detectable by LVP scintigraphy.","output":"Microvascular Injury With Secondary Edema, Bronchoconstriction and Vasoconstriction of Non-involved Lung Parenchymal Segments May Contribute to Clinical Deterioration of Non-critically Ill Patients Hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia Without Evidence of Pulmonary Embolism: A Preliminary Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cryo-EM maps are valuable sources of information for protein structure modeling. However, due to the loss of contrast at high frequencies, they generally need to be post-processed to improve their interpretability. Most popular approaches, based on global B-factor correction, suffer from limitations. For instance, they ignore the heterogeneity in the map local quality that reconstructions tend to exhibit. Aiming to overcome these problems, we present DeepEMhancer, a deep learning approach designed to perform automatic post-processing of cryo-EM maps. Trained on a dataset of pairs of experimental maps and maps sharpened using their respective atomic models, DeepEMhancer has learned how to post-process experimental maps performing masking-like and sharpening-like operations in a single step. DeepEMhancer was evaluated on a testing set of 20 different experimental maps, showing its ability to reduce noise levels and obtain more detailed versions of the experimental maps.

It is characterised by an excessive activation of the immune system that leads to a disproportionate and destructive inflammatory response. The high mortality rates are in part due to a delay in the diagnosis, and therefore clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion. When the treatment is started early, the survival rate reaches around 55% of cases. HLH usually presents with persistent fever, pancytopenia, and organomegaly and is associated with very high levels of serum ferritin. In this manuscript, we present the case of a patient with primary Sj?gren's syndrome who developed HLH after an acute infection by Cytomegalovirus.

To address this, we developed a Luminex-based multiplex immunoassay that detects total antibodies (IgG/IgM/IgA) against the N, S1 and RBD antigens and used it to compare antibody responses in 1225 blood donors across Greece. Seroprevalence based on single-antigen readouts was strongly influenced by both the antigen type and cut-off value and ranged widely [0.8% (95% CI 0.4-1.5%)-7.5% (95% CI 6.0-8.9%)]. A multi-antigen approach requiring partial agreement between RBD and N or S1 readouts (RBD&N|S1 rule) was less affected by cut-off selection, resulting in robust seroprevalence estimation [0.6% (95% CI 0.3-1.1%)-1.2% (95% CI 0.7-2.0%)] and accurate identification of seroconverted individuals.","output":"Accurate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveys require robust multi-antigen assays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quick and accurate building-level infectious disease transmission evaluation is a key concern that gains traction nowadays.

We recently reported that a component of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) surface protein, S1, can amplify the SASP of senescent cultured human cells and that a related mouse -coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), increases SASP factors and senescent cell burden in infected mice. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 induces senescence in human non-senescent cells and exacerbates the SASP in human senescent cells through Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3). TLR-3, which senses viral RNA, was increased in human senescent compared to non-senescent cells. Notably, genetically or pharmacologically inhibiting TLR-3 prevented senescence induction and SASP amplification by SARS-CoV-2 or Spike pseudotyped virus. While an artificial TLR-3 agonist alone was not sufficient to induce senescence, it amplified the SASP in senescent human cells. Consistent with these findings, lung p16(INK4a+) senescent cell burden was higher in patients who died from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection than other causes. Our results suggest that induction of cellular senescence and SASP amplification through TLR-3 contribute to SARS-CoV-2 morbidity, indicating that clinical trials of senolytics and/or SASP/TLR-3 inhibitors for alleviating acute and long-term SARS-CoV-2 sequelae are warranted.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 causes senescence in human cells and exacerbates the senescence-associated secretory phenotype through TLR-3"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus pandemic has revealed many scientific, social, and institutional challenges required to improve the health and wellbeing of individuals stricken by this disease.

A diverse sample of mothers (N = 93) was recruited prenatally. In a follow-up visit when the infants were six months of age (N = 82), we examined factors that may be associated with initial infant exposure to screens. First, mothers reported whether they had already exposed their infants to screens. Thereafter, those mothers who reported already having exposed their infants to screens were further queried to determine the extent of infant screen use. Results demonstrated that among infants exposed to screens, mothers reported an average of nearly 3 h of daily screen use. Average parental educational attainment, but not maternal stress, was significantly associated with initial infant exposure. Of those families who endorsed screen exposure by 6 months, 70 % reported a screen in the room where the child sleeps, nearly half reported using screens to help calm the infant, and about a third reported using a screen at least sometimes during meals, when going to sleep, and while waiting.

Using forebrain assembloids derived by integration of cortical and ventral forebrain organoids, we have previously discovered a cortical interneuron migration defect in Timothy syndrome (TS), a severe neurodevelopmental disease caused by a mutation in the L-type calcium channel (LTCC) Cav1.2. Here, we find that acute pharmacological modulation of Cav1.2 can regulate the saltation length, but not the frequency, of interneuron migration in TS. Interestingly, the defect in saltation length is related to aberrant actomyosin and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, while the defect in saltation frequency is driven by enhanced ?3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) sensitivity and can be restored by GABA-A receptor antagonism. Finally, we describe hypersynchronous hCS network activity in TS that is exacerbated by interneuron migration.

Here we present a mathematical theory of co-evolution between immune systems and viruses in a finite-dimensional antigenic space, which describes the cross-reactivity of viral strains and immune systems primed by previous infections. We show the emergence of an antigenic wave that is pushed forward and canalized by cross-reactivity. We obtain analytical results for shape, speed, and angular diffusion of the wave. In particular, we show that viral-immune co-evolution generates a new emergent timescale, the persistence time of the waves direction in antigenic space, which can be much longer than the coalescence time of the viral population. We compare these dynamics to the observed antigenic turnover of influenza strains, and we discuss how the dimensionality of antigenic space impacts on the predictability of the evolutionary dynamics.

For instance, the cerebral cortex is located within the cranial vault;however, it can be difficult to view the relationship between the cerebral cortex and skull via dissection. This project goes into discussing the creation of a 3D stereoscopic model of the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex model was segmented via Amira 5.6 software from computed tomography angiography (CTA) data. Amira 5.6 surface rendering methods were used to create the cerebral cortex, and volume rendering methods were used to create the skull. The segmentations were performed using the axial view and paintbrush tools in Amira 5.6 along with the Wacom pen and tablet. After completing the initial segmentation across 155 slides, the CTA scans were compiled in Amira 5.6 to create the 3D model of the cerebral cortex. A smoothing filter was then applied to the initial surface render of the cerebral cortex to smooth the transition from slide to slide. The cerebral cortex model generated can be viewed from any angle at any magnification level. In addition, the model can also be overlayed orthoslice CTA data to allow the user to have a stronger understanding of the relationship between each individual two-dimensional CTA image and the three-dimensional model. Moreover, the cerebral cortex virtual model can be created into video clips using the Amira 5.6 movie maker, which can be inserted into PowerPoint presentations.

Clinically significant serrated polyps (CSSPs: any sessile serrated polyp (SSP), traditional serrated adenoma (TSA), large (> 1 cm HP) or proximal HP > 5 mm) also lead to PCCRC, but there are no data on associated detection rates (CSSDR). We used data from the New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry (NHCR) to investigate the association between PCCRC risk and endoscopist CSSDR. METHODS We included NHCR patients with one or more follow up events (either a colonoscopy or a colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis identified through linkage with the New Hampshire State Cancer Registry). We defined our outcome, PCCRC, in three time periods: CRC diagnosed 6-36 months, 6-60 months, or all exams (6 months or longer) after an index exam. We excluded patients with CRC diagnosed at or within 6 months of index exam, with incomplete exams, or with IBD. The exposure variable was endoscopist CSSDR at index colonoscopy. Cox regression was used to model the hazard of PCCRC on CSSDR controlling for age, sex, index findings, year of exam, personal history of colorectal neoplasia, and having more than 1 surveillance exam. RESULTS There were 128 patients with CRC diagnosed at least 6 months after index exam. Our cohort included 142 endoscopists (92 gastroenterologists). We observed that the risk for PCCRC 6 months or longer after index was significantly lower for exams performed by endoscopists with CSSDRs of 3 - < 9% (HR=0.57; 95% CI:0.39-0.83) or 9% or higher (HR=0.39; 95% CI:0.20-0.78) relative to those with CSSDR under 3%.

Although some patients have recovered from COVID-19, the sequalae to the SARS-CoV-2 infection may include pulmonary fibrosis, which may contribute to considerable economic burden and health-care challenges. Convalescent Chinese Prescription (CCP) has been widely used during the COVID-19 recovery period for patients who were at high risk of pulmonary fibrosis and is recommended by the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19 (Trial Version sixth, seventh). However, its underlying mechanism is still unclear. Methods: In this study, an integrated pharmacology approach was implemented, which involved evaluation of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of CCP, data mining of the disease targets, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, and analysis, enrichment analysis, and molecular docking simulation, to predict the bioactive components, potential targets, and molecular mechanism of CCP for pulmonary fibrosis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: The active compound of CCP and the candidate targets, including pulmonary fibrosis targets, were obtained through database mining. The Drug-Disease network was constructed. Sixty-five key targets were identified by topological analysis. The findings of Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation suggested that the VEGF, Toll-like 4 receptor, MAPK signaling pathway, and TGF-1 signaling pathways may be involved in pulmonary fibrosis. In the molecular docking analyses, VEGF, TNF-, IL-6, MMP9 exhibited good binding activity. Findings from our study indicated that CCP could inhibit the expression of VEGF, TNF-, IL-6, MMP9, TGF-1 via the VEGF, Toll-like 4 receptor, MAPK, and TGF-1 signaling pathways. Conclusion: Potential mechanisms involved in CCP treatment for COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection involves multiple components and multiple target points as well as multiple pathways. These findings may offer a profile for further investigations of the anti-fibrotic mechanism of CCP. ?

However, there are limited school data accounting for asymptomatic cases, particularly late in the 2020/21 school year, and in the context of uninterrupted in-person schooling and widespread community transmission. Objectives: To determine the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a sample of school staff, compared to the community, and to COVID-19 rates among all students and staff within the same school population. Design: Incident COVID-19 cases among students and school staff using public health data, with an embedded cross-sectional serosurvey among school staff sampled from February 10 to May 15, 2021, comparing to age, sex and geographic location-matched blood donors sampled in January 2021. Setting: Vancouver School District (British Columbia, Canada) from kindergarten to grade 12. Participants: Active school staff enrolled from February 3 to April 23, 2021. Main outcome measures: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a sample of school staff using spike (S)-based testing (unvaccinated staff) or N-based serology testing (vaccinated staff). Results: The incidence of COVID-19 cases among students attending in-person was 9.8 per 1,000 students during the 2020/21 school year (N = 47,280 students), and among staff was 13 per 1,000 since the beginning of the pandemic (N = 7,071 active school staff). In total, 1,689 school staff (64% elementary, 28% secondary, 8.3% school board staff or multiple grades) completed the questionnaire, 78.2% had classroom responsibilities, and spent a median of 17.6 hours in class per week [IQR: 5.0 - 25 hours]. Although 21.5% (363/1,686) reported close contact with a COVID-19 case, only 1.4% (24/1688) of the school staff reported having had a positive viral nucleic acid test. Of this group, five believed they acquired the infection at school. The adjusted seroprevalence in staff who gave blood (1,556/1,689, 92.1%) was 2.3% [95%CI: 1.6 - 3.2%] compared to 2.3% [95%CI: 1.7 - 3.0%] in blood donors. Conclusion and relevance: Despite high reported COVID-19 cases among students and staff, and frequent within-school exposures, we found no detectable increase in seroprevalence among school staff above the community seroprevalence. These findings corroborate claims that, with appropriate mitigation strategies, in-person schooling is not associated with significantly increased risk for school staff.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among Vancouver public school staff in British Columbia, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the time of writing this article, more than 18 million people worldwide have been infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 and about 700,000 people have died from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) In India, about 190,000 people have been infected and nearly 39,000 people have succumbed to this infection Infection among health-care workers has emerged as one of the key problems in facing this pandemic The purpose of this article is to describe the measures taken by the department of oncoradiology at our institution to control the infection and minimize staff exposure during the current lockdown period with reduced patient load and in the post-lockdown period with increased demand for radiology services The key focus of this article is the continued delivery of cancer imaging services with practical precautions and optimized resources We have also discussed algorithms and protocols unique to the practice of oncoradiology in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic ? 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications All rights reserved","output":"Oncoradiology preparedness in the COVID-19 pandemic: Perspective from a tertiary oncology referral center from Eastern India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020, a state of emergency was announced in many countries.

Little is known on its impact on the utilization of emergency department (ED) services, particularly for conditions that might be medically urgent. The objective of this study was to explore trends in the number of outpatient (treat and release) ED visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, retrospective study of outpatient emergency department visits from January 1, 2019 to August 31, 2020 using data from a large, urban, academic hospital system in Utah. Using weekly counts and trend analyses, we explored changes in overall ED visits, by patients' area of residence, by medical urgency, and by specific medical conditions. RESULTS: While outpatient ED visits were higher (+6.0%) in the first trimester of 2020 relative to the same period in 2019, the overall volume between January and August of 2020 was lower (-8.1%) than in 2019. The largest decrease occurred in April 2020 (-30.4%), followed by the May to August period (-12.8%). The largest declines were observed for visits by out-of-state residents, visits classified as non-emergent, primary care treatable or preventable, and for patients diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes, headaches and migraines, mood and personality disorders, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and abdominal pain. Outpatient ED visits for emergent conditions, such as palpitations and tachycardia, open wounds, syncope and collapse remained relatively unchanged, while lower respiratory disease-related visits were 67.5% higher in 2020 relative to 2019, particularly from March to April 2020. However, almost all types of outpatient ED visits bounced back after May 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Overall outpatient ED visits declined from mid-March to August 2020, particularly for non-medically urgent conditions which can be treated in other more appropriate care settings. Our findings also have implications for insurers, policymakers, and other stakeholders seeking to assist patients in choosing more appropriate setting for their care during and after the pandemic.","output":"Trends in outpatient emergency department visits during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large, urban, academic hospital system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the efforts to dampen the COVID-19 pandemic, governments are compelled to outweigh disease control efforts to the possible negative consequences of closing large parts of society.

We performed a chart review to document the infant weight, length, head circumference, survival, congenital abnormalities, and hearing loss, maternal complications, and placental pathology classified by the Amsterdam criteria. Results: The average infant weight, length, and head circumference were all within the normal range for gestational age, the infants had no identifiable congenital abnormalities, and all infants and mothers survived. Only one infant (0.870%) became infected with SARS-CoV-2. Moderate and severe maternal COVID-19 were associated with increased caesarean section, premature delivery, infant NICU admission, and maternal respiratory failure, and were more likely in Type 1 (p=0.0055) and Type 2 (p=0.0285) diabetic mothers.

We aimed to assess the psychological impact during the COVID-19 outbreak period(OP) and remission period(RP) among medical students. METHODS: We surveyed the medical students in Shantou University Medical College twice-during the OP and the RP, surveying psychological burden of COVID-19 lockdowns and its associated factors. 1069 respondents were recruited in OP and 1511 participants were recruited in RP. We constructed nomograms to predict the risk of psychological burden using risk factors that were screened through univariate analysis of the surveyed data set. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant longitudinal increment in psychological burden from OP to RP, and stress as well as cognition in psychological distress were the most dominant ones. Common impact factors of the depression, anxiety and stress included frequency of outdoor activities, mask-wearing adherence, self-perceived unhealthy status and exposure to COVID-19. In addition, the high frequency of handwashing was a protective factor for depression and anxiety. The C-index was 0.67, 0.74 and 0.72 for depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. CONCLUSION: The psychological impact of COVID-19 was worse during the RP than during the OP. Thus, it's necessary to continue to emphasize the importance of mental health in medical students during the pandemic and our proposed nomograms can be useful tools for screening high-risk groups for psychological burden risk in medical students.","output":"A longitudinal study on psychological burden of medical students during COVID-19 outbreak and remission period in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is rapidly spreading across the globe.

This systematic review was updated by rescanning databases on December 20, 2021 and a total of 611 studies were attained. Results 17 studies which met the study inclusion criteria, which were conducted mostly through online survey method in different study designs and which included a total of 24,889 healthcare professionals were examined. The incidence of PPE-related pressure ulcers was found to be between 30% and 92.8%. Grade I pressure ulcers were the most common (44.1%C82%). The incidence of skin problems except PPE-related pressure ulcers such as itching, redness and dry skin was found to be between 42.888.1%. Risk factors that frequently played a role in the development of PPE-related pressure ulcers and other skin problems were longer use of PPE and sweating. PPE-related pressure ulcers and other skin problems were more frequent over the nose (nasal bone/nasal bridge), ears, forehead and cheeks. PPE-related itching, redness and dry skin mostly occurred.

Results We report strong upregulation of the innate immune response, especially type I interferon pathway, upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Upregulated genes were subjected to a comparative meta-analysis using global datasets to identify a common network of interferon stimulated and viral response genes that mediate the host response and resolution of infection. A large proportion of mis-regulated genes showed a reduction in expression level, suggesting an overall decrease in host mRNA production. Significantly downregulated genes included those encoding olfactory, taste and neuro-sensory receptors. Many pro-inflammatory markers and cytokines were also downregulated or remained unchanged in the COVID-19 patients. Finally, a large number of non-coding RNAs were identified as down-regulated, with a few of the lncRNAs associated with functional roles in directing the response to viral infection.

Understanding the relationship between the propofol effect-site concentration (Ce) and patient sedation level could help clinicians achieve the desired sedation level with minimal side effects. We aimed to model the relationship between the propofol Ce and adequate and deep sedation and also incorporate covariates. Thirty patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery received spinal anaesthesia with 0.5% bupivacaine. Propofol was administered via an effect-site target-controlled infusion device using the Schnider pharmacokinetic model. The pharmacodynamic models for both adequate sedation [Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scores of 3-4] and deep sedation (OAA/S scores of 1-2) were developed using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. Increments in the propofol Ce were associated with increased depths of sedation. In the basic model, the estimated population Ce50 values for adequate and deep sedation were 0.94 and 1.52 g/ml, respectively. The inclusion of the patient's age and sensory block level for adequate sedation and of age for deep sedation as covariates significantly improved the basic model by decreasing the objective function's minimum value from 10696.72 to 10677.92 (p = 0.0003). The simulated Ce50 values for adequate sedation in 20-year-old patients with a T12 sensory level and in 80-year-old patients with a T4 level were 1.63 and 0.53 g/ml, respectively. Both age and sensory block level should be considered for adequate sedation, and the propofol concentration should be reduced for elderly patients with a high spinal block to avoid unnecessarily deep levels of sedation.","output":"Modelling of the Sedative Effects of Propofol in Patients undergoing Spinal Anaesthesia: A Pharmacodynamic Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND A high-volume low-pressure endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff forms folds along its contact with the trachea, allowing mucus leakage into the lungs.

In light of this ongoing global issue, different health and safety measure has been recommended by the WHO to ensure the proactive, comprehensive, and coordinated steps to bring back the whole world into a normal situation. This is an infectious disease and can be modeled as a system of non-linear differential equations with reaction rates which consider the rapid-test as the intervention program. Therefore, we have developed the biologically feasible region, i.e., positively invariant for the model and boundedness solution of the system. Our system becomes well-posed mathematically and epidemiologically for sensitive analysis and our analytical result shows an occurrence of a forward bifurcation when the basic reproduction number is equal to unity. Further, the local sensitivities for each model state concerning the model parameters are computed using three different techniques: non-normalizations, half-normalizations, and full normalizations. The numerical approximations have been measured by using System Biology Toolbox (SBedit) with MATLAB, and the model is analyzed graphically. Our result on the sensitivity analysis shows a potential of rapid-test for the eradication program of COVID-19. Therefore, we continue our result by reconstructing our model as an optimal control problem.

OBJECTIVES To analyze the impact of corticosteroid therapy on outcomes of patients having ARDS associated with influenza A/H1N1 pneumonia. METHODS Patients from the French registry of critically ill patients with influenza A/H1N1v 2009 infection were selected if fulfilling criteria for ARDS, excluding patients having other indication for corticosteroids, or decompensated underlying disease as the primary cause for intensive care unit admission. Survival to hospital discharge was analyzed using Cox regression, accounting for the time to administration of steroids, and after adjustment on the propensity for receiving steroid therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of 208 patients with ARDS, 83 (39.9%) received corticosteroids (median initial dose of 270 mg equivalent hydrocortisone per day for a median of 11 d). Steroid therapy was associated with death, both in crude analysis (33.7 vs. 16.8%; hazard ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.3; P = 0.004) and after propensity score-adjusted analysis (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.5-5.4; P = 0.002), controlling for an admission severity Simplified Acute Physiology Score, version 3, greater than 50, initial administration of vasopressors, and immunodepression. Early therapy ( 3 d of mechanical ventilation) appeared more strongly associated with mortality than late administration. Patients receiving steroids had more acquired pneumonia and a trend to a longer duration of ventilation.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of IPC in primary care settings. Methods An overview (review of systematic reviews) was carried out. We searched nine databases and employed a double selection and data extraction method. Patient-related outcomes were categorized, and results coded as improvement (+), worsening (-), mixed results (?) or no change (0). Results 34 reviews were included. Six types of IPC were identified: IPC in primary care (large scope) (n = 8), physician-nurse in primary care (n = 1), primary care physician (PCP)-specialty care provider (n = 5), PCP-pharmacist (n = 3), PCP-mental healthcare provider (n = 15), and intersectoral collaboration (n = 2). In general, IPC in primary care was beneficial for patients with variation between types of IPC. Whereas reviews about IPC in primary care (large scope) showed better processes of care and higher patient satisfaction, other types of IPC reported mixed results for clinical outcomes, healthcare use and patient-reported outcomes. Also, reviews focusing on interventions based on pre-existing and well-defined models, such as collaborative care, overall reported more benefits. However, heterogeneity between the included primary studies hindered comparison and often led to the report of mixed results. Finally, professional- and organizational-related outcomes were under-reported, and cost-related outcomes showed some promising results for IPC based on pre-existing models; results were lacking for other types.

Emerging spike gene variants jeopardize global efforts to produce immunity and reduce morbidity and mortality. These challenges require effective real-time genomic surveillance solutions that the medical community can quickly adopt. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host receptor recognition and entry into the cell and is susceptible to generation of variants with increased transmissibility and pathogenicity. The spike protein is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 patients and the most common antigen for induction of effective vaccine immunity. Tight monitoring of spike protein gene variants is key to mitigating COVID-19 spread and generation of vaccine escape mutants. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 sequencing methods are labor intensive and expensive. When sequence demands are high sequencing resources are quickly exhausted. Consequently, most SARS-CoV-2 strains are sequenced in only a few developed countries and rarely in developing regions. This poses the risk that undetected, dangerous variants will emerge. In this work, we present HiSpike, a method for high-throughput cost effective targeted next generation sequencing of the spike gene. This simple three-step method can be completed in < 30 h, can sequence 10-fold more samples compared to conventional methods and at a fraction of their cost. HiSpike has been validated in Israel, and has identified multiple spike variants from real-time field samples including Alpha, Beta, Delta and the emerging Omicron variants.

Univariate analysis was done using Chi-square test, unpaired t-test, and ANOVA, while multivariate analysis was conducted using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: 57.5% of the interns reported psychological distress, with 39.8% having moderate-to-severe distress. Past consultation with a mental health professional (odds ratio [OR]: 2.15; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.42C3.26) and perceived lack of support from friends (OR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.33C3.99) and faculty (OR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.41C3.28) were the most significant predictors of distress. Fear of COVID-19 was higher in interns who were female, were medically ill, were dissatisfied with the pandemic preparedness at the hospital, and perceived the faculty to be less approachable and supportive.

METHODS: We synthesized information on 13 nutrition-related components and their potential interactions with COVID-19: overweight, obesity, and diabetes; protein-energy malnutrition; anemia; vitamins A, C, D, and E; PUFAs; iron; selenium; zinc; antioxidants; and nutritional support. For each section we provide: 1) a landscape review of pertinent material; 2) a systematic search of the literature in PubMed and EMBASE databases, including a wide range of preprint servers; and 3) a screen of 6 clinical trial registries. All original research was considered, without restriction to study design, and included if it covered: 1) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), or SARS-CoV viruses and 2) disease susceptibility or 3) disease progression, and 4) the nutritional component of interest.

Despite this, some nurses and midwives have been found to take an anti-vaccination stance and promulgate misinformation about vaccines, often using Facebook as a platform to do so. RESEARCH QUESTION This article reports on one component and dataset from a larger study - 'the positives, perils and pitfalls of Facebook for nurses'. It explores the specific issue of nurses and midwives who take an anti-vaccination stance, deemed to be unprofessional by crossing professional boundaries and by providing medical information on Facebook that is not within their scope of practice. PARTICIPANTS Data were collected via an online worldwide survey from nurse and midwife participants, distributed and 'snowballed' through relevant nursing and midwifery groups on Facebook. In total, 1644 Registered Nurses and Midwives, and Enrolled Nurses worldwide attempted the online survey. There were 1100 (66.9%) completed surveys and 54 partially (33.1%) completed surveys. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted online using Skype? with 17 participants in Australia. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Ethical processes and procedures have been adhered to relating to privacy, confidentiality and anonymity of the participants. FINDINGS/RESULTS A mixed-methods approach was used, including descriptive and content analysis of the quantitative survey data and thematic analysis of the qualitative interview data. The main theme 'blurred boundaries' was generated, which comprised three sub-themes: 'follow the science, 'abuse of power and erosion of trust' and 'the moral and ethical responsibility to safeguard public health'. The results offer an important and unique understanding of how nurses and midwives interpret the conduct of fellow health professionals as unprofessional and crossing the professional boundary if they used Facebook to promulgate anti-vaccination messages and/or give medical advice online. CONCLUSION There are many positives and negatives for nurses and midwives associated with using Facebook for personal and professional communication, which is in keeping with the results of the larger study from which this article is taken. Professional behaviour is a key theme in the larger research as is the ethical construct of 'every act has a consequence'; however, in this article, the theme 'blurred boundaries' offers an overall understanding of how nurses and midwives interpret the behaviour of their colleagues who espouse anti-vaccination sentiment and/or give medical advice online that is outside their scope of practice and education.","output":"'Blurred boundaries': When nurses and midwives give anti-vaccination advice on Facebook."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although many deem intermittent fasting (IF) a healthy dietary regimen, there is a paucity of scientific evidence to corroborate IF health benefits in human studies However, its comparative ease and the emphasized benefits in the light of COVID-19 (e g , weight loss and immunization improvement) have led to the increase of IF adoption A vast number of intermittent fasters have not sought consultation from health professionals, which can bring adverse health effects Most intermittent fasters use mobile apps to get assistance for IF Types of assistance offered by the IF mobile applications may range from tracking (e g , fasting periods, calorie intake) to obtaining knowledge about IF However, it is unclear how much people are using the features for learning more about IF which is crucial to making healthier decisions in the IF adoption process Thus, we organized our study into two stages for establishing design implications that further encourage a safety-conscious and user-friendly IF experience We first investigated how IF app users who have chosen apps that provide extensive IF-specific knowledge acquire the said knowledge via (i) topic modeling of user app reviews, (ii) detecting modularity in co-word maps drawn from reviews specific to IF information acquisition, (iii) locating the position of keywords indicating information acquisition in the reviews Then, we examined how users judge the effectiveness of knowledge provision interfaces in obtaining information We investigated this aspect with an interface ranking user task for information tabs and organized user rationale using manual coding and co-word mapping ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"Appealing to the Gut Feeling: How Intermittent Fasters Choose Information Tab Interfaces for Information Acquisition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many of the cellular mechanisms underlying host responses to pathogens have been well conserved during evolution.

In common with other centres, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (London) offered modified telephone consultations to new and follow-up patients in the low vision clinic. Here we assess the success of this telephone service. METHODS: Data were collected for 500 consecutive telephone low vision appointments. Successful completion of the assessment and clinical outcomes (low vision aids prescribed, onward referral) were recorded. RESULTS: Telephone assessments were completed for 364 people (72.8%). The most common reasons for non-completion were either no answer to the telephone call (75 people, 15%), or the patient declining assessment (20 people, 4%). There was no association between age and the likelihood of an assessment being completed. 131 new low vision aids were dispensed, 77 internal referrals were made and 15 people were referred to outside services. More than 80% of the low vision aids prescribed were useful. CONCLUSIONS: Telephone low vision assessments were completed in about three-quarters of cases. About one-quarter of consultations resulted in new low vision aids being dispensed, which were generally found useful. Telephone low vision assessments can be used successfully in a large low vision clinic, but have many limitations when compared to face-to-face assessments.","output":"Lockdown low vision assessment: an audit of 500 telephone-based modified low vision consultations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In view of the poor teaching effect of the traditional sports teaching method, this paper designs the sports auxiliary teaching method based on the multimedia network.

It reached to peak within 15C21 days and then began a slowly decline. The positive rates of IgG were increased with the disease course and reached the peak between 22 and 39 days. The differences in sensitivity of the three detection modes (IgM, IgG, and IgM + IgG) were statistically significant. The largest group of test cases (illness onset 15C21 days) showed that the positive rate of IgG was higher than IgM. Also, the sensitivity of IgM combined with IgG was higher than IgM or IgG.

We used population genetics analyses on human SARS-CoV-2 genomes available on 2 April 2020 to infer the mutation rate and plausible recombination events between the Betacoronavirus genomes in nonhuman hosts that may have contributed to the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we localized the targets of recent and strong, positive selection during the first pandemic wave. The genomic regions that appear to be under positive selection are largely co-localized with regions in which recombination from nonhuman hosts took place. Our results suggest that the pangolin coronavirus genome may have contributed to the SARS-CoV-2 genome by recombination with the bat coronavirus genome. However, we find evidence for additional recombination events that involve coronavirus genomes from other hosts, i.e., hedgehogs and sparrows. We further infer that recombination may have recently occurred within human hosts. Finally, we estimate the parameters of a demographic scenario involving an exponential growth of the size of the SARS-CoV-2 populations that have infected European, Asian, and Northern American cohorts, and we demonstrate that a rapid exponential growth in population size from the first wave can support the observed polymorphism patterns in SARS-CoV-2 genomes.","output":"Population Genomics Insights into the First Wave of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blockage of air circulation caused by the mutual sheltering effect of high-rise buildings in built-up areas in dense cities causes various health- and comfort-related problems.

This study also examines the influence of stagnant zones and wake regions on ventilation potential and wind comfort around the case study arrangements at various wind incident directions. An investigation was performed from 16 wind directions using the standard kC turbulence model with revised closure coefficients. A wind tunnel experiment was conducted to validate the results, which revealed that wind circulation at re-entrant corners was substantially affected by the building orientations and separation. The wind catchment effect within the re-entrant corners and the sheltering effect of buildings at various wind incident directions and building separations are also discussed.

Abstract There is debate as to whether olfactory dysfunction should be considered a symptom of COVID-19 infection, given the implications for managing the symptom itself, for diagnostic testing, and for implementing isolation measures. We undertook a systematic literature review of the articles indexed in PubMed on olfactory disorders in viral respiratory tract conditions, with special emphasis on COVID-19. The main objective was to find evidence of clinical interest to support the relationship between anosmia and COVID-19. Olfactory disorders in upper respiratory tract infections are frequent, most caused by obstruction due to oedema of the nasal mucosa. Occasionally, post-viral sensorineural olfactory dysfunction occurs, with a variable prognosis. The evidence on anosmia in COVID-19 patients is extremely limited, corresponding to a level 5 or D of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. According to the various medical societies that have issued reports on the subject, it seems reasonable to apply isolation, hygiene and social distancing measures in patients with recent olfactory disorders as the only symptom, although the usefulness of diagnostic tests for this type of patient should be studied.","output":"Alteraciones Del Olfato En El Covid-19, Revisin De La Evidencia E Implicaciones En El Manejo De La Pandemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a suite of circumstances that will simultaneously affect mental health and mobilize coping strategies in response.

People vulnerable to the influence of stress tend to change the quantity and quality of their food intake. Variables such as sex and body mass index (BMI) seem to be related to this stress-eating behavior, but it is rather unclear what factors account to the parameters associated with stress-eating behavior. The aim of this survey was to identify further characteristics of adults in Germany related to stress-overeating, focusing on stress perception, coping, eating motives and comfort foods as well as personality types. METHODS This online survey was performed throughout Germany and comprised a 38-item pre-tested questionnaire. Stress-induced overeating was classified based on the Salzburg Stress Eating Scale (SSES). Moreover, validated questionnaires were used to identify additional characteristics of stress eaters. Participants were recruited using a convenience sampling approach, and data were collected between January and April 2021. RESULTS The overall sample consisted of 1222 participants (female 80.8%, aged 31.512.8). 42.1% of participants were identified as stress-overeaters. Among the remaining group, 78.9% stated to eat less, 21.1% to eat equally when stressed. Female participants had a higher mean SSES score compared to male participants. The BMI was positively correlated to SSES, r(1220)=0.28, p>0.005. 'Agreeableness' (BigFive) was found to be a negative predictor of stress-overeating.

METHODS: The responses of 840 Hungarian participants were analysed who took part in a nationwide computer-assisted telephone interviewing. During the survey questions concerning various demographic characteristics, perceived financial status, and willingness to get the two types of vaccines were asked. Descriptive statistics, comparative statistics and word co-occurrence network analysis were conducted. RESULTS: 48.2% of participants were willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine, while this ratio for the seasonal influenza was only 25.7%. The difference was significant. Regardless of how the participants were grouped, based on demographic data or perceived financial status, the significant difference always persisted. Being older than 59 years significantly increased the willingness to get both vaccines when compared to the middle-aged groups, but not when compared to the younger ones. Having higher education significantly elevated the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in comparison to secondary education. The willingness of getting any type of COVID-19 vaccine correlated with the willingness to get both influenza and COVID-19.

Delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to myelin were examined in both symptomatic and asymptomatic mice at different times post-infection, in order to determine whether autoreactivity correlates with the development of demyelination. The results indicate that although autoimmune responses probably do not play a major role in the initiation of demyelination at early times post-infection, autoreactivity to myelin antigens dose eventually develop in symptomatic animals, perhaps through the mechanism of epitope spreading. Autoimmunity to myelin components is therefore an additional factor that may contribute to lesion progression in chronically diseased animals.","output":"Investigation of the role of delayed-type-hypersensitivity responses to myelin in the pathogenesis of Theiler's virus-induced demyelinating disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence from past economic crises indicates that recessions often affect mens and womens employment differently, with a greater impact on male-dominated sectors. The current COVID-19 crisis presents novel characteristics that have affected economic, health and social phenomena over wide swaths of the economy. Social distancing measures to combat the spread of the virus, such as working from home and school closures, have placed an additional tremendous burden on families. Using new survey data collected in April 2020 from a representative sample of Italian women, we analyse the effects of working arrangements due to COVID-19 on housework, childcare and home schooling among couples where both partners work. Our results show that most of the additional housework and childcare associated to COVID-19 falls on women while childcare activities are more equally shared within the couple than housework activities. According to our empirical estimates, changes to the amount of housework done by women during the emergency do not seem to depend on their partners working arrangements. With the exception of those continuing to work at their usual place of work, all of the women surveyed spend more time on housework than before. In contrast, the amount of time men devote to housework does depend on their partners working arrangements: men whose partners continue to work at their usual workplace spend more time on housework than before. The link between time devoted to childcare and working arrangements is more symmetric, with higher percentages of both women and men spending less time with their children if they continue to work away from home. For home schooling, too, parents who continue to go to their usual workplace after the lockdown are less likely to spend greater amounts of time with their children than before. Similar results emerge for the partners of women not working before the emergency. Finally, analysis of workClife balance satisfaction shows that working women with children aged 0C5 are those who find balancing work and family more difficult during COVID-19. The workClife balance is especially difficult to achieve for those with partners who continue to work outside the home during the emergency.","output":"Womens and mens work, housework and childcare, before and during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increasing spread of COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, raises concerns about the extent to which mutations have occurred across the viral genome.

Although different patterns can be maintained by the concerted action of transcription factors (TFs), it was proposed that long-term persistence hinges on chromatin state. Here, we study how the dynamics of chromatin state affect memory, and focus on a biologically motivated circuit motif, among histones and DNA modifications, that mediates the action of TFs on gene expression. Memory arises from time-scale separation among three circuits constituent processes: basal erasure, auto and cross-catalysis, and recruited erasure of modifications. When the two latter processes are sufficiently faster than the former, the circuit exhibits bistability and hysteresis, allowing active and repressed gene states to coexist and persist after TF stimulus removal. The duration of memory is stochastic with a mean value that increases as time-scale separation increases, but more so for the repressed state. This asymmetry stems from the cross-catalysis between repressive histone modifications and DNA methylation and is enhanced by the relatively slower decay rate of the latter. Nevertheless, TF-mediated positive autoregulation can rebalance this asymmetry and even confers robustness of active states to repressive stimuli. More generally, by wiring positively autoregulated chromatin modification circuits under time scale separation, long-term distinct gene expression patterns arise, which are also robust to failure in the regulatory links.","output":"Epigenetic cell memory: The genes inner chromatin modification circuit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Recurrent ptosis may occur after mastopexy procedures over time. The volume distribution mastopexy technique provides breast lifting with projection enhancement and maintains breast suspension. METHOD Since 2010, 50 patients underwent volume distribution mastopexy procedures. The technique consists of a superior or superomedial pedicle, dissection of a Wringer-septum-based chest wall flap, suspension of the flap to the pectoralis major muscle using a prosthetic mesh, gland suture to the mesh, and fat grafting if required. A prospective study was conducted. Nipple position and length of the lower pole distance of the breast were noted. Patient satisfaction and results evaluation were reported using a Likert scale. RESULTS A Vicryl mesh was used in the first 23 patients and a mixed polyester/Vicryl mesh was used in the following 27 patients. Wound dehiscence occurred in one patient. At an average follow-up of 3 years, nipple position remained stable in position, but lower pole distance elongation was observed in five patients (20 percent) and in one patient (3 percent) who had Vicryl mesh and mixed mesh respectively (p < 0.05). Only four breasts (4.7 percent) demonstrated significant lower pole elongation over time (>15 percent), all in the Vicryl mesh group. Worth noting, both the patients and the independent evaluators provided high ratings of the result of 4.7 and 4.6, respectively, on a Likert scale. CONCLUSIONS The volume distribution mastopexy technique repositions the ptotic gland with a mesh to suspend the breast gland and to maintain the lifting effect.

However, these accommodations are seldom individualized to ensure that they actually improve the performance of a specific student. Therefore, a need exists for an evidence-based protocol (henceforth, the Protocol) for selecting individually tailored test accommodations for students with dysgraphia. OBJECTIVE: To establish the Protocol's content validity, interrater reliability, and preliminary outcomes through a pilot study. DESIGN: Descriptive and exploratory design. SETTING: Research laboratory at a large university in central Israel. PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 25 students (mean age = 24.9 yr, standard deviation = 2.1), of whom 88.0% were male. Inclusion criteria included a previous diagnosis of a specific learning disability and handwriting difficulties. Exclusion criteria were a physical condition or medication intake that may have affected students' handwriting or typing ability. RESULTS: The Protocol was found to have face validity and high interrater reliability (&#954; = .80). Its initial use showed that the most suitable accommodations for students with dysgraphia varied and were not always intuitive (e.g., extended time was not always the best accommodation for students with slow handwriting).

Nanomaterials with tunable size, morphology and composition, surface modification, and increased functionality provide considerable opportunities for effective wastewater treatment. Thus, in this work, an attempt has been made to use spinel-structured MnCo2O4 as a nanofiller in the fabrication of nanostructured polysulfone (PSF) mixed matrix membranes and is investigated in terms of morphology, hydrophilicity, permeability, protein and natural organic matter separation, dye removal, and, finally, antifouling properties. The MnCo2O4 nanomaterials are synthesized and characterized via X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy and are loaded into a membrane matrix with varied concentrations (0 to 1.5 wt %). PSF nanocomposite membranes are prepared via a nonsolvent-induced phase-separation process. The results show an enhancement in hydrophilicity, porosity, and permeability with respect to the modified nanocomposite membranes because of oxygen-rich species in the membrane matrix, which increases affinity toward water. It was also found that the modified membranes display remarkably greater pure water flux (PWF) (220 L/m2 h), higher Congo red rejection coefficient (99.86%), higher humic acid removal (99.81%), higher fouling resistance, and a significant flux recovery ratio (FRR) (88%) when tested with bovine serum albumin protein when compared to a bare PSF membrane (30 L/m2 h PWF and 35% FRR). This is because the addition of MnCo2O4 nanoparticles into the polymeric casting solution yielded tighter PSF membranes with a denser skin layer and greater selectivity. Thus, the enhanced permeability, greater rejection coefficient, and antifouling properties show the promising potential of the fabricated PSF-spinel nanostructured membrane to be utilized in membrane technology for wastewater treatment.","output":"Comprehensive Analysis of Spinel-Type Mixed Metal Oxide-Functionalized Polysulfone Membranes toward Fouling Resistance and Dye and Natural Organic Matter Removal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study tests whether economic value added (EVA) as a performance evaluation metric incentivizes public administrators to increase the performance of public organizations.

METHODS: Data from in-depth interviews with a crisis management team (n = 23) and free text answers in a weekly survey to subordinated clinical directors, i.e. unit managers, (n = 108) were scrutinised in a directed content analysis. Dynamic capabilities as a prerequisite for dynamic effectiveness, understood as reaching strategic and operative effectiveness simultaneously, were explored by using three frameworks for dynamic effectiveness, dynamic capabilities and delegated authority in a decentralised organisation. RESULTS: Unpredictable events, such as the pandemic Covid-19 outbreak, demand a high grade of ability to be flexible. We find that a high degree of operational effectiveness, which is imperative in an emergency situation, also is a driver of seeking new strategic positions to even better meet new demands. The characteristics of the dynamic capabilities evolving from this process are described and discussed in relation to decentralisation, defined by decision space, organisational and individual capacity as well as accountability. We present arguments supporting that a decentralised management model can facilitate the agility required in an emergency. CONCLUSIONS: This study is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind where a decentralised management model in a service delivery organisation in healthcare is studied in relation to crisis management. Although stemming from one organisation, our findings indicating the value of decentralisation in situations of crisis are corroborated by theory, suggesting that they could be relevant in other organisational settings also.

The narrowing of cranial vessels may be asymptomatic or produce neurological symptoms. Very often nonspecific signs of ischemia occur, such as headache, vertigo, or dizziness. OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to assess the effect of carotid and vertebral arteries stenosis on the function of the equilibrium organ on the basis of electronystagmography and posturography. MATERIAL The study was conducted in 63 patients, presenting with carotid and vertebral arteries stenosis. The control group consisted of 32 healthy persons. METHODS All patients were subjected to precise audiological and otoneurological diagnostic examinations. Prior to being qualified for the study, patients were subjected to the assessment of arteries by means of Doppler ultrasonography. The vestibular organ was assessed by means of physical examination as well as by electronystagmography and posturography testing. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The study revealed statistically significant reduction in the results of the equilibrium organ assessments in patients with carotid and vertebral arteries sclerosis as compared to the control group. Abnormal ENG records in the study group patients were observed particularly in the pendulum test, optokinetic test, and the assessment of positional nystagmus, possibly indicating disturbances within the central part of the equilibrium system. Disturbed blood flow in arteries had also an important impact on spinovestibular reflexes and resulted in disturbed postural stability control. On the basis of the conducted studies, it is concluded that diagnostic examinations for carotid and vertebral artery stenosis should be performed in patients with equilibrium system disorders.","output":"The assessment of the balance system in cranial artery stenosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Seniors have been only little considered in studies examining problematic internet use and associated health issues, although they may present risk factors that make them particularly vulnerable for the development of problematic internet use. Objectives: (1) To compare Internet use and problematic use among seniors in Switzerland and Poland; (2) To examine the relationships between problematic internet use, impulsivity traits and well-being as previous studies showed that internet can be used to cope with negative emotions or life dissatisfaction. Methods: A cross-sectional survey conducted between June 2016 and April 2017 with 264 older internet users aged above 60 years old recruited in Switzerland (88) and Poland (176) assessing sociodemographic variables, online activities, problematic internet use, impulsivity traits and well-being. Results: The two groups differed in their reported online activities in that Polish participants reported more searching for information and buying, whereas Swiss participants reported significantly greater problematic internet use than Polish participants. Finally, a multiple linear regression analysis performed on the whole sample indicated that lower well-being and being a Swiss participant were both significantly associated with greater problematic internet use, after age, gender, level of education, impulsivity traits have been controlled for. Discussion: Swiss seniors showed a more problematic internet use than Polish participants who focused more in their online activities on utility use of internet. The relationships between problematic internet use and well-being suggest that older adults use internet mainly to cope with negative emotion or life dissatisfaction. Socio-cultural differences that could account for these group differences as well as difference with young adults are discussed.","output":"Internet Use and Problematic Use in Seniors: A Comparative Study in Switzerland and Poland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via the original article.","output":"Correction to: Pakistan Randomized and Observational Trial to Evaluate Coronavirus Treatment (PROTECT) of Hydroxychloroquine, Oseltamivir and Azithromycin to treat newly diagnosed patients with COVID-19 infection: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Double-positive vasculitis with anti-polynuclear cytoplasm (ANCA) and anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies is a rare entity of systemic vasculitis defined by the presence of ANCA and anti-GBM antibodies.

Results: A 52 year-old smoking man with a history of exposure to hydrocarbons and uretheral lithiasis, presented in April 2021 epigastralgia and vomiting. the investigations concluded to H.pylori gastritis and ulcer and he received a quadruple therapy. The kidney function was correct in April 2021. The evolution was marked by the persistence of symptoms and urine output had decreased for a few days. He was found to have renal dysfunction (serum creatinine: 2000 mol/L). Abdominal CT scan without iodinated contrast injection showed severe hydronephrosis of the right pelvicalyceal system with cortical thinning and dilatation of the right ureter. The two kidneys had regular outlines seat multiple bilateral renal cysts with exophytic development. He had a nephrosomy with secondarily a right double-J stent with slight improvement of renal function. The patient presented then with acute respiratory distress.Testing for COVID-19: PCR and serology were negatives. Chest CT scan showed alveolar syndromeevoking pulmonary overload.

The attitude was non-invasive ventilation and broad-spectrum antibiotics therapy. Control chest CT showed emphysematous lung with signs of fibrosis with bilateral subpleural nodules. A rereading of the scanner showed intraalveolar hemorrhage which has regressed on the imaging of the control. Based on these data, pneumo renal syndrome was suspected and a bronchoscopy was performed showing alveolar hemorrhage with 70% siderophageswith Gold score superior to 100. Anti-GBM and p-ANCA and antibodies were positive at a high titer. Electroneuromyogram was without anomaly. Kidney biopsy was not done because of the presence of multiple cysts.

Here, we characterized this process relative to (1) specific 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA cleavage sites and (2) identity of specific upstream signaling elements in this pathway. Capillary electrophoresis indicated that DON at concentrations as low as 200 ng/ml evoked selective rRNA cleavage after 6 h and that 1000 ng/ml caused cleavage within 2 h. Northern blot analysis revealed that DON exposure induced six rRNA cleavage fragments from 28S rRNA and five fragments from 18S rRNA. When selective kinase inhibitors were used to identify potential upstream signals, RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck), and p38 were found to be required for rRNA cleavage, whereas c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase were not. Furthermore, rRNA fragmentation was suppressed by the p53 inhibitors pifithrin- and pifithrin- as well as the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. Concurrent apoptosis was confirmed by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining and flow cytometry. DON activated caspases 3, 8, and 9, thus suggesting the possible coinvolvement of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in rRNA cleavage. Satratoxin G (SG), anisomycin, and ricin also induced specific rRNA cleavage profiles identical to those of DON, suggesting that ribotoxins might share a conserved rRNA cleavage mechanism. Taken together, DON-induced rRNA cleavage is likely to be closely linked to apoptosis activation and appears to involve the sequential activation of PKR/Hck p38p53caspase 8/9caspase 3.","output":"Targets and Intracellular Signaling Mechanisms for Deoxynivalenol-Induced Ribosomal RNA Cleavage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, the World Health Organization announced the new COVID-19 pandemic, which represented a challenge for health services and professionals.

Substantial gains have been made in the region, but the threat to health worldwide posed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic includes not only the direct effects of the pandemic but also the potential eclipsing of the global tuberculosis emergency. The results of modelling studies present stark warnings of a reversal of years of progress and a significant resurgence in deaths from tuberculosis. The COVID-19 pandemic has had variable impacts in the WHO South-East Asia Region to date, but in the countries most affected there has been targeted diversion and repurposing of tuberculosis services, health-care workers and diagnostic equipment. The combined effects of COVID-19, containment measures and fragmentation of tuberculosis services have resulted in delays in diagnosis or non-diagnosis and disruption in treatment resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, transmission and drug resistance. Countries of the region have made attempts to ensure continuity of services and civil society and nongovernmental organizations have instituted a range of innovative mechanisms to support national programmes. However, a comprehensive approach - including scaling up successful initiatives, empowering community leadership, harnessing digital tools, and implementing easily accessible cash transfers and nutrition support - will be critical to success.

Concomitantly, COVID-19 patients exhibit a state of hypercoagulability that can affect circuit lifespan. An optimal anticoagulation strategy is therefore needed in order to maintain circuit patency and therapeutic efficiency of RRT. Methods Retrospective single-centre cohort study on 71 critically ill COVID-19 patients at the University of Freiburg Medical Center. Included were all patients aged 18 years and older with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that were admitted to ICU between February 26 and May 21, 2020. We collected data on the COVID-19 disease course, AKI, RRT, thromboembolic events and anticoagulation. Primary outcome of the study was the effect of different anticoagulation strategies during RRT on extracorporeal circuit lifespans. Results Anticoagulation during continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD) was performed with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or citrate. Mean treatment time in the UFH group was 21.3h (SEM: {+/-}5.6h). Mean treatment time in the citrate group was 45.6h (SEM: {+/-}2.7h). Citrate anticoagulation prolonged treatment duration significantly by 24.4h (p=0.0014). Anticoagulation during sustained low-efficiency daily dialysis (SLEDD) was performed with UFH, argatroban or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Mean dialysis time with UFH was 8.1h (SEM: {+/-}1.3h), argatroban 8.0h (SEM: {+/-}0.9h) and LMWH 11.8h (SEM: {+/-}0.5h).

Conclusions UFH fails to prevent early clotting events in dialysis circuits. For patients, who do not require an effective systemic anticoagulation, regional citrate dialysis is the most effective strategy in our cohort.

Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression, using the propensity index as a covariant. RESULTS: Of the 259 patients enrolled in the study, 67 (25.9%) had an unfavorable evolution, dying or requiring ICU admission. Comparative analyzes between different glucocorticoids treatments and the association with ICU admission or death were: glucocorticoids treatment (any dose) versus no glucocorticoids treatment (OR: 0.71 [0.30-1.66]), treatment with glucocorticoids (&#8805;250mg prednisone daily) versus no glucocorticoids treatment (OR: 0.35 [0.11-1.08]) and glucocorticoids treatment (&#8805;250mg prednisone daily) versus patients with glucocorticoids doses <250mg prednisone daily or without glucocorticoids treatment (OR: 0.30 [0.10-0.88]).

Remote triage and consultations became the default, with adapted models for face-to-face contact if clinically required. This study aimed to gain insight into public perception of these adaptations. Methods: Two online surveys were developed, and conducted in August and September 2020. Survey A, open to adults (>18 years) receiving the link to it, considered respondents perspectives on healthcare contacts since March 2020, and their understanding of the adapted delivery. Survey B, open to survey A respondents only, then considered how healthcare communication had been received and individual preferences for this. Survey participation was voluntary. Results: The perceptions of 150 members of the public were obtained. 105 had considered contacting general practice, although half avoided this or delayed doing so for longer than usual. While some patients did so to help the NHS, others experienced reduced access for reasons including concerns about telephone consultations and about COVID-19 safety. Some however reported benefitting from remote consultation availability and regular texts/emails from their practice. 68% (102/150) of respondents were unaware that patients with COVID-19 were seen separately from other patients during general practice appointments. 27% in survey B who had avoided or delayed contact said they would have felt more comfortable contacting general practice had they known this. Conclusions: Experience and use of the adapted general practice models varied. Some patients felt their access to healthcare was reduced, often due to technological requirements.

Previous literature indicates that increasing social participation may be an effective way to address this exclusion, but no systematic review of interventions designed to increase social participation of people with intellectual disabilities have been conducted. This study aims to identify and organize the factors associated with interventions that increase the social participation of people with intellectual disabilities and to provide a set of best of practices for future interventions. METHODS/DESIGN The databases Web of Science, Scopus, LILACS, and PubMed will be searched for articles from January 2004 onwards; grey literature search will be identified through searching additional databases (such as Google Scholar and EBSCO databases). Randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, and controlled pre-post studies will be included. Noncontrolled pre-post studies will also be included. Observational or qualitative studies will be excluded. The primary outcomes are measures of social participation. Secondary outcomes include measures of well-being, stigma, knowledge about rights, and advocacy processes. Two reviewers will independently screen articles, extract relevant data, and assess the quality of the studies. We will provide a meta-analysis of included studies if possible, or a quantitative narrative synthesis otherwise.

The Thoracic Domain of the Asian Society for Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery reports a consensus statement on the provision of thoracic cancer surgery during this pandemic. METHODS A Thoracic Experts Panel was convened by the Society. A consensus on the provision, safety, and setting of thoracic cancer surgery during the pandemic was obtained through a Delphi process. RESULTS Responses were received from 26 panel members (96% response rate) from 10 regions across Asia. The Society recommended that elective thoracic cancer surgery services may need to be reduced or postponed if medical resources were needed for COVID-19 patients, especially intensive care unit beds and ventilators. However, thoracic cancer surgery should proceed as normal for all solid tumors, without restrictions based on disease stage, availability of non-surgical treatment options, or patient condition (unless there is a high likelihood of postoperative intensive care unit stay). Aerosol-forming procedures should be avoided intra- and perioperatively. The surgical approach does not make a difference in terms of safety. Services for thoracic cancer patients should be offered only in hospitals that maintain isolation wards for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Services for patients with thoracic cancer should be maintained during the COVID-19 pandemic. The position of the Society is that thoracic surgeons have a responsibility to perform good surgical management of thoracic cancer during the pandemic, to advocate for patients' rights to receive it, and to safeguard patients and staff from infection.","output":"Thoracic cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: A consensus statement from the Thoracic Domain of the Asian Society for Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Shelter in place orders in the COVID 19 pandemic necessitate changes in how medical care is delivered.

Critically, we show that using different definitions alters the projected effects of key parameters-such as inter-regional travel rates, degree of pre-existing immunity, and heterogeneity in transmission rates between regions-on the risk of a pandemic. Our analysis provides a foundation for understanding the scientific importance of precise language when discussing pandemic risk, illustrating how alternative definitions affect the conclusions of modelling studies.

High Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in COVID-19 patients suggest that a cytokine storm may play a major role in the pathophysiology and are considered as a relevant parameter in predicting most severe course of disease. The aim of this study was to assess repeated IL-6 levels in critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and to evaluate their relationship with patient's severity and outcome. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on patients admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 10 (i.e. the date of the first admitted patients) and April 30, 2020. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected at admission. On the day of IL-6 blood concentration measurement, we also collected results of D-Dimers, C-Reactive Protein, white blood cells and lymphocytes count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin as well as microbiological samples, whenever present. RESULTS: Of a total of 65 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our ICU we included 41 patients with repeated measure of IL-6. There was a significant difference in IL-6 levels between survivors and non-survivors over time (p = 0.001); moreover, non survivors had a significantly higher IL-6 maximal value when compared to survivors (720 [349-2116] vs. 336 [195-646] pg/mL, p = 0.01). The IL-6 maximal value had a significant predictive value of ICU mortality (AUROC 0.73 [95% CI 0.57-0.89]; p = 0.01).

Methods: This cross-sectional study surveyed 123 community-dwelling older adults living in the southern United States in 2015C2016. All participants were 65 years or older. Data were collected using the Patient Action Inventory for Self-Care and analyzed using descriptive, univariate, and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results: The social determinants (identified as barriers) of self-care behaviors related to making good treatment decisions and participating in treatment were: having less than a high school education, being 75 years or older, and being separated from a spouse. Sex and residence were found to be neither barriers nor facilitators. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that, in older adults, attending to the needs related to health literacy education and improving social support might increase self-care behaviors related to making good treatment decisions and participating in treatment.

We assessed the change in survival to hospital discharge over time for intensive care unit patients with COVID-19 during the first 3 months of the pandemic and the presence of any surge effects on patient outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using electronic medical record data for all patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units from February 25, 2020, to May 15, 2020, at one of 26 hospitals within an integrated delivery system in the Western USA. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and severity of illness were measured along with medical therapies and hospital outcomes over time. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to assess temporal changes in survival to hospital discharge during the study period. RESULTS: Of 620 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU [mean age 63.5 years (SD 15.7) and 69% male], 403 (65%) survived to hospital discharge and 217 (35%) died in the hospital. Survival to hospital discharge increased over time, from 60.0% in the first 2 weeks of the study period to 67.6% in the last 2 weeks. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, the risk-adjusted odds of survival to hospital discharge increased over time (biweekly change, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.22, 95% CI 1.04C1.40, P = 0.02). Additionally, an a priori-defined explanatory model showed that after adjusting for both hospital occupancy and percent hospital capacity by COVID-19-positive individuals and persons under investigation (PUI), the temporal trend in risk-adjusted patient survival to hospital discharge remained the same (biweekly change, aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00C1.38, P = 0.04). The presence of greater rates of COVID-19 positive/PUI as a percentage of hospital capacity was, however, significantly and inversely associated with survival to hospital discharge (aOR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92C0.98, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: During the early COVID-19 pandemic, risk-adjusted survival to hospital discharge increased over time for critical care patients.

The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 in the ASEAN Federation of Endocrine Societies (AFES) member countries; to describe challenges, changes and opportunities in caring for patients with endocrine diseases, as well as in fellowship training programs, and endocrinerelated research in the AFES countries. METHODOLOGY: The AFES ASEAN Survey Of Needs in Endocrinology (AFES A.S.-O.N.E.) was an open-ended questionnaire that was sent to the presidents and representatives of the AFES member countries by email. Responses from Societies were collated and synthesized to obtain perspectives on the emergent issues in endocrinology in the Southeast Asian region during this pandemic. RESULTS: The burden of COVID-19 cases varied widely across the AFES member countries, with the least number of cases in Vietnam and Myanmar, and the greatest number of cases in either the most populous countries (Indonesia and the Philippines), or a country with the highest capability for testing (Singapore). The case fatality rate was also the highest for Indonesia and the Philippines at around 6%, and lowest for Vietnam at no fatalities. The percentage with diabetes among patients with COVID-19 ranged from 5% in Indonesia to 20% in Singapore, approximating the reported percentages in China and the United States. The major challenges in managing patients with endocrine diseases involved inaccessibility of health care providers, clinics and hospitals due to the implementation of lockdowns, community quarantines or movement control among the member countries. This led to disruptions in the continuity of care, testing and monitoring, and for some, provision of both preventive care and active management including surgery for thyroid cancer or pituitary and adrenal tumors, and radioactive iodine therapy. Major disruptions in the endocrine fellowship training programs were also noted across the region, so that some countries have had to freeze hiring of new trainees or to revise both program requirements and approaches to training due to the closure of outpatient endocrine clinics. The same observations are seen for endocrine-related researches, as most research papers have focused on the pandemic. Finally, the report ends by describing innovative approaches to fill in the gap in training and in improving patient access to endocrine services by Telemedicine. CONCLUSION: The burden of COVID-19 cases and its case fatality rate varies across the AFES member countries but its impact is almost uniform: it has disrupted the provision of care for patients with endocrine diseases, and has also disrupted endocrine fellowship training and endocrine-related research across the region. Telemedicine and innovations in training have been operationalized across the AFES countries in an attempt to cope with the disruptions from COVID-19, but its over-all impact on the practice of endocrinology across the region will only become apparent once we conquer this pandemic.","output":"AFES A.S.-O.N.E.: ASEAN Survey Of Needs in Endocrinology in the Time of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A survey experiment exposes treatment groups to four messages supporting future vaccination against COVID-19.

The occlusal factors and the occurrence of TMD are weakly related, but there are some common malocclusions such as occlusal interference on non-working side, excessive sliding between maximum intercuspid position (MIP) and retruded contact position (RCP), unstable MIP and so on, may be risk factors that promote the disease.

In this study, we set out to assess the clinical features and outcomes of patients with current psychiatric disorders exposed to COVID-19. METHODS: This multi-center prospective study was conducted in 22 psychiatric wards dedicated to COVID-19 inpatients between 28 February and 30 May 2020. The main outcomes were the number of patients transferred to somatic care units, the number of deaths, and the number of patients developing a confusional state. The risk factors of confusional state and transfer to somatic care units were assessed by a multivariate logistic model. The risk of death was analyzed by a univariate analysis. RESULTS: In total, 350 patients were included in the study. Overall, 24 (7%) were transferred to medicine units, 7 (2%) died, and 51 (15%) patients presented a confusional state. Severe respiratory symptoms predicted the transfer to a medicine unit [odds ratio (OR) 17.1; confidence interval (CI) 4.9C59.3]. Older age, an organic mental disorder, a confusional state, and severe respiratory symptoms predicted mortality in univariate analysis. Age >55 (OR 4.9; CI 2.1C11.4), an affective disorder (OR 4.1; CI 1.6C10.9), and severe respiratory symptoms (OR 4.6; CI 2.2C9.7) predicted a higher risk, whereas smoking (OR 0.3; CI 0.1C0.9) predicted a lower risk of a confusional state.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary academic center. A national survey of members of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery was administered. Descriptive analyses were performed to determine how telehealth was employed in otolaryngologists' practices. Results: A total of 184 surveys were completed. Telehealth technology was used by 50% of otolaryngologists surveyed. Regions with the largest percentage of physicians using telehealth were the Mid-Atlantic region (84%) and West Coast (67%). Most otolaryngologists indicated that they were familiar with telehealth or any of its components and how it is used in practice (52-83%), they had heard of telehealth or any of its components but were unsure what the terms specifically entailed (17-42%); 53% were satisfied with their current use of telehealth and electronic medical record (EMR); and 72% were comfortable utilizing smart devices for patient care. Most otolaryngologists (65%) indicated reimbursement as the biggest limitation to implementing telehealth, and 67% believed that typing was a hindrance to EMR utility. Conclusion: Half of the surveyed otolaryngologists used some form of telehealth at the time of the survey. The most commonly cited obstacle to physician adoption of telehealth was reimbursement.

Due to the comparatively short evolutionary period of their appearance in nature, sufficiently effective enzymes for their biodegradation are not available. Plastics are designed for use in conditions typical for human activity, and their physicochemical properties roughly change at extreme environmental parameters like low temperatures, salt, or low or high pH that are typical for the life of extremophilic microorganisms and the activity of their enzymes. This review represents a first attempt to summarize the extraordinarily limited information on biodegradation of conventional synthetic plastics by thermophilic, alkaliphilic, halophilic, and psychrophilic bacteria in natural environments and laboratory conditions. Most of the available data was reported in the last several years and concerns moderate extremophiles.

Methods: : From February 26 to April 20, 2020, D-dimer level at admission and outcomes of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in medical wards (in-hospital mortality or VTE) were retrospectively analyzed in a multicenter study in 24 French hospitals. Results: : Among 2878 patients enrolled in the study, 1154 (40.9%) patients had D-dimer measurement at admission.

High levels of extracellular HMGB1 play a critical role in impairing the clearance of invading pulmonary pathogens and dying neutrophils in the injured lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A heparin derivative, 2-O, 3-O desulfated heparin (ODSH), has been shown to inhibit HMGB1 release from a macrophage cell line and is efficacious in increasing bacterial clearance in a mouse model of pneumonia. Thus, we hypothesized that ODSH can attenuate the bacterial burden and inflammatory lung injury in CF and we conducted experiments to determine the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: We determined the effects of ODSH on lung injury produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection in CF mice with the transmembrane conductance regulator gene knockout (CFTR(?/?)). Mice were given ODSH or normal saline intraperitoneally, followed by the determination of the bacterial load and lung injury in the airways and lung tissues. ODSH binding to HMGB1 was determined using surface plasmon resonance and in silico docking analysis of the interaction of the pentasaccharide form of ODSH with HMGB1. RESULTS: CF mice given 25 mg/kg i.p. of ODSH had significantly lower PA-induced lung injury compared to mice given vehicle alone. The CF mice infected with PA had decreased levels of nitric oxide (NO), increased levels of airway HMGB1 and HMGB1-impaired macrophage phagocytic function. ODSH partially attenuated the PA-induced alteration in the levels of NO and airway HMGB1 in CF mice. In addition, ODSH reversed HMGB1-impaired macrophage phagocytic function. These effects of ODSH subsequently decreased the bacterial burden in the CF lungs. In a surface plasmon resonance assay, ODSH interacted with HMGB1 with high affinity (K(D) = 3.89  10(C8) M) and induced conformational changes that may decrease HMGB1s binding to its membrane receptors, thus attenuating HMGB1-induced macrophage dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that ODSH can significantly decrease bacterial infection-induced lung injury in CF mice by decreasing both HMGB1-mediated impairment of macrophage function and the interaction of HMGB1 with membrane receptors. Thus, ODSH could represent a novel approach for treating CF and ARDS patients that have HMGB1-mediated lung injury.

Use of fluoroscopy during ERCP results in radiation exposure to the interventional endoscopy care providers. Prevention of radiation induced injuries such as cataracts, cancer, skin injuries and vascular aging from long term exposure is of vital importance. Current guidelines recommend monitored radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) with institution dependent numerical limits. Prompted by a pregnancy among one of our providers who chose to continue performing ERCP, we initated a radiation safety initiative and evaluated the impact of this initiative on mean fluoroscopy times and radiation dose exposure to our staff. Methods: All ERCP cases performed from June 2018 to February 2020 were reviewed (data collection halted in March 2020 due to the COVID19 pandemic). Cases performed from June 2018 to June 2019 were categorized as pre initiative. Cases from July 2019 to February 2020 were categorized as post initiative. The safety initiative included use of a new fluoroscopy bed with a lead skirt, c-arm receiver unit lead shield, mindful fluoroscopy use by the attending physician only, appropriate usage of dosimeter badges and evaluation of personal protective equipment (PPE) (lead aprons, thyroid shield, lead glasses) to ensure quality. The following data was collected: mean fluoroscopy time per procedure, individual provider (physicians, nurses and technicians), the monthly deep dose equivalent (DDE) representing body, gonads and blood making organs, the monthly shallow dose equivalent (SDE) representing skin and extremities and monthly lens of eye dose equivalent (LDE) were collected. Results: A total of 198 ERCPs were performed in the pre-initiative group (14 cases per month). Mean fluoroscopy time per case was 12.1 minutes. A total of 110 ERCPs were performed in the post-initiation group (also 14 cases per month) with a mean fluoroscopy time per case of 6.3 minutes (48% reduction). For all providers, the average monthly DDE went from 47.6 mrem to 9.23 (81% reduction), the average monthly SDE went from 102.49 mrem to 31.35 (69.5% reduction) and the average monthly LDE went from 100.25 mrem to 30.18 (70% reduction). The fetal dosimeter badge worn by the pregnant provider detected an \\"undetectable\\" reading every month. Discussion: Quality initiatives coupled with adequate personal protective equipment to improve the radiation dose exposure of advanced endoscopy staff performing ERCP can result in significant improvement. Performing ERCP during pregnancy is a feasible option if proper techniques and policy are implanted to protect the fetus. Improvement of the safety profile of ERCP for women of child-bearing age is an important step in increasing the number of women in the field of advanced endoscopy.","output":"Id: 3524384 Impact of an Ercp Radiation Safety Initiative on Staff Dose Exposures: a Quality Improvement Initiative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Everybody agrees that the COVID-19 pandemic is a big disruption in education It questions many traditional rules and structures that have organised the work of schools in the past But not everyone agrees that the pandemic will eventually change schools In this article, I narrow the scope of that question and ask whether the pandemic helps us fix some of the pre-existing inequalities that we were unable, and often unwilling, to improve I argue that as we think about how education should be reimagined, it is paramount to continue efforts to make education more inclusive, fairer and equitable for all I take some early examples from two distinct education systems, Australia and Finland, to highlight how disrupted teaching caused by school closures has had different impacts on schools and teachers The conclusion is that the pandemic may help make education more equitable if current socio-economic inequalities are addressed early on;teachers and principals are trusted more in leading schools forward in the post-pandemic world;and schools and children are supported to become more self-directed in leading and learning","output":"Does the pandemic help us make education more equitable?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: In the characterization of severe lung diseases, early detection of specific inflammatory cells could help to monitor patients response to therapy and increase chances of survival.

[(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE is an established clinical radiopharmaceutical targeting somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR 2). Since activated macrophages (M1) overexpress SSTR 2, the aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of M1 macrophages in pulmonary inflammation. METHODS: Inflammation in the pig lungs was induced by warm saline lavage followed by injurious ventilation in farm pigs (n = 7). Healthy pigs (n = 3) were used as control. A 60-min dynamic PET scan over the lungs was performed after [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE injection and [(18)F]FDG scan was executed afterward for comparison. The uptake of both tracers was assessed as mean standardized uptake values (SUV(mean)) 30C60-min post-injection. The PET scans were followed by computed tomography (CT) scans, and the Hounsfield units (HU) were quantified of the coronal segments. Basal and apical segments of the lungs were harvested for histology staining. A rat lung inflammation model was also studied for tracer specificity using lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by oropharyngeal aspiration. Organ biodistribution, ex vivo autoradiography (ARG) and histology samples were conducted on LPS treated, octreotide induced blocking and control healthy rats. RESULTS: The accumulation of [(68)Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE on pig lavage model was prominent in the more severely injured dorsal segments of the lungs (SUVmean = 0.91  0.56), compared with control animals (SUVmean = 0.27  0.16, p < 0.05). The tracer uptake corresponded to the damaged areas assessed by CT and histology and were in line with HU quantification.

It is important to prioritize mental health during crisis events to mitigate the negative and often long-term effects of the crises on young people, families, and society. Mental health and well-being apps represent a scalable approach for improving psychological outcomes in young people and have potential to improve the equity of service access. OBJECTIVE: The Whitu: 7 Ways in 7 Days well-being app was recently developed by our group to address the urgent need for innovative approaches to reach young New Zealanders who are struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is twofold: to evaluate the acceptability of the prototype app and to examine the effectiveness of the refined app at improving mental and emotional well-being and reducing depression, anxiety, and stress in young people in New Zealand. METHODS: A two-phase mixed methods study will be undertaken to achieve these aims. During the first phase, 20 young people aged 16-30 years (including those of Maori and Pacific ethnicity) will participate in a qualitative study to help refine the prototype app. During the second phase, 90 young people aged 16-30 years will participate in a randomized waitlist-controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of the refined Whitu app at 4 weeks and 3 months after baseline. Outcomes will be evaluated using validated web-based questionnaires at baseline, 4 weeks, and 3 months. RESULTS: The study received ethics approval in May 2020, and recruitment for the focus groups commenced in June 2020. Recruitment for the RCT is expected to commence in October 2020. Participants for both study phases will be recruited via social media and web-based communities. Data collection for the RCT is expected to be completed by January 2021, and analyses are expected to be completed by March 2021. Linear mixed modelling will be used to determine between-group differences in psychological outcomes.

Currently, there are no clinically proven pharmacotherapies for coronavirus disease 2019, despite promising initial results obtained from drugs such as azithromycin and hydroxyquinoline. Therefore, the repurposing of clinically approved drugs for use against SARS-CoV-2 has become a viable strategy. Here, we searched for drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) by in silico screening of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved drug library.

Tetracycline, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, dutasteride, nelfinavir, and paliperidone formed stable interactions with 3CLpro based on MD simulation results. Similar analysis with RdRp showed that eltrombopag, tipranavir, ergotamine, and conivaptan bound to the enzyme with high binding free energies. Docking results suggest that ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, bromocriptine, dutasteride, conivaptan, paliperidone, and tipranavir can bind to both enzymes with high affinity.

Retrospective review of all patients needing ECMO between September 2011 and September 2020 who underwent evaluation for HIT while on ECMO. The diagnosis of HIT required a confirmatory serotonin release assay (SRA). Various break points for the optical density (OD) that defines a positive HIT ELISA were examined to estimate their utility as screening tests for HIT. Patient outcomes served as a secondary endpoint. Among 417 ECMO patients, 162 (38.8%) had a HIT ELISA. Of these, 114 (70.4%) had a subsequent SRA. Although the HIT ELISA was positive at an OD  0.4 in 1/3(rd) of subjects, only 15 subjects met criteria for HIT by SRA. Hence, the prevalence of HIT equaled 3.6%. At an OD  0.4 the ELISA had both poor specificity (71.7%) and accuracy (74.6%). Changing the definition of the ELISA to an OD  1.2 improved both specificity and accuracy with only a limited impact on sensitivity. Nearly 60% of those with HIT developing during ECMO died. HIT is infrequent in persons requiring ECMO. However, HIT remains associated with substantial mortality. The HIT ELISA as currently implemented performs poorly as a screening test and likely results in the unnecessary overuse of alternatives to unfractionated heparin.

P. jirovecii colonization may be linked to the transmission of the infection. The detection of P. jirovecii in immunocompromised patients is thus especially important. The low fungal load and the presence of PCR inhibitors limit the usefulness of quantitative PCR (qPCR) for accurate absolute quantification of P. jirovecii in specimens. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), however, presents a methodology that allows higher sensitivity and accuracy. Here, we developed a ddPCR method for detecting P. jirovecii DNA in respiratory specimens, and evaluated its sensitivity against qPCR. Materials and Methods: One bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) sample each was collected from 82 patients with potential PCP to test the presence of P. jirovecii DNA using both ddPCR and qPCR, and samples with inconsistent results between the two methods were further tested by metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS). In addition, 37 sputum samples from 16 patients diagnosed with PCP, as well as continuous respiratory tract specimens from nine patients with PCP and treated with sulfonamides, were also collected for P. jirovecii DNA testing using both ddPCR and qPCR. Results: ddPCR and qPCR gave the same results for 95.12% (78/82) of the BALF samples. The remaining four specimens tested positive using ddPCR but negative using qPCR, and they were found to be positive by mNGS. Detection results of 78.37% (29/37) sputum samples were consistent between ddPCR and qPCR, while the other eight samples tested positive using ddPCR but negative using qPCR. The P. jirovecii load of patients with PCP decreased to undetectable levels after treatment according to qPCR, but P. jirovecii was still detectable using ddPCR. Conclusions: ddPCR was more sensitive than qPCR, especially at detecting low-pathogen-load P. jirovecii. Thus, ddPCR represents a useful, viable, and reliable alternative to qPCR in P. jirovecii testing in patients with immunodeficiency.","output":"Development of a Droplet Digital Polymerase Chain Reaction for Sensitive Detection of Pneumocystis jirovecii in Respiratory Tract Specimens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children.

It is noticed that atmospheric precipitations help to cleanse the air from pollution and at the same time from viruses, reducing non-contact infections. These facts additionally actualize the problem of optimal microbiological decontamination of air and surfaces. In order to optimize microbiological sterilization, a thermodynamic approach is applied. It is shown that irreversible chemical oxidation reactions are the shortest way to achieve sterility, they being capable of providing one hundred percent reliability of decontamination. It is established that oxygen is optimal as an oxidant, including ecologically, because it and all of its reactive forms harmoniously fit into natural exchange cycles. The optimal way to obtain reactive oxygen species for disinfection is the use of low-temperature (cold) plasma, which provides energy-efficient generation of oxidative reactive forms - atomic oxygen (O), ozone (O3), hydroxyl radical (?OH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide (O2 ?), singlet oxygen O2(a1g). Due to the short lifetime for most of the above forms outside the plasma applicator, remoted from the plasma generator objects should be sterilized with ozone (O3), the minimum lifetime of which is quite long (several minutes). It is substantiated that microwave method of generating oxygen plasma is optimal for energy efficient ozone production. A modular principle of generation is proposed for varying the productivity of ozone generating units over a wide range. The module is developed on the basis of an adapted serial microwave oven, in which a non-self-sustaining microwave discharge is maintained due to ionizations produced by radionuclides-emitters. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Microbiological Decontamination of Air and Surfaces Due to Nanosecond Discharges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"LaR Pediatric solid-organ transplantation is an increasingly successful treatment for organ failure.

The study identifies key persuasive communication components that influence individuals' attitudes and, subsequently, intentions to follow health-related information shared by SMIs. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative interviews with healthcare workers and interactions with 332 active social media users via structured online questionnaires were used for data collection. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse responses. Findings: Results indicate that SMIs' credibility, SMICindividual homophily and quality of information shared by the SMI are the significant factors determining individuals' attitudes towards the information received. Furthermore, the individual's attitude significantly impacts their intention to follow information shared by the SMI. The study thus verifies the mediating role of attitude in persuasive communication. Research limitations/implications: The current study can serve as a foundation for future work to examine the suitability of SMIs for tasks other than marketing. Practical implications: The study provides insights for planning and implementing SMI-sourced communication in the public health context. The study enhances the understanding of the tested relationships and thereby increases scholars' and practitioners' ability to leverage SMIs for health-related communication. Originality/value: Whilst SMIs are attracting increasing attention in consumer markets, the study suggests that they can be used in public health communication.

To increase this activity there are growing opportunities for physiotherapists to be involved in clinical research. However, there are few roles that include time for that research (Westwood et al., 2018). Further, there are fewer opportunities for band 5 clinicians to gain research experience to foster research awareness. To impact the research awareness and clinical practice of our Band 5 rotational physiotherapists, a mixed research and clinical musculoskeletal rotation was implemented at a London Healthcare Trust. The objective of this service evaluation was to evaluate whether the rotation impacted the activity of these clinicians. Methods: The full time rotation was structured with 2 days research activity alongside 3 days clinical activity within musculoskeletal outpatients. Two band 5 physiotherapists were invited to undertake this 4 month rotation. Any prior research experience related to their physiotherapy qualification. They were trained and mentored by the Lead Clinical Academic for Therapies, and each research activity was supervised by pre-doctoral to post-doctoral Therapy clinical academic fellows. The rotation included completion of research relevant training, fortnightly mentorship, and research activity relating to on-going projects. These projects included two systematic reviews and a scoping review at different stages of completion, analysis of a national survey and conducting a COVID-19 related service evaluation. The physiotherapists were asked to provide feedback of their experience. Results: The therapists reported perceived improvement and new skills in: adapting to change, time management, understanding of research governance, use of reference management and data software, and management of data. The therapists also reported improvement in the ability to read, search, and appraise the literature, and applied these new skills to research projects. Importantly, they reported that all the skills were applied to their clinical workload, in particular to implementation of evidence base care. They reported that this confidence and skill led to evidence based discussions with their musculoskeletal out-patient colleagues. Further impacts have been that to date, the therapists have 1 paper in review and will co-author 2 additional papers. Finally, they have submitted two s for conference. Conclusion(s): The rotation provided an opportunity to develop research skills C both in theory and in practice. The structure of the rotation and time given for learning allowed for consolidation of new knowledge. The skills gained during the rotation had positive impact on approaches to patient care, as well as research activity. Limitations include the timing of research days within the working week, leading to challenges of adapting between clinical and non-clinical settings. This could be addressed by placing research days at the beginning or end of the week. Impact: Early adoption, training and practice of research activity impacts evidence based patient care, and the research awareness of the clinicians and their colleagues. This rotation has been established within the wider Therapies Department. The benefits reported could inspire creation of similar opportunities, and so serve as an important step in the paradigm shift towards research active clinical practice.

IVE assessments are increasingly publicized and are often used by policy makers to make decisions about the value of seasonal influenza vaccination. But there is limited guidance on how IVE should be interpreted or used to inform policy. There are several limitations to the use of IVE for decision-making: (a) IVE studies have methodological issues that often complicate the interpretation of their value; and (b) the full impact of vaccination will almost always be greater than the impact assessed by a point estimate of IVE in specific populations or settings. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of study methodologies and the fundamental limitations of IVE estimates is important for the accuracy of interpretations and support of policy makers' decisions. Here, we review a comprehensive set of issues that need to be considered when interpreting IVE and determining the full benefits of influenza vaccination. We propose that published IVE values should be assessed using an evaluative framework that includes influenza-specific outcomes, types of VE study design, and confounders, among other factors. Better interpretation of IVE will improve the broader assessment of the value of influenza vaccination and ultimately optimize the public health benefits in seasonal influenza vaccination.","output":"Assessment of the benefits of seasonal influenza vaccination: Elements of a framework to interpret estimates of vaccine effectiveness and support robust decision-making and communication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by the coronavirus has shaken the entire world. It has, like no pandemic before, deeply impacted the mobility of the population on a global scale. Almost all the member states, including the Republic of Croatia, had public transport services put on hold and the mobility of the people who travel abroad was possible only under specific conditions. Public transport represents an extremely important segment of each society, and its role has been gaining importance in recent years since sustainable transport is in everybody's best interest. Even in these difficult times, decision-makers need to be aware of the fact that an efficient system of public transport is of great importance, and they need to find a solution to the problem that arose because many have lost trust in the public transport system for fear of their health. The findings of the studies so far have confirmed that there have been changes happening in the transport behavior and that it is crucial to revise the existing strategies of public transport development to regain trust and to ensure the conditions for sustainable transport. In Croatia's capital, a drop of the number of passengers in all segments of urban transit has been recorded, but the encouraging fact is that it is smaller than in other EU member states. To be able to operate at levels from before the pandemic, the authorities in the City of Zagreb will have to continue with the precautionary measures for minimizing the risk of transmission of the virus and with informing the public on a high level of safety.

RECENT FINDINGS When the first and only Food and Drug Administration-approved robot-assisted device, the daVinci surgical system, was approved for use in gynecology in April 2005, many procedures were translated to a robotic approach. In the field of urogynecology, much attention was given to the use of robotic assistance for sacrocolpopexy. In oncology, there was an attraction to the use of robotics for radical hysterectomies. There are a number of published observational studies comparing the outcomes of both robot-assisted laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (RALS) and robot-assisted radical hysterectomy (RRH) to their conventional laparoscopic and open versions. Overall, the literature suggests that the use of robotics for these procedures increases operative time and cost, but decreases estimated blood loss and length of stay. The complication rates appear to be similar. Recurrence of apical prolapse after RALS appears to be similar to that in conventional laparoscopic or open sacrocolpopexy. The number of lymph nodes harvested is the same or increases with RRH, whereas the disease-free progression and overall survival are similar for all the methods of radical hysterectomy. SUMMARY Literature suggests that RALS and RRH have equivalent outcomes when compared to conventional laparoscopic and open techniques. The question is whether the use of robotics that combines the outcomes of an open procedure, the benefits of minimally invasive surgery, and easy adoptability will outweigh the increased cost and time associated with robotic surgery.","output":"Role of robotic surgery in urogynecologic surgery and radical hysterectomy: how far can we go?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article we aim to provide insights about the challenges stakeholders in Portugal and across the globe may face throughout the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic to reorganize coach training programs and suggest strategies to help coaches learn Such reflection may help stakeholders across socio-cultural contexts consider the consequences of the changes made to coach training programs, the rationale for these decisions and the need to acknowledge existent challenges such as lower course completion rates, pressures to deliver the curriculum and dilemmatic decisions about course format Furthermore, we also suggest pathways for stakeholders to develop strategies that consider contextual variables and contribute to meaningful learning Based on the Portuguese context, several issues are discussed","output":"Coach Training Within the Covid-19 Pandemic: Challenges and Potential Pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online education has been around for many years and it has been growing rapidly in many parts of the world. However, many educational service providers were reluctant to utilise it fully till Covid-19 hit the world. As a result, almost most of these educational institutions have been pushed to adopt this method of teaching as an alternative mode to the conventional approach. They adapted to this new norm very quickly. However, with this new norm there arise inevitable challenges, one of which is the students engagement in the learning process, where in normal times it has its challenge. Therefore, the current study was planned to uncover the effects of an organisational factor (e.g. internal crises communication), technological factors (e.g. knowledge quality, interactivity, complexity), and personal factor (e.g. social responsibility) on students online learning engagement. Data have been obtained from a convenience sample of 365 business students from a private university in Selangor state in Malaysia. The results of the partial least square structural equation modelling have revealed that the students online learning engagement is positively and directly predicted by internal crises communication, interactivity and social responsibility as well as negatively predicted by complexity. Findings also show that knowledge quality, internal crises communication, and complexity have influenced online learning engagement indirectly through interactivity.

In answering this question, scholarship on the optimal control of infectious disease adopts the model of a benevolent social planner who maximizes social welfare. This approach, which treats the social health planner as a unitary \\"public health brain\\" standing outside of society, removes the policymaking process from economic analysis. This paper opens the black box of the social health planner by extending the tools of economics to the policymaking process itself. We explore the nature of the economic problem facing policymakers and the epistemic constraints they face in trying to solve that problem. Additionally, we analyze the incentives facing policymakers in their efforts to address infectious diseases and consider how they affect the design and implementation of public health policy. Finally, we consider how unanticipated system effects emerge due to interventions in complex systems, and how these effects can undermine well-intentioned efforts to improve human welfare.

Recently, an emerging social media app, TikTok, has received much interest owing to its popularity among general health consumers. We notice that there are many videos about diabetes on TikTok. However, it remains unclear whether the information in these videos is of satisfactory quality. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the quality of the information in diabetes-related videos on TikTok. METHODS: We collected a sample of 199 diabetes-related videos in Chinese. The basic information presented in the videos was coded and analyzed. First, we identified the source of each video. Next, 2 independent raters assessed each video in terms of the completeness of six types of content (the definition of the disease, symptoms, risk factors, evaluation, management, and outcomes). Then, the 2 raters independently assessed the quality of information in the videos, using the DISCERN instrument. RESULTS: In regard to the sources of the videos, we found 6 distinct types of uploaders; these included 3 kinds of individual users (ie, health professionals, general users, and science communicators) and 3 types of organizational users (ie, news agencies, nonprofit organizations, and for-profit organizations). Regarding content, our results show that the videos were primarily about diabetes management and contained limited information on the definition of the disease, symptoms, risk factors, evaluation, and outcomes. The overall quality of the videos was acceptable, on average, although the quality of the information varied, depending on the sources. The videos created by nonprofit organizations had the highest information quality, while the videos contributed by for-profit organizations had the lowest information quality. CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall quality of the information in the diabetes videos on TikTok is acceptable, TikTok might not fully meet the health information needs of patients with diabetes, and they should exercise caution when using TikTok as a source of diabetes-related information.","output":"TikTok as a Health Information Source: Assessment of the Quality of Information in Diabetes-Related Videos"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The crisis in the SARSCoV-2 coronavirus causing COVID-19 is putting health systems around the world to the test. In a great effort to standardize the management and treatment guidelines, the different health authorities and scientific associations have tried to issue recommendations on how to act in this new and complex scenario. OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the existing evidence and recommendations about urological emergency surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Furthermore, we propose a general action protocol for these patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS The document is based ont he scarce evidence on SARS / Cov-2 and the experience of the authors in the management of COVID-19 in their institutions, including specialists from Andalusia, Cantabria, Madrid and the Basque Country. A web and PubMed search was performed using the keywords \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", \\"COVID19\\", \\"COVID Urology\\", \\"COVID19 surgery\\" and \\"emergency care\\". A narrative review of the literature was carried out until April 30, 2020, including only articles and documents written in Spanish and English. After the nominal group technique modified due to the extraordinary restrictions, a first draft was made to unify criteria. Finally, a definitive version was made, agreed by all the authors on May 12, 2020. RESULTS General principles of action are set out, as well as specific recommendations for the most frequent urgent urological procedures. CONCLUSIONS Given the exceptional nature of the situation, there is a lack of evidence regarding the optimal management of the patient with urgent urological pathology. The information is changing, as the epidemiological knowledge of the disease advances. The establishment of multidisciplinary surgical committees that develop and implement action protocols appropriate to the different resources and particular situations of each center is recommended.

In prenatal education, cultivating nurses' knowledge and competence of vaccine administration is a crucial issue for protecting pregnant women and newborns from infection. Therefore, obstetric vaccination knowledge has become a basic and essential training program for nursing students. However, most of these training programs are given via the lecture-based teaching approach with skills practice, providing students with few opportunities to think deeply about the relevant issues owing to the lack of interaction and context. This could have a negative impact on their learning effectiveness and clinical judgment. To address this problem, a mobile chatbot-based learning approach is proposed in this study to enable students to learn and think deeply in the contexts of handling obstetric vaccine cases via interacting with the chatbot. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment was implemented. Two classes of 36 students from a university in northern Taiwan were recruited as participants. One class was the experimental group learning with the proposed approach, while the other class was the control group learning with the conventional approach (ie, giving lectures to explain the instructional content and training cases). The results indicate that applying a mobile chatbot for learning can enhance nursing students' learning achievement and self-efficacy. In addition, based on the analysis of the interview results, students generally believed that learning through the mobile chatbot was able to promote their self-efficacy as well as their learning engagement and performance. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Issues relevant to AI technology in education have been extensively discussed and explored around the world. Among the various AI systems, the potential of chatbots has been highlighted by researchers owing to the user-friendly interface developed using the natural language processing (NLP) technology. Few studies using AI chatbots in professional training have been conducted. What this paper adds In this study, a mobile chatbot was used in a nursing training program to enhance students' learning achievement and self-efficacy for handling vaccine cases. The mobile chatbot significantly improved the students' learning achievement and self-efficacy in comparison with the conventional learning approach in the vaccine training program. From the interview results, it was found that the students generally believed that the mobile chatbot was able to promote their self-efficacy as well as learning engagement and performances in the vaccine training program. Implications for practice and/or policy Mobile chatbots have great potential for professional training owing to their convenient and user-friendly features. It would be worth applying mobile chatbots as well as other NLP-based applications to other professional training programs in the future. ? 2021 British Educational Research Association.","output":"Promoting students' learning achievement and self-efficacy: A mobile chatbot approach for nursing training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Data on the filtration efficacies of various masks against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are limited. We thus evaluate the effectiveness of the surgical mask, the N95 respirator mask, and its equivalent (KF94 mask) in filtering SARS-CoV-2. METHODS Patients hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 infection were instructed to cough five times each while wearing (1) no mask, (2) surgical mask, (3) KF94 mask, and (4) N95 mask. The coughs were separated by 20-second intervals, and the patients were rested for at least 5 min between each setting. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in patient samples (i.e. nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva), petri dishes placed in front of the patients during coughing, and swabs from the outer and inner surfaces of the masks were analysed with PCR. RESULTS A total of 7 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection participated in the mask test. SARS-CoV-2 was detected on the petri dishes after coughing in 3 out of 7 cases with the surgical mask or no mask. Viral particles were not found in the petri dishes after coughing while wearing the N95 mask or the KF94 mask. While viral particles were detected in both the inner and outer surfaces of the surgical masks, those were detected only in the inner surfaces of the N95 and K94 masks. CONCLUSION Surgical masks were less effective in filtering viral particles from coughing patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The sudden onset of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted neuropsychologists to identify alternative ways to provide equitable care. Clinicians providing TeleNP to this population during (and after) the pandemic must consider safety, professional factors, and systemic barriers to accessing and benefitting from virtual modalities.

CASE PRESENTATION: Our interdisciplinary rehabilitation team faced challenges related to language, cultural and educational barriers which impacted the typical standard rehabilitation care offered to these individuals. Many of the individuals were focused on curative treatments. As such, managing expectations and educating individuals to rehabilitation practices for chronic SCI and lack of curative treatments for associated medical complications affected the provision of care across all disciplines of the rehabilitation team. DISCUSSION: This case series showcases the challenges of caring for international refugees with SCI. The care offered to these individuals highlights the benefits that an interdisciplinary SCI rehabilitation approach can provide to comprehensively care for this vulnerable population.","output":"Interdisciplinary care for spinal cord injured refugees"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Accurate estimates for the risk of COVID-19 in IBD, and an understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on IBD course and the risk of incident post-infectious IBD are needed. AIMS: To estimate the risk of COVID-19 in IBD and study its impact on IBD course and the risk of incident post-infectious IBD. METHODS: A retrospective propensity score matched cohort study utilising multi-institutional research network TriNetX. COVID-19 patients with and without IBD were identified to quantify the risk of COVID-19 in patients with IBD, COVID-19 outcomes in patients with IBD and the impact of COVID-19 on IBD disease course. The risk of incident post-infectious IBD in COVID-19 patients was compared to the population not infected with COVID-19 during a similar time period. RESULTS: Incidence rate ratio for COVID-19 was lower in IBD patients compared to the non-IBD population (0.79, 95% CI: 0.72-0.86). COVID-19-infected patients with IBD were at increased risk for requiring hospitalisation compared to non-IBD population (RR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.02-1.34) with no differences in need for mechanical ventilation or mortality. Patients with IBD on steroids were at an increased risk for critical care need (RR: 2.22, 95% CI: 1.29-3.82). Up to 7% of patients with IBD infected with COVID-19 suffered an IBD flare 3-months post-infection. Risk for incident IBD post-COVID was lower than that seen in the non-COVID population (RR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.54-0.65). CONCLUSION: We observed no increase in risk for COVID-19 amongst patients with IBD or risk for de novo IBD after COVID-19 infection. We confirmed prior observations regarding the impact of steroid use on COVID-19 severity in patients with IBD.","output":"Incidence, outcomes, and impact of COVID-19 on inflammatory bowel disease: propensity matched research network analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Clinical competence is essential for providing safe, competent care and is regularly assessed to ensure health care practitioners maintain competence. When deficiencies in competence are identified, practitioners may undergo remediation. However, there is limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of remediation programs. The purpose of this review is to examine the purpose, format, and outcomes of remediation programs for regulated health care practitioners. METHODS All six stages of the scoping review process as recommended by Levac et al were undertaken. A search was conducted within MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ERIC, gray literature databases, and websites of Canadian provincial regulatory bodies. Emails were sent to Registrars of Canadian regulatory bodies to supplement data gathered from their websites. RESULTS A total of 14 programs were identified, primarily for physicians (n = 8). Reasons for remediation varied widely, with some programs identifying multiple reasons for referral such as deficiencies in recordkeeping (n = 7) and clinical skills (n = 6). Most programs (n = 9) were individualized to address specific deficiencies in competence. The process of remediation followed three stages: (1) assessment, (2) active remediation, and (3) reassessment. Most programs (n = 12) reported that remediation was effective in improving competence. CONCLUSIONS Regulatory bodies should consider implementing individualized remediation programs to ensure that clinicians' deficiencies in competence are addressed effectively. Further research is indicated, using reliable and valid outcome measures to assess competence immediately after remediation programs and beyond.","output":"Remediation Programs for Regulated Health Care Professionals: A Scoping Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: During the fall of 2020, some high schools across the US allowed their students to participate in interscholastic sports while others cancelled or postponed their sport programs due to concerns regarding COVID-19 transmission. It is unknown what effect this has had on the physical and mental health of adolescents. OBJECTIVE: Identify the impact of playing a sport during the COVID-19 pandemic on the health of student athletes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Sample recruited via email. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: 559 STATE-XXX high school athletes (age=15.71.2 yrs., female=44%) from 44 high schools completed an online survey in October 2020. A total of 171 (31%) athletes played (PLY) a fall sport, while 388 (69%) did not play (DNP). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Demographics included: sex, grade and sports played. Assessments included the General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for quality of life. Univariable comparisons between the two groups were made via t-tests or chi-square tests. Means for each continuous outcome measure were compared between the groups by ANOVA models that controlled for Age, Sex, Teaching method (Virtual, Hybrid, or In-person), and the % of students eligible for free lunch. RESULTS: PLY group participants were less likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety (PLY=6.6%, DNP=44.1%, p<0.001) and depression (PLY=18.2%, DNP=40.4%, p<0.001). PLY athletes reported higher (better) PFABS scores (mean: [95%CI]), (PLY=23.2[22.0,24.5], DNP=16.4[15.0,17.8], p <0.001) and higher (better) PedsQL total scores (PLY=88.4[85.9,90.9], DNP=79.6[76.8,82.4], p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents who played a sport during the COVID-19 pandemic reported fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as higher physical activity and quality of life scores compared to adolescent athletes who did not play a sport.","output":"High School Sports During the CoVID-19 Pandemic: The Impact of Sport Participation on the Health of Adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mass immunization is the prioritised post-pandemic phase offering preventive countermeasure for COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is crucial to tackle the environmental impact of COVID-19 vaccine waste for sustainable vaccination management because a prolonged immunisation campaign is expected. As the pace of vaccine production, distribution and mass vaccination has been expedited, there is a simultaneous rise in plastic derived vaccine waste including syringes, needles, used/unused vaccine vials, vaccine packaging, and protective gear (surgical facemasks, gloves, face shields, etc). Henceforth, in view of the repercussions of heaping plastic waste in the environment, this article provides a perspective on the usage of synthetic and natural materials as potential substituents for vaccination tools. The biodegradable polymeric gums such as cellulose, gellan, pectin, etc. have been successfully applied for the fabrication of surgical facemasks. The highly suggestive practice is replacement of conventional polypropylene based plastics with bioplastics or paper for vaccine packaging. The usage of biodegradable bio-plastics as packaging material along with environmentally friendly face masks can help to achieve the zero waste approach. The discussion in the article significantly highlights the necessity of opting sustainable solutions of disinfecting and substituting vaccination tools for an environment friendly ongoing vaccination campaign.

METHODS All consecutive patients treated for unruptured intracranial aneurysms with TRA using a 6F Neuron MAX catheter between September 2019 and May 2021 in a single tertiary center were screened. They were referred to a consultation and an ultrasound-Doppler assessment of the radial artery 3 months after treatment with the attending neuroradiologist. Patients with available assessment of the radial artery patency were included. RESULTS A total of 17 patients (median age: 58 years, range 35-68 years; sex ratio F/M: 15/2) were treated for intracranial aneurysms using a 6F Neuron MAX directly into the right radial artery and included. Treatment was a technical success for 16/17 (94%) patients and 1 patient (6%) required a conversion to femoral access. The median radial artery diameter at the puncture site was 2.7 mm (range 1.8-2.9mm). No symptomatic RAO was noted during follow-up. Assessment at 3 months revealed 7/17 (41%) asymptomatic RAOs. CONCLUSION Even if technically feasible, the use of a 6F Neuron Max long sheath for triaxial catheterization in intracranial interventions, especially flow diversion, may be responsible for a high radial artery occlusion rate (41%). Although being asymptomatic in all cases in our series, this high occlusion rate may be a concern for further interventions. The development of dedicated radial long sheaths for neurointerventions, with external hydrophilic coating, seems necessary.","output":"Prohibitive Radial Artery Occlusion Rates Following Transradial Access Using a 6-French Neuron MAX Long Sheath for Intracranial Aneurysm Treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic underlined that guidelines and recommendations must be made more accessible and more understandable to the general public, including adults, parents, and youth, to improve health outcomes. The objective of this study is to the publics (youth, parents, and adult populations) understanding, usability, satisfaction, intention to implement, and preference for different ways of presenting COVID-19 health recommendations derived from the COVID-19 Living Map of Recommendations and Gateway to Contextualization (herein referred to as the RecMap). Methods and AnalysisThis is a protocol for a mixed-methods study. We will conduct a pragmatic allocation-concealed, blinded superiority randomized controlled trial (RCT) in three populations: adults (21 years of age or older), parents (18 years or above and are a parent or legal guardian of a child under 18 years old), and youth (15 to 24 years old), with at least 240 participants in each population. The trial will consist of an online survey and optional one on one interview. Prior to initiating the RCT, all PLRs were refined with relevant stakeholder input. In each population group, the intervention arm will receive a PLR format while the control arm will receive the original recommendation format as originally published by the guideline organizations (herein referred to as Standard Language Version). Our primary outcome is understanding, and our secondary outcomes are accessibility and usability, satisfaction, intended behavior, and preference for the two recommendation formats. Each populations results will be analyzed separately. We will pool the results across populations using meta-analysis, and also explore potential interaction and subgroup effects within each population. At the end of each survey, participants will be invited to participate in a one-on-one semi-structured interview to explore reasons for their choices and learn for future research. All interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis. Interpretation will be iterative as data coding proceeds. Ethics and DisseminationThrough Clinical Trials Ontario (CTO), the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board has reviewed and approved this protocol (Project ID: 3856).

However, shared (limited) sanitation facilities have been thought to pose health risks due to poor hygiene levels. Interventions to improve user behavior and cleanliness of shared sanitation are few, both in literature and in practice. This study details the codesign and testing of strategies to improve the cleanliness of shared sanitation facilities in low-income areas of Kisumu City in Kenya. The strategies included a cleaning plan, monitoring system, and discussions among users, and were codesigned through workshops with stakeholders and group discussions with landlords and tenants. These strategies were tested in 38 compound houses through the Trials of Improved Practices approach over a 5-month period. Field staff visited the compounds, observed the cleanliness of the shared toilets, and through discussions, encouraged users to develop a formal cleaning system and a monitoring plan. The discussions built social capital and collective action and facilitated uptake of the cleaning plan with notable improvements in cleanliness of shared toilets. The results support the acceptability of shared sanitation in low-income settlements, the importance of codesigning and coproducing solutions with users, and the need to evaluate the effects of these strategies on cleanliness of shared sanitation.","output":"Developing and Testing Strategies for Improving Cleanliness of Shared Sanitation in Low-Income Settlements of Kisumu, Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Difficulties have risen while managing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, although it meets the Berlin definition.

Previous work is limited to postmortem studies, while our report addresses patients under protective lung mechanical ventilation. An open-lung minithoracotomy was performed in 3 patients who developed ARDS related to COVID-19 and were admitted to the intensive care unit to carry out a pathological and microbiological analysis on lung tissue biopsy. Diffused alveolar damage with hyaline membranes was found, as well as plurifocal fibrin microthrombi and vascular congestion in all patients' specimens. Microbiological cultures were negative, whereas qualitative Reversed Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) detected SARS-CoV-2 in the pulmonary parenchyma and pleural fluid in two patients. COVID-19 causes progressive ARDS with onset of severe hypoxemia, underlying a dual mechanism: shunt effect through diffused alveolar damage and dead space effect through thrombotic injuries in microvascular beds.

As more information accumulates, patterns of rare or new diseases on CT scans are being increasingly reported. Several pulmonary diseases have distinguishing features, which are better delineated on high resolution CT scans than plain chest radiographs. The radiographic features of unusual diffuse lung diseases published in the past two years are described. RECENT FINDINGS Severe acute respiratory syndrome generally manifests as focal or diffuse bilateral areas of consolidation on chest radiography and reticulation with ground-glass attenuation commonly seen on CT scans. A normal HRCT rules out the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while a normal chest radiograph does not. Immunocompromised patients without AIDS, who have CMV pneumonia, generally demonstrate a combination of ground-glass attenuation, air-space consolidation, and small nodules on HRCT. Nodules less than 10 mm in size in immunocompromised patients are highly suggestive of viral infections. Bronchial wall thickening on HRCT associated with cavitating nodules is suggestive of Wegner granulomatosis in the appropriate clinical setting. Small cysts may be seen in a minority of patients with subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis and centrilobular emphysema in chronic farmer's lung. Reversed halo sign has a high specificity for cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. The triad of ground-glass opacities, ill-defined centrilobular nodules and cysts and focal areas of air trapping is highly suggestive of subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

Methods We enrolled a cohort of patients with PCR confirmed COVID-19 disease at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, the main hospital for southern Malawi, between July 2020 and September 2021. The recruitment period covered three waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Malawi. Clinical and diagnostic data were collected using the ISARIC clinical characterization protocol for COVID-19. The viral material from PCR-positive swabs was amplified with a tiling PCR scheme and sequenced using the MinION sequencer in Malawi. Consensus genomes were generated using the ARTIC pipeline and lineage assignment was performed using Pangolin. Results Sequencing data showed that wave one was predominantly B.1 (8/11 samples), wave two consisted entirely of Beta variant of concern (VOC) (6/6), and wave three was predominantly Delta VOC (25/26). Patients presenting in the second and third waves had progressively fewer underlying chronic conditions, and patients in the third wave had a shorter time to presentation (2 days vs 5 in the original wave). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated increased mortality in wave three, dominated by the Delta VOC, compared to previous waves (OR 6.6 [CI 1.1-38.8]). Conclusions Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Blantyre during the Delta wave had more acute symptom onset; fewer underlying conditions; and were more likely to die. Whilst we demonstrate the value of linking virus sequence data with clinical outcome data in a low-income setting, this study also highlights the considerable barriers to establishing sequencing capacity in a setting heavily affected by disruptions in supply chain and inequity of resource distribution.","output":"Genomically informed clinical comparison of three epidemic waves of COVID-19 in Malawi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeCrises threaten the operations of small businesses and endanger their survival;however, when the crisis is not attributable to the firm, consumers may rally around the business. This study aims to examine how attitudes toward helping others can create support for small businesses, which in turn can direct consumers to help businesses with increased financial support. It is hoped that this paper will inform how consumers will help firms pivot during crises.Design/methodology/approachA conceptual model was proposed which linked support for helping others to increased willingness to tip/amount tipped. The model was tested using structural equation modeling from two surveys given to customers of two small businesses, a coffee shop and an independent movie theater, respectively.FindingsDuring a crisis, support for helping others has a positive impact on feelings of support for small businesses. Consumers direct their support to small businesses that they are interested in seeing survive and continue operations. They either tip more or tip when they otherwise would not have tipped.Practical implicationsFirms that pivot their operations because of a crisis imposed on them can still generate revenues. Consumers who have a self-interest in the continuing operations of the firm want to support it, and by pivoting their business model, the firm gives consumers the opportunity to give the firm and its employees more than they would have in the form of tips.Originality/valuePrior work in crisis management has focused primarily on how firms recover and respond to a crisis of their doing.

Seasonal variation driven by responses to changing environment has been shown to affect the transmission intensity of several coronaviruses. However, the impact of the environment on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains largely unknown, and thus seasonal variation remains a source of uncertainty in forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we address this issue by assessing the association of temperature, humidity, ultraviolet radiation, and population density with estimates of transmission rate (R). Using data from the United States, we explore correlates of transmission across US states using comparative regression and integrative epidemiological modeling. We find that policy intervention (lockdown) and reductions in individuals mobility are the major predictors of SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates, but, in their absence, lower temperatures and higher population densities are correlated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our results show that summer weather cannot be considered a substitute for mitigation policies, but that lower autumn and winter temperatures may lead to an increase in transmission intensity in the absence of policy interventions or behavioral changes. We outline how this information may improve the forecasting of COVID-19, reveal its future seasonal dynamics, and inform intervention policies.","output":"Temperature and population density influence SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the absence of nonpharmaceutical interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Progressive lung cancer is associated with abnormal coagulation. Platelets play a vital part in evading immune surveillance and angiogenesis in the case of tumor metastasis. The study aimed to analyze the predictive and prognostic effects of platelet count on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed the prognostic effects of platelets on 52 NSCLC patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant following EGFR-TKI treatment. Related data, together with the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were collected before and after 2 cycles of treatments (60 days). RESULTS: The anti-EGFR treatment markedly reduced the platelet count in 33 (63.5%) patients after 2 cycles of treatment. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that, the decreased platelet count was closely correlated with the longer OS (HR = 0.293; 95%CI: 0.107-0.799; p = 0.017). Besides, the median OS was 326 days in the decreased platelet count group and 241 days in the increased platelet count group (HR = 0.311; 95%CI: 0.118-0.818; P = 0.018), as obtained from the independent baseline platelet levels and other clinical features. CONCLUSIONS: The platelet count may predict the prognosis for EGFR-TKI treatment without additional costs.

How does digital inequality in the context of social distancing affect the COVID-19 pandemic? In this article, we assessed the impact of existing digital inequality as the cause of the changing number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU. We assessed the relationship between the increase in COVID-19 cases between the first and second waves in 2020 and the presence of digital inequality in Internet use and digital skills across sociodemographic factors: gender, age, education, generation, marital status, and place of residence. We applied the ordinary least squares method to data from the 2019 Eurobarometer survey, which reveals the digital maturity of EU citizens, and from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control in 2020, which tracks COVID-19 cases. We found that the strongest relationship between the number of COVID-19 cases and digital inequality is related to Internet use rather than digital skills. The digital divide by age, between generations, and the geographic digital divide in Internet use show a strong positive relationship with the changing incidence of COVID-19 cases. The gender digital gap shows a negative relationship for both Internet use and digital skills, indicating the social role of women in households in the pandemic, caring for children and the elderly. A negative relation was also found in digital inequality by marital status for digital skills, which reflects preferences regarding living alone during the pandemic. These findings prove the importance of universal access to the Internet for older people and those living in rural areas.

It is expected that patients who received Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR T-cell) therapy for hematologic malignancies are at risk for poor outcomes after COVID-19 due to their severely immunocompromised state caused by prior cumulative immunochemotherapy, on-target/off-tumor B-cell depletion, hypogammaglobulinemia and ongoing cytopenias. Current data are limited to small case series and case reports. This study describes the clinical characteristics and outcomes of CAR T-cell therapy recipients after developing COVID-19 in the largest cohort to date. Methods In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) developed a special COVID-19 report form to capture data from all patients with COVID-19 after treatment with CAR T-cell therapy for hematologic malignancies. Only PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed patients before June 1 (st), 2021 were included. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical course after COVID-19 diagnosis and evaluate overall survival. Overall survival probabilities were calculated using the Kaplan Meier method. Factors associated with mortality after COVID-19 diagnosis were examined using a Cox proportional hazard model. Results A total of 57 patients from 11 countries were reported to the EBMT. One patient with incomplete data at diagnosis and without any follow up information had to be excluded from the analysis. The median age of these 56 patients was 57.7 years (min-max 5.2 - 72.8) including 55 adults and one child. Of these patients, 32 were male. CAR T-cell therapy was given to 46 patients with B-cell-non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 7 patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 3 patients with multiple myeloma. The median time from CAR T-cell infusion to COVID-19 diagnosis was 7.4 months (min-max 0.03 - 25.3). At the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, 62.5% of patients were in complete remission, 12.5% of patients had a partial response and 25% of patients had relapsed/refractory disease. Forty-five patients (80%) were admitted to hospital (median 26,5 days, min-max 3-171) due to COVID-19. Of the admitted patients, 24 (53%) needed oxygen support. Twenty-two (49%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (median 14 days, min - max 2-65) and 16 (73%) of these patients received invasive ventilation. At the time of analysis, 25 of the 56 patients had died (44.6%), most (23/25) due to COVID-19, resulting in a COVID-19 attributable mortality rate of 41%. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival is shown in Figure 1. The median follow-up from COVID-19 diagnosis was 20.9 weeks. In 1 of the 32 alive patients there was no resolution of COVID-19 at the time of analysis. In multivariate analysis, older age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.50, 95% CI 1.11-2.03, p=0.009) and comorbidities (HR 2.56, 95% CI 1.05-6.23, p=0.001) had a negative impact on overall survival. Better performance status at time of admission (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59-0.88, p=0.038) had a positive impact on overall survival. Sex, time from CAR T-cell therapy to COVID-19 diagnosis, disease remission status and the occurrence of neurotoxicity or cytokine release syndrome after CAR T-cell infusion did not have a significant effect on overall survival in the multivariate analysis. Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 after B-cell-targeted CAR T-cell therapy have a very poor outcome. As it remains uncertain whether currently applied vaccination strategies against SARS-CoV-2 are effective after CAR T-cell therapy, vaccination of health-care personnel and family members in combination with protective measures against viral exposure are likely to play the most important role in protecting this vulnerable group of patients. Better treatment strategies are urgently needed.

Participation in community-based recreational activities, self-rated health, quality of life, and health status was assessed by questionnaire. Socioeconomic variables (educational level, occupational and marital status) were obtained from national registers. Multiple logistic regression models were used to examine associations. Less than half of the population participated in community-based recreational activities. Individuals with a higher educational level were 55% more likely to participate in recreational activities compared to those with a lower educational level (OR = 1.55, CI:1.45C1.66). Individuals with a low educational level who participated in recreational activities, were more likely to have an excellent/good quality of life (OR = 2.03 (95% CI:1.86C2.21)) and an excellent/very good self-rated health (OR = 1.61 (95% CI:1.51C1.71)), than those who did not participate in recreational activities. Regardless of educational level, recreational activity participation was associated with better self-rated health and quality of life.

To minimize in-person contact during the pandemic, a federal waiver of the in-person training requirement allowed new patients to begin PST after completing virtual training. However, it was uncertain whether such patients achieved comparable levels of INR control to patients receiving in-person training. METHODS: INR results for patients receiving virtual training upon PST commencement between April 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, were compared to those of patients initiating PST with in-person training between April 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019. The primary outcome was the difference in warfarin time in therapeutic range (TTR) between the groups, with secondary outcomes including differences in the percentages of INR values within individually prescribed INR range and of critical INR values. RESULTS: The records of 33,683 patients were included in the analysis (13,568 in the In-Person sample; 20,115 in the Virtual sample). Patients in the Virtual sample achieved a TTR of 66.78%, compared to the In-Person sample (64.19%; absolute difference 2.59; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.50C2.68, p < 0.001). The TTR values were also statistically significantly higher in all subgroups evaluated across categories of patient age, gender, geography, and indication. Similarly favorable results were achieved for INR values in range and critical values. CONCLUSION: Virtual education for PST for warfarin therapy is effective and should continue to be an option for patients and providers throughout the pandemic, and possibly beyond.","output":"Virtual Education for Patient Self-Testing for Warfarin Therapy Is Effective During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To continue nursing leadership development experiences in a virtual world requires planning and perseverance.

Additionally, streaming (live streaming of game sessions) became a way to earn income from home for creators. This type of content became part of the digital media diet of video game fans, who established a close relationship with streamers and generated different dynamics ranging from the publication of positive comments to strong rejection. Despite the implementation of rules regulating the behavior of streamers on platforms such as Twitch and Facebook, they are not able to control some irregularities, like monitoring negative comments or sexual innuendo during live streams. This has initiated various debates about the correct use of these media that gather people of all ages, from children to adults. In order to know consumers points of view, two focus groups were carried out (one with 8 women and another with 14 men) in order to find out the factors that influence the media competence of female streamers audience. The study addresses two dimensions: languages and ideology and values. In the languages dimension, although women are aware of harassment, they consider that a person has freedom of behavior during a stream. Men, meanwhile, consider that the way women show themselves in front of the camera allows them to generate money. In the ideology and values dimension, women believe that a female streamers behavior should not be questioned or criticized as long as it respects the rules of the community. On the other hand, men consider that the rules are interpreted subjectively, but they are aware that without these practices, the Facebook Gaming platform would not have economic income. To sum up, women take more into account the human side of people who stream while men view these behaviors as a business. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"Factors that Influence Media Competence of Female Streamers Audiences During the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As a result of the contact ban issued at the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in March 2020, psychotherapists provided significantly more video-based therapy (VBT) and most of them provided it the first time. To date, there is little research on how therapists experienced VBT during the pandemic and no studies are available that look at possible procedure-specific features. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to analyze what subjective experiences therapists of different guideline procedures had with the implementation of VBT in times of the COVID 19 pandemic and what advantages and disadvantages they experienced. METHODS: This was a mixed methods study with a cross-sectional online survey. In addition to quantitative data, seven open-ended questions were used to collect therapists subjective experiences with conducting VBT and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The identified categories were subjected to a frequency analysis. Data from 174 medical or psychological psychotherapists were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Particularly frequently mentioned advantages were flexibility of location and time, continuity of contact during pandemic periods and avoidance of risk of infection. The most commonly cited disadvantage was the lack of sensory input, facial expressions, gestures, eye contact, and nonverbal communication. The VBT was well-accepted by most, but not all, patients. Technical problems made the implementation difficult. CONCLUSION: For many therapists VBT remained a stopgap solution that was not designed to last; however, VBT could help to solve known care problems (e.g., underprovision in rural areas) beyond the pandemic period. The results of the study make an important contribution to weighing up the opportunities and risks of VBT for psychotherapeutic care and for keeping an eye on possible dangers and difficulties.","output":"?In Videobehandlungen trotz Distanz N?he schaffen: Wie erlebten Psychotherapeuten die Durchfhrung von Videobehandlungen in Zeiten von COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has caused sudden shocks in transportation systems, specifically the subway ridership patterns in New York City (NYC), U.S. Understanding the temporal pattern of subway ridership through statistical models is crucial during such shocks.

In this paper, utilizing change point detection procedures, a piecewise stationary time series model is proposed to capture the nonstationary structure of subway ridership. Specifically, the model consists of several independent station based autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models concatenated together at certain time points. Further, data-driven algorithms are utilized to detect the changes of ridership patterns as well as to estimate the model parameters before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Additionally, it has also been suggested that the extent of glioma resection is closely correlated with patient survival. Case presentation A 162-cm, 61.4-kg, 30-year-old, right-handed primigravida was referred to our institution at 21 weeks gestation to obtain a second opinion. At 18 weeks gestation, the patient developed new-onset generalized convulsive seizures (GCSs), which were poorly controlled by anticonvulsant polytherapy, early in the second trimester. A 6-cm lesion located in her left frontal supplementary motor area (SMA) was suspected as a grade III glioma, classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Due to the limited evidence on the use of adjuvant therapy during pregnancy, tumors causing neurological symptoms and seizures must be treated, in order to stabilize the maternal condition and enable a safe birth. In the case of pregnant patients, awake craniotomy using intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) is considered advantageous, achieving gross total resection with a reduction of direct cortical stimulation, which may induce seizure, and so reducing fetal exposure to anesthetics. The \\"Asleep-Awake-Asleep\\" technique was performed at 27 weeks and 2 days gestation. As use of propofol in pregnant patients is prohibited, general anesthesia was maintained through administration of sevoflurane and remifentanil until the first scan of iMRI, and was subsequently re-induced with dexmedetomidine when tumor removal had been accomplished. A supraglottic airway (SGA) was used until the patient's cranium was opened. There were no complications during either the procedure or the post-operative period. At 35 weeks gestation, the patient delivered a healthy baby of 2317 g. Pathological examination of the patient, revealed an anaplastic astrocytoma, thus radiotherapy and chemotherapy began 2 months post-delivery. There is no evidence of tumor recurrence in the patient and the child did not show any medical or developmental concerns at the point of the 17-month follow-up. Conclusions Since evidence on the use of adjuvant therapy during pregnancy is limited, extensive resection with functional monitoring is recommended if a brain tumor is presumed to be malignant. Awake craniotomy is considered advantageous to pregnant patients because subjective movement preserves the patient's motor function and reduces fetal exposure to anesthetics. Therefore, providing multidisciplinary discussion takes place within the decision-making process, as well as careful perioperative preparation, awake craniotomy should be considered, even in the case of pregnant patients.","output":"A case of left frontal high-grade glioma diagnosed during pregnancy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in December 2019; the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus previously never observed in humans.

The aim of this study was to investigate if an Innovative technique (reduced number of screws and injection of a beta-TCP additivated partially resorbable cement) provides the same or better stability of the reconstructed head compared to the Standard technique (using more screws). A four-fragment fracture was simulated in six pairs of humeri, with partial removal of the cancellous bone to simulate osteoporotic \\"eggshell\\" defect. One humerus of each pair was repaired with a Standard (locking plate, 2 cortical and 6 locking screws), and the other with the Innovative technique (same plate, 2 cortical and only 3 locking screws, plus cement injection). The reconstructed specimens were subjected to a biomechanical test where a cyclic force of increasing amplitude was applied axially until failure. The Innovative reconstructions withstood a force 3.49 times larger than the contralateral Standard reconstructions before failure started. The maximum force before final collapse for the Innovative reconstructions was 4.24 times larger than the contralateral Standard reconstructions. These differences were statistically significant. The Innovative reconstructions, based on fewer screws and beta-TCP additivated acrylic cement, showed positive results, demonstrating better biomechanical properties compared to the Standard reconstructions.

The objective of this study was to estimate the following:The average cost of a heart transplant procedure in a \\"real-world setting\\" in a private healthcare facility in India, with varying patient risk profiles.Identify the factors contributing to the wide variations in cost seen in practice.Finally, based on data thus collected, can some kind of estimation be made about the expected cost in a given patient before the operation is done? Methods The cost incurred by the hospital in doing 168 heart transplants during a 3-year period was analyzed. Costs were divided into direct and indirect costs. The direct costs consisted of medical consumables, laboratory investigations, radiology, costs involved in organ harvest and transport, and diet. Direct cost was 40 % of the total cost of the procedure and was used as a surrogate for total costing estimates. Results There was a wide variation in direct costs almost tenfold, ranging from INR 240,882 to 2403193 with a mean of 603755.The cost was affected by length of stay in the hospital, whether a patient survived or died and whether the patient died within 7 days of surgery or later. It was also affected by patient-specific factors like the INTERMACS status and preoperative creatinine levels. The average cost of the entire transplant procedure was INR 1459000. Conclusion There is a wide variation in the cost incurred by the hospital in doing transplants dictated to a large extent by patient risk profiles. A \\"One package fits all model\\" is unrealistic. The data pertains to the cost to the hospital and not the hospital bill and is therefore relevant to any health care facility, public or private.

The model considers four routes of introduction: human travel, legal trade of products, live animal imports and illegal import of bushmeat and was applied to five virus outbreak scenarios. Two scenarios were considered for Zaire ebolavirus (wEBOV, cEBOV) and other scenarios for Hendra virus, Marburg virus (MARV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The use of the same framework and generic data sources for all EU Member States (MS) allows for a relative comparison of the probability of virus introduction and of the importance of the routes of introduction among MSs. According to the model wEBOV posed the highest risk of an introduction event within the EU, followed by MARV and MERS-CoV. However, the main route of introduction differed, with wEBOV and MERS-CoV most likely through human travel and MARV through legal trade of foodstuffs.

The model has the capability to allow for a continual updating of the risk estimate using new data as, and when, it becomes available. The model provides an horizon scanning tool for use when available data are limited and, therefore, the absolute risk estimates often have high uncertainty. Sensitivity analysis suggested virus prevalence in bats has a large influence on the results; a 90% reduction in prevalence reduced the risk of introduction considerably and resulted in the relative ranking of MARV falling below that for MERS-CoV, due to this parameter disproportionately affecting the risk of introduction from the trade route over human travel.","output":"Application of a quantitative entry assessment model to compare the relative risk of incursion of zoonotic bat-borne viruses into European Union Member States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of delirium (DEL) among older patients living at home and periodically visited by their General Practitioners (GPs). DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: In Italy, programmed home visits by the GPs are regularly scheduled for their vulnerable and frail patients who are often on poly-drug regimens and suffering from dementia. PARTICIPANTS: N = 102 patients among those receiving programmed home visits by n = 6 GP based in the Brianza area (Lombardy). MEASUREMENTS: Patients were screened for delirium with the Italian version of the 4AT, with a score  4 considered as a positive indicator for DEL. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), the presence of dementia, and benzodiazepine (BZD) use were recorded. RESULTS: DEL+ was detected in almost half of the recruited sample (44.1%), and it was clearly associated with increased comorbidity and decreased motor abilities. Pre-existing dementia was documented in most of DEL+ patients (71.1%), while this was the case for only a minority of DEL- (5.2%, p < 0.00001). Analogously, BZD use was over-represented in the DEL+ group with respect to the DEL? one (73.3% vs. 22.8%, p < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: DEL prevalence as detected by GP during programmed home visits is surprisingly high, and related to motor impairment, comorbidities (among which dementia), and BZD use. DEL prompt recognition should be one of the goals of GP-programmed home visits, since this treatable and preventable condition is associated to an elevated burden of frailty and risk of death.","output":"Delirium in your house: a survey during General Practitioner-programmed home visits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Life style of people almost in every country has been changed with arrival of corona virus.

Fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common complication of RA. Whether MTX exposure increases the risk of ILD in patients with RA is disputed. We aimed to evaluate the association of prior MTX use with development of RA-ILD. METHODS: Through a case-control study design with discovery and international replication samples, we examined the association of MTX exposure with ILD in 410 patients with chronic fibrotic ILD associated with RA (RA-ILD) and 673 patients with RA without ILD. Estimates were pooled over the different samples using meta-analysis techniques. RESULTS: Analysis of the discovery sample revealed an inverse relationship between MTX exposure and RA-ILD (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.90; p=0.022), which was confirmed in the replication samples (pooled adjusted OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.19-0.79; p=0.009). The combined estimate using both the derivation and validation samples revealed an adjusted OR of 0.43 (95% CI, 0.26-0.69; p=0.0006). MTX ever users were less frequent among patients with RA-ILD compared to those without ILD, irrespective of chest high resolution computed tomography pattern. In patients with RA-ILD, ILD detection was significantly delayed in MTX ever users compared to never users (11.410.4a? years and 4.07.4a? years, respectively; p<0.001).

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are commonly prescribed for the prevention of acute exacerbations in people with COPD, but their use is associated with increased risk of respiratory infections. The effects of ICS on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or COVID-19 severity are currently unknown. Objectives: To determine the effects of ICS treatment on the bronchial epithelial cell expression of key SARS-CoV-2-related genes in volunteers with COPD. Methods: We performed a randomized, open-label, parallel treatment trial of 12 weeks treatment with ICS in combination with long-acting beta-agonist (formoterol/budesonide 12/400 g twice daily or salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 25/250 g twice daily), or treatment with LABA only (formoterol 12 g twice daily), in volunteers with mild to very severe COPD. We obtained bronchial epithelial cell samples via bronchoscopy before and after treatment, and determined transcriptome-wide gene expression by RNA sequencing. Main Results: 63 volunteers were randomized to receive treatment. Compared to formoterol alone, formoterol/budesonide treatment decreased the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor gene ACE2 and the host cell protease gene ADAM17. These genes were highly co-expressed with innate immune response genes, particularly those of the type I interferon and anti-viral response pathways, which also tended to decrease following ICS treatment. Conclusions: This is the first randomized controlled trial to show that ICS affect the expression of key SARS-CoV-2-related genes in COPD. Their relation to important anti-viral response genes may have critical implications for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or COVID-19 severity in this vulnerable population.","output":"Inhaled corticosteroids downregulate SARS-CoV-2-related gene expression in COPD: results from a RCT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We sought to identify optimal temporal windows for lockdown-based mitigation strategies on infectious disease spreads.

The resulting parameter values were used to simulate lockdown outcomes for a wide range of start times and durations. Lockdowns were simulated as intervention strategies that modified weights assigned to social contact matrices for work, school and other places. Lockdown efficacy was assessed by the maximum number of infections recorded during a simulation run. Our analysis shows that lockdown outcomes depend sensitively on the timing of imposition and that it is possible to minimize lockdown durations while limiting case loads to numbers below the hospitalization thresholds.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Single institution across 3 hospital sites during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patients who were intubated for respiratory wean tracheotomy underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR nasal, throat, and endotracheal tube swabs at the time of the procedure. These were assessed via quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. The tracheal tissue excised during the tracheotomy was cultured for SARS-CoV-2 with Vero E6 and Caco2 cells. Serum was assessed for antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 via neutralization assays. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included in this study. The mean number of days intubated prior to undergoing surgical tracheotomy was 27.8. At the time of the surgical tracheotomy, PCR swab testing yielded 8 positive results, but none of the 35 individuals who underwent tissue culture were positive for SARS-CoV-2. All 18 patients who had serum sampling demonstrated neutralization antibodies, with a minimum titer of 1:80. CONCLUSION: In our series, irrespective of positive PCR swab, the likelihood of infectivity during tracheotomy remains low given negative tracheal tissue cultures. While our results do not undermine national and international guidance on tracheotomy after day 10 of intubation, given the length of time to procedure in our data, infectivity at 10 days cannot be excluded.

METHODS This retrospective clinical study of prospectively collected data will assess hepatic resections performed by a single surgeon between 2005 and 2013, with the introduction of the two haemostatic techniques in 2009. RESULTS A total of 371 hepatic resections (214 from 2005 to 2008 and 157 from 2009 to 2013) were included in this study. Compared with the conventional hepatic resection (2005-2008), the use of haemostatic techniques (2009-2013) significantly reduced the need for inflow occlusion (OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.24-0.57, P < 0.001), overall occlusion time (20.8 min versus 25.9 min, P = 0.04) and transfusion requirement (4.6% versus 12%, OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.14-0.90, P = 0.02). Mean overall blood loss was reduced post-2009; however, the decrease was not statistically different (401.3 mL versus 470.8 mL, P = 0.27). Subgroup analysis revealed that blood loss was more than halved post-2009 compared with pre-2009 for patients who received pre-operative chemotherapy (324.6 mL versus 738.5 mL, P = 0.005).

Denoising using deep learning reconstruction (Advanced Intelligent Clear-IQ Engine [AiCE]) has been reported for CT and MR. The purpose of this study was to compare the contrast-to-noise ratio of endolymph to perilymph (CNREP) between the improved hybrid of reversed image of the positive endolymph signal and the native image of the perilymph signal multiplied with the heavily T2-weighted MR cisternography (iHYDROPS-Mi2) images, which used AiCE for the three source images (i.e. positive endolymph image [PEI], positive perilymph image [PPI], MR cisternography [MRC]) to those that did not use AiCE. We also examined if there was a difference between iHYDROPS-Mi2 images with and without AiCE for degree of visual grading of EH and in endolymphatic area [EL] ratios. METHODS Nine patients with suspicion of EH were imaged on a 3T MR scanner. iHYDROPS images were generated by subtraction of PEI images from PPI images. iHYDROPS-Mi2 images were then generated by multiplying MRC with iHYDROPS images. The CNREP and EL ratio were measured on the iHYDROPS-Mi2 images. Degree of radiologist visual grading for EH was evaluated. RESULTS Mean CNREP  standard deviation was 1681.8  845.2 without AiCE and 7738.6  5149.2 with AiCE (P = 0.00002). There was no significant difference in EL ratio for images with and without AiCE. Radiologist grading for EH agreed completely between the 2 image types in both the cochlea and vestibule.

Methods and Results: All ACS admissions during the COVID-19 lockdown (10 March to 4 May, 2020), in 3 municipalities (3 spoke, and 1 hub hospital), in Southwestern Greece (411,576 inhabitants), were prospectively recorded and compared to the equivalent periods during 2018, and 2019. A telephone survey of 1014 participants was conducted to explore the lifestyle habits of citizens aged 35-years-old before and during lockdown. The median ACS incidence rate decreased from 19.0 cases per week in 2018 and 21.5 in 2019 down to 13.0 in 2020 (RR: 0.66 during the Covid-19 lockdown; 95%CI: 0.53C0.82; P = 0.0002). This was driven by a significant reduction of admissions for Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) (RR: 0.68; 95%CI: 0.52C0.88; P = 0.0037), mainly in patients with a lower burden of cardiovascular risk factors, as we noticed an inverse association between the reduction of the incidence of ACS during the Covid-19 lockdown period and the number of registered patient risk factors. There was no difference in the rates of STEMI and population-based all-cause mortality across the examined time periods. The telephone survey demonstrated reduction of passive smoking, working hours, alcohol, junk food and salt consumption, and an increase in sleeping hours, mainly in participants with a lower burden of cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusions: A significant decline in ACS admissions during the COVID-19 lockdown was noted, affecting mainly NSTEMI patients with a lower burden of cardiovascular risk factors. This was accompanied by significant lifestyle changes. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that to some extend the latter might be associated with the observed decline in ACS admissions.","output":"Potential Relationship Between Lifestyle Changes and Incidence of Hospital Admissions for Acute Coronary Syndrome During the COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Revisional surgery is becoming a common and challenging practice in bariatric centers. The aim of this study was to evaluate resectional one anastomosis gastric bypass/mini gastric bypass (R-OAGB/MGB) as a revisional procedure. Methods From January 2016 to February 2017, data on 21 consecutive patients undergoing R-OAGB/MGB for weight loss failure after primary restrictive procedures were prospectively collected and analysed. Results Mean age was 39  12 years (18-65), and 11 (52.3%) were women. The mean operative time was 96.4  20.9 min (range, 122-80), and the mean postoperative stay was 47.8  7.4 hours (range, 36-73). There were no deaths and no procedure-related complications. The mean body mass index (BMI) decreased from 42.9  6.5 at the time of R-OAGB/MGB to 28.5  4 at the 12-month follow-up.

Lately, the application of bisphosphonates (bis) in order to optimize bone healing has become a topic of great interest. N-containing bis, such as alendronate (ALN), are the more potent drugs of this class. It was the aim of this study to determine the effect of ALN on the osseointegration of a well-documented nanotreated implant system in a rabbit femoral condyle model. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-two adult female New Zealand White rabbits received one implant (3.25 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length) in their left femoral condyle, a week after they were ovariectomized. Half of them were saline treated (control, group A) and the other half were ALN treated (group B). Rabbits from both groups were euthanized after 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. RESULTS The specimens were evaluated histologically and histomorphometrically. Upon histological evaluation, no obvious differences were found between the control and the treatment group. Implants showed good integration into the bone tissue surrounding them. There were also no statistically significant differences in bone-to-implant contact and the amount of bone tissue in the immediate neighborhood of the implant at both healing periods. CONCLUSIONS The systemic administration of ALN was not found to affect histological osseointegration of implants in animals with a hormonal status resembling that of postmenopausal healthy women.

In the present work, we have elucidated the mechanism of binding of two inhibitors, namely -ketoamide and Z31792168, to SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro) or 3CL(pro)) by using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations. We calculated the total binding free energy (G(bind)) of both inhibitors and further decomposed G(bind) into various forces governing the complex formation using the Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) method. Our calculations reveal that -ketoamide is more potent (G(bind)= ? 9.05 kcal/mol) compared to Z31792168 (G(bind)= ? 3.25 kcal/mol) against COVID-19 3CL(pro). The increase in G(bind) for -ketoamide relative to Z31792168 arises due to an increase in the favorable electrostatic and van der Waals interactions between the inhibitor and 3CL(pro). Further, we have identified important residues controlling the 3CL(pro)-ligand binding from per-residue based decomposition of the binding free energy. Finally, we have compared G(bind) of these two inhibitors with the anti-HIV retroviral drugs, such as lopinavir and darunavir. It is observed that -ketoamide is more potent compared to lopinavir and darunavir. In the case of lopinavir, a decrease in van der Waals interactions is responsible for the lower binding affinity compared to -ketoamide. On the other hand, in the case of darunavir, a decrease in the favorable intermolecular electrostatic and van der Waals interactions contributes to lower affinity compared to -ketoamide. Our study might help in designing rational anti-coronaviral drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

However, heavily relying on the normal images may cause the model training to overfit the normal class. Self-supervised pre-training is an effective solution to this problem. Unfortunately, current self-supervision methods adapted from computer vision are sub-optimal for MIA applications because they do not explore MIA domain knowledge for designing the pretext tasks or the training process. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised pre-training method for UAD designed for MIA applications, named Multi-class Strong Augmentation via Contrastive Learning (MSACL). MSACL is based on a novel optimisation to contrast normal and multiple classes of synthetised abnormal images, with each class enforced to form a tight and dense cluster in terms of Euclidean distance and cosine similarity, where abnormal images are formed by simulating a varying number of lesions of different sizes and appearance in the normal images. In the experiments, we show that our MSACL pre-training improves the accuracy of SOTA UAD methods on many MIA benchmarks using colonoscopy, fundus screening and Covid-19 Chest X-ray datasets.","output":"Self-supervised Multi-class Pre-training for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Segmentation in Medical Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY DESIGN: An exploratory descriptive study was conducted.

SETTING: Acute care hospital settings in Canada. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with physical and occupational therapists, licensed in Canada, who worked in an acute care neurological setting with individuals with spinal cord injury or disease (SCI/D). To analyze the data, interpretive description was used. NVivo 12 was used for data management. RESULTS: Five physical therapists and two occupational therapists were interviewed (n = 7). Two therapists declined after reading a description of the study.

Throughout these themes, therapists referred to dosage as a limiting factor affecting ABT delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Our research reveals that implementing ABT in an acute care setting is challenging considering the high dosage of movement practice required for ABT.

These DAVFs were embolized with Onyx through the middle meningeal artery or the occipital artery. We reviewed the occurrence of reflux into the arteries of carotid or vertebral origin. RESULTS In all the cases, reflux occurred into the first millimeters of the DAVF arterial feeders arising from carotid or vertebral arteries but slowly enough to be controlled by interruption of Onyx injection. Reflux was always minimal and Onyx never reached the ostium of the arteries. No cerebral ischemic complications occurred in our series. CONCLUSION The behavior of Onyx is clearly different from that of cyanoacrylate glue, resulting in superior control during injection.

As part of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS), a national longitudinal study of health and well-being, subjects (N = 265) (i) completed a phone-based interview that assessed generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder symptoms at enrollment, (ii) participated in a one-week actigraphy study 9-14 years later, and (iii) completed a long-term follow-up, phone-based interview to quantify generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder symptoms 17-18 years from initial enrollment. A deep auto-encoder paired with a multi-layered ensemble deep learning model was leveraged to predict whether participants experienced increased anxiety disorder symptoms across this 17-18 year period. RESULTS Out-of-sample cross-validated results suggested that wearable movement data could significantly predict which individuals would experience symptom deterioration (AUC = 0.696, CI [0.598, 0.793], 84.6% sensitivity, 52.7% specificity, balanced accuracy = 68.7%).

As pregnant women began to present for delivery while sick with COVID-19, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) convened a writing group in March 2020 to develop guidance for the management of their newborns. The initial guidance was developed emergently and was forced to rely on extremely limited data from China. The initial guidance advocated for a conservative approach that included temporary physical separation of infected mother and newborn. To address the knowledge deficit, the AAP sponsored a volunteer registry to collect data on perinatal infection and management. As data have emerged informing the natural history of COVID-19, the performance of PCR-based diagnostics, the value of infection control measures and the risk of infant disease, AAP has issued serial updates to newborn guidance.

Guatemala has one of the world's highest levels of stunting despite sustained commitment to international nutrition policy best-practices endorsed by the Scaling Up Nutrition movement (SUN). Our objective was to use Guatemala as a case study by projecting the impact of a recently published national nutrition policy, the Great Crusade, that is consistent with SUN principles. Methods: We used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) to project the scaling-up of nutrition interventions proposed in the Great Crusade and recommended by SUN. Our outcomes were changes in stunting prevalence, number of stunting cases averted, and number of cases averted by intervention in children under five years of age from 2020-2030. We considered four scenarios: (1) intervention coverage continues based on historical trends, (2) coverage targets in the Great Crusade are achieved, (3) coverage targets in the Great Crusade are achieved with reduced fertility risk, and (4) coverage reaches an aspirational level. Results: All scenarios led to modest reductions in stunting prevalence. In 2024, stunting prevalence was estimated to change by -0.1{per thousand} (95{per thousand} CI 0.0{per thousand} to -0.2{per thousand}) if historical trends continue, -1.1{per thousand} (95{per thousand} CI -0.8{per thousand} to -1.5{per thousand}) in the Great Crusade scenario, and -2.2{per thousand} (95{per thousand} CI -1.6{per thousand} to -3.0{per thousand}) in the aspirational scenario. In 2030, we projected a stunting prevalence of -0.4{per thousand} (95{per thousand} CI -0.2{per thousand} to -0.8{per thousand}) and -3.7{per thousand} (95{per thousand} CI -2.8{per thousand} to -5.1{per thousand}) in the historical trends and aspirational scenario, respectively.

In this study, the aim was to determine the reasons for vaccine hesitation among HCWs working in a large public hospital and its affiliated units in Istanbul. METHODS: A descriptive method for collecting qualitative data was designed for this study. The data of the HCWs were analyzed in line with the vaccine hesitancy factors put forward by the World Health Organization (WHO). RESULTS: The most important vaccine hesitancy theme that emerged was the fear and lack of confidence in the vaccines, which was expressed at a higher rate than any other theme in all HCWs. The most cited reason for fear/lack of confidence in the vaccine was the fear of its side effects. It was observed that the HCWs who reported hesitation about vaccination due to pregnancy and breastfeeding consisted of women. The second most common theme for vaccine hesitation was reported as an inconvenience in accessing the vaccines. Although HCWs have priority, they stated that their reason for vaccine hesitancy was due to heavy personal issues or workloads. The final theme was about complacency, or thinking they do not need the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine hesitation is a challenge that can be overcome with detailed monitoring and policy-making. Although the vaccine seems to be more significant, we do not want to see vaccine hesitancy grow more than the vaccine itself.","output":"Vaccine Hesitancy of Health-Care Workers: Another Challenge in the Fight Against COVID-19 in Istanbul"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Routine molecular diagnostic testing by our laboratory, based on using a primer pair with conservative binding sites on the spike glycoprotein coding sequence, has indicated the recurring of a unique phylogenetic cluster of chicken infectious bronchitis viruses (IBV) in the Middle East since 2010. The nearly full-length S1 subunit of the spike gene phylogeny of selected strains, however, split up this grouping, suggesting potential recombination in the S1 gene. In order to clarify this, various bioinformatic analyses of the strains were carried out, which confirmed this supposition. Two patterns of recombination were found among the strains, one of which could also be identified in GenBank-deposited IBV sequences from the region. These findings demonstrate that IBV strains of different recombinant patterns occur simultaneously in the same geographic region and could circulate for an extended period of time, thus contributing to the knowledge on IBV evolution.","output":"Successive occurrence of recombinant infectious bronchitis virus strains in restricted area of Middle East"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cell development from an undifferentiated stem cell to a differentiated one is essential in forming an organism.

By developing to a differentiated cell, the gene expression in more order, which is the cause of losing pluripotency. In this model, the chaotic dynamics of gene expression in the stem cells become ordered during the developments. Various patterns and bifurcation points can be seen during development. The bifurcation points and their predictions during the process of cell development are studied in this paper. Some well-known critical slowing down indicators are used to show the variations of slowness during the cells development and predict the bifurcation points.

However, wearing masks to prevent the spread of viruses such as COVID-19 involves obscuring a large portion of the face. Do the eyes carry sufficient information to allow for the accurate perception of emotions in dynamic expressions obscured by masks? What about the perception of the meanings of specific smiles? We addressed these questions in two studies. In the first, participants saw dynamic expressions of happiness, disgust, anger, and surprise that were covered by N95, surgical, or cloth masks or were uncovered and rated the extent to which the expressions conveyed each of the same four emotions. Across conditions, participants perceived significantly lower levels of the expressed (target) emotion in masked faces, and this was particularly true for expressions composed of more facial action in the lower part of the face. Higher levels of other (non-target) emotions were also perceived in masked expressions. In the second study, participants rated the extent to which three categories of smiles (reward, affiliation, and dominance) conveyed positive feelings, reassurance, and superiority, respectively. Masked smiles communicated less of the target signal than unmasked smiles, but not more of other possible signals. The present work extends recent studies of the effects of masked faces on the perception of emotion in its novel use of dynamic facial expressions (as opposed to still images) and the investigation of different types of smiles.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 602 participants completed an online questionnaire, shared via social networks, between November 20 and December 20, 2020. Pre-pandemic sexual intercourse frequency, International Erectile Dysfunction Index (IIEF-15) score, intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT) score, and activities during sexual intercourse were compared to the ones during the pandemic. In addition, the effects of various variables on participants' sexual functions were evaluated and analyzed according to age groups. RESULTS The mean number of weekly sexual intercourse during the pandemic was 1.7+1.7, which was significantly lower than in the pre-pandemic period (p < 0.001). The ED score was significantly lower during the pandemic (p < 0.001) compared to the pre-pandemic period, however orgasmic function (p = 0.016), sexual intercourse satisfaction (p < 0.001), general satisfaction (p < 0.001), and PEDT scores (p = 0.004) were significantly higher. There was no significant difference in IELT before and during the pandemic (p = 0.391). Full-time employment and low education level were risk factors for developing ED and PE. The negative affect of the pandemic on sexual life was most prominent in the > 65 age group. Although kissing, oral and anal sex, and face-to-face sex positions decreased during the pandemic in all age groups, kissing and face-to-face sex positions remained the most preferred sexual behavior pattern (p = 0.002). There was no reduction in risky sexual behavior in the majority of the participants. CONCLUSIONS At the end of one year with COVID-19, a decrease in erectile function and an increase in PE incidence were observed in men. Despite this, there was an increase in sexual desire and satisfaction.

More evidence is needed to guide patient selection, timing of high-flow nasal cannula initiation, and resource allocation. We aimed to assess time to discharge and time to death in severe coronavirus disease 2019 in patients treated with high-flow nasal cannula compared with matched controls. We also evaluated the ability of the respiratory rate-oxygenation ratio to predict progression to invasive mechanical ventilation. DESIGN: Time-dependent propensity score matching was used to create pairs of individuals who were then analyzed in a Cox proportional-hazards regression model to estimate high-flow nasal cannulas effect on time to discharge and time to death. A secondary analysis excluded high-flow nasal cannula patients intubated within 6 hours of admission. A Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used to assess risk of invasive mechanical ventilation among high-flow nasal cannula patients stratified by respiratory rate-oxygenation. SETTING: The five hospitals of the Johns Hopkins Health System. PATIENTS: All patients who were admitted with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 were eligible for inclusion. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: High-flow nasal cannula was associated with longer median time to discharge: 10.6 days (interquartile range, 7.1C15.8 d) versus 7.8 days (interquartile range, 4.9C12.1 d). Respiratory rate-oxygenation index performed poorly in predicting ventilation or death. In the primary analysis, there was no significant association between high-flow nasal cannula and hazard of death (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.57C1.09). Excluding patients intubated within 6 hours of admission, high-flow nasal cannula was associated with reduced hazard of death (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45C0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Among unselected patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia, high-flow nasal cannula was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in hazard of death.

It is critical to explore patient factors that drive telemedicine use to recognize any disparities in healthcare access that may emerge with remote healthcare. Our objective was to compare the characteristics and subsequent health care utilization of gynecologic oncology patients who had a scheduled telemedicine visit from 3/23/20-5/18/20. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of women whose scheduled in-person office visits were converted to telemedicine. Video visits were encouraged and telephone visits were the default option. We compared patient factors between women who cancelled versus those who completed their telemedicine visits. Subsequent health care utilization included in-person office appointments, emergency department (ED) or operative care was compared between those who cancelled versus completed telemedicine visits. We also evaluated patient differences in completion of video vs telephone visits. Cancellation rates were compared to a historical control of in-person gynecologic oncology office visits (3/23- 5/18/19). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess odds of completing a telehealth appointment. Results: Of the 185 women with scheduled telemedicine visits, 158 (85%) completed and 27 (15%) cancelled. Telemedicine had significantly higher cancellations compared to office visits a year ago, 15% vs. 3% (p<0.001). Women who completed telemedicine visits tended to be older than those who cancelled (p=0.008). No other patient characteristics differed between those who completed versus cancelled telemedicine visits, and no differences were observed in subsequent health care utilization between groups. A total of 30% of patients had not activated their electronic patient portals prior to the study period. 124 (75%) of women had telephone visits. Being employed and a new, rather than established patient, was associated with video visits, p=0.009 and 0.003, respectively. In univariate analyses, older patients (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.93, 0.99) and Medicare insurance (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05, 0.90) were less likely to cancel a visit. No patient characteristics were associated with visit cancellation in multivariate analyses. Conclusions: Telemedicine implementation faces ongoing challenges. High cancellation rates and patient's reluctance to use video or activate their electronic patient portals may limit a durable telemedicine platform. No patient characteristics were associated with the successful completion of telemedicine visits, and completion of telemedicine visits was not associated with subsequent healthcare utilization.

Furthermore, in genetically identical, cohoused mice infected with the same viral bolus, the same model can predict the lethality of individual animals but, intriguingly, only within a specific time window that overlapped with the early effector phase of adaptive immunity.

We aimed to evaluate these criteria for the assessment of GERD and to measure interassessor agreement. METHODS We performed a post hoc analysis of data from the Diamond study (NCT 00291746), conducted in Europe and Canada on adults with frequent upper gastrointestinal symptoms who had not taken a proton pump inhibitor in the previous 2 months. GERD was diagnosed based on the presence of 1 or more of the following: reflux esophagitis, pathologic esophageal acid exposure, and/or positive symptom-acid association probability. Nonerosive reflux disease was defined as the presence of pathologic esophageal acid exposure and/or a positive symptom-acid association probability, but no reflux esophagitis. Biopsies collected from 336 patients from 0.5 cm and 2.0 cm above the Z line were evaluable; they were analyzed independently at pathology centers in Germany and Italy (biopsies from 258 and 195 patients, respectively). The primary outcomes were the accuracy of histologic criteria for the diagnosis of GERD, defined by endoscopy and pH monitoring, and interassessor agreement on histologic criteria. RESULTS At the assessment site for basal cell layer thickness, total epithelial thickness was the best-performing criterion for diagnosis of investigation-defined GERD; it also identified nonerosive reflux disease, reflux esophagitis, and pathologic esophageal acid exposure at 0.5 cm and 2.0 cm above the Z line. Basal cell layer thickness and presence of dilated intercellular spaces did not identify patients with GERD. Among the criteria tested, the best agreement between assessments carried out at the 2 pathology centers was for total epithelial thickness at 0.5 cm and 2.0 cm above the Z line.

Firstly, tick data collected at the national (United Kingdom) or state (Minnesota, USA) level were sufficient to determine seasonal occurrence and distribution patterns of important tick species, and were able to corroborate and complement known trends in tick distribution. Importantly, tick species with expanding distributions (Haemaphysalis punctata in the UK, and Amblyomma americanum in Minnesota) were also detected.

This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of burnout among unmatched trainees and residents in surgical and nonsurgical specialties in Palestine. Additionally, this study also sought to identify the associated variables and predictors of higher burnout scores. METHODS: This study was conducted in a cross-sectional design using a questionnaire in the period between October 2020 and March 2021. The questionnaire collected sociodemographic characteristics of the residents and trainees in 18 different training centers/hospitals. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory was used to determine burnout among the residents and trainees. Pearsons correlations, analysis of variance, Students t-test, and multiple linear regressions were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The study tool was completed by 250 residents and trainees in surgical and nonsurgical specialties (response rate = 83.3%). Of all participants, 203 (81.2%) reported a moderate-severe degree of burnout in the personal domain, 188 (75.2%) reported a moderate-severe degree of burnout in the work-related domain, and 97 (38.8%) reported moderate-severe degree of burnout in the client-related domain. There was a moderate and positive correlation between personal and work-related burnout scores (Pearsons r = 0.69, p-value < 0.001), and client-related burnout scores (Pearsons r = 0.52, p-value < 0.001). Similarly, there was a moderate and positive correlation between work-related and client-related burnout scores (Pearsons r = 0.57, p-value < 0.001). The multiple linear regression model showed that higher burnout scores were predicted by being married, not having another paid employment, inability to financially support oneself, frequent consumption of tea/coffee, dissatisfied with the training/job, thinking to change the profession, and long working hours. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicated that burnout was highly prevalent among residents and trainees in surgical and nonsurgical specialties in Palestine. Decision-makers in healthcare authorities, hospital managers, professional groups, directors of residency programs, and educators/trainers should consider addressing burnout and improving the well-being of residents and trainees in surgical and nonsurgical specialties in Palestine.

This study investigates the impact of botanical disinfectants on indoor air chemistry and human exposure. Controlled surface disinfection experiments were conducted in a mechanically ventilated zero-energy tiny house laboratory. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and aerosol size distributions were measured in real-time (1 Hz) with a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer and a high-resolution electrical low-pressure impactor, respectively. Botanical disinfectant spray and wipe products drove sudden changes in the chemical composition of indoor air. Mixing ratios of monoterpenes (C10H16) and monoterpenoids (C10H14O, C10H16O, C10H18O, and C10H20O) increased suddenly during the disinfection events (10-1 to 102 ppb) and exhibited volatility-dependent temporal emission profiles. VOC emission factors ranged from 100 to 104 g g-1, and thymol intake fractions ranged from 6 to 7  103 ppm. Rapid new particle formation events were observed due to ozonolysis of monoterpenes and monoterpenoids, increasing sub-100 nm particle number concentrations by 104 to 105 cm-3.

The presence of comorbidities prolongs the recovery time. The recovery in patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms might take 10 days, while in those with a critical illness or immunocompromised status could take 15 days. Considering the lack of data about predictors that could affect the recovery time, we conducted this study to identify them. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was implemented in the COVID-19 clinic of a teaching and referral university hospital in Tehran. Patients with the highly suggestive symptoms who had computed tomography (CT) imaging results with typical findings of COVID-19 or positive results of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were enrolled in the study. Inpatient and outpatient COVID-19 participants were followed up by regular visits or phone calls, and the recovery period was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 478 patients were enrolled. The mean age of patients was 54.11  5.65 years, and 44.2% were female. The median time to recovery was 13.5 days (IQR: 9). Although in the bivariate analysis, multiple factors, including hypertension, fever, diabetes mellitus, gender, and admission location, significantly contributed to prolonging the recovery period, in multivariate analysis, only dyspnea had a significant association with this variable (p = 0.02, the adjusted OR of 2.05; 95% CI 1.12-3.75).

We developed risk prediction models to identify patients with low risk for COVID-19 from this cohort of hospitalised patients with acute respiratory symptoms. METHODS: This was a single-centre retrospective observational study. Patients admitted to our institution's respiratory surveillance wards from 10 February to 30 April 2020 contributed data for analysis. Prediction models for COVID-19 were derived from a training cohort using variables based on demographics, clinical symptoms, exposure risks and blood investigations fitted into logistic regression models. The derived prediction models were subsequently validated on a test cohort. RESULTS: Of the 1,228 patients analysed, 52 (4.2%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Two prediction models were derived, the first based on age, presence of sore throat, dormitory residence, blood haemoglobin level (Hb), and total white blood cell counts (TW), and the second based on presence of headache, contact with infective patients, Hb and TW. Both models had good diagnostic performance with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.934 and 0.866, respectively. Risk score cut-offs of 0.6 for Model 1 and 0.2 for Model 2 had 100% sensitivity, allowing identification of patients with low risk for COVID-19. Limiting COVID-19 screening to only elevated-risk patients reduced the number of isolation days for surveillance patients by up to 41.7% and COVID-19 swab testing by up to 41.0%.

In response, many countries have implemented non pharmaceutical methods of intervention, such as social distancing and lockdowns. This study aims to investigate the relationship of four dimensions of social capital (community attachment, social trust, family bond, and security) and several control variables with COVID-19 deaths. METHODS: We retrieved data from open access databases and a survey. COVID-19 death-related data were collected from the website \\"Centre for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University\\". Social capital-related data were collected from a large-scale survey that included web-based and face-to-face surveys covering 100,956 respondents across all regions/provinces/states of 37 countries in 2017. Data regarding population density, number of hospital beds, and population aged 65 or older were retrieved from the World Development Indicators (WDIs). Data on country lockdowns were obtained from the website \\"National responses to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic\\". Linear regressions were applied to identify the relationship between social capital and COVID-19 deaths. RESULTS: We found that COVID-19 deaths were associated with social capital both positively and negatively. Community attachment and social trust were associated with more COVID-19 deaths, and family bond and security were associated with fewer deaths. COVID-19 deaths were positively associated with population density, ageing population, and interactions between four dimensions of social capital-related factors and the ageing population. Furthermore, the number of hospital beds and early lockdown policy were negatively associated with COVID-19 deaths.

METHODS We performed a comprehensive literature search of major databases (from inception to November 2020) to identify studies which assess the incidence and risk of HCC following bariatric surgery. Pooled data were assessed using a random-effects model expressed in terms of odds ratio (OR), incidence rate ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS Nine studies (two abstracts and seven full texts) were included for meta-analysis which involved 19 514 750 patients (18 423 546 controls and 1 091 204 bariatric patients). Pooled unadjusted odds ratio (OR) was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.28-0.57) which favoured bariatric surgery, though with high heterogeneity (I2 : 79%). Using an adjusted model derived from matched cohorts (five studies) yielded an OR of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.53-0.75) with moderate heterogeneity (I2 : 38%).

Primary AI (PAI) is rare and is caused by direct adrenal failure. Secondary AI (SAI) is more frequent and is caused by diseases affecting the pituitary, whereas in tertiary AI (TAI), the hypothalamus is affected. The most prevalent form is TAI owing to exogenous glucocorticoid use. Symptoms of AI are non-specific, often overlooked or misdiagnosed, and are related to the lack of cortisol, adrenal androgen precursors and aldosterone (especially in PAI). Diagnosis is based on measurement of the adrenal corticosteroid hormones, their regulatory peptide hormones and stimulation tests. The goal of therapy is to establish a hormone replacement regimen that closely mimics the physiological diurnal cortisol secretion pattern, tailored to the patient's daily needs. This Primer provides insights into the epidemiology, mechanisms and management of AI during pregnancy as well as challenges of long-term management. In addition, the importance of identifying life-threatening adrenal emergencies (acute AI and adrenal crisis) is highlighted and strategies for prevention, which include patient education, glucocorticoid emergency cards and injection kits, are described.","output":"Adrenal insufficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUD Cancer stemness is associated with metastases in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and negatively correlates with immune infiltrates. Recent stemness evaluation methods based on the absolute expression have been proposed to reveal the relationship between stemness and cancer. However, we found that existing methods do not perform well in assessing the stemness of KIRC patients, and they overlooked the impact of alternative splicing. Alternative splicing not only progresses during the differentiation of stem cells, but also changes during the acquisition of the stemness features of cancer stem cells. There is an urgent need for a new method to predict KIRC-specific stemness more accurately, so as to provide help in selecting treatment options. METHODS The corresponding RNA-Seq data were obtained from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal. We also downloaded stem cell RNA sequence data from the Progenitor Cell Biology Consortium (PCBC) Synapse Portal. Independent validation sets with large sample size and common clinic pathological characteristics were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. we constructed a KIRC-specific stemness prediction model using an algorithm called one-class logistic regression based on the expression and alternative splicing data to predict stemness indices of KIRC patients, and the model was externally validated. We identify stemness-associated alternative splicing events (SASEs) by analyzing different alternative splicing event between high- and low- stemness groups. Univariate Cox and multivariable logistic regression analysisw as carried out to detect the prognosis-related SASEs respectively. The area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was performed to evaluate the predictive values of our model. RESULTS Here, we constructed a KIRC-specific stemness prediction model with an AUC of 0.968,and to provide a user-friendly interface of our model for KIRC stemness analysis, we have developed KIRC Stemness Calculator and Visualization (KSCV), hosted on the Shiny server, can most easily be accessed via web browser and the url https://jiang-lab.shinyapps.io/kscv/ . When applied to 605 KIRC patients, our stemness indices had a higher correlation with the gender, smoking history and metastasis of the patients than the previous stemness indices, and revealed intratumor heterogeneity at the stemness level. We identified 77 novel SASEs by dividing patients into high- and low- stemness groups with significantly different outcome and they had significant correlations with expression of 17 experimentally validated splicing factors. Both univariate and multivariate survival analysis demonstrated that SASEs closely correlated with the overall survival of patients. CONCLUSIONS Basing on the stemness indices, we found that not only immune infiltration but also alternative splicing events showed significant different at the stemness level. More importantly, we highlight the critical role of these differential alternative splicing events in poor prognosis, and we believe in the potential for their further translation into targets for immunotherapy.","output":"Alternative splicing associated with cancer stemness in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Os servi?os de alimenta??o est?o cada vez mais presentes no cotidiano das pessoas, j que oferecem refei??es de rpida aquisi??o e consumo.

To date, treatment of severe COVID-19 is far from clear. Therefore, it is urgent to develop an effective option for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Most patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit markedly increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interferon (IFN)-, IFN-, and interleukin (IL)-1. Immunotherapeutic strategies have an important role in the suppression of cytokine storm and respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search in the literature was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, as well as Google Scholar preprint database using all available MeSH terms for Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, anti-rheumatoid agents, COVID-19, cytokine storm, immunotherapeutic drugs, IFN, interleukin, JAK/STAT inhibitors, MCP, MIP, TNF. RESULTS: Here, we first review common complications of COVID-19 patients, particularly neurological symptoms. We next explain host immune responses against COVID-19 particles. Finally, we summarize the existing experimental and clinical immunotherapeutic strategies, particularly anti-rheumatoid agents and also plasma (with a high level of gamma globulin) therapy for severe COVID-19 patients. We discuss both their therapeutic effects and side effects that should be taken into consideration for their clinical application. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that immunosuppressants, such as anti-rheumatoid drugs, could be considered as a potential approach for the treatment of cytokine storm in severe cases of COVID-19. One possible limitation of immunosuppressant therapy is their inhibitory effects on host anti-viral immune response. So, the appropriate timing of administration should be carefully considered.","output":"Pharmacological mechanism of immunomodulatory agents for the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Improved understanding of the psychosocial effects of prominent ears has led to increased intervention in early school-aged children. Cartilage-sparing otoplasty procedures are commonly used in this population, given the effectiveness of sutures in remodeling the pliable pediatric ear. In addition to their efficacy, another advantage of these techniques is their low overall complication rates, with complications beyond 3 months being particularly uncommon. We present the clinical case of a 5-year-old female patient who experienced wound dehiscence 9 months after her cartilage-sparing otoplasty. Before experiencing her atypical complication, she had been wearing an ear-looped mask daily to comply with guidelines developed to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools. The use of masks would previously not have been a concern in this age group, but given the longevity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the importance of masking as a public health tool, this needs to be a consideration for otoplasty patients going forward. Pressure and friction on an immature surgical scar impede healing and expose the patient to increased risk of complications. Therefore, we discuss options for decreasing exposure to COVID-19 and complying with local face-covering policies while avoiding the direct contact associated with traditional ear-looped masks. Additionally, we explore the role permanent suture material may have played in predisposing our patient to mask-related irritation.","output":"Pulling Strings: Otoplasty Complicated by Wound Dehiscence in the Setting of Prolonged Mask Wearing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colon capsule endoscopy is a wireless and minimally invasive technique for visualization of the whole colon.

Antiplatelet resistance negates the protective effects of antiplatelet medication, leading to a higher incidence of ischemic events. A possible link between antiplatelet hyper-response and increased hemorrhagic complications has been inadequately investigated. We aimed to examine the correlation between antiplatelet hyper-response and the risk of hemorrhagic complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients who were treated with antiplatelet medications and underwent neurointerventional procedures were prospectively recruited. We collected the following data: demographics, vascular risk factors, antiplatelet and anticoagulation treatment, antiplatelet responsiveness, coagulation profile, and hemorrhagic complications. P2Y12 receptor-mediated platelet inhibition was tested by using the VerifyNow assay device. The primary end points were postprocedural major and minor hemorrhagic complications. Receiver operator characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the percentage of platelet inhibition as a diagnostic tool for bleeding events. The association between hemorrhage and percentage of platelet inhibition was investigated by using logistic regression modeling. RESULTS Forty-seven patients were enrolled. The mean age was 5612 years, and 28% were men. Ten patients (21.3%) developed hemorrhagic complications. Clopidogrel response was higher in patients with a major bleeding complication compared with those with minor or no bleeding (median, 94% versus 24% platelet inhibition; P=.0084). Of the 7 patients (14.9%) defined as hyper-responders with 72% platelet inhibition, 42.8% had a major bleeding complication. CONCLUSIONS Hyper-response to clopidogrel is associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic complications. Larger studies are urgently needed to validate a clinically useful threshold to define clopidogrel hyper-response and to examine the clinical effects of antiplatelet dosage adjustment.","output":"Clopidogrel hyper-response and bleeding risk in neurointerventional procedures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media use in public health and other health related research applications has seen a rapid increase in recent years.

PAPS was assigned based on categories of high, moderate, or low risk, consistent with the American College of Surgeons priority system. MeNTS scores were calculated. The primary outcome was delay to surgery. Descriptive statistics were performed, and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) values were calculated for PAPS and MeNTS. RESULTS: Of 146 patients included, 68% (n=100) were female; the median age was 60 years (IQR:43,67). Mean delay to surgery was significantly shorter (p=0.01) in patients with high PAPS (35 days), compared with moderate (61 days) and low (79 days) PAPS groups. MeNTS scores were provided for 105 patients and were analyzed by diagnosis. Patients with benign thyroid disease (n=17) had a significantly higher MeNTS score than patients with thyroid disease which was malignant/suspicious for malignancy (n=44) patients (51.5 vs. 47.6, p=0.034). Higher PAPS correlated well with a delay to surgery of <30 days (AUC: 0.72). MeNTS score did not correlate well with delay to surgery <30 days (AUC: 0.52). CONCLUSION: PAPS better predicted delay to surgery than MeNTS scores.

Under the circumstances, this study attempted to assess the COVID-19 vaccine-related knowledge, perceptions, attitude, and acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine of public university students. Besides, factors affecting the degrees of COVID-19 vaccine-related knowledge, perceptions, attitudes, and vaccine acceptability were also explored. Results from descriptive analyses revealed that most of the respondents showed positive attitudes toward a COVID-19 vaccine, while 78% of them found to have adequate knowledge. Nevertheless, 37% of students exhibiting negative perceptions about the vaccine raised our concern. However, 72.7% of respondents intended to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Outcomes of multinomial logistic model showed that knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes significantly varied across the level of education, residence area, and COVID-19 infection history of the respondents. Further, findings of binary logistic model reported that female students, students of low family income, those free from COVID-19 infection, students having inadequate knowledge, and negative perceptions and attitudes toward the vaccine were susceptible to vaccine hesitancy and resistance.

RESULTS: A total of 45 neonates were included (FENT, n = 19; DEX, n = 26). The DEX group had a decreased need for sedative bolus doses during therapeutic hypothermia compared with the FENT group; however, there was no difference in number of uncontrolled agitation scores or need for additional scheduled sedatives. The DEX group had a shorter time to discontinuation of sedatives after rewarming compared with the FENT group (0.52 versus 5 days, respectively; p = 0.001), shorter time to extubation after birth (3.1 versus 11.3 days, respectively; p = 0.004), and earlier time to resumption of feeds (8.5 versus 13 days, respectively; p = 0.03).

Heparin binding protein (HBP) is a neutrophil protein that plays an important role in bacterial sepsis and is a promising biomarker in severe infections. Syndecans and glypicans are potential markers of sheeding of the glycocalyx and endothelial dysfunction.The primary aims of this study were to assess whether HBP or syndecans and glypicans are involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and if so, whether they can be used to predict severe disease preferably using a point-of-care test (POC) that can substitute more time-consuming analysis with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Methods: : A prospective convenience sample study of biomarkers. The main cohort consisted of patients admitted to hospital with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Samples and clinical data were collected at admission, during admission and at discharge and samples were analyzed with ELISA kit (Axis-Shield Diagnostics) for measuring HBP concentration and a novel dry immunofluorescence analyzer (Jet-iStar 800) (Joinstar) for point-of-care testing. Results: : Thirty-five COVID-19 patients were prospectively enrolled in the study. HBP was significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients with organ dysfunction (n= 23) compared to those without organ dysfunction (n=6), 24.7 ng/mL (95% CI 17.3-48.4) vs 10.6 ng/mL (95% CI 6.2-17.1 ng/mL), p =0.03.

METHODS: This was a prospective study of 3,057 adult twins from the Washington State Twin Registry. Study participants completed online surveys in 2020, at baseline (March 26 CApril 5), and three follow-up waves (W1: April 20 CMay 3; W2: Jul 16 CAug 2; W3: Sept 16 COct 1). Physical activity was operationalized as self-reported moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and neighborhood walking (minutes/week), and mental health outcomes, operationalized as self-reported anxiety and perceived stress were assessed in the three waves of follow-up. Latent growth curve models (LGCMs) were used to assess changes in PA and mental health outcomes over time. Parallel LGCMs were used to estimate the cross-sectional, parallel, and prospective associations between PA and mental health over time. All models took into within-pair correlations and adjusted for age, sex, and race. RESULTS: Individuals amount of MVPA and walking decreased over time, whereas levels of anxiety remained stable, and stress increased slightly. Cross-sectional associations observed between both PA predictors and mental health outcomes were weak. After taking into account cross-sectional associations between PA and mental health outcomes, changes in PA over time were not associated with changes in mental health outcomes over time. CONCLUSIONS: Over a time period aligned with COVID-19 mitigation strategies and social restrictions, changes in physical activity was not associated with changes in anxiety or stress levels in the current sample. Nonetheless, the average decline in PA over time is worrisome. Public health resources should continue to promote PA as a means to improve physical health during the pandemic.","output":"Changes in physical activity levels and mental health during COVID-19: Prospective findings among adult twin pairs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this age of increased global connectivity, global health education is more important than ever.

Multiple therapeutic options, including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZI), were tried initially to treat moderate to severe COVID-19 and high-risk patients in LTCFs, but they were abandoned due to unfavorable reports. As a less toxic option, we initiated treatment with doxycycline (DOXY) very early in the course of illness. DOXY has antiviral, cardioprotective, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory properties, but the efficacy of early intervention with DOXY in high-risk COVID-19 patients in LTCFs is unknown. Objective The goal of this retrospective study is to describe the clinical outcomes of high-risk COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe symptoms in LTCFs after early intervention with DOXY. Design Case-series analysis Setting LTCFs in New York Participants This observational study examines 89 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 18 to May 13, 2020. Exposure All patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 received DOXY and regular standard of care within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms. Additionally, four patients received meropenem, three patients received Zosyn, two patients received linezolid, and two patients received Bactrim DS. Four patients were on chronic ventilator support. No patients received any steroids or any other antiviral or immunomodulatory agents. The majority of the patients received zinc and calcium supplements as well. Main outcomes and measures Assessed measures were patients' characteristics, fever, shortness of breath (SOB), cough, oxygen saturation/pulse oximetry (POX), radiologic improvements, laboratory tests, DOXY side effects, hospital transfers, and death. Results Eighty-nine (89) high-risk patients, who developed a sudden onset of fever, cough, SOB, and hypoxia and were diagnosed with COVID-19, were treated with DOXY (100 mg PO or intravenous (IV) for seven days) and regular standard of care. Eighty-five percent (85%) of patients (n=76) demonstrated clinical recovery that is defined as resolution of fever (average 3.7 days, Coeff = -0.96, p = 0.0001), resolution of SOB (average 4.2 days), and improvement of POX: average 84% before treatment and average 95% after treatment (84.7  7% vs. 95  2.6%, p = 0.0001). Higher pre- and post-treatment POX is associated with lower mortality (oxygen saturation (Spo2) vs. Death, Coeff = -0.01, p = 0.023; post-Spo2 vs. Death, Coeff = -0.05, p = 0.0002). Within 10 days of symptom onset, 3% of patients (n=3) were transferred to hospital due to clinical deterioration and 11% of patients (n=10) died. The result was followed for 30 days from the onset of symptoms in each patient. Conclusion Early treatment with DOXY for high-risk patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infections in non-hospital settings, such as LTCFs, is associated with early clinical recovery, decreased hospitalization, and decreased mortality.","output":"Clinical Outcomes of Early Treatment With Doxycycline for 89 High-Risk COVID-19 Patients in Long-Term Care Facilities in New York"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent literature has shown that sleep patterns are shaped during the first years of life, playing a relevant role in childrens functioning. We focused on comparing sleep patterns in infants and toddlers in Spain before and during COVID-19 home confinement to assess the immediate impact on sleep patterns. We compared data from two cross-sectional surveys from parents of 1658 children three to 36 months of age from Spain. One conducted before COVID-19 (2017C2018, n = 1380) and another during COVID-19 pandemic (MarchCMay of 2020, n = 254). We used an internet self-administrated questionnaire using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) criteria in both surveys. During confinement, infants and toddlers went to sleep later (median bedtime 21:30 before confinement vs. 21:36 during confinement (p = 0.004)). More infants and toddlers showed longer sleep latencies (> 30 min) during confinement median 33.9% versus 12.3% (p < 0.001). Based on the recommended BISQ criteria, we observed an increase in poor sleepers meeting at least one criterion of inadequate patterns during confinement (p < 0.001). Parental perception of a childs sleep as problematics were 39.4% and 44.1% (adjusted p = 0.363) before and under lockdown, respectively.

Despite that anticoagulation seems an intuitive therapeutic option, the US National Institute of Health has issued a warning against its use in critically ill patients. We present five cases of imaging-proven or clinically suspected hypercoagulability with hemodynamic compromise despite therapeutic anticoagulation. We describe the patients with thoughts on links between pathophysiology and the laboratory values, clinical course, and imaging studies in each case. All patients presented to the hospital with symptoms and chest imaging suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients presented with severe hypoxia requiring mechanical ventilation, and received full anticoagulation for treatment of hypercoagulable state suggested by elevated D-dimer. All but one patient received alteplase for thrombolytic therapy of suspected massive pulmonary embolism (PE). On the basis of this case series, hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is a late manifestation of the disease that persists despite anticoagulation, is cyclic in nature based on D-dimer despite thrombolysis, and is fatal if it rebounds. The use of anticoagulation and thrombolysis in these patients seemed harmful or non-beneficial.

This study aims to determine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and other related factors such as resource availability and institutional support on well-being, burnout and job-satisfaction of EM physicians in the United States. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey study of EM physicians was conducted through the Emergency Medicine Practice Research Network of the ACEP. The survey focused on resource adequacy, institutional support, well-being, and burnout. A total of 890 EM physicians were invited to participate. Both descriptive and risk adjusted, and multivariate regressions were performed with a statistical significance defined as p < 0.05. RESULTS: EM physicians' response rate was 18.7% (166) from 39 states. Burnout was reported by 74.7% (124) since the start of the pandemic. Factors contributing included work-related emotional strain and anxiety, isolation from family and friends, and increased workload. Those reporting inadequate resources felt ignored by their institutions (p < 0.0001). Physicians who felt there was inadequate institutional support, were also dissatisfied with patient care resources (p = 0.001). Physicians expressing job dissatisfaction were more likely to report feelings of burnout (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: EM physicians face greater burnout in the COVID-19 pandemic. This may be compounded by resource scarcity, psychological stress, isolation, and job dissatisfaction. Many of the survey respondents reported inadequate mental health services and resources.

Often in these communities, there is a dependence on bushmeat for both food security and basic income. Despite the importance of bushmeat for households worldwide, the practice raises concern for transmission of zoonotic pathogens through hunting, food preparation, and consumption. In Uganda, harvest of wildlife is illegal, but bushmeat hunting, is commonplace. We interviewed 292 women who cook for their households and 180 self-identified hunters from 21 villages bordering Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda to gain insights into bushmeat preferences, opportunity for zoonotic pathogen transmission, and awareness of common wildlife-associated zoonoses. Both hunters and women who cook considered primates to be the most likely wildlife species to carry diseases humans can catch. Among common zoonotic pathogens, the greatest proportions of women who cook and hunters believed that pathogens causing stomach ache or diarrhea and monkeypox can be transmitted by wildlife. Neither women who cook nor hunters report being frequently injury during cooking, butchering, or hunting, and few report taking precautions while handling bushmeat. The majority of women who cook believe that hunters and dealers never or rarely disguise primate meat as another kind of meat in market, while the majority of hunters report that they usually disguise primate meat as another kind of meat. These data play a crucial role in our understanding of potential for exposure to and infection with zoonotic pathogens in the bushmeat trade.

OBJECTIVE: This paper reports the case of a 37-year-old woman with stress-induced new-onset psychosis instigated by fear of coronavirus infection. METHOD: Physical examinations, paraclinical testing, and neuroimaging excluded an organic cause of symptoms. A thorough anamnestic investigation excluded the presence of other concomitant stress factors as the trigger of the patients psychotic symptoms. RESULTS: In response to the COVID-19 lockdown, the patient developed excessive concern about coronavirus infection and, consequently, sleeping difficulties. Symptoms intensified, and she was admitted to the psychiatric ward, presenting with hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, and disorientation. The clinical picture fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of an Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder. After one week of antipsychotic treatment, her symptoms had remitted, and the patient was discharged. Albeit, four months after treatment discontinuation, her psychotic symptoms re-emerged, and she was readmitted. The patient recovered from symptoms within 48 hours of treatment initiation with antipsychotics. She later reported to have been stressed and anxious while awaiting her coronavirus test result and, following, had doubted the negative result.

Cardiomyocyte senescence is considered to be a key factor in the development of DOX-related cardiomyopathy. Complement component 5a (C5a) and the C5a receptor (C5aR) have been reported to play a key role in the process of cellular senescence. However, to the best of our knowledge, the exact role of C5a and C5aR in cellular senescence in the heart remains largely unknown. Reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q)PCR and western blot assays were used to analyze the expression levels of C5a and C5aR in H9c2 embryonic rat cardiomyocytes and AC16 human cardiomyocyte-like cells. The cells were treated with DOX and a C5aR antagonist (C5aRA). The expression of TNF- and IFN- was determined using ELISA and western blotting. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also measured using ELISA. Cellular senescence was determined using senescence-associated -galactosidase (SA--gal) staining and by analyzing the protein expression levels of p53, p16, p21 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3). The expression levels of C5a and C5aR were found to be upregulated during the DOX-induced senescence of H9c2 and AC16 cardiomyocytes. Treatment with C5aRA downregulated TNF- and IFN- expression, in addition to ROS levels. Furthermore, C5aRA prevented DOX-induced cellular senescence and decreased the levels of positive SA--gal staining in H9c2 and AC16 cardiomyocytes, in addition to downregulating the expression levels of p53, p16, p21 and IGFBP3. C5aRA also increased the telomere length and telomerase activity in H9c2 and AC16 cardiomyocytes following DOX stimulation. In conclusion, the findings of the present study indicated that C5a and C5aR may play a key role in cardiomyocyte senescence, and treatment with C5aRA may be an effective method for preventing DOX-induced cardiomyocyte aging.","output":"Role of C5a and C5aR in doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte senescence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM There is a clinical need for safety data regarding hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We analysed real-world data using the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) database to assess HCQ/CQ-associated cardiovascular adverse events (CVAEs) in pre-COVID-19 reports. METHODS We conducted disproportionality analysis of HCQ/CQ in the FAERS database (07/2014-9/2019), using reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the lower bound of the information component 95% credibility interval (IC025 ). RESULTS The full database contained 6 677 225 reports with a mean (SD) age of 53 (17) years and 74% females. We identified 4895 reports of HCQ/CQ related adverse events, of which 696 (14.2%) were CVAEs. Compared with the full database, HCQ/CQ use was associated with a higher reporting rate of major CVAEs, including cardiomyopathy (n = 86 [1.8%], ROR = 29.0 [23.3-35.9]), QT prolongation (n = 43 [0.9%], ROR = 4.5 [3.3-6.1]), cardiac arrhythmias (n = 117 [2.4%], ROR = 2.2 [1.8-2.7]) and heart failure (n = 136 [2.8%], ROR = 2.2 [1.9-2.7], all IC > 0). No statistically significant differences were observed between sex and age groups. CVAEs were reported more often in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome. HCQ/CQ-associated CVAEs demonstrated subsequent hospitalization and mortality rates of 39% and 8%, respectively. Overdose reports demonstrated an increased frequency of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias (35% and 25%, respectively). CONCLUSION In a real-world setting, HCQ/CQ treatment is associated with higher reporting rates of various CVAEs, particularly cardiomyopathy, QT prolongation, cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure. HCQ/CQ-associated CVAEs result in high rates of severe outcomes and should be carefully considered as an off-label indication, especially for patients with cardiac disorders.","output":"Cardiovascular adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine: A comprehensive pharmacovigilance analysis of pre-COVID-19 reports."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypercoagulability and thrombosis caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) are related to the higher mortality rate.

The extent to which this mutualism plays a role in resilient plant populations can only be understood by examining its occurrence rate and phenological patterns. To test for prevalence and seasonality in colonization, we examined 1305 individual L. inundata roots from 275 plants collected during spring and autumn 2019 across 11 semi-natural heathlands in Britain and the Netherlands. We quantified presence/absence of fine root endophyte (FRE) hyphae and vesicles and explored possible relationships between temperature and precipitation in the months immediately before sampling. Fine root endophyte hyphae were dominant in all of the examined heathlands, and every colonized root had FRE in both cortical cells and root hairs. However, we found significant differences in colonization between the two seasons at every site. Overall, 14% of L. inundata roots were colonized in spring (2.4% with vesicles) compared with 86% in autumn (7.6% with vesicles). Colonization levels between populations were also significantly different, correlating with temperature and precipitation, suggesting some local environments may be more conducive to root and related hyphal growth.

Medical directors of different blood banks were invited to participate. RESULTS: A total of 16 centers participated with representation from 15/22 countries in the region. 75% were from national blood banks. Most centres had a decrease in the blood supply, ranging from 26-50%. Representatives from 14 countries (93.3%) believed that public fear has contributed to a decrease in donations.

Methods: Patients starting a biologic treatment as part of clinical care completed the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6), the Severe Asthma Questionnaire (SAQ and SAQ-global scores) and the EQ5D (EQ-5D-5L and EQ5D-VAS) at baseline. They completed the ACQ-6, SAQ, SAQ-global and a retrospective global rating of change (GRoC) scale at weeks 4, 8 and 16 and completed the EQ-5D-5L and EQ5D-VAS at week 16. The SAQ-global and EQ5D-VAS differ but both are single item 100-point questions. Sensitivity was measured by Cohen's D effect size at each of the three time points.

As an alternative, and to improve finite sample performance, this paper considers bootstrap-based inference for interval estimation and testing. Specifically, for a wide class of point process models we consider a novel bootstrap scheme labeled 'fixed intensity bootstrap' (FIB), where the conditional intensity is kept fixed across bootstrap repetitions. The FIB, which is very simple to implement and fast in practice, extends previous ideas from the bootstrap literature on time series in discrete time, where the so-called 'fixed design' and 'fixed volatility' bootstrap schemes have shown to be particularly useful and effective. We compare the FIB with the classic recursive bootstrap, which is here labeled 'recursive intensity bootstrap' (RIB). In RIB algorithms, the intensity is stochastic in the bootstrap world and implementation of the bootstrap is more involved, due to its sequential structure. For both bootstrap schemes, we provide new bootstrap (asymptotic) theory which allows to assess bootstrap validity, and propose a 'non-parametric' approach based on resampling time-changed transformations of the original waiting times. We also establish the link between the proposed bootstraps for point process models and the related autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) models. Lastly, we show effectiveness of the different bootstrap schemes in finite samples through a set of detailed Monte Carlo experiments, and provide applications to both financial data and social media data to illustrate the proposed methodology.","output":"Bootstrap Inference for Hawkes and General Point Processes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since important agents of viral nosocomial infections like hepatitis B and C viruses and norovirus do not replicate sufficiently in cell culture systems, disinfectants with suspected efficacy against these viruses must be evaluated by different methods.

There is a growing body of research that aims to understand the experiences of these parents, but the majority of this research is from mothers' perspectives, meaning that fathers' experiences are not well understood. OBJECTIVES: To identify and synthesise findings from existing qualitative studies that have explored the experiences of fathers of children with a life-limiting condition. METHODS: A systematic review of qualitative research was conducted using thematic synthesis. Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Social Science Citation Index. RESULTS: Findings from 30 studies were included, representing the experiences of 576 fathers of children with a range of diagnoses including cancer, cystic fibrosis, genetic and neurological conditions. Themes detailed fathers' experiences of uncertainty and shock around the time of their child's diagnosis, their accounts of a 'new normal', difficulties in discussing their emotions, forming relationships with and seeking support from professionals and working fathers' role conflicts. They discussed the life-changing nature of their child's diagnosis, an event that affected all aspects of their lives from everyday activities, to their relationships, spirituality, values and ambitions. CONCLUSIONS: Fathers experience many difficulties in response to their child's diagnosis and ongoing treatment. Findings highlight the need for healthcare professionals to recognise individual family dynamics and the evolving role of the father. Fathers' responses are not widely understood, and research that directly addresses their own well-being is warranted.","output":"Experiences of fathers of children with a life-limiting condition: a systematic review and qualitative synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a cross-sectional evaluation of healthcare worker reuse of their own 3M N95 respirators, 83% (76/92) passed the seal check and the fit-test after a median of 40 repeated donnings.

Seedlings were treated with either a 2-d or 4-d supply of potassium cyanide (KCN) in the nutrient solution containing nitrate (NO3-) or ammonium (NH4+). Although a KCN-induced increase was recorded in the activity of ?-cyanoalanine synthase (?-CAS) in rice tissues of both NH4+-fed and NO3--fed seedlings, the former showed a significantly greater assimilation rate for CN- than the latter. The addition of KCN decreased NO3- uptake and assimilation, whereas a negligible impact was observed in NH4+ treatments. Enzymatic assays showed a marked activities enhancement of glutamine synthetase (GS), glutamate synthase (GOGAT), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in NH4+-fed seedlings after KCN exposure. Similarly, the rises occurring in nitrate reductase (NR) and GDH activity in NO3--fed seedlings were also detected after 2-d exposure to KCN, whereas a significant reduction of GS and GOGAT activities was determined. The results suggest that although exogenous KCN at moderate or high concentrations caused repressively effects on biomass growth of both NH4+-fed and NO3--fed rice seedlings, the nontoxic concentration of KCN supplied can serve as a supplemental N source in plant nutrition and N metabolism.","output":"Assimilation of exogenous cyanide cross talk in Oryza sativa L. to the key nodes in nitrogen metabolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide even in industrialised countries, and its incidence is highest among children aged <5years.

The main aim of this review is to consider the available data concerning the aetiology, diagnosis, evaluation of severity, and treatment of paediatric CAP. Analysis of the literature shows that there are a number of unanswered questions concerning the management of CAP, including its definition, the absence of a paediatric CAP severity score, the difficulty of identifying its aetiology, the emergence of resistance of the most frequent respiratory pathogens to the most widely used anti-infectious agents, and the lack of information concerning the changes in CAP epidemiology following the introduction of vaccines against respiratory pathogens.

However, applied psychologists have limited understanding of how employee experiences of work-family conflict and enrichment have been affected by this event and what organizations can do to ensure better employee functioning during such societal crises. Adopting a person-centered approach, we examine transitions in employees' work-family interfaces from before COVID-19 to after its onset. First, in Study 1, using latent profile analysis (N = 379; nonpandemic data), we identify profiles of bidirectional conflict and enrichment, including beneficial (low conflict and high enrichment), active (medium conflict and enrichment), and passive (low conflict and enrichment). In Study 2, with data collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we replicate Study 1 profiles and explore whether employees transition between work-family profiles during the pandemic. Results suggest that although many remain in prepandemic profiles, positive (from active/passive to beneficial) and negative (from beneficial to active/passive) transitions occurred for a meaningful proportion of respondents. People were more likely to go through negative transitions if they had high segmentation preferences, engaged in emotion-focused coping, experienced higher technostress, and had less compassionate supervisors. In turn, negative transitions were associated with negative employee consequences during the pandemic (e.g., lower job satisfaction and job performance, and higher turnover intent).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten transumbilical SPLPN were performed using the R-Port (Advanced Surgical Concepts, Wicklow, Ireland) multi-instrument port, a 5-mm flexible laparoscope (Olympus Surgical, Orangeburg, NY, USA), and custom-engineered articulating needle drivers, graspers, and scissors (Cambridge Endo, Framingham, MA, USA). After general anaesthesia, the pig was placed in the flank position. After umbilical placement of the R-Port, Gerota's fascia was incised and hilar dissection performed with the newly engineered articulating instruments. Either the upper or lower pole of the kidney was scored and excised after placing a bulldog clamp on the renal pedicle. The bolsters were prepared with absorbable haemostat, placed at the site of excision, and secured with polyglactin sutures. RESULTS A fascial incision of > or =2.5 cm should be made to allow adequate room for passing the instruments. Also, use of the 5 mm flexible laparoscope minimizes instrument crowding and allows for optimal visualization. The mean (sd, range) time for hilum dissection was 12.2 (4.3, 7-20) min, while that for total excision was 9.8 (1.7, 8-12) min. Modified suturing techniques were developed to achieve reconstruction in a small working space. Specialized instrumentation is essential for a successful SPLPN with no need for an additional port for triangulation. The mean duration of intracorporeal suturing was 27.7 min (declining from 40 to 15 min). The total ischaemia time decreased from 50 min in the first case to 27 min in the last (mean 37.4 min). The mean estimated blood loss was 81.1 (31.7, 50-150) mL.

We hypothesise that foreskin tissue samples of asymptomatic HSV-2 seropositive men had remaining signs of inflammation at the molecular level. Even in the absence of clinical lesions, genital inflammation may contribute to increased HIV susceptibility on sexual exposure to the virus. SETTING: Foreskin tissue samples were collected from men undergoing elective circumcision in Kisumu, Kenya. PARTICIPANTS: The foreskin tissue samples (n=86) were stratified into study groups based on HSV-2 serology and assessed for mRNA expression of inflammatory markers. Markers of interest were further assessed by immunohistochemical staining within the tissue samples. RESULTS: The two study groups had comparable levels of all molecular markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD69, CCR5, HLA-DR, Langerin, DC-SIGN, Mannose Receptor 1, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-, 7, IgA, IFN-, CCL5, E-cadherin, ZO-1 and occludin), except for lower mRNA levels of the epithelial junction protein claudin-1 in the HSV-2 seropositive group (p=0.008). Although mRNA levels of claudin-1 were lower in HSV-2 seropositive individuals, the corresponding protein could be visualised in the foreskin epithelium of all samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas no general inflammation was demonstrated in the foreskin of asymptomatic HSV-2 seropositive individuals, a decreased expression of claudin-1 indicates a less robust genital epithelial barrier. An intact epithelial barrier is essential for blocking mucosal entry of genital infections, including HIV.","output":"Comparable mRNA expression of inflammatory markers but lower claudin-1 mRNA levels in foreskin tissue of HSV-2 seropositive versus seronegative asymptomatic Kenyan young men"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The molecular link between SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection and susceptibility is not well understood.

This online survey captured the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nuclear medicine services in Germany comparing 2020 to 2019. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was developed to record the 2020 numbers of nuclear medicine procedures and, in particular, the change compared with 2019. The changes in nuclear medicine diagnostics and therapy were queried, as well as the extent to which \\"Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2\\" recommendations provided by the DGN were implemented. RESULTS: 91 complete responses were recorded and evaluated. This corresponds to about 20a??% of all German nuclear medicine facilities. Nuclear medicine diagnostic tests showed a decrease in scintigraphies for thyroid (15.9a??%), bone (8.8a??%), lung (7.6a??%), sentinel lymph nodes (5.5a??%), and myocardium (1.4a??%) with small increases in PET/CT examinations (1.2a??%) compared with 2019. Among nuclear medicine therapies, reductions were highest for benign indications (benign thyroid 13.3a??%, RSO 7.7a??%), while changes from 2019 were less pronounced for malignant indications (PRRT: +a??2.2a??%, PSMA: +a??7.4a??%, SIRT: -5.9a??%, and RJT for thyroid carcinoma -2.4a??%).

This is presumed due to direct spread of infection or due to immunological response. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a rare inflammatory and demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system that is often preceded by infection or vaccination. Very few cases of ADEM have been reported in the literature that are associated with COVID-19 infection. CASE REPORT: Here we demonstrate familial cases of ADEM in a hospitalized father and son, who presented to the emergency department with fever and shortness of breath, later diagnosed with COVID-19, and subsequently requiring mechanical ventilation. Both patients developed neurological symptoms with upper motor neuron involvement at approximately day 30 of admission. MRI of the brain demonstrated bilateral multifocal periventricular white matter FLAIR signal hyperintensities consistent with ADEM. The patients were treated with medium dose IV methylprednisolone with variable outcomes. The 49-year-old son developed severe residual neurological deficits with encephalomalacic changes on MRI which required extensive rehabilitation; meanwhile, the 68-year-old father predominantly had pulmonary sequelae including fibrosis and the development of a pneumatocele, but he had a better neurological outcome.

Meanwhile, by adding Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) as additives, the nonwovens exhibit excellent antibacterial performance. The resultant nonwovens exhibit filtration efficiency of 99.1% for PM(0.3) and low pressure drop of 105 Pa under the 10.67 cm/s inlet air velocity, and antibacterial rate of > 99.99% for Escherichia coli. These performances and functions make the designed complex nonwovens a promising filter core for face masks. [Image: see text] ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: Supplementary material (Fig. S1.

Through the census approach, a cross-sectional sample of 760 students was administered a questionnaire in two universities offering Physical Education in Ghana: the University of Education, Winneba, and University of Cape Coast. The outcome of the study found a positive and significant link between COVID-19 knowledge and anxiety. Further, school climate and coping strategies significantly moderated the relationship between students COVID-19 knowledge and associated anxiety. The findings have implications for creating a conducive school environment that reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection and through students adoption of active coping strategies in an attempt to reduce psychological distress associated with COVID-19 anxiety.","output":"Relationship Between COVID-19 Related Knowledge and Anxiety Among University Students: Exploring the Moderating Roles of School Climate and Coping Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Focused practice within family medicine may be increasing globally, but there is limited research on the factors contributing to decisions to focus practice. AIM: To examine the factors influencing resident and early-career family physician choices of focused practice across three Canadian provinces. DESIGN AND SETTING: A subset of qualitative interview data were analysed from a study across British Columbia, Ontario, and Nova Scotia, Canada. METHOD: Included in the analysis were a total of 22 resident family physicians and 38 early-career family physicians in their first 10 years of practice who intend to or currently practise in a focused area. Comparisons were made for participant types, provinces, and the degree of focused practice, while identifying themes related to factors influencing the pursuit of focused practice. RESULTS: Three key themes were identified of factors contributing to choices of focused practice: self-preservation within the current structure of the healthcare system; support from colleagues; and training experiences in medical school and/or residency. Minor themes included: alignment of practice with skills, personal values, or ability to derive professional satisfaction; personal lived experiences; and having many attractive opportunities for focused practice. CONCLUSION: Both groups of participants unanimously viewed focused practice as a way to circumvent the burnout or exhaustion they associated with comprehensive practice in the current structure of the healthcare system. This finding, in addition to other influential factors, was consistent across the three provinces.

We aimed to examine the use of rapid SARS-CoV-2 sequencing combined with detailed epidemiological analysis to investigate health-care associated SARS-CoV-2 infections and inform infection control measures. METHODS: In this prospective surveillance study, we set up rapid SARS-CoV-2 nanopore sequencing from PCR-positive diagnostic samples collected from our hospital (Cambridge, UK) and a random selection from hospitals in the East of England, enabling sample-to-sequence in less than 24 h. We established a weekly review and reporting system with integration of genomic and epidemiological data to investigate suspected health-care associated COVID-19 cases. FINDINGS: Between March 13 and April 24, 2020, we collected clinical data and samples from 5613 patients with COVID-19 from across the East of England. We sequenced 1000 samples producing 747 high-quality genomes. We combined epidemiological and genomic analysis of the 299 patients from our hospital and identified 35 clusters of identical viruses involving 159 patients. 92 (58%) of 159 patients had strong epidemiological links and 32 (20%) patients had plausible epidemiological links. These results were fed back to clinical, infection control, and hospital management teams, leading to infection-control interventions and informing patient safety reporting. INTERPRETATION: We established real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in a UK hospital and showed the benefit of combined genomic and epidemiological analysis for the investigation of health-care associated COVID-19. This approach enabled us to detect cryptic transmission events and identify opportunities to target infection-control interventions to further reduce health-care associated infections.

Across all disciplines, unique and novel modes of presentation with substantial morbidity and mortality are being encountered, and growing evidence suggests that psychiatric comorbidity is likely among COVID-19 patients. Objective This article aims to broaden the current discussion on the psychiatric sequalae of COVID-19, which has largely focused on anxiety, and examine the recently documented psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 infection, the secondary effects of the pandemic on public mental health, and future psychiatric conditions that may arise due to COVID-19. Methods We conducted an in-depth review of the current global psychiatric literature and describe the wide range of psychopathological presentations reported among past COVID-19 patients worldwide and those that are expected to emerge. Results Current discussions in the psychiatric literature on COVID-19 report anxiety and anxiety disorders as a predominant set of clinical presentations during the pandemic. The impacts of direct COVID-19 infection, associated psychopathological sequelae, and drastic lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa, are associated with a broad range of psychopathologies and other neuropsychiatric presentations. Pre-existing societal conditions and burdens on the health system in South Africa prompt healthcare providers and public health planners to accordingly prepare for the expected rise in new psychiatric presentations. Conclusion Greater awareness of the various psychiatric conditions attributed to COVID-19 infection may allow for earlier screening, more effective treatment, and greater positive health outcomes and better prepare health systems to address the growing pandemic in South Africa.","output":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Psychiatric Sequelae in South Africa: Anxiety and Beyond."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES This study aims to analyze the epidemiological and clinical features of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) in a Moroccan pediatric population.

In addition to establishing the exact criteria regarding whether treatment for a newly arriving patient shows a sufficient likelihood of success, it is also necessary to ask whether patients already undergoing treatment whose prospects are low should be moved into palliative care if new patients with better prospects arrive. This question has led to divergent ethical guidelines. This paper explores the distinction between withholding and withdrawing medical treatment during times of scarcity. As a first central point, the paper argues that a revival of the ethical distinction between doing and allowing would have a revisionary impact on cases of voluntary treatment withdrawal. A second systematic focus lies in the concern that withdrawal due to scarcity might be considered a physical transgression and therefore more problematic than not treating someone in the first place. In light of the persistent disagreement, especially concerning the second issue, the paper concludes with two pragmatic proposals for how to handle the ethical uncertainty: (1) triage protocols should explicitly require that intensive care attempts are designed as time-limited trials based on specified treatment goals, and this intent should be documented very clearly at the beginning of each treatment; and (2) lower survival prospects can be accepted for treatments that have already begun, compared with the respective triage rules for the initial access of patients to intensive care.","output":"Withdrawal of intensive care during times of severe scarcity: Triage during a pandemic only upon arrival or with the inclusion of patients who are already under treatment?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Childhood emotional abuse (CEA) is associated with various negative mental health outcomes.

This study aims to determine the clinical importance of platelet count and platelet indices in the differentiation of COVID-19 from influenza and the value of these parameters in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS The medical records of the patients and the electronic patient monitoring system were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic characteristics, admission symptoms, laboratory findings, radiological involvement, comorbidities, and mortality of the patients were recorded. RESULTS Forty-three patients diagnosed with influenza and 54 diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. The average age of the COVID-19 patients was lower than that of the influenza patients (influenza: 60.5 years, COVID-19: 52.4 years; p = 0.024), and the male gender was predominant in the COVID-19 group (influenza: 42%, COVID-19: 56%). According to laboratory findings, mean platelet volume (MPV) and MPV/platelet ratio were statistically significantly lower, whereas eosinophil count and platelet distribution width (PDW) level were significantly higher (p <0.05) in the COVID-19 group. It was found that the most common symptom in both groups was dyspnea and that the symptom was more prevalent among the influenza patients.

We developed whole virus inactivated HCV vaccine candidates employing a licensed adjuvant and inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies in mice. Further, we investigated effects of HCV envelope protein modifications increasing neutralization epitope exposure on immunogenicity. METHODS Whole virus vaccine antigen was produced in Huh7.5 hepatoma cells, processed using a multistep protocol and formulated with adjuvant (MF-59 analogue AddaVax or aluminium hydroxide). For IgG purified from serum of immunized BALB/c mice, we investigated capacity to neutralize genotype 1-6 HCV by virus neutralization assays and to bind homologous envelope proteins by ELISA. Viruses used for immunizations were (i) HCV5aHi with strain SA13 envelope proteins and modification of an O-linked glycosylation site in E2 (T385P), (ii) HCV5aHi(T385) with reversion of T385P to T385, featuring the original E2 sequence determined in vivo and (iii) HCV5aHi(HVR1) with deletion of HVR1. For these viruses, epitope exposure was investigated using human monoclonal (AR3A and AR4A) and polyclonal (C211 and H06) antibodies in neutralization assays. RESULTS Processed HCV5aHi formulated with AddaVax induced antibodies, efficiently binding homologous envelope proteins and broadly neutralizing cultured genotype 1-6 HCV with IC50 between 14 and 192g/mL; mean IC50 against the homologous virus was 36g/mL. Vaccination with aluminium hydroxide was less immunogenic. Compared to HCV5aHi(T385) with the original E2 sequence, HCV5aHi with a modified glycosylation site and HCV5aHi(HVR1) without HVR1 showed increased neutralization epitope exposure but similar immunogenicity. CONCLUSION Using an adjuvant suitable for human use, we developed inactivated whole HCV vaccine candidates inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies for further pre-clinical development.

Here, we examined this hypothesis in primary human skeletal myoblasts (SkMs) using multiplex expression analysis of 39 inflammatory proteins in response to different FFA species. Multiplex mRNA quantification confirmed that the IL6, IL1RA, IL4, LIF, CXCL8, CXCL1, CXCL12 and CCL2 genes were differentially regulated by saturated and unsaturated C16 or C18 FFAs. Fluorescence staining revealed that only saturated C16 and C18 strongly interfere with myoblast replication independent of desmin expression, mitochondrial abundance and oxidative activity.

The primary outcome was the change in the disease severity category of COVID-19 after treatment. Results: Between Jan 31, 2020, and Feb 19, 2020, 42 out of 100 screened patients were included in the trial: 28 in the CHM plus standard care group and 14 in the standard care alone group. Among 42 participants who were randomized (mean [SD] age 60.43 years [12.69 years]), 21 (21/42, 50%) were aged 65 years, 35 (35/42, 83%) were women, and 42 (42/42, 100%) had data available for the primary outcome. For the primary outcome, one patient from each group died during treatment; the odds of a shift toward death was lower in the CHM plus group than in the standard care alone group (common OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.148C2.352, P = 0.454). Three (two from the CHM plus group and one from the standard care alone group) patients progressed from severe to critical illness. After treatment, mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease accounted for 17.86% (5/28) vs. 14.29% (2/28), 71.43% (20/28) vs. 64.29% (9/28), and 0% (0) vs. 7.14% (1/28) of the patients treated with CHM plus standard care vs. standard care alone. Conclusions: For the first time, the G-CHAMPS trial provided valuable information for the national guideline-based CHM treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The effects of CHM in COVID-19 may be clinically important and warrant further consideration and studies. Clinical Trial Registration: http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx.

We assessed the effect of 52 weeks of a supervised aerobic exercise program on amyloid accumulation, cognitive performance, and brain volume in cognitively normal older adults with elevated and sub-threshold levels of cerebral amyloid as measured by amyloid PET imaging. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This 52-week randomized controlled trial compared the effects of 150 minutes per week of aerobic exercise vs. education control intervention. A total of 117 underactive older adults (mean age 72.9 [7.7]) without evidence of cognitive impairment, with elevated (n = 79) or subthreshold (n = 38) levels of cerebral amyloid were randomized, and 110 participants completed the study. Exercise was conducted with supervision and monitoring by trained exercise specialists. We conducted 18F-AV45 PET imaging of cerebral amyloid and anatomical MRI for whole brain and hippocampal volume at baseline and Week 52 follow-up to index brain health. Neuropsychological tests were conducted at baseline, Week 26, and Week 52 to assess executive function, verbal memory, and visuospatial cognitive domains. Cardiorespiratory fitness testing was performed at baseline and Week 52 to assess response to exercise. The aerobic exercise group significantly improved cardiorespiratory fitness (11% vs. 1% in the control group) but there were no differences in change measures of amyloid, brain volume, or cognitive performance compared to control. CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise was not associated with reduced amyloid accumulation in cognitively normal older adults with cerebral amyloid. In spite of strong systemic cardiorespiratory effects of the intervention, the observed lack of cognitive or brain structure benefits suggests brain benefits of exercise reported in other studies are likely to be related to non-amyloid effects.

This neurotropic virus is deft at avoiding the immune system while travelling through neurons to the brain. Until recently, research efforts into the role of non-coding RNAs in rabies pathogenicity and detection have been hampered by a lack of human in vitro neuronal models. Here, we utilized our previously described human stem cell-derived neural model to investigate the effect of lyssavirus infection on microRNA (miRNA) expression in human neural cells and their secreted exosomes. Conventional differential expression analysis identified 25 cellular and 16 exosomal miRNAs that were significantly altered (FDR adjusted P-value <0.05) in response to different lyssavirus strains. Supervised machine learning algorithms determined 6 cellular miRNAs (miR-99b-5p, miR-346, miR-5701, miR-138-2-3p, miR-651-5p, and miR-7977) were indicative of lyssavirus infection (100% accuracy), with the first four miRNAs having previously established roles in neuronal function, or panic and impulsivity-related behaviors. Another 4-miRNA signatures in exosomes (miR-25-3p, miR-26b-5p, miR-218-5p, miR-598-3p) can independently predict lyssavirus infected cells with >99% accuracy. Identification of these robust lyssavirus miRNA signatures offers further insight into neural lineage responses to infection and provides a foundation for utilizing exosome miRNAs in the development of next-generation molecular diagnostics for rabies.","output":"Machine Learning Identifies Cellular and Exosomal MicroRNA Signatures of Lyssavirus Infection in Human Stem Cell-Derived Neurons"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND DuraSeal(?) (Coviden, Waltham, MA, USA), a hydrogel sealant, is primarily used as an adjunct to a dural repair. Its use has also been described to seal off an annulotomy after a transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion when recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) is used. This aids in the reduction of postoperative radiculitis caused by rhBMP-2. However, as a result of its hydrophilic properties, DuraSeal(?) has the potential to swell, which could lead to compression of the thecal sac. CASE DESCRIPTION We report a 57-year-old woman who developed cauda equina after a transforaminal lumbar 47 interbody fusion (TLIF) procedure in which the expansion of the DuraSeal(?) was believed to be the causative factor. The patient developed urinary retention, bowel incontinence, and paresthesias in the saddle region on postoperative Day 3. She underwent emergent exploration and decompression of the thecal sac. The gel-like DuraSeal? material was causing significant compression of the thecal sac. LITERATURE REVIEW Multiple reports have documented that DuraSeal(?), used as an adjunct to dural repair, can swell leading to compression of the spinal cord and/or neural elements. Our case demonstrates the use of DuraSeal(?) both over a site of a dural repair and over an annulotomy site, through which a TLIF was performed, is associated with the risk of developing postoperative cauda equina syndrome as a result of swelling of the DuraSeal(?). CLINICAL RELEVANCE Those using DuraSeal? to seal off the annulotomy after a TLIF procedure performed with rhBMP-2 should use the product with an understanding of the potential postoperative swelling of the product and resulting neurologic sequela, particularly if DuraSeal(?) is used concomitantly at the site of dural repair.","output":"Cauda equina syndrome after a TLIF resulting from postoperative expansion of a hydrogel dural sealant."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The National Organization for Civil Registration (NOCR) of Iran has reported causes of death data by ICD-10 chapters for the first time in 2020.

Under the background of the 3 Year Action Plan to Fight Air Pollution (2018-2020), the pollution status of PM2.5, a typical air pollutant, has been the focus of continuous attention. The spatiotemporal specificity of PM2.5 pollution in the Chinese urban atmospheric environment from 2018 to 2020 can be summarized to help conclude and evaluate the phased results of the battle against air pollution, and further, contemplate the governance measures during the period of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025). Based on PM2.5 data from 2018 to 2020 and taking 366 cities across China as research objects, this study found that PM2.5 pollution has improved year by year from 2018 to 2020, and that the heavily polluted areas were southwest Xinjiang and North China. The number of cities with a PM2.5 concentration in the range of 25-35 g/m3 increased from 34 in 2018 to 86 in 2019 and 99 in 2020. Moreover, the spatial variation of the PM2.5 gravity center was not significant. Concretely, PM2.5 pollution in 2018 was more serious in the first and fourth quarters, and the shift of the pollution's gravity center from the first quarter to the fourth quarter was small. Global autocorrelation indicated that the space was positively correlated and had strong spatial aggregation. Local Moran's I and Local Geti's G were applied to identify hotspots with a high degree of aggregation. Integrating national population density, hotspots were classified into four areas: the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Fenwei Plain, the Yangtze River Delta, and the surrounding areas were selected as the key hotspots for further geographic weighted regression analysis in 2018. The influence degree of each factor on the average annual PM2.5 concentration declined in the following order: (1) the proportion of secondary industry in the GDP, (2) the ownership of civilian vehicles, (3) the annual grain planting area, (4) the annual average population, (5) the urban construction land area, (6) the green space area, and (7) the per capita GDP.

COVID-19 is a serious illness leading to multiple deaths in various countries including the United States. Several million Americans satisfy the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for being high risk. Unfortunately, the available supply of medical beds and equipment for mechanical ventilation are much less than is projected to be needed. The World Health Organization (WHO) and multiple agencies led by the CDC in the United States have attempted to organize intensive outbreak investigation programs utilizing appropriate preventive measures, evaluation, and treatment. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic forms to conditions encompassing multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) syndromes. The presently approved treatments are supportive but not curative for the disease. There are multiple treatments being studied. These include vaccines, medications Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine and potentially combination therapy. Finally, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells or (UC-MSCs) may have a role and are being studied. The cure of COVID-19 is essentially dependent on the patients' own immune system. When the immune system is over activated in an attempt to kill the virus, this can lead to the production of a large number of inflammatory factors, resulting in severe cytokine storm. The cytokine storm may induce organ damage followed by the edema, dysfunction of air exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and secondary infection, which may lead to death. Thus, at this point, the avoidance of the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment of HCOV-19 infected patients.In China, where there was limited availability of effective modalities to manage COVID-19 several patients were treated with expanded UC-MSCs. Additionally, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care have reported guidelines to treat coronavirus patients with stem cells in the hope of decreasing the number of patients going to the ICU, and, also relatively quickly getting them out of ICU. In this manuscript, we describe the urgent need for various solutions, pathogenesis of coronavirus and the clinical evidence for treatment of COVID-19 with stem cells. The limited but emerging evidence regarding UC MSC in managing COVID-19 suggests that it might be considered for compassionate use in critically ill patients to reduce morbidity and mortality in the United States. The administration and Coronavirus Task Force might wish to approach the potential of expanded UC-MSCs as an evolutionary therapeutic strategy in managing COVID-19 illness with a 3-pronged approach: If proven safe and effective on a specific and limited basis 1.

In this work we propose a parametric cubic Hermite (CH) based mesh to model the shape of cow udders and teats. The workflow starts from selecting a subset of nodes from the data cloud captured by a depth scanner, and constructing a CH mesh from the nodes. Using a coherent point drifting (CPD) algorithm, the nodes on the mesh are registered from one cow to their counterparts of another cow while preserving the topological coherence of the mesh. This workflow works well for the udder surface when teats are excluded. However, when teats are included in the mesh, misaligned correspondences occur due to data point occlusion and insufficient sampling points. In summary, a first parametric mesh based 3D model has been constructed for the cow udder and teat.

The increasing number of primary studies reporting long-term follow-up measurements supports a meta-analysis of this evidence. OBJECTIVE This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to understand the immediate and long-term impact of mHealth interventions on PA. The secondary objective was to explore potential effect moderators (population type, intervention design, control group type). METHODS We performed this systematic review according to the Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, SCOPUS and PsychINFO in July 2020. Eligible studies included randomized-controlled trials of mHealth interventions targeting PA as a primary outcome in adults. Eligible outcome measures were walking, moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA), total PA (TPA), and energy expenditure (EE). Where reported, we extracted data for three time points (ie, end of intervention, follow-up 6 months, follow-up >6 months). To understand effect moderators, we performed subgroup analyses by population, intervention design, and control group type. Results were summarized using random-effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. RESULTS Of the 2 828 identified citations, 117 studies were included. These studies reported on 21 118 participants with a mean age of 52.03 years (SD 14.14), of whom 59% were female. mHealth interventions significantly increased PA across all four outcome measures at the end of intervention (walking standardized mean difference 0.46, 0.36 to 0.55; P<.001; MVPA 0.28, 0.21 to 0.35; P<.001; TPA 0.34, 0.20 to 0.47; P<.001; EE 0.44, 0.13 to 0.75; P=.01). Only 33 studies reported short-term and eight studies reported long-term follow-up measurements in addition to end of intervention results. Effects were sustained short-term for walking (0.26, 0.09 to 0.42; P=.002), MVPA (0.20, 0.05 to 0.35; P=.008), and TPA (0.53, 0.13 to 0.93; P=.009). Long-term, effects were also sustained for walking (0.25, 0.10 to 0.39; P=.001) and MVPA (0.19, 0.11 to 0.27; P<.001). We found study population to be an effect moderator, with higher effect scores in sick and at-risk populations. PA was increased both in scalable and non-scalable mHealth intervention designs and regardless of the control group type. The risk of bias was rated high in 94 of 117 studies. In addition, heterogeneity was significant and substantial across outcome measures, resulting in low to very low quality of evidence. CONCLUSIONS mHealth interventions can foster small to moderate increases in PA. Effects are maintained long-term, but effect size decreases over time. The results encourage the use of mHealth interventions in at-risk and sick populations, and support the use of scalable mHealth intervention designs to affordably reach large populations. However, given low evidence quality and high heterogeneity, further methodologically rigorous studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term effects of mHealth interventions.

Its impact has varied across geographical, socioeconomic and policy factors. These stressors are known to increase alcohol use along with other high risk health behaviors. In this study we aimed to evaluate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol associated hepatitis (AAH) incidence in the Midwestern population. Methods: Consecutive adult admissions for symptomatic AAH (defined by alcohol use, evidence of liver injury and total bilirubin dL) to our one academic and two community hospitals located in a Midwestern USA metro area with a population of about 1 million people were included. We included the years 2016 to 2019 as controls and 2020 as the pandemic year. The years were further divided by quarter as pandemic related changes started in the second quarter of 2020. Patients were identified using ICD-10 code k70.10 and k70.11. Severe AAH is based on admission Maddrey's Discriminant Function r MELD-a  Results: A total of 282 hospitalizations for symptomatic AAH occurred between 2016 to 2020. As shown in Table 1, hospitalizations for AAH over 5 years were similar in gender and race, but patients in 2016 were older compared to other years. Compared to the same quarters in the previous 4 years, the number of hospitalizations for symptomatic AAH during the pandemic year more than doubled, with the sharpest rise in the 3rd and 4th quarters (Figure 1). The proportion of severe AAH and inpatient mortality was similar to previous years. Conclusion: Our results show significant rise in hospitalization for AAH in the Midwestern USA population during the COVID-19 pandemic. This rise was particularly sharp in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2020. This is likely an effect of prolonged pandemic related stressors. The rise in AAH might be higher in other states as our state did not have a stay home mandate at any point during the pandemic.","output":"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitalization for alcohol-associated hepatitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate oil market forecasting plays an important role in the theory and application of oil supply chain management for profit maximization and risk minimization. However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has compelled governments worldwide to impose restrictions, consequently forcing the closure of most social and economic activities. The latter leads to the volatility of the oil markets and poses a huge challenge to oil market forecasting. Fortunately, the social media information can finely reflect oil market factors and exogenous factors, such as conflicts and political instability. Accordingly, this study collected vast online oil news and used convolutional neural network to extract relevant information automatically. Oil markets are divided into four categories: oil price, oil production, oil consumption, and oil inventory. A total of 16,794; 9,139; 8,314; and 8,548 news headlines were collected in four respective cases. Experimental results indicate that social media information contributes to the forecasting of oil price, oil production and oil consumption. The mean absolute percentage errors are respectively 0.0717, 0.0144 and 0.0168 for the oil price, production, and consumption prediction during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Eczema incidence was defined as the first\\\\ever diagnosis of eczema recorded in the primary care record, and eczema prevalence was defined as fulfilment of criteria for active eczema (two eczema records appearing in the primary care record within any one\\\\year period). RESULTS: Eczema incidence was highest in infants younger than 1 year (15.0 per 100 person\\\\years), lowest in adults aged 40C49 (0.35 p/100 person\\\\years), and increased from middle age to a second smaller peak in people 80 years or older (0.79 p/100 person\\\\years). Eczema prevalence was highest in children aged 2 (16.5%) and lowest in adults aged 30C39 (2.8%). Eczema incidence was higher in male infants (<2) and male adults older than 70; for all other ages, incidence was higher in females. Eczema was more common in Asian and black ethnic groups than in people of white ethnicity. Higher socio\\\\economic status was associated with a greater incidence of eczema in infants younger than 2, but the reverse was seen for all other age groups. Both incidence and prevalence of eczema were greater in urban settings and in North\\\\West England. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Eczema has a bimodal distribution across the lifespan.

This standard is intended to serve as a reference reagent against which serological tests can be calibrated, thus creating better comparability of results between different tests, laboratories, etc. Here, we have examined three different commercial ELISA kits for the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, namely the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac ELISA (IgG) (Euroimmun, Lbeck, Germany), the SERION ELISA agile (Institut Virion Serion, Wrzburg, Germany), and the COVID-19 quantitative IgG ELISA (DeMediTec Diagnostics, Kiel, Germany). According to the manufacturers, all are calibrated against the WHO IS and can provide results in either international units (IU) (DeMediTec) or arbitrary antibody units (BAU) per milliliter (Euroimmun, Virion Serion), which are numerically identical, according to the WHO. A total of 50 serum samples from vaccinated individuals were tested side by side and according to the manufacturers instructions. We compared the test results of all three assays with each other to assess comparability and with a quantitative in-house virus neutralization test (micro-NT). In summary, our data are consistent with other studies published on this topic that tested similar assays from different manufacturers. Overall, the agreement between quantitative ELISAs is variable and cannot be used interchangeably despite calibration against a standard. Therefore, interpretation of results must still be individualized and tailored to each case.

Following widespread compliance with initial lockdowns (90.7% reported high or very high compliance), as few as 60.1% of participants indicated that they would comply with a fourth lockdown if the government decides to enact it. Non-vaccinated individuals reported the lowest levels of compliance with previous lockdowns, compared to participants who received one or two vaccines and participants vaccinated with three doses. Adjusted for gender and age, the results suggest that fearing being infected with COVID-19, perceiving the vaccine to be effective, and reporting being compliant with other health behaviorssuch as mask wearing and maintaining social distance from othersare predictors of lockdown compliance. Considering the effect of pandemic lockdown fatigue, there is little support for additional lockdowns among the Israeli public, unless dramatic changes occur in the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Most parents (92.7%) in the study reported that their children had online learning experiences during the pandemic, and many (84.6%) spent less than a half-hour each time. The parents generally had negative beliefs about the values and benefits of online learning and preferred traditional learning in early childhood settings. They tended to resist and even reject online learning for three key reasons: the shortcomings of online learning, young children's inadequate self-regulation, and their lack of time and professional knowledge in supporting children's online learning. Also, the hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has made them suffering, thus more resistant to online learning at home.

Nevertheless, this type of study may impose significant risk without potential benefit for those in the sham group. The aim of the current study was to systematically review and analyze the endoscopic literature to assess the safety of sham controls. METHODS MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched for endoscopic sham procedures for all dates to July 2017. Only randomized controlled trials comparing an endoscopic therapy with a sham were included. Primary outcome was adverse events (AEs) categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. Results were combined using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic, and publication bias was assessed with the Egger test and funnel plots. RESULTS Data were extracted from 34 publications (1987-2017; 100% full text), with a total of 2492 procedures (1355 treatment/1137 sham). Sham procedures involved upper endoscopy (31 studies) and ERCP (3 studies). Treatment arms included procedures with the following indications: weight loss (38.2%), GI bleeding (26.5%), GERD (20.6%), sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (8.8%), and dysphagia (6.2%). Overall percentage of severe adverse events (SAEs) in the sham group was 1.7% (19/1137). Of these, the most common SAEs in the sham groups were need for surgery/intensive care unit stay (35.3%), post-ERCP pancreatitis (23.5%), and perforation (11.8%). There was no significant difference in the odds of developing an SAE between the treatment group and the sham group (odds ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-2.3).

The analysis shows that the mask mandate is consistently associated with lower infection rates in the short term, and its early adoption boosts the long-term efficacy. By contrast, the other five policy instruments?domestic lockdowns, international travel bans, mass gathering bans, and restaurant and school closures?show weaker efficacy. Governments prepared for a public health crisis with stronger resilience or capacity and those with stronger collectivist cultures were quicker to adopt nationwide mask mandates. From a policy design perspective, policymakers must avoid overreacting with less effective instruments and underreacting with more effective ones during uncertain times, especially when interventions differ in efficacy and cost.

Oxygen saturations (Sao(2)) may be useful in determining which febrile infants require chest x-rays (CXR) in investigation for bacterial pneumonia (PNA). This study aimed to determine whether Sao(2) is clinically useful in excluding bacterial PNA in febrile infants <24 months. METHODS A febrile infant registry was instituted at a tertiary care military hospital (55,000 annual patients, 27% children) from December 2002-December 2003. Eligible patients consisted of infants <3 months with temperature 38C or 3-24 months with temperature 39C. Bacterial PNA was defined in this cohort by a CXR revealing a 'lobar infiltrate' by a board-certified radiologist. Descriptive statistics are presented on groups who received CXR versus groups who did not, and on infants who had bacterial PNA versus those who did not. Student t tests were used to compare maximum temperature (Tmax), RR, and Sao(2). Logistic regression for PNA was performed using age, sex, Tmax, RR, HR and Sao(2). A Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve was created to show Sao(2) cut-off points as related to sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS 985 patients (55% boys; median age: 12 months) met entry criteria. 790 underwent CXR and 82 were diagnosed with bacterial PNA. Sao(2) was lower in infants with bacterial PNA (96.6%2.5% vs 97.7%1.8%, p<0.001). Sao(2) was also predictive of bacterial PNA by logistic regression (p=0.017) but the ROC curve yielded a poor sensitivity/specificity profile (area under curve (AUC) of 0.6786).

We used community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) as a benchmark to define the processes that occur in a bacterial pulmonary infection, and tested the hypothesis that baseline inflammatory markers and their response to antibiotic therapy could distinguish CAP from COVID-19. MethodsIn patients admitted to Royal Free Hospital (RFH) and Barnet Hospital (BH) we defined CAP by lobar consolidation on chest radiograph, and COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 detection by PCR. Data were derived from routine laboratory investigations. ResultsOn admission all CAP and >90% COVID-19 patients received antibiotics. We identified 106 CAP and 619 COVID-19 patients at RFH. CAP was characterised by elevated white cell count (WCC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to COVID-19 (median WCC 12.48 (IQR 8.2-15.3) vs 6.78 (IQR 5.2-9.5) x106 cells/ml and median CRP CRP 133.5 (IQR 65-221) vs 86 (IQR 42-160) mg/L). Blood samples collected 48-72 hours into admission revealed decreasing CRP in CAP but not COVID-19 (CRP difference -33 (IQR -112 to +3.5) vs +15 (IQR -15 to +70) mg/L respectively). In the independent validation cohort (BH) consisting of 169 CAP and 181 COVID-19 patients, admission WCC >8.2x106 cells/ml or falling CRP during admission identified 95% of CAP cases, and predicted the absence of bacterial co-infection in 45% of COVID-19 patients. ConclusionsWe propose that in COVID-19 the absence of both elevated baseline WCC and antibiotic-related decrease in CRP can exclude bacterial co-infection and facilitate antibiotic stewardship efforts.","output":"Exclusion of bacterial co-infection in COVID-19 using baseline inflammatory markers and their response to antibiotics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Huashi Baidu Formula (HSBDF) is a traditional Chinese medicine formula consisting of fourteen parts, which has been proven effective for treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinically. However, the therapeutic mechanism of the effect of HSBDF on COVID-19 remains unclear. METHODS: The components and action targets of HSBDF were searched in the TCMSP, YaTCM, PubChem, and TargetNet databases. Disease targets related to ACE2 were screened in single-cell sequence data of colon epithelial cells from other reports. The therapeutic targets of HSBDF for COVID-19 were obtained by integrated analysis, and the protein-protein interaction was analyzed using the STRING database. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) processes were analyzed using the OmicsBean and Metascape databases. The communication between networks [component-target (C-T) network, component-target-pathway (C-T-P) network, herb-target (H-T) network, target-pathway (T-P) network, and meridian-tropism (M-T) network] was constructed by Cytoscape software. The Cloud computing molecular docking platform was used to verify the molecular docking. RESULTS: The obtained 223 active ingredients and 358 targets of HSBDF. The 5,555 COVID-19 disease targets related to ACE2 were extracted, and 84 compound-disease common targets were found, of which the principal targets included ACE, ESR1, ADRA1A, and HDAC1. A total of 3,946 items were seized by GO enrichment analysis, mainly related to metabolism, protein binding, cellular response to the stimulus, and receptor activity. The enriched KEGG pathways screened 46 signaling pathways, including the renin-angiotensin system, the renin secretion, NF-kappa B pathway, the arachidonic acid metabolism, and the AMPK signaling pathway. The molecular docking results showed that the bioactive components of HSBDF have an excellent binding ability with main proteins related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). CONCLUSIONS: HSBDF might act on SARS-CoV-2 through multiple components, targets, and pathways.

The leading products, Fst-A,-B and-F (arenarioside), can be found also in > 90 other plants inventoried here. The pharmacological properties of Fst are reviewed, with emphasis on their anticancer, antiviral, and antibacterial activities, which essentially derive from their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Fst-B functions as a potential binder of the repressor protein Kelch-like ECH-association protein 1 (Keap 1), thus promoting the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) implicated in the subsequent activation of the production of antioxidant enzymes and repression of the oxidative stress. The regulation of the Nrf2/Heme oxygenase-1 pathway is the central piece of the multifaceted mechanism of action of Fst-A/B. Their prominent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects support the use of these compounds in different inflammation-related diseases and conditions, from sepsis to neuroprotection and many other pathologies discussed here. In addition, these properties contribute to the antiviral action of the compounds.

To help mobilize CBKs, we describe our efforts to outline metadata categories to make CBKs FAIR+T. METHODS: We examined the literature regarding metadata with the potential to make digital artifacts FAIR+T. We also examined metadata available online today for actual CBKs of 12 different types. With iterative refinement, we came to a consensus on key categories of metadata that, when taken together, can make CBKs FAIR+T. We use subject\\\\predicate\\\\object triples to more clearly differentiate metadata categories. RESULTS: We defined 13 categories of CBK metadata most relevant to making CBKs FAIR+T. Eleven of these categories (type, domain, purpose, identification, location, CBK\\\\to\\\\CBK relationships, technical, authorization and rights management, provenance, evidential basis, and evidence from use metadata) are evident today where CBKs are stored online. Two additional categories (preservation and integrity metadata) were not evident in our examples. We provide a research agenda to guide further study and development of these and other metadata categories.

METHODS: With the hypothesis that upper airway immune and epithelial cell responses are also distinct, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) on nasal wash cells freshly collected from adults with either acute COVID-19 or influenza or from healthy controls. We focused on major cell types and subtypes in a subset of donor samples. RESULTS: Nasal wash cells were enriched for macrophages and neutrophils for both individuals with influenza and those with COVID-19 compared with healthy controls. Hillock-like epithelial cells, M2-like macrophages, and age-dependent B cells were enriched in COVID-19 samples. A global decrease in IFN-associated transcripts in neutrophils, macrophages, and epithelial cells was apparent in COVID-19 samples compared with influenza samples. The innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 appears to be maintained in macrophages, despite evidence for limited epithelial cell immune sensing. Cell-to-cell interaction analyses revealed a decrease in epithelial cell interactions in COVID-19 and highlighted differences in macrophage-macrophage interactions for COVID-19 and influenza.

This epidemiological 'curve' refers to the cases versus time graph, which shows the rise of a disease to its peak before descending. The aim in a pandemic is to flatten this curve by reducing the peak and spreading out the timeline. However, the models used to predict this curve are often not clearly outlined, no model parameters are given, and models are not tested against real data. This lack of detail makes it difficult to recreate the curve. What is much needed is a simple tool for approximating the curve to allow ideas to be tested and comparisons made. Methods This work presents a Simple Curve Approximation Tool (SCAT) which can be used by anyone. This tool allows the user to approximate and draw the curve and allows testing of assumptions, trajectories and the wildly varying figures reported in the media. The mathematics behind SCAT is clearly outlined here but understanding of this is not required. SCAT is provided online as a downloadable MS Excel workbook with some sample cases shown. Throughout this work, the parameters used are specified so that all results can be easily reproduced. Findings Although not intended as a prediction tool, SCAT has achieved less than 0.5 % error in short-term forward prediction. It also shows a very significant improvement on the pandemic exponential approximations found throughout media reporting. As a comparison tool, it highlights obvious differences between COVID-19 and other diseases, such as influenza, and between countries at different stages of the pandemic (China, Italy and the UK are used here for demonstration purposes).

As alpelisib is a relatively new therapeutic option, specific guidance and a multidisciplinary approach are needed to provide optimal patient care. The primary objective of this manuscript is to provide comprehensive guidance on minimizing and managing adverse events (AEs) for patients with advanced breast cancer who are receiving alpelisib. METHODS: Clinical studies, prescribing information, published literature, and relevant guidelines were reviewed to provide recommendations on the prevention and management of alpelisib-associated AEs. RESULTS: The most common AEs associated with alpelisib in the phase 3 SOLAR-1 trial were hyperglycemia and rash (which are considered on-target effects of PI3K inhibition) and gastrointestinal AEs, including diarrhea, nausea, and decreased appetite. These AEs require regular monitoring, early recognition, and prompt initiation of appropriate treatment. In addition, there are effective strategies to reduce the onset and severity of frequently observed AEsin particular, onset of hyperglycemia and rash may be reduced by lifestyle changes (such as reduced intake of carbohydrates and regular exercise) and antihistamine prophylaxis, respectively. To reduce risk of severe hyperglycemia, it is essential to achieve adequate glycemic control prior to initiation of alpelisib treatment.

In this work, we study the effects of 4-methylumbelliferone (4Mu) on TME and how this change could be exploited to promote a potent immune response against HCC. First, we observed that 4Mu therapy induced a switch of hepatic macrophages (M?) towards an M1 type profile, and HCC cells (Hepa129 cells) exposed to conditioned medium (CM) derived from M? treated with 4Mu showed reduced expression of several CSCs markers and aggressiveness. HCC cells incubated with CM derived from M? treated with 4Mu grew in immunosuppressed mice while presented delayed tumor progression in immunocompetent mice. HCC cells treated with 4Mu were more susceptible to phagocytosis by DCs, and when DCs were pulsed with HCC cells previously treated with 4Mu displayed a potent antitumoral effect in therapeutic vaccination protocols.

The aim of this report is to present an unusual case of a severe COVID-19 patient managed at home in a developing country, and to discuss some of the available guidelines and potential therapeutic options for this type of cases. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old female seeking medical attention through teleconsultation presents with profound dyspnea, oppressive chest pain, fatigue, episodic hallucinations, and difficulty sleeping, for what she originally sought medical attention at an ER but could not be admitted due to saturation of the health system. A positive PCR test for COVID-19, and a CT scan of the chest showing bilateral consolidations with ground-glass opacities confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was managed at home, with corticosteroids, nitazoxanide and a single dose of 40 mg of subcutaneous enoxaparin. Colchicine was added at the third day of treatment. Standard oxygen therapy through nasal cannula was also recommended. Daily follow-ups were established to monitor for signs of clinical improvement. Two weeks later from the initial consultation the patient presents marked improvement in her symptoms, as well as in her CT scan, which prompted in discontinuation of the medications and the oxygen therapy. CONCLUSIONS: There are several limitations in this report regarding the clinical data and the management, but such limitations do also reflect the state of emergency and the chaos that resides in the health care systems of developing nations. For the ambulatory care of COVID-19 patients, several aspects of disease management may differ from current guidelines and basic requirements may represent a huge challenge to cover. Further research is needed to assist physicians in the daily clinical decision making, to optimize patient outcomes, and to reduce the probability of adverse scenarios of patients with COVID-19 managed in the ambulatory setting.","output":"The unusual experience of managing a severe COVID-19 case at home: what can we do and where do we go?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The SARS COVID-19 is a highly transmittable and pathogenic viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2.

We included studies that reported sufficient data to estimate the effect of any form of eye protection including face shields and variants, goggles, and glasses, on subsequent confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2. Findings: We screened 898 articles and included 6 reports of 5 observational studies from 4 countries (USA, India, Columbia, and United Kingdom) that tested face shields, googles and wraparound eyewear on 7567 healthcare workers. The three before-and-after and one retrospective cohort studies showed statistically significant and substantial reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infections favouring eye protection with odds ratios ranging from 0.04 to 0.6, corresponding to relative risk reductions of 96% to 40%. These reductions were not explained by changes in the community rates. However, the one case-control study reported odds ratio favouring no eye protection (OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.99, 3.0). The high heterogeneity between studies precluded any meaningful meta-analysis. None of the studies adjusted for potential confounders such as other protective behaviours, thus increasing the risk of bias, and decreasing the certainty of evidence to very low.

The virus can be fatal to wildlife and contributes to economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. National surveillance efforts in the US use serology to detect PrV-specific antibodies in feral swine populations, but PrV exposure is not a direct indicator of pathogen transmission among conspecifics or to non-suid wildlife species. We measured antibody production and the presence of PrV DNA in four tissue types from feral swine populations of Florida, US. We sampled blood, nasal, oral, and genital swabs from 551 individuals at 39 sites during 2014-16. Of the animals tested for antibody production, 224 of 436 (51%) feral swine were antibody positive while 38 of 549 feral swine (7%) tested for viral shedding were quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-positive for PrV. The detection of PrV DNA across all the collected sample types (blood, nasal, oral, and genital [vaginal] swabs) suggested viral shedding via direct (oronasal or venereal), and potentially indirect (through carcass consumption), routes of transmission among infected and susceptible animals. Fourteen of 212 seronegative feral swine were qPCR-positive, indicating 7% false negatives in the serologic assay. Our findings suggest that serology may underestimate the actual infection risk posed by feral swine to other species and that feral swine populations in Florida are capable of shedding the virus through multiple routes.","output":"EVIDENCE OF PSEUDORABIES VIRUS SHEDDING IN FERAL SWINE ( SUS SCROFA) POPULATIONS OF FLORIDA, USA."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cell-mediated protective and pathogenic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection remain largely elusive.

Here the clinical application of a new technique for transanal access is reported. METHODS Consecutive non-selected patients eligible for TEM over a 3-month period (and selected patients thereafter) were offered a procedure performed via a 'glove TEM port'. This access device was constructed on-table using a circular anal dilator (CAD), wound retractor and standard surgical glove, along with standard, straight laparoscopic trocar sleeves and instruments. RESULTS Fourteen patients underwent full-thickness resection of benign (8) or malignant (6) rectal pathology. CAD insertion failed in one patient and conventional TEM assistance was needed in another, leaving 12 procedures completed successfully by glove TEM alone as planned (completion rate 86 per cent overall, 92 per cent after initiation).

The toughest issue traumatic orthopaedic surgeons are faced with is how to maintain a balance between adequate COVID-19 screening and timely surgery. In this study, we described our experience with pre-operative COVID-19 screening in patients with traumatic fractures. Furthermore, we analysed the clinical results of fracture patients undergoing confined or emergency surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This was a case series study. Patients with traumatic fractures who were admitted to our hospital for surgery were enrolled in this study during the COVID-19 outbreak from March to April 2020. All patients were enrolled and managed using the standardized clinical pathway we designed for preoperative COVID-19 screening. Clinical, laboratory and outcome data were analysed. RESULTS: The average surgery waiting time from injury to surgery was 8.7  3.4 days. The average waiting time from admission to surgery was 5.3  2.8 days. These average waiting times were increased by 4.1 days and 2.0 days, respectively, compared with 2019 data. Cardiovascular complications, venous thromboembolism and pneumonia occurred in one, two and one patient, respectively. Three and two patients developed pre-operative and postoperative fevers, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We introduced a novel clinical pathway for pre-operatively screening of COVID-19 in traumatic orthopaedic patients. The delay in surgery caused by COVID-19 screening was minimized to a point at which reasonable and acceptable clinical outcomes were achieved.

Various studies have proven functional role of TET2 mutations in AML. We herein studied the frequency and genotype-phenotype correlation of TET2 gene in AML patients in Sindh, Pakistan. Patients and methods The current study was carried out at Liaquat University of Medical & Health Sciences, Jamshoro, Pakistan, in collaboration with National Institute of Blood Disease & Bone Marrow Transplant, Karachi, Pakistan, during the period from June 2019 to June 2020. A total of 130 patients diagnosed with AML were screened for TET2 mutations. Whole exome sequencing of 14 individuals was carried out to find the genetic variants in TET2 gene. The pathogenicity of the variants was predicted by SIFT, PolyPhen2, Mutation Taster and CADD Phred scores. The allele frequency of the variants was compared with global population using 1000 genomes project and Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). Furthermore, exon 3 and exon 5 of the TET2 gene were sequenced by using Sanger sequencing. The findings were correlated with subtypes of AML and corresponding karyotypes. Results Through the exome sequencing, 17 genetic variants (13 SNPs and four indels) were identified in 14 individuals. Of these, four variants that is, one frameshift deletion, one frameshift insertion and two nonsense variants were novel and not present in dbSNP151 database. Three novel variants were found in exon 3 including two frameshift variants that is, p.T395fs and G494fs, predicted as deleterious by CADD Phred scores, and one stop-gain variant (p.G898X) predicted as deleterious by Mutation Taster and CADD Phred scores. One novel non sense variant (p.Q1191X) was found in the exon 5 predicted as deleterious by SIFT, Mutation Taster and CADD Phred scores. Sanger sequencing analysis revealed one novel deletion at g105233851: del.TAGATAGA, and one novel SNP g;105233861 T>G identified in the TET2 gene. Majority of the exon 3 mutations were seen in the patients diagnosed with AML with maturation, and had a normal karyotype. Conclusion TET2 mutations were identified in around 16% of the total patients of our study indicating other mechanisms being involved in pathophysiology of AML in this cohort.

This study proposes Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) as a possible factor for the anti-diabetic mechanism after sleeve gastrectomy (SG). MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasma TXNIP level in obesity patients with diabetes (T2D, N = 20), obesity patients without diabetes (NDO, N = 20), and patients without obesity and diabetes (lean, N = 10) were assessed before surgery and at 1 and 12 months after SG. RESULTS Preoperative TXNIP level was significantly higher in T2D (196.4  76.0 pg/ml) and NDO (149.7  94.1 pg/ml) patients when compared with lean patients (98.7  22.7 pg/ml) (p-value < 0.05). At 1 month and 12 months postoperatively, the TXNIP levels were reduced significantly from the preoperative levels in the T2D and NDO patients (p-value < 0.05). Before surgery, a correlation between TXNIP and fasting blood glucose (FBG) (r2 = 0.1585, p-value = 0.0109), HbA1C (r2 = 0.2120, p-value = 0.0028), and insulin (r2 = 0.1217, p-value = 0.0274) was observed. At 12 months after surgery, the reduction of TXNIP was also correlated with the degree of FBG (r2 = 0.1038, p-value = 0.0426), HbA1C (r2 = 0.2459, p-value = 0.0011), and insulin (r2 = 0.1365, p-value = 0.0190) reduction. CONCLUSION Plasma TXNIP level is elevated in obesity patients with/without diabetes. SG resulted in a significant reduction of plasma TXNIP level which is correlated with the degree of FBG, HbA1C, and insulin reduction.

Dysregulated systemic inflammation and various patient traits are presumed to underlie this anomaly. Optimal VTE prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients has not been established due to a lack of validated models for predicting VTE in this population. Our study aims to address this deficiency by identifying demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients associated with increased VTE risk. METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of all adult patients (final sample, n = 355) hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 at Einstein Medical Center Philadelphia between March 1 and April 24, 2020. Demographic and clinical patient data were collected and factors associated with VTE were identified and analyzed using t-tests, multivariable logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Thirty patients (8.5%) developed VTE. Patients with VTE had significantly higher D-dimer levels on admission (P = 0.045) and peak D-dimer levels (P < 0.0001), in addition to higher rates of vasopressor requirements (P = 0.038), intubation (P = 0.003), and death (P = 0.023). Age (OR 1.042), obstructive sleep apnea (OR 5.107), and need for intubation (OR 3.796) were associated with significantly increased odds of VTE. Peak D-dimer level was a good predictor of VTE (AUC 0.806, P < 0.0001) and a D-dimer cutoff of >6640 ng/mL had high (>70%) sensitivity and specificity for VTE. CONCLUSION: Peak D-dimer level may be the most reliable clinical marker in COVID-19 patients for predicting VTE and future prospective studies should attempt to further validate this.","output":"Predictors of venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 in an underserved urban population: A single tertiary center experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Omicron has more than twenty new mutations in the S1 domain of the spike gene as compared to the other previously known variants of SARS-CoV-2.

All consecutive patients  18 years admitted with cardiogenic shock and supported with VA-ECMO between 2015 and 2019 in our tertiary care hospital were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: The study included 106 patients with a mean age of 40.2  14.4 years, a mean BMI of 26.5  7 and mostly males (69.8%). The in-hospital mortality occurred in 56.6% and acute cerebral strokes occurred in 25.5% of the enrolled patients. The non-survivors and the patients with acute cerebral strokes had significantly higher arterial lactate levels at pre-ECMO initiation, post-ECMO peak and after 24 h of ECMO support compared to the survivors and those without strokes, respectively.

The challenge for universities is to diversify funding sources, develop effective approaches to minimize existing and prevent future threats to ensure their financial stabilization (sustainability) in the post-pandemic period. The paper aims to consider financial sustainability of a university (the case of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv) due to COVID-19 using the objective calculative approach on the statistical sample of data for 2011-2020. The tasks for achieving the aim are seen in determining, using regression methods, the number of lost receipts from general and special funds in the short and medium term, which will maintain a constant value of receipts at constant assets. The main idea of the paper is that financial sustainability is considered as a condition, and stabilization is considered as a process towards stability/sustainability. The modeling approach reveals a fragile list of factors for the future preventing measures of the University to sustain. It is estimated that the University's top management should consider financial strategy in dollar terms only. The challenge is that funding in hryvnia seems to be quite increasing and linear, but indeed, funding of the University is non-linear and has a quite intensive downward trend. Thus, for the financial sustainability strategy, this fact should be crucial.

Methods: A self-administrated questionnaire was used in this online survey through social networks during March 19th to 26th, 2020 (n = 2550). A Likert scoring scale was employed to investigate barriers and drivers affecting the participants' preventive behaviors. Using personal protective equipment and good hand hygiene practices were identified as person-based measures. Social distancing and the restriction of social and economic activities during the past two months were determined as community-based measures. Univariate logistic regression and multiple - logistic regression were used to identify and assess influencing factors. Results: The study results indicated that 2426 (95.1%) of the participants intended to restrict their social and economic activities, and 1968 (72.2%), 1637 (64.2%), and 2492 (97.7%) persons intended to observe social distancing, use personal protective equipment, and have good hand hygiene, respectively.

For PDMS characterization, water contact angle measurements and tests for flexibility, stretchability, bond strength, comfortability, and bendability were conducted to confirm the surface properties of the different mixing ratios of PDMS. By using human body heat, the wearable RPA microdevices were successfully applied to amplify 210 bp from Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) and 203 bp from the DNA plasmid SARS-CoV-2 within 23 min. The limit of detection (LOD) was approximately 500 pg/reaction for genomic DNA template (E. coli O157:H7), and 600 fg/reaction for plasmid DNA template (SARS-CoV-2), based on gel electrophoresis. The wearable RPA microdevice could have a high impact on DNA amplification in instrument-free and resource-limited settings.","output":"Fabrication of Wearable PDMS Device for Rapid Detection of Nucleic Acids via Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Operated by Human Body Heat"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-hepatotropic viruses cause acute hepatitis and/or acute liver failure, without causing any chronic damage to the liver. These viruses do not primarily target the liver. These viruses include the herpes viruses (Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus), parvovirus, adenovirus, influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus. The risk of acquiring infection from any of the non-hepatotropic viruses is specific to each virus. Infection with the herpesviruses is ubiquitous, with clinically significant hepatitis being less common. Considerations for determining the risk of hepatitis from non-hepatotropic viruses include prior exposure (risk of reactivation), host immune status (increase severity in immunosuppressed), and duration of infection in the contact. Diagnosis is made with a combination of serology, polymerase chain reaction, or liver biopsy. Treatment is supportive in the majority. In certain clinical scenarios, such as cytomegalovirus infection in transplant patients, and acute liver failure from herpes simplex virus, specific antiviral therapy is warranted.","output":"Viral Hepatitis: Other Viral Hepatides"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: At the time of writing, we are all coping with the global COVID-19 pandemic.

To control the epidemic, all the state governments in the United States took the mask mandates to ask people to wear masks in public. However, many people doubt if the mask can help them prevent the spread of the virus, and there are few researches about the effectiveness of the mask mandates in each state. To tackle this issue, this paper proposed an evaluating system for the effectiveness of mask mandate in each state in the U.S.A, which can be utilized to analyze whether mask mandates can slow down the spread of the virus. And if the effectiveness of mask mandates is different in different states, this paper will continue to find out which factor can most affect the effectiveness. The experimental results demonstrated that even though the new cases in some states still increased after the mask mandates, it can be seemed that the mask mandates do control the spread of the virus in general. According to the research, the paper can find that the most influential factor to the effectiveness is the infection rate. There are also some secondary factors to the effectiveness of mask mandates. Through these researches, they can analyze the result to develop more effective mandates to control the epidemic and help governments and companies develop new products to fit the needs during the epidemic.","output":"Evaluating System for Effectiveness of Mask Mandates and the Most Influential Factor in Each State in the U.S.A"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an epidemic virus arising from a freshly discovered coronavirus. Most people involved with the coronavirus will experience slight to moderate respiratory disease and recover without needing particular therapy. In this work, the atomic stability of the coronavirus at different thermodynamic properties such as temperature and pressure, was studied. For this purpose, the manner of this virus by atomic precession was described with a molecular dynamics approach. For the atomic stability of coronavirus description, physical properties such as temperature, total energy, volume variation, and atomic force of this structure were reported. In molecular dynamics approach, coronavirus is precisely simulated via S, O, N, and C atoms and performed Dreiding force field to describe these atoms interaction in the virus. Simulation results show that coronavirus stability has reciprocal relation with atomic temperature and pressure. Numerically, after 2.5 ns simulation, the potential energy varies from - 31,163 to - 26,041 eV by temperature changes from 300 to 400 K. Furthermore, this physical parameter decreases to - 28,045 eV rate at 300 K and 2 bar pressure. The volume of coronavirus is another crucial parameter to the stability description of this structure.

During the course of the disease, other extra-pulmonary manifestations have been reported in the literature including pancreatic involvement such as acute pancreatitis. This phenomenon linking COVID-19 and acute pancreatitis has been reported by several case reports and cohort studies. No cases had been reported in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. We report one more case Of COVID-19 induced acute pancreatitis in a Malagasy woman patient without risk factors, further consolidating the existing evidence. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old woman was diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and had a favorable course under home isolation and drug treatments. One week later, the patient was admitted to hospital with severe acute abdominal pain. Acute pancreatitis was considered according to the revised Atlanta criteria with the presence of the three criteria. Other etiologies of acute pancreatitis (lithiasis, alcohol, hypercalcemia, hypertriglyceridemia, tumor, trauma, surgery) were excluded. Ultimately, a COVID-19 induced acute pancreatitis was retained. The outcome was favorable under symptomatic medical treatment (fluid resuscitation, bowel rest, management of pain and vomiting, and early oral feeding). The patient was discharged after one week of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is a possible etiology of acute pancreatitis.

Multitudes of endeavor have been contrived during the last decennium in the field of noninvasive tests to rule out heart transplant rejection (HTR). In spite of having supportive literature, noninvasive imaging techniques lack acceptable documentation of clinical robustness, and endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) still remains the gold standard. The aim of this review is to shed light on the existing noninvasive radiological modalities to detect rejection among heart transplant recipients. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted for this review article on the basis of literature available including scientific databases of PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar, using keywords of Heart transplantation, Acute allograft rejection, Arrhythmias, Echocardiography, Speckle tracking echocardiography, and Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging from inception until September 2020. Results After preliminary screening of the databases, details regarding existent noninvasive radiological modalities to detect HTR were gathered and compiled in this review article. Currently, deformation imaging using speckle tracking and T2 time using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can serve as screening tools based on which further invasive investigations can be planned. Standardization of blood-based and imaging modalities as screening and possible diagnostic tools for rejection would have obvious clinical and financial benefits in the care of growing number of post heart transplant recipients in our country. Conclusion Diagnosis of allograft rejection in heart transplant recipients through noninvasive techniques is demanding. To unravel the potential of noninvasive radiological modalities that can serve as a standard-of-care test, a prospective multicentric study randomizing noninvasive modality as first strategy versus current EMB-based gold standard of care is the need of the hour.","output":"Insight into Noninvasive Radiological Modalities to Detect Heart Transplant Rejection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A plethora of literature have existed on disruptive technologies revealing its relevance in academia and application in the field of engineering education The directions of possible problems of the application in the field of engineering education however are still obscured despite the abundant available literature with different opinions and inconsistent results which necessitates a review to harmonize the challenges and prospects to ensure continuity of study during this COVID-19 health crisis in emerging economies In this work, disruptive engineering education in emerging economies is thus investigated and reviewed, and the challenges and prospects are examined and presented The work also presents the emerging trends in disruptive engineering, proposes some solutions to overcome the key challenges by giving some novel recommendations on technical requirements and potential enablers ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Disruptive Engineering and Education in Emerging Economies: Challenges and Prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Irving Medical Center were heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic Various measures were taken in an effort to ensure patient and staff safety The management of patients with complex dermatological oncologic conditions, such as cutaneous lymphomas was especially challenging We retrospectively reviewed the charts of the patients with cutaneous lymphomas who had COVID-19 (n=7) as well as those who did not have COVID-19 (n=26) from March to September 2020 Due to safety protocols, 4/7 (57%) patients who contracted COVID-19 experienced a treatment interruption Three patients had no treatment interruptions because the timing of their COVID-related illness and scheduled treatments did not overlap Treatment was delayed for a mean 2 1 months (range: 10 days - 4 months) Two out of four (50%) patients with treatment delays experienced disease relapse Of the patients who did not have COVID-19, 12 patients experienced treatment delays, and ten (83 3%) of those patients experienced disease progression or relapse Fourteen patients continued in hospital treatments with no delay, and 2 (14 3%) patients experienced disease progression or relapse Of the total patients included in this review, 16 (48 5%) experienced a treatment Delay Twelve patients (12/16 or 75%) had disease relapse or progression following treatment delays In contrast, among the 17 patients who did not experience treatment delay, 4 (23 5%) patients had relapse or progression of disease Treatment delay was associated with a significant risk of disease relapse or progression (p=0 0053) No hospital-related cases of COVID-19 were recorded during the six-month capture period Treatment interruptions are associated with negative clinical outcomes Established safety protocols are effective in preventing infections during therapy for cutaneous lymphomas We do not recommend altering treatment regimens for patients with cutaneous lymphomas if safety protocols can be assured","output":"461 A review of cutaneous lymphoma outcomes during COVID-19 pandemic at Columbia University"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This qualitative longitudinal study examined the experiences of people living with HIV who engaged in a structured community-based exercise (CBE) program under the supervision of a fitness coach.

There is ample evidence on the effectiveness of balance training on balance performance in athletic and non-athletic population. However, less is known on potential transfer effects of other training types, such as plyometric jump training (PJT) on measures of balance. Given that PJT is a highly dynamic exercise mode with various forms of jump-landing tasks, high levels of postural control are needed to successfully perform PJT exercises. Accordingly, PJT has the potential to not only improve measures of muscle strength and power but also balance. Objective: To systematically review and synthetize evidence from randomized and non-randomized controlled trials regarding the effects of PJT on measures of balance in apparently healthy participants. Methods: Systematic literature searches were performed in the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS. A PICOS approach was applied to define inclusion criteria, (i) apparently healthy participants, with no restrictions on their fitness level, sex, or age, (ii) a PJT program, (iii) active controls (any sport-related activity) or specific active controls (a specific exercise type such as balance training), (iv) assessment of dynamic, static balance pre- and post-PJT, (v) randomized controlled trials and controlled trials. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. This meta-analysis was computed using the inverse variance random-effects model. The significance level was set at p <0.05. Results: The initial search retrieved 8,251 plus 23 records identified through other sources. Forty-two articles met our inclusion criteria for qualitative and 38 for quantitative analysis (1,806 participants [990 males, 816 females], age range 9C63 years). PJT interventions lasted between 4 and 36 weeks. The median PEDro score was 6 and no study had low methodological quality (3). The analysis revealed significant small effects of PJT on overall (dynamic and static) balance (ES = 0.46; 95% CI = 0.32C0.61; p < 0.001), dynamic (e.g., Y-balance test) balance (ES = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.30C0.71; p < 0.001), and static (e.g., flamingo balance test) balance (ES = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.31C0.67; p < 0.001). The moderator analyses revealed that sex and/or age did not moderate balance performance outcomes. When PJT was compared to specific active controls (i.e., participants undergoing balance training, whole body vibration training, resistance training), both PJT and alternative training methods showed similar effects on overall (dynamic and static) balance (p = 0.534). Specifically, when PJT was compared to balance training, both training types showed similar effects on overall (dynamic and static) balance (p = 0.514). Conclusion: Compared to active controls, PJT showed small effects on overall balance, dynamic and static balance. Additionally, PJT produced similar balance improvements compared to other training types (i.e., balance training). Although PJT is widely used in athletic and recreational sport settings to improve athletes' physical fitness (e.g., jumping; sprinting), our systematic review with meta-analysis is novel in as much as it indicates that PJT also improves balance performance. The observed PJT-related balance enhancements were irrespective of sex and participants' age. Therefore, PJT appears to be an adequate training regime to improve balance in both, athletic and recreational settings.","output":"Effects of Plyometric Jump Training on Balance Performance in Healthy Participants: A Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Serological tests detect antibodies against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the ongoing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Methods: Four fully automated assays, Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total (COV2T) and SARS-CoV-2 IgG (COV2G) were evaluated using 350 pre-pandemic samples and 700 samples from 245 COVID-19 patients (158 hospitalized, 87 outpatients). Results: All tests showed very high diagnostic specificity. Sensitivities in samples collected at least 14 days after disease onset were slightly lower than manufacturers' claims for Roche (93.04%), Abbott (90.83%), and Siemens COV2T (90.26%), and distinctly lower for Siemens COV2G (78.76%). Concordantly negative results were enriched for immunocompromised patients. ROC curve analyses suggest a lowering of the cut-off index for the Siemens COV2G assay. Finally, the combination of two anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays is feasible when considering borderline reactive results. Conclusions: Thorough on-site evaluation of commercially available serologic tests for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 remains imperative for laboratories.

The Royal College of Psychiatrists decided to run the final part of the membership exam, the Clinical Assessment of Skills and Competencies (CASC) online for the first time in September 2020. We aimed to prepare candidates in the Northern Ireland deanery for this by developing a virtual mock examination using the Zoom platform.MethodIn previous years, higher psychiatry trainees in the Northern Ireland deanery have run successful face to face mock examinations to help pre-membership trainees prepare for the CASC. We adapted some of this material to our virtual examination. 16 stations were run in total, in two circuits of eight. These stations were mapped to the Royal College CASC blueprint. Higher trainees were recruited to act as examiners, with core trainees acting as simulated patients. The mock examination was advertised through the local deanery and all candidates sitting in September availed of the opportunity (a total of 8 trainees).Zoom was used as the platform due to ease of use, familiarity and breakout room function. Each station formed one breakout room, and a facilitator moved candidates between rooms and provided timing prompts. Instructions were emailed to candidates in advance.A comfort break was provided between circuits. At the end of the mock examination, everyone was returned to the main room and examiners gave general feedback and tips. Individual feedback was provided by collating mark schemes for each candidate, which included free text feedback, and sending these via email.ResultDespite the evident challenges involved, the mock CASC ran smoothly. There was one minor delay of approximately 3 minutes due to technical difficulties, which was easily recouped. We obtained qualitative feedback from candidates which was positive, with trainees commenting that they felt more at ease  less worried about a digital exam, and that it was efficient and effective.All candidates who sat the mock examination were successful in the face to face CASC sitting which followed in September.ConclusionWe were able to successfully adapt what was previously an in-person mock CASC exam to the new digital format in a way that reflected how the actual CASC exam will run, and it was considered beneficial preparation by the candidates who sat this mock.

Using data from 650 European regions in 14 countries, I first show that winter school holidays in late February/early March 2020 (weeks 8, 9 and 10) led to large regional outbreaks of Covid-19 in the spring with the spread being 60% and up-to over 90% higher compared to regions with earlier school holidays. While the impact of these initial large outbreaks fades away over the summer months, it systematically reappears from the fall as regions with school holidays in weeks 8, 9 and 10 had 30C70% higher spread. This suggests that following a large outbreak, there is a strong element of underlying (latent) regional persistence of Covid-19. The strong degree of persistence highlights the long-term benefits of effective (initial) containment policies, as once a large outbreak has occurred, Covid-19 persists. This result emphasizes the need for vaccinations against Covid-19 in regions that have recently experienced large outbreaks but are well below herd-immunity, to avoid a new surge of cases.","output":"How a school holiday led to persistent COVID-19 outbreaks in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten various regions around the world, obtaining accurate and reliable COVID-19 data is crucial for governments and local communities aiming at rigorously assessing the extent and magnitude of the virus spread and deploying efficient interventions.

However, studies investigating whether social capital that controls the effects of population density also influences the infection rate are limited. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the relationship between infection rate, population density, and social capital using statistical data of Japan's every prefecture. Statistical analysis showed that social capital not only negatively correlates with infection rates and population densities, but also negatively correlates with infection rates controlling for the effects of population density. Additionally, controlling the relationship between the variables by mean age showed that social capital had a greater correlation with infection rate than population density. In other words, social capital mediates the relationship between population density and infection rates, indicating that social distancing alone is not enough to deter coronavirus disease; social capital needs to be recharged.","output":"Social Capital Mediates the Relationship between Social Distancing and COVID-19 Prevalence in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Directional root growth control is crucial for plant fitness.

To reduce the impact of unilateral mechanostimulus on roots grown along agar-supplemented medium, we compared the root movement of Col-0 and auxin resistant 1-7 in a root penetration assay to test how both lines adjust the growth patterns of evenly mechanostimulated roots. We combined the assay with the D-root system to reduce light-induced growth deviation. Moreover, the impact of sucrose supplementation in the growth medium was investigated because exogenous sugar enhances root growth deviation in the vertical direction. Overall, we observed a more regular growth pattern for Col-0 but evaluated a higher level of skewing of aux1-7 compared to the wild type than known from published data. Finally, the tracking of the growth rate of the gravistimulated roots revealed that Col-0 has a throttling elongation rate during the bending process, but aux1-7 does not.","output":"Throttling Growth Speed: Evaluation of aux1-7 Root Growth Profile by Combining D-Root system and Root Penetration Assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The first national COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom between March to July 2020 resulted in sudden and unprecedented disruptions to daily life.

The mean age was 69 13 years, the mean baseline NIHSS score was 17  5, and 174 (55%) were men. The ERIC was used as the primary thrombectomy device in 59 (19%) patients. In a propensity score matched analysis including the NIHSS score, clot location, delay to groin puncture, neurointerventionalist, and anesthetic management, 57 matched pairs were identified. RESULTS Patients treated with the ERIC device compared with classic stent retrievers showed equal rates of recanalization (86% versus 81%, P = .61), equal favorable 3-month clinical outcome (mRS 0-2: 46% versus 40%, P = .71), and procedural adverse events (28% versus 30%, P = 1.00).

RESULTS: Thirty-hundred and six patients were hospitalized, median age 65.0 years, 57.8% males, 53.3% Charlson index &#8805;3. The overall all-cause fatality rate was 15.0% (n = 46). Maximum care was provided in 238 (77.8%), IMV was used in 38 patients (16.0%), and 5.5% died. LTE was decided in 68 patients (22.2%), none received IMV and fatality was 48.5%. Independent risk factors of mortality under maximum care were lymphocytes <790/mm3, troponin T >15ng/L and hypotension. Advanced age, lymphocytes <790/mm3 and BNP >240pg/mL independently associated with IMV requirement. CONCLUSION: Overall fatality in the cohort was 15% but markedly varied regarding the decided approach (maximum care versus LTE), translating into nine-fold higher mortality and different risk factors.","output":"Fatality and risk features for prognosis in COVID-19 according to the care approach - a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International law enforcement have noted a rise in the use of the Dark Web to facilitate and commit sexual offenses against children, both prior to and since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The strategy was simple: in times of extreme difficulty a cool head combined with stoicism is an appropriate response to ensure a successful outcome. The latest major challenge to society (COVID-19) met with a very different response, and only history will reveal whether 'Stay home and worry' will be equally effective. In devising blueprints or strategies it is extremely important to have a clear idea of what you are trying to achieve, whether it be maintaining world freedom or stopping a pandemic. In the case of livestock agriculture, it is helping to feed a rapidly growing global population in harmony with the needs of current and future generations. I hope that I have stated this clearly, and calmly. If so, I ask you to picture a scene. We are on a Calm Farm. Dairy animals go about their daily lives contented, unhurried and focused on the simple feeding and socialising activities that are so important to them. Unstressed, their productive capacities and abilities to avoid and, when necessary, cope with physiological and pathological challenges are maximised. They are not alone: the exact same characteristics also apply to the farmer and husbandry staff that we meet. How is this calm farming approach relevant to the aspirations we had when we established the EU COST Action DairyCare? Our objective was to harness the power of computing technologies to assist our management of dairy livestock. A simple rearrangement leads us to Computing Assisted Livestock Management, CALM. In this short Research Reflection I shall assess how far we have come towards the achievement of sensible goals related to technological assessment of dairy animal wellbeing, and speculate on what more things both can and need to be done to finish the job. It is a personal account. DairyCare was a major collaboration involving several hundred active researchers. To involve them all would be impossible, and I do not pretend to speak for them all. As will become evident, the wide skills base that was assembled was so successful in its primary objectives that different skills, chiefly in economics, are now needed to exploit all of the technological advance that has been achieved. DairyCare succeeded in a second direction. Whilst the focus was technology development, by assembling a large cohort of biologists with animal welfare interests, it soon became apparent that technology should run alongside and help to enable improved management practices. This Special Issue is, therefore, in two sections. The first is dedicated to technology development and the second to a novel management practice that has the potential to significantly improve the wellbeing of cows and calves: cow-calf contact rearing. That section is introduced by my DairyCare colleague, Sigrid Agen?s.","output":"DairyCare 'blueprint for action': husbandry for wellbeing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To investigate the influence of low-dose sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5-I), on the function of the mouse lower urinary tract (LUT). MATERIALS AND METHODS Adult male mice were decerebrated and arterially perfused with a carbogenated Ringer's solution to establish the decerebrate arterially perfused mouse (DAPM). To allow distinction between central neural and peripheral actions of sildenafil, experiments were conducted in both the DAPM and in a 'pithed' DAPM, which has no functional brainstem or spinal cord. The action of systemic and intrathecal sildenafil on micturition was assessed in urethane-anaesthetised mice. RESULTS In the DAPM, systemic perfusion of sildenafil (30 pm) decreased the voiding threshold pressure [to a mean (sem) 84.7 (3.8)% of control] and increased bladder compliance [to a mean (sem) 140.2 (8.3)% of control, an effect replicated in the pithed DAPM]. Sildenafil was without effect on most voiding variables but significantly increased the number of bursts of the external urethral sphincter (EUS) per void in DAPM [to a mean (sem) 130.1 (6.9)% of control at 30 pm] and in urethane-anaesthetised mice [to a mean (sem) 117.5 (5.8)% of control at 14 ng/kg]. Sildenafil (10 and 30 pm) increased pelvic afferent activity during both bladder filling and the isovolumetric phase [to a mean (sem) 205.4 (30.2)% of control at 30 pm]. Intrathecal application of sildenafil (5 L of either 150 pm or 1.5 nm) did not alter cystometry and EUS-electromyography variables in urethane-anaesthetised mice. CONCLUSIONS Low-dose sildenafil increases bladder compliance, increases pelvic nerve afferent activity, and augments the bursting activity of the EUS. We propose that the novel actions on afferent traffic and sphincter control may contribute to its beneficial actions to restore storage and voiding efficiency in LUT dysfunction.","output":"Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, augments sphincter bursting and bladder afferent activity to enhance storage function and voiding efficiency in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article presents the results of the Slovenian Public Opinion survey conducted just before the outbreak and during the first and second waves of the epidemic.

More specifically, we are interested in how these perceptions relate to the actual situation of individuals and how the interaction of the two contributes to the dissatisfaction that manifests itself as a willingness to protest. We take as our starting point the theory of relative deprivation, which proves to be relevant in explaining the occurrence of protests in times of crisis. The results of the study confirm the relevance of the theory especially in times of crisis or in the case of unannounced and sudden outbreaks of resentment, when the usual explanatory models of political action are not sufficient. The results show that the main trigger of collective action is not absolute distress, but that protest behaviour can be the result of a relative degree of deprivation in a social group. Therefore, the discrepancy between specific and legitimate expectations for a particular social group (in terms of norms, living standards and social status) and the assessment of whether these expectations are met is important.","output":"The COVID-19 epidemic in Slovenia, attitudes towards inequalities and protest potential"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a preliminary, multicenter, retrospective cohort study, including 272 consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospitals in Buenos Aires Province, between May 15th and July 1st, 2020, included in an expanded access program to convalescent plasma Our objectives were to analyze mortality and its independent risk factors, and to assess the occurrence of a favorable evolution, defined as hospital discharge, or stay at the ward, or transfer from ICU to ward Patients were stratified int o 4 subgroups: admission to the ward with pneumo nia and/or oxygen requirement (WARD;n=100);ICU admission (ICU;n=87);ICU admission with requirement of mechanical ventilation (ICU-MV;n=56), and ICU-MV plus septic shock (ICU-MV-SS;N=29) Mortality at 28 days was 26 1% for the entire group, 14 0% for WARD group, 18 4% for ICU, 44 6% for ICU-MV, and 55 2% for ICU-MV-SS Mean survival time (days) was 25 6+or-0 6 (WARD);25 3+or-0 7 (ICU);20 8+or-1 2 (ICU-MV) and 18 2 +or- 1 8 (ICU-MV-SS) Independent predictors of mortality were MV, septic shock and weight A favorable evolution occurred in 81 4% of WARD patients;in 70 9% of ICU;in 39 6% of ICU-MV and in 27 6% of ICU-MV-SS patients Severity of illness on admission, age, weight and heart rate were independently associated with evolution No major adverse effects were recorded The lack of a control group precluded the estimation of efficacy However, our 26% mortality rate was higher than that of the treatment arm of clinical trials comparing plasma with usual treatment, which might be ascribed to higher proportion of patients with MV and septic shock in our cohort","output":"Convalescent plasma therapy in COVID-19 patients, in the province of Buenos Aire"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 has implications on the overall operation of Macedonian wineries and directly affected the decline in domestic sales and export to international markets.

The aim of this study is to assess survival without incident cancer in a cohort of IBD patients exposed to anti-TNF while having previous malignancy within past 5 years. METHODS Data from IBD patients with previous malignancy diagnosed within the last 5 years before starting an anti-TNF agent were collected through a Groupe d'Etude Thrapeutiques des Affections Inflammatoires du tube Digestif multicenter survey. Inclusion date corresponded to the first anti-TNF administration after cancer diagnosis. RESULTS Twenty centers identified 79 cases of IBD patients with previous malignancy diagnosed 17 months (median; range: 1-65) before inclusion. The most frequent cancer locations were breast (n = 17) and skin (n = 15). After a median follow-up of 21 (range: 1-119) months, 15 (19%) patients developed incident cancer (8 recurrent and 7 new cancers), including 5 basal-cell carcinomas. Survival without incident cancer was 96%, 86%, and 66% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Crude incidence rate of cancer was 84.5 (95% CI, 83.1-85.8) per 1000 patient-years.

Yet, the effectiveness of HBCTR as an alternative to Phase 2 CBCR is unknown. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to quantitatively appraise the effectiveness of HBCTR. METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Scopus, and PsycINFO were searched from inception to January 2021. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HBCTR to Phase 2 CBCR or usual care in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Out of 1588 studies, 14 RCTs involving 2869 CHD patients were included in this review. When compared with usual care, participation in HBCTR showed significant improvement in functional capacity {6-min walking test distance [mean difference (MD) 25.58 m, 95% confidence interval (CI) 14.74C36.42]}; daily step count (MD 1.05 K, 95% CI 0.36C1.75) and exercise habits [odds ratio (OR) 2.28, 95% CI 1.30C4.00)]; depression scores (standardized MD ?0.16, 95% CI ?0.32 to 0.01) and quality of life [Short-Form mental component summary (MD 2.63, 95% CI 0.06C5.20) and physical component summary (MD 1.99, 95% CI 0.83C3.16)].

CONCLUSION: In patients with CHD, HBCTR was associated with an increase in functional capacity, physical activity (PA) behaviour, and depression when compared with UC. When HBCTR was compared to CBCR, an equivalent effect on functional capacity, PA behaviour, QoL, medication adherence, smoking behaviour, physiological risk factors, depression, and cardiac-related hospitalization was observed.","output":"Effectiveness of home-based cardiac telerehabilitation as an alternative to Phase 2 cardiac rehabilitation of coronary heart disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The variable brightness of the night sky affects plants as well as animals and humans. However, knowledge about this variability is still insufficient. Outstanding questions regarding how significant the influence of the moon, clouds, and artificial lighting remain. To be able to make statements about these effects, measurements over a long period of time are necessary. Fraunhofer IOSB performs such measurements in the 380C780 nm photopic visual and 800C1700 nm shortwave infrared spectral range. As the latter is only marginally affected by artificial lighting, a comparison of the two bands deepens insight into the influence of artificial lighting. First analyses show that the moon is, as expected, the dominant light source in the night sky, especially during a full moon. Illuminance values up to 200 mlx and irradiance values up to 600 W/m(2) were measured in the visible and infrared respectively. The influence of clouds is more complicated. The measured intensities depend, among other things, on cloud cover and cloud altitude. When the night sky is overcast, the measured intensities can drop as low as 0.5 mlx and 0.5 W/m(2), respectively. These small values were measured during rainfall. The influence of artificial illumination is difficult to estimate, as intensities in the shortwave infrared decrease with increasing cloud cover, but increase in the visual.","output":"Influence of moon and clouds on night illumination in two different spectral ranges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: As approval of one of many coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccines' use for pregnancy is getting closer, vaccine hesitancy may take place in pregnant individuals for this new vaccine.

Results: Among 250 participants, 183 (73.2%) reported they wouldn't accept COVID-19 vaccination if there was a safe and effective vaccine approved for use in pregnancy. Main reasons of refusal were the belief that vaccine hadn't been studied on humans enough or that it might have adverse effectes on baby and/or pregnant individual.

Here, we revealed that S protein glycosylation has site-differential effects on viral infectivity. We found that S protein generated by lung epithelial cells has glycoforms associated with increased infectivity. Compared to the fully glycosylated S protein, immunization of S protein with N-glycans trimmed to the mono-GlcNAc-decorated state (SMG) elicited stronger immune responses and better protection for human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice against variants of concern (VOCs). In addition, a broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody was identified from SMG-immunized mice that could neutralize wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs with subpicomolar potency.

We find that more than 60% of the observed regional variations can be explained by these factors. Decreasing temperature and humidity, increasing cloudiness, precipitation and the absence of mitigation measures for public events are the strongest drivers for increased virus transmission, leading in combination to a doubling of the transmission rates compared to regions with more favourable weather.

This study reports the findings from the trial implementation and process evaluation that investigate the implementation of the intervention and inform factors that may influence the wider implementation of the intervention in the future. Methods: We developed an evaluation framework by employing both the RE-AIM framework and the MRC process evaluation framework to describe the implementation indicators, related enablers and barriers, and illustrate some potential impact pathways that may influence the effectiveness of the intervention in the trial. Quantitative data were collected from surveys and extracted from digital health monitoring systems. In addition, we conducted quarterly in-depth interviews with stakeholders in order to understand barriers and enablers of program implementation and effectiveness. Quantitative data analysis and thematic qualitative data analysis were applied, and the findings were synthesized based on the evaluation framework. Results: The SINEMA intervention was successfully implemented in 25 rural villages, reached 637 patients with stroke in rural Northern China during the 12 months of the trial. Almost 90% of the participants received all follow-up visits per protocol, and about half of the participants received daily voice messages. The majority of the intervention components were adopted by village doctors with some adaptation made. The interaction between human-delivered and technology-enabled components reinforced the program implementation and effectiveness.

With increased telehealth consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic, remote monitoring of lung function is encouraged at cystic fibrosis (CF) centres. We aimed to evaluate the quality of spirometry performance by adult CF patients with and without observation by a trained respiratory scientist. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between February-September 2020. 74 adults from the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Adult CF clinic were recruited and instructed to perform spirometry without supervision within 24 hours of their remote CF clinic consultation. Spirometry was repeated at their consultation, supervised by a respiratory scientist using video conferencing. The same portable spirometer was used during both encounters. Spirometry grade was recorded from their portable devices and severity of obstruction (mild: FEV1 >80%, moderate: FEV1 50C80%, severe: FEV1 <50%) was obtained from their supervised encounter. Results: 15, 30 and 29 participants with mild, moderate and severe obstruction respectively participated in the study (total n = 74, mean age 37  11 years, 50% female). The majority of patients achieved ATS/ERS grade A (excellent) or B (very good) spirometry quality with (95%) and without supervision (91%) independent of lung function severity or age. Participants with poorer grades (C-F) either experienced technical difficulties with their devices or failed to perform a sufficient number of manoeuvres. No patients required carer assistance to perform spirometry remotely. Conclusion: For a large proportion of adult CF patients, unsupervised portable spirometry produces acceptable and repeatable results. Ongoing monitoring for technical difficulties may be needed.","output":"Quality of home spirometry performance amongst adults with cystic fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kawasaki disease (KD) is an inflammatory syndrome which is generally observed among children.

With dimensions of ~100-200 m across and <1 m thick, they offer high spatial resolution, portability, low power consumption, and low cost. However, a thorough understanding of the magnetic material behavior in these devices has been lacking, hindering performance optimization. This manuscript reports on the strong, nonlinear correlation observed between the frequency response of these sensors and the stress-induced curvature of the resonator plate. The resonance frequency shift caused by DC magnetic fields drops off rapidly with increasing curvature: about two orders of magnitude separate the highest and lowest frequency shift in otherwise identical devices. Similarly, an inverse correlation with the quality factor was found, suggesting a magnetic loss mechanism. The mechanical and magnetic properties are theoretically analyzed using magnetoelastic finite-element and magnetic domain-phase models. The resulting model fits the measurements well and is generally consistent with additional results from magneto-optical domain imaging. Thus, the origin of the observed behavior is identified and broader implications for the design of nano-magnetoelastic devices are derived. By fabricating a magnetoelectric nano-plate resonator with low curvature, a record-high DC magnetic field sensitivity of 5 Hz/nT is achieved.","output":"Curvature and Stress Effects on the Performance of Contour-Mode Resonant E Effect Magnetometers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction : We present demographic and clinical characteristics including laboratory and imaging data of COVID-19.

We analyzed the correlation between the signaling activity, carbohydrate metabolism, and incretin profiles of patients. METHODS: The omental and subcutaneous fat was obtained in patients with obesity. The omental study included 16 patients with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 17 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); the subcutaneous study included 9 NGT patients and 12 T2DM patients. Insulin resistance was evaluated using the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp test and HOMA-IR index. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for NGT patients and mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) for T2DM patients were performed. The levels of incretins (GLP-1, GIP, oxyntomodulin) and glucagon were measured during the tests. Signaling was analyzed by Western blotting in adipose tissue biopsies. RESULTS: We have shown equal levels of basal phosphorylation of insulin- and mTOR-dependent signaling in omental fat depot in NGT and T2DM obese patients. Nevertheless, pNDRG1-T346 was decreased in omental fat of T2DM patients. Correlation analysis has shown an inverse correlation of pNDRG1-T346 in omental fat and diabetic phenotype (HbA1c, impaired incretin profile (AUC GLP-1, glucagon)). Moreover, pNDRG1-T346 in subcutaneous fat correlated with impaired incretin levels among obese patients (inverse correlation with AUC glucagon and AUC GIP). CONCLUSIONS: According to results of the present study, we hypothesize that phosphorylation of pNDRG1-T346 can be related to impairment in incretin hormone processing. pNDRG1-T346 in adipose tissue may serve as a marker of diabetes-associated impairments of the systemic incretin profile and insulin sensitivity.","output":"NDRG1 Activity in Fat Depots Is Associated With Type 2 Diabetes and Impaired Incretin Profile in Patients With Morbid Obesity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unsustainable trade in wildlife is one of the major threats affecting the global biodiversity crisis. An important part of the trade now occurs on the internet, especially on digital marketplaces and social media. Automated methods to identify trade posts are needed as resources for conservation are limited. Here, we developed machine vision models based on Deep Neural Networks with the aim to automatically identify images of exotic pet animals for sale. A new training dataset representing exotic pet animals advertised for sale on the web was generated for this purpose. We trained 24 neural-net models spanning a combination of five different architectures, three methods of training and two types of datasets. Specifically, model generalisation improved after setting a portion of the training images to represent negative features. Models were evaluated on both within and out of distribution data to test wider model applicability. The top performing models achieved an f-score of over 0.95 on within distribution evaluation and between 0.75 to 0.87 on the two out of distribution datasets. Notably, feature visualisation indicated that models performed well in detecting the surrounding context (e.g. a cage) in which an animal was located, therefore helping to automatically detect images of animals in non-natural environments. The proposed methods can help investigate the online wildlife trade, but can also be adapted to study other types of people-nature interactions from digital platforms.

No country has been spared from its onslaught. Treatments that can reduce the risk of infection and mortality from the disease are desperately needed. Though high quality randomized controlled trials are lacking, some observational and interventional studies that explore the link between vitamin D and RTIs exist. Vitamin D modulates both innate as well as adaptive immunity and may potentially prevent or mitigate the complications associated with RTIs. Evidence linking vitamin D to COVID-19 include that the outbreak occurred in winter in the northern hemisphere at a time when vitamin D levels are lowest in resident populations, that blacks and minority ethnic individuals who are known to have lower levels of vitamin D appear to be disproportionately affected and have more severe complications from the disease, that vitamin D deficiency has been shown to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome and that case fatality rates increase with age and in populations with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, all of which are associated with lower vitamin D levels. This narrative review summarizes the current knowledge about the epidemiology and pathophysiology of COVID-19, the evidence linking vitamin D and RTIs, especially COVID-19, the mechanistic reasons behind the possible protective effect of vitamin D in COVID-19, and the evidence with regard to vitamin D supplementation in RTIs.

Using social exchange as our theoretical foundation and three-wave lagged survey data collected from N = 300 employees within the United States, the current study found support for the contention that individuals with greater job insecurity pursue fewer idiosyncratic deals (I-Deals) with their employers. Fewer I-Deals in turn were associated with lower affective commitment, and higher turnover intentions, perceived psychological contract breach, and psychological contract violation. However, these indirect effects were conditional upon employee levels of grit (specifically, perseverance of effort), such that higher grit attenuated the negative relationship between job insecurity and the pursuit of I-Deals. Given that employees often have little control over the source of their experienced job insecurity (e.g., impending layoffs, a poor economy, announced merger or acquisition), these findings hold promise in potentially alleviating the well-documented negative outcomes of job insecurity through interventions designed to increase employee levels of grit and facilitate the creation of I-Deals.

With people forced out of public spaces, much of the conversation about these phenomena now occurs online on social media platforms like Twitter. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we describe a multilingual COVID-19 Twitter data set that we are making available to the research community via our COVID-19-TweetIDs GitHub repository. METHODS: We started this ongoing data collection on January 28, 2020, leveraging Twitters streaming application programming interface (API) and Tweepy to follow certain keywords and accounts that were trending at the time data collection began. We used Twitters search API to query for past tweets, resulting in the earliest tweets in our collection dating back to January 21, 2020.

Therefore, we prospectively investigated the incidence and clinical impacts of viral infection in adults with bronchiectasis exacerbations. METHODS: The study cohort of 119 adults with bronchiectasis was followed up prospectively for 12 months. Nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were assayed for 16 respiratory viruses, using polymerase chain reaction assays. Symptoms, spirometry, quality of life, bacterial cultures, and inflammatory markers were assessed during steady-state bronchiectasis and exacerbations. RESULTS: A total of 100 exacerbations were captured from 58 patients during 1-year follow-up. Respiratory viruses were found more frequently in nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum during bronchiectasis exacerbations (49 of 100, 49.0') than during steady state (11 of 58, 18.9'; P < .001). The most common viruses found in patients experiencing exacerbations were coronavirus (19 of 65, 39.2'), rhinovirus (16 of 65, 24.6'), and influenza A/B viruses (16 of 65, 24.6'). Virus-positive exacerbations were associated with a greater increase in markers of systemic and airway inflammation (serum IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-; sputum IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-) compared with virus-negative exacerbations, but the differences in spirometric indexes, quality of life, and bacterial density were unremarkable. In receiver operating characteristics analysis, serum interferon--induced protein 10 yielded an area under curve of 0.67 (95' CI, 0.53-0.77; P = .018). Furthermore, a greater proportion of patients with virus-positive exacerbations received IV antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of viral infections, detected by polymerase chain reaction assay, is higher in cases of bronchiectasis exacerbations than in steady-state bronchiectasis, suggesting that respiratory viruses play crucial roles in triggering bronchiectasis exacerbations. The potential mechanisms of virus-induced bronchiectasis exacerbations merit further investigations.

It will do so by first marshalling the evidence of exclusion and its resulting harm and then analyzing the characteristics of entities conducting research studies that make them covered entities under the ADA.

We conducted an online survey that tackled how individuals would deal with three different scenarios of medical scarcity: (1) organ donation, (2) limited hospital beds during an influenza epidemic, and (3) allocation of novel therapeutics for lung cancer. In addition, a free-comment option was included at the end of the survey if respondents wished to contribute further. Seven hundred and fifty-four survey responses were gathered, including 372 males (49.3%), and 382 females (50.7%). Five groups of individuals were represented including religion scholars, physicians, medical students, allied health practitioners, and lay people. Of the five surveyed groups, four found sickest-first to be the most important prioritization principle in all three scenarios, and only the physicians group documented a disagreement.

The city of Ningbo decided to use this opportunity to develop a systematic procedure, using Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP), to identify which allotments within the municipal area have the greatest potential of delivering green buildings, ensuring the set targets are fair and deliverable. This paper explains in detail the use of FAHP in the production of the Specific Plans for Green Buildings for the city of Ningbo in the Zhejiang Province of China. This innovative multi-faceted method incorporates the level of development in each of the 3213 land allotments in the municipal area, assessing each one for critical aspects such as environmental potential, local economic development land-use and land prices in order to determine an individual roadmap for the ratio of green buildings to be built in each region within the city. This method incorporates a scientific process, in which Pairwise Comparison Analysis was conducted for the selected criteria and aspects to determine the weighting factors and scores in each case. This allowed planners to rank all allotments in the municipal area in terms of their potential to provide green buildings, and thus make the setting of targets to provide these accordingly. This approach breaks away from the traditional method which relies on simple estimation, which is often unjustified. Over the two years since this method was introduced, the effects had been positive, within all the allotments abiding to the set targets. Other cities and regions in China, such as the provinces of Liaoning and Hebei, have also adopted this process.

The aim of this quality improvement (QI) was to improve BP control <130/80 from the baseline rates of 20%C30% and <140/90 from the baseline rates of 40%C60% between ages of 18C75 years, within 12 months. METHODS: We used the Plan-Do-Study-Act method. A multidisciplinary QI team identified barriers by fish bone diagram. Barriers included: 1) Physicians' knowledge gap and clinical inertia in optimization of medications, and 2) Patients' nonadherence to medication and appointments. The outcome measures were the percentage of patients with BP < 140/90 and < 130/80. Process measures included: 1) attendance rates of physician and nurses at educational sessions, 2) medication reconciliation completion rates and 3) care guide order rates. Key interventions were: 1) physicians and nurses' education regarding ACC/AHA guidelines, 2) patient education and engagement and 3) enhancement of health information technology. Data analysis was performed using monthly statistical process control charts. RESULTS: We achieved 62.6% (n = 885/1426) for BP < 140/90 and 24.47% (n = 349/1426) for BP < 130/80 within 12 months project period.

Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched for combinations of benzonatate and \\"poisoning,\\" \\"overdose,\\" and \\"toxicity.\\" References of relevant articles were searched for additional publications. Articles were included if they described the clinical course of at least one patient suffering from benzonatate poisoning and available in English. Dual independent review and extraction were performed. RESULTS Seventeen cases from NPDS and 19 published reports met the inclusion criteria resulting in 36 cases, mostly (28/36) self-harm ingestions. Most patients were young [17 (11-29), median (IQR)] and female (22). Onset of toxicity was rapid at <5 min (9). Most common symptoms included cardiac arrest (29), seizures (24), and dysrhythmias (24). Treatments included intubation (26), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (28), vasopressors (20) and others. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 23/28 patients, but most had significant neurologic deficits or other end organ damage and 5 survived with a good neurologic outcome. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Overdose ingestions of benzonatate can cause significant toxicity with a rapid onset. Interventions performed were generally supportive in nature. Duration of directly toxic effects is short, but dramatic with neurologic devastation and resuscitated patients often still have a poor outcome.","output":"A description of the clinical course of severe benzonatate poisonings reported in the literature and to NPDS: A systematic review supplemented with NPDS cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An epidemic can be characterized by its speed (i.e., the exponential growth rate r) and strength (i.e., the reproductive number ?).

Here, we develop a mathematical framework for this classic, strength-based paradigm and show that there is a corresponding speed-based paradigm which can provide complementary insights. In particular, we note that r = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like ? = 1, and show that we can measure the speed and strength of an intervention on the same scale as the speed and strength of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, just as the strength-based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed-based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of test-and-treat interventions against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be done more clearly on the speed than strength scale, given uncertainty in the proportion of HIV spread that happens early in the course of infection.

METHODS: A survey on virtual care in rhinology was distributed to 61 Canadian rhinologists. The primary objective was to determine how virtual care compared to in-person care in each area of a typical appointment. Other areas focused on platforms used to deliver virtual care and which patients could be appropriately assessed by virtual visits. RESULTS: 43 participants responded (response rate 70.5%). The majority of participants use the telephone as their primary platform. History taking and reviewing results (lab work, imaging) were reported to be equivalent in virtual care. Non-urgent follow up and new patients were thought to be the most appropriate for virtual care. The inability to perform exams and nasal endoscopy were reported to be significant limitations.

Frequent intake of these compounds through diet arguably becomes a natural remedy for lowering the risk of non-communicable diseases. Hydrophobic flavonoids within the spectrum stand out, owing to their remarkable therapeutic effects including the capability of acting as a complementary approach to conventional therapy for COVID-19, suggested by novel research endeavors. However, various physicochemical aspects (e.g., low aqueous solubility, low permeability, and high oxidation susceptibility), as well as undesirable sensory attributes have hindered the direct incorporation of hydrophobic flavonoids into food matrices. Thus, the demand has risen for encapsulated/protected flavonoids that can maintain their original bioactivity during processing, storage, and gastrointestinal digestion. Taking the importance of these facts into consideration, the purpose of this critical review is to discuss different approaches for the encapsulation/delivery of hydrophobic flavonoids. Additionally, the strengths and weaknesses of delivery systems, recommendations to overcome possible challenges, the incorporation of encapsulated hydrophobic flavonoids into food materials, and the importance of considering toxicity aspects of the corresponding delivery systems have been discussed in detail. The influence of flavonoid systems on the overall physicochemical and organoleptic properties of functional food products has also been addressed, with a particular emphasis on the importance of food safety in this regard. ? 2022 Elsevier Ltd","output":"Oral delivery of hydrophobic flavonoids and their incorporation into functional foods: Opportunities and challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies have been increasingly utilized in medicine over the past several years and can greatly facilitate surgical planning thereby improving patient outcomes.

The purpose of this study was two-fold: 1) to determine the prevalence in the existing literature of using MRI to create 3D printed anatomic models for surgical planning and 2) to provide image acquisition recommendations for appropriate clinical scenarios where MRI is the most suitable imaging modality. The workflow for creating 3D printed anatomic models from medical imaging data is complex and involves image segmentation of the regions of interest and conversion of that data into 3D surface meshes, which are compatible with printing technologies. CT is most commonly used to create 3D printed anatomic models due to the high image quality and relative ease of performing image segmentation from CT data. As compared to CT datasets, 3D printing using MRI data offers advantages since it provides exquisite soft tissue contrast needed for accurate organ segmentation and it does not expose patients to unnecessary ionizing radiation. MRI, however, often requires complicated imaging techniques and time-consuming postprocessing procedures to generate high-resolution 3D anatomic models needed for 3D printing. Despite these challenges, 3D modeling and printing from MRI data holds great clinical promises thanks to emerging innovations in both advanced MRI imaging and postprocessing techniques.

Patients were classified into strict appropriate criteria, expanded criteria, and inappropriate based on the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association guidelines. Factors associated with endoscopic local excision were identified using univariate and logistic multivariate regression. RESULTS: Within the National Cancer Database, 46,334 patients were stratified into strict appropriate criteria (n = 1,405), expanded criteria (n = 727), and inappropriate (n = 43,675). Annual cases of local excision increased by 76.9% over the study period, from 273 in 2010 to 483 in 2017. Among patients who underwent local excision, 10.1% were classified as strict appropriate criteria, 1.6% were classified as expanded criteria, and 84.5% were classified as inappropriate. Among inappropriate patients, factors associated with endoscopic local excision were: more recent year of diagnosis, increasing age, female sex, tumor located in the cardia, smaller size, low-grade, absence of lymphovascular invasion, and treatment at an academic facility.

Moreover, we investigated whether immune responses elicited by enzootic coronaviruses affect SARS-CoV-2 infection in cats. We found infection with significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against the Gamma variant of concern, endemic in Brazil during 2020, than against an early SARS-CoV-2 B.1 isolate (p<0.0001), validating the use of Gamma for further testing. The overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Brazilian cats during late 2020 validated by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT(90)) was 7.3% (95% CI, 5.3-9.8). There was no significant difference in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in cats between Brazilian states, suggesting homogeneous infection levels ranging from 4.6% (95% CI, 2.2-8.4) to 11.4% (95% CI, 6.7-17.4; p=0.4438). Seroprevalence of the prototypic cat coronavirus Feline coronavirus (FCoV) in a PRNT(90) was high at 33.3% (95% CI, 24.9-42.5) and seroprevalence of Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) was low at 1.7% (95% CI, 0.2-5.9) in a PRNT(90).

Women had increased odds of loneliness compared with men, whether living alone (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.52, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.04) or with others (2.44, 95% CI 2.04 to 2.92). Increasing age group decreased the odds of loneliness (aOR 0.69 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.81) 65-79 years and 0.50 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.65) 80+ years compared with <65 years). Living alone was associated with loneliness, with a greater association in men (aOR 4.26, 95% CI 3.15 to 5.76) than women (aOR 2.65, 95% CI 2.26 to 3.11). Other factors associated with loneliness included: fair or poor health (aOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.54 to 2.41), being a caregiver (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.37), receiving care (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.81), high concern for the pandemic (aOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.84), not experiencing positive effects of pandemic distancing measures (aOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.32) and changes to daily routine (aOR 2.81, 95% CI 1.96 to 4.03). CONCLUSIONS: While many older adults reported feeling lonely during COVID-19, several characteristics-such as being female and living alone-increased the odds of loneliness. These characteristics may help identify priorities for targeting interventions to reduce loneliness.","output":"Loneliness among older adults in the community during COVID-19: a cross-sectional survey in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Olfactory dysfunction is reported frequently in patients with coronavirus disease 2019.

Since the chicken embryo becomes immunocompetent prior to hatch, we here characterized the transcriptional response of selected innate immune genes to Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection in chicken embryos at days 10, 14, and 18 of embryonic development. The results suggest that the innate immune response 72 h after challenge of 18-day chicken embryo is both consistent and robust. The expression of CCL5, Mx1, and TLR3 in lung tissues of NDV challenged chicken embryos from the outbred Kuroiler and Tanzanian local ecotype lines showed that their expression was several orders of magnitude higher in the Kuroiler than in the local ecotypes. Next, the expression patterns of three additional innate-immunity related genes, IL-8, IRF-1, and STAT1, were examined in the highly congenic Fayoumi (M5.1 and M15.2) and Leghorn (Ghs6 and Ghs13) sublines that differ only at the microchromosome bearing the major histocompatibility locus. The results show that the Ghs13 Leghorn subline had a consistently higher expression of all genes except IL-8 and expression seemed to be subline-dependent rather than breed-dependent, suggesting that the innate immune response of chicken embryos to NDV infection may be genetically controlled by the MHC-locus. Taken together, the results suggest that the chicken embryo may represent a promising model to studying the patterns and sources of variation of the avian innate immune response to infection with NDV and related pathogens.","output":"Transcriptional Innate Immune Response of the Developing Chicken Embryo to Newcastle Disease Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a systematic healthcare system developed from clinical experience based on a scientific model of regulation. TCM relies on unique theories and practices to treat diseases and enhance health. These practices include Chinese herbal medicine and dietetics, acupuncture and moxibustion, and other non-medication therapies such as Chinese bodywork or manual therapy, known as Tuina, and traditional biofeedback exercises, known as Qigong and Taijiquan. The integration of TCM in Western health systems and research requires a rational communicable theory, scientific proof of efficacy and safety, and quality control measures. Understanding the structural concepts of the TCM language makes possible the parallelism to Western physiology, and the inherent rational use of the reflex therapeutic systems, anti-inflammatory mechanisms and mental training involved, for example, in acupuncture and Qigong. The results of TCM clinical trials and fundamental research on its nature and mechanisms have encouraged the development and application of well-designed research strategies such as double blinding in acupucture to overcome limitations and resistances in integrating these practices into the existing biomedical paradigms of the West. This review aims to overview some TCM theoretical concepts and the evidence-based clinical application of TCMs leading practices to create an easy-to-consult and condensed source of information, available for the healthcare community, facilitating the understanding and communication between conventional health professionals and TCM practitioners and acupuncturists.","output":"Understanding Traditional Chinese Medicine Therapeutics: An Overview of the Basics and Clinical Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors in coronavirus disease 19 (Covid-19) patients has not been fully investigated. We evaluated the association between RAAS inhibitor use and outcomes of Covid-19. METHODS: This study was a retrospective observational cohort study that used data based on insurance benefit claims sent to the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of Korea by May 15, 2020. These claims comprised all Covid-19 tested cases and the history of medical service use in these patients for the past five years. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the rate of ventilator care was compared between the groups. RESULTS: From a total of 7,590 patients diagnosed with Covid-19, two distinct cohorts were generated based on RAAS inhibitors prescribed within 6 months before Covid-19 diagnosis. A total of 1,111 patients was prescribed RAAS inhibitors, and 794 patients were prescribed antihypertensive drugs, excluding RAAS inhibitors. In propensity-score matched analysis, 666 pairs of data set were generated, and all-cause mortality of the RAAS inhibitor group showed no significant difference compared with the non-RAAS inhibitor group (14.6% vs. 11.1%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-1.15; p = 0.22). The rate of ventilator care was not significantly different between the two groups (4.4% vs. 4.1%; HR, 1.04; 95%CI, 0.60-1.79; p = 0.89).

The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global pandemic; it is reported to have spread to nearly every country in the world. However, the prevalence varies across developed and developing countries, as well as within different regions of the same country. It is not hidden that estimating the magnitude of COVID-19 infection from the community surveys is critical for public health policymakers to make decisions to deal with the outbreak, optimize measures, and design mitigation plans. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 01 July to 31 August 2020 in the northeastern Ethiopia region. A simple random sampling technique was used to select study participants from the community survey, contact traces from confirmed cases, and infection suspects. After extraction of viral nucleic acid from oropharyngeal specimen, the real-time fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit was used for detecting novel coronavirus. RESULTS: A total of 8752 study participants were included in this study. About 63.6% were males and 36.4% were females. Out of the total 8752 study participants, 291 (3.3%) were found to be infected with the virus. The first laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 were detected in the fourth week of the study period, that is, from July 24 to July 31, 2020, and the peak prevalence was observed in the last two weeks. The COVID-19 infection was more prevalent among males and in the age group of 36C52 years. Participants tested via contact trace had 1.65 times (AOR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.09C2.51, P=0.018) the likelihood of COVID-19 infection in comparison to the other forms of community surveys.

We studied the longitudinal association of working from home during the pandemic with physical activity and sedentary behavior. METHODS: Longitudinal data from 17 questionnaire rounds of the Lifelines COVID-19 cohort (March 2020-February 2021) were used. In total, 33 325 workers were included. In every round, participants reported their current work situation: location, home, or hybrid (working on location and from home). Physical activity levels and sedentary behavior before and during the pandemic were asked. Logistic generalized estimating equations adjusted for demographic/work/health covariates were used to study the association of work situation with physical activity and sedentary behavior. RESULTS: Home workers were less likely to meet the recommended 150 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity activity during the pandemic than location workers [odds ratio (OR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90-0.96] and more likely to be less physically active than before the pandemic (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04-1.14). Furthermore, compared to location workers, home and hybrid workers were more likely to be more sedentary (sitting 8 hours/day) on workdays during than before the pandemic (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.39-1.64/1.36-1.68, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to location workers, home workers (and to a lesser extent hybrid workers) were more often physically inactive and sedentary during than before the COVID-19 pandemic. As a substantial part of the working population may continue to work (partly) from home after the pandemic, workers should be supported to increase activity and reduce sitting while working from home.","output":"Working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic and its longitudinal association with physical activity and sedentary behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a new strain of coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020.

Despite the fact that DT is frequently used as an LVAD indication across other major European countries and the United States, with consistent improvements in quality-of-life and longevity, National Health Service (NHS) England does not currently fund DT, mainly due to concerns over cost-effectiveness. On the basis of the recently published ENDURANCE Supplemental Trial studying DT patients, we assessed for the first time the cost-effectiveness of DT LVADs compared with medical management (MM) in the NHS England. METHODS AND RESULTS We developed a Markov multiple-state economic model using NHS cost data. LVAD survival and adverse event rates were derived from the ENDURANCE Supplemental Trial. MM survival was based on Seattle Heart Failure Model estimates in the absence of contemporary clinical trials for this population. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated over a lifetime horizon. A discount rate of 3.5% per year was applied to costs and benefits. Deterministic ICER was 46 207 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Costs and utilities were 204 022 and 3.27 QALYs for the LVAD arm vs. 77 790 and 0.54 QALYs for the MM arm. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness of the primary analysis. CONCLUSIONS The implantation of the HeartWare? HVAD?

Hong Kong is characterized by high population density, and is susceptible to large-scale natural disasters and health crises such as typhoons, fires and infectious disease outbreaks. This research paper investigates the rates and predictors of urban community disaster risk perception, awareness and preparedness, at individual and household levels. Methods: A randomized cross-sectional, population-based telephone survey study was conducted among the Cantonese-speaking population aged over 15 years in Hong Kong. Descriptive statistics were reported. A stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the independent associations between risk perceptions, socioeconomic factors, household characteristics, and personal background. Findings: Final study sample comprised of 1002 respondents with a 63% response rate. The majority of respondents (82.3%) did not perceive Hong Kong as a disaster-susceptible city. Half (54.6%) reported beliefs that the local population had lower disaster awareness than other global cities. Infectious disease outbreak (72.4%), typhoon (12.6%), and fire (7.1%) were ranked as the most-likely-to-occur population-based disasters. Although over 77% believed that basic first aid training was necessary for improving individual disaster preparedness, only a quarter (26.1%) of respondents reported participation in training. Conclusion: Despite Hong Kongs high level of risk, general public perceptions of disaster in Hong Kong were low, and little preparedness has occurred at the individual or household levels. This report has potential to inform the development of related policies and risk communication strategies in Asian urban cities.","output":"Socio-demographic Predictors for Urban Community Disaster Health Risk Perception and Household Based Preparedness in a Chinese Urban City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Rapid diagnostic techniques are valuable tools in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal infections, especially for the detection of some microorganisms and in certain groups of patients. While antigen detection techniques are widely used in Clinical Microbiology laboratories, for the diagnosis of viruses, some parasites and some bacteria, molecular techniques are routinely used only for some pathogens (such as Clostridium difficile). However, molecular techniques are constantly evolving, and they allow a rapid diagnosis for an increasing number of pathogens, with high sensitivity and specificity. In addition, they are also able to detect virulence factors or resistance mechanisms. Syndromic surveillance systems, which detect different pathogens simultaneously, are very promising because they enable the most frequent pathogens to be diagnosed in a few hours and they can be very useful in certain patients. For the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection, molecular techniques are able to detect bacteria and its resistance to clarithromycin and levofloxacin, allowing the most appropriate treatment to be selected for each patient when bacterial culture is not possible.","output":"Rapid diagnosis of gastrointestinal tract infections due to parasites, viruses, and bacteria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new tuberculosis model consisting of ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations is established in this paper.

Healthcare workers were faced with patients experiencing rapidly progressive respiratory failure, which led to the need for unconventional treatment approaches. Awake proning modified with alternating lateral decubitus positions was implemented to improve oxygenation in patients with type 2 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).1 In this case report, we discuss the positive outcome of one of many patients who improved with the modified proning approach implemented early on during their disease course. Case: A 59-year-old previously healthy male presented with fevers and shortness of breath for 10 days. He was febrile with saturation at 86% on room air with improvement to 94% on nasal cannula. Chest x-ray showed patchy bibasilar airspace opacities. His nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 returned positive. Per protocol at the time, he was treated with Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin. He continued to deteriorate with increasing oxygen requirements. On hospital day 3, he desaturated to 77%. Patient was placed on 100% FiO2 via non-rebreather and placed in a prone position with improvement in his O2 saturation to 90%. He felt uncomfortable lying prone and was unable to assume the position for extended period of time. He was advised to alternate between prone positioning with lateral decubitus positions on either side as much as could tolerate. He continued to require oxygen supplementation via non-rebreather. On hospital day 20, he was weaned to room air and was discharged to a short-term facility. Discussion: COVID-19 is a pulmonary disease that causes type 2 ARDS1 at its most severe state. Proning mechanically ventilated patients has been established as a part of management in ARDS with severe hypoxemia. Its mechanism of improving oxygenation includes \\"affecting recruitment in dorsal lung regions, increasing end-expiratory lung volume, decreasing alveolar shunt, and improving tidal volume\\".4 During this pandemic, physicians extrapolated this concept and applied a modified maneuver on awake patients in attempts to improve oxygenation without invasive mechanical ventilation. The patient in this case demonstrated marked improvement with not only prone but also lateral decubitus positioning. This is one of many cases that showed the effectiveness of rotating the body in various positions early on during the disease process to prevent worsening of respiratory failure in mild to moderate type 2 ARDS in COVID-19. It also highlights the need for further research to expand it to other causes of ARDS.","output":"Avoid the Vent: Modified Awake Proning for Severe Hypoxemia in COVID-19 ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) has become a mainstay treatment modality for a select patient population who do not respond to conventional medical therapy suffering from severe COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The existing inflammatory markers, like C-reactive protein, are not specific for infection, which introduces diagnostic uncertainty. Procalcitonin (PCT) is used to accurately diagnose bacterial sepsis and differentiate it from other conditions, which is now particularly important given the vulnerability to COVID-19 in pregnancy. There are few studies of PCT in pregnancy as the reference interval for pregnant women is unknown. This study aimed to define the pregnancy-specific reference interval for PCT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 323 healthy pregnant women, with longitudinal sampling in each trimester. RESULTS: The upper reference limit for PCT was 0.05 ng/mL and did not vary materially between any observed group of gestational age, body mass index, maternal age, mean arterial blood pressure or fetal sex. CONCLUSION: Our study has shown that levels of PCT are similar in pregnant and non-pregnant populations despite the physiological changes of normal pregnancy.

There are no non-antibiotic approaches to dealing with persistent infection by these exceptional colonizers, which form copious biofilms. We screened the Medicines for Malaria Venture Pathogen Box for chemical entities that inhibit EAEC biofilm formation. Methodology We used two EAEC strains, 042 and MND005E, in a medium-throughput crystal violet-based antibiofilm screen. Hits were confirmed in concentration-dependence, growth kinetic and time course assays and activity spectra were determined against a panel of genome-sequenced EAEC. Antibiofilm activity against isogenic EAEC mutants, molecular docking simulations and comparative genomic analysis were used to identify the mechanism of action of one hit. Principal findings In all, five compounds (1.25%) reproducibly inhibited biofilm accumulation by at least one strain by 30-85% while inhibiting growth by under 10%. Hits exhibited at least 10-fold greater antibiofilm activity than nitazoxanide, the only known EAEC biofilm inhibitor. Reflective of known EAEC heterogeneity, only one hit was active against both screen isolates, but three hits showed broad antibiofilm activity against a larger panel of strains. Mechanism of action studies point to the EAEC anti-aggregation protein (Aap), dispersin, as the target of compound MMV687800. Conclusions This study identified five compounds not previously described as anti-adhesins or Gram-negative antibacterials with significant and specific EAEC antibiofilm activity. One molecule, MMV687800, targets the EAEC Aap. In vitro small-molecule inhibition of EAEC colonization opens a way to new therapeutic approaches to preventing and treating EAEC infection. Author summary Diarrhoea accounts for over half a million deaths in children under five annually. It additionally contributes to childhood malnutrition as well as growth and development deficiencies, particularly in low-income countries. Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) causes diarrhoea that is often persistent and can also contribute to growth deficiencies in young children. EAEC is a neglected pathogen that is often resistant to antimicrobial drugs. Small molecules that block EAEC colonization may hold the key to interfering with EAEC disease without promoting antimicrobial resistance. We screened the Medicines for Malaria Ventures Pathogen Box for chemicals that can interfere with EAEC biofilm formation, a key colonization indicator. Our screen identified five biofilm-inhibiting molecules that did not interfere with bacterial viability and therefore are unlikely to exert strong pressure for resistance. Molecular biology and computational investigations point to the EAEC anti-aggregative protein, also known as dispersin, as a possible target for one of these hit molecules. Optimizing EAEC antibiofilm hits will create templates that can be employed for resolving EAEC diarrhoea and related infections.","output":"Antibiofilm agents with therapeutic potential against enteroaggregative Escherichia coli"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Research involving children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has primarily focused on those presenting to emergency departments.

We calculated positive likelihood ratios (LRs) for self-reported symptoms and a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab result in the entire cohort and in 3 sensitivity analyses: all children with at least 1 symptom, all children tested because of contact tracing whether they were symptomatic or not and all children 5 years of age or older. RESULTS: We analyzed results for 2463 children who underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection; 1987 children had a positive result and 476 had a negative result. Of children with a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, 714 (35.9%) reported being asymptomatic. Although cough (24.5%) and rhinorrhea (19.3%) were 2 of the most common symptoms among children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were also common among those with negative test results and were not predictive of a positive test (positive LR 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81-1.14, and 0.87, 95% CI 0.72-1.06, respectively). Anosmia/ageusia (positive LR 7.33, 95% CI 3.03-17.76), nausea/vomiting (positive LR 5.51, 95% CI 1.74-17.43), headache (positive LR 2.49, 95% CI 1.74-3.57) and fever (positive LR 1.68, 95% CI 1.34-2.11) were the symptoms most predictive of a positive result for a SARSCoV-2 swab.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional household surveys. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A representative sample of the population in England from April to May 2020. The sample included 3179 adults aged &#8805; 18 years. MEASUREMENTS: Participants who reported that they definitely or thought they had coronavirus were classified as having self-reported COVID-19. Participants were asked how often they wash their hands after returning home, before preparing foods, before eating or before touching their face. They were also asked whether, due to COVID-19, they had (i) attempted to quit smoking, (ii) attempted to quit vaping and (iii) changed the amount they smoke inside the home. FINDINGS: Odds of self-reported COVID-19 were significantly greater among current smokers [20.9%, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.73] and long-term (> 1-year) ex-smokers (16.1%, aOR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.05-1.68) compared with never smokers (14.5%). Recent (< 1-year) ex-smokers had non-significantly greater odds of self-reported COVID-19 (22.2%, aOR = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.85-2.53). Bayes factors indicated there was sufficient evidence to rule out large differences in self-reported COVID-19 by NRT use and medium differences by e-cigarette use.

Predictors were ranked using variable importance metrics. Models were assessed by C-indices, Brier scores and calibration plots in the test set. SETTING: Optum de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record dataset including over 700 hospitals and 7000 clinics in the USA. PARTICIPANTS: 17 086 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 between 20 February 2020 and 5 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All-cause mortality while hospitalised. RESULTS: The full model that included information on demographics, comorbidities, laboratory results, and vital signs had good discrimination (C-index=0.87) and was well calibrated, with some overpredictions for the most at-risk patients. Results were similar on the training and test sets, suggesting that there was little overfitting. Age was the most important risk factor. The performance of models that included all demographics and comorbidities (C-index=0.79) was only slightly better than a model that only included age (C-index=0.76). Across the study period, predicted mortality was 1.3% for patients aged 18 years old, 8.9% for 55 years old and 28.7% for 85 years old. Predicted mortality across all ages declined over the study period from 22.4% by March to 14.0% by May. CONCLUSION: Age was the most important predictor of all-cause mortality, although vital signs and laboratory results added considerable prognostic information, with oxygen saturation, temperature, respiratory rate, lactate dehydrogenase and white cell count being among the most important predictors. Demographic and comorbidity factors did not improve model performance appreciably.

OBJECTIVES: As a primary objective, this prospective study aimed to describe the epidemiology of SSIs and the associated AMR among women who delivered by cesarean at a rural Rwandan hospital. As secondary objectives, this study also assessed patient demographics, pre- and post-operative antibiotic use, and SSI treatment. METHODS: Women who underwent cesarean deliveries at Kirehe District Hospital between September 23rd, 2019, and March 16th, 2020, were enrolled prospectively. On postoperative day (POD) 11 (+/C 3 days), their wounds were examined. When an SSI was diagnosed, a wound swab was collected and sent to the Rwandan National Reference Laboratory for culturing and antibiotic susceptibility testing. FINDINGS: Nine hundred thirty women were enrolled, of whom 795 (85.5%) returned for the POD 11 clinic visit. 45 (5.7%) of the 795 were diagnosed with SSI and swabs were collected from 44 of these 45 women. From these 44 swabs, 57 potential pathogens were isolated. The most prevalent bacteria were coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 12/57, 20.3% of all isolates), and Acinetobacter baumannii complex (n = 9/57, 15.2%). 68.4% (n = 39) of isolates were gram negative; 86.7% if excluding coagulase-negative staphylococci. No gram-negative pathogens isolated were susceptible to ampicillin, and the vast majority demonstrated intermediate susceptibility or resistance to ceftriaxone (92.1%) and cefepime (84.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial isolates from SSI swab cultures in rural Rwanda predominantly consisted of gram-negative pathogens and were largely resistant to commonly used antibiotics.

Therefore, a novel purified PV-Trombe wall for electricity, space heating, formaldehyde degradation and bacteria inactivation was proposed. Firstly, the system thermal and mass transfer model was established and verified by experimental data. Secondly, the comprehensive performance with the PV coverage ratio of 0 was analyzed. Finally, the effect of PV coverage ratio on the system performance was investigated. Accordingly, the main results were:  Under PV coverage ratio of 0, the average daily air thermal efficiency and formaldehyde single-pass ratio were 0. 46 and 0. 35, respectively. Meanwhile, the total generated volume of clean air by formaldehyde degradation was 93. 4 m3 . Five kinds of bacteria were fully thermal inactivated for several hours. Accordingly, the total generated volume of clean air were 188. 3, 173. 0, 201. 4, 189. 9 and 200. 2 m3 for E. coli, L. monocytogenes, L. plantarum, S. Senftenberg and S. cerevisiae, respectively.

Several studies have provided evidence on the implication of the human host intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as a major receptor for iRBCs binding to P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) in the development of severe and cerebral malaria. The genetic polymorphism K29M in the immunoglobulin-like domain of ICAM-1, known as ICAM-1(Kilifi), has been associated with either increased or decreased risk of developing cerebral malaria. METHODS: To provide more conclusive results, the genetic polymorphism of ICAM-1(Kilifi) was assessed by PCR and sequencing in blood samples from 215 Beninese children who presented with either mild or severe malaria including cerebral malaria. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that in this cohort of Beninese children, the ICAM-1(kilifi) variant is present at the frequencies of 0.27, similar to the frequency observed in other African countries. This ICAM-1(kilifi) variant was not associated with disease severity in agreement with other findings from the Gambia, Tanzania, Malawi, Gabon, and Thailand, suggesting no evidence of a direct link between this polymorphism and the pathogenesis of severe and cerebral malaria.","output":"ICAM-1 (Kilifi) variant is not associated with cerebral and severe malaria pathogenesis in Beninese children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has prompted accelerated vaccines development. Their use was prioritized to protect the most vulnerable, notably, the elderly. Because of fluctuations in vaccine availability, strategies such as delayed second dose and heterologous prime-boost have been employed. The effectiveness of these strategies in the frail elderly are unknown. Methods In this real-world vaccination study, under a government-decreed rationing strategy, elderly adults residing in long-term care facilities, with or without previously-documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, were administered homologous or heterologous mRNA vaccines, with an extended 16-week interval between doses. Clinical data and blood were serially collected during and after this interval period. Sera were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies (to trimeric S; RBD; nucleocapsid) by automated chemiluminescent ELISA. Findings After a significant increase 4 weeks post-prime dose, there was a significant decline in anti-RBD and anti-S IgG levels until the boost dose, followed by an increase 4 weeks later. Previously uninfected individuals exhibited lower antibody responses up to 16 weeks post-prime dose, but achieved comparable levels to previously infected counterparts by 4 weeks post-second dose. Individuals primed with BNT162b2 exhibited larger decrease in anti-RBD and anti-S IgG levels with 16-week interval between doses, compared to those who received mRNA-1273. No differences in antibody levels 4 weeks after the second dose were noted between the two vaccines, in either homologous or heterologous combinations. Interpretations These interim results of this ongoing longitudinal study show that, among frail elderly, neither age, sex, nor comorbidity affect antigenicity of mRNA-based COVID vaccines, but previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and type of mRNA vaccine influenced antibody responses when used with a 16-week interval between doses. Homologous/heterologous use of mRNA vaccines was not associated with significant differences in antibody responses 4 weeks following second dose, supporting their interchangeability.","output":"Real-world serologic responses to Extended-interval and Heterologous COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in Frail Elderly - Interim report from a prospective observational cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the current pandemic season, reports on pathologic features of coronavirus disease 19 (Covid-19) are exceedingly rare at the present time.

New agents that address the hyperinflammatory cytokine storm and hypercoagulable pathology seen in these patients may be a promising approach to treat patients, minimize hospital stays, and ensure hospital wards and critical care units are able to operate effectively. Dociparstat sodium (DSTAT) is a glycosaminoglycan derivative of heparin with robust anti-inflammatory properties, with the potential to address underlying causes of coagulation disorders with substantially reduced risk of bleeding compared to commercially available heparin. Methods: This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2/3 trial to determine the safety and efficacy of DSTAT added to standard of care, in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen. Phase 2 will enroll 12 participants in each of two dose escalating cohorts, to confirm the safety of DSTAT in this population. Following review of the data, an additional 50 participants will be enrolled. Contingent upon positive results, Phase 3 will enroll approximately 450 participants randomized to DSTAT or placebo. The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants who survive and do not require mechanical ventilation through day 28. Discussion: Advances in standard of care, recent emergency use authorizations, and positive data with dexamethasone, has likely contributed to an increasing proportion of patients who are surviving without the need for mechanical ventilation. Therefore, examining the time to improvement in the NIAID score will be essential to provide a measure of drug effect on recovery. Analysis of additional endpoints, including supportive biomarkers (e.g., IL-6, HMGB1, soluble-RAGE, D-dimer) will be performed to further define the effect of DSTAT in patients with COVID-19 infection.

However, human data of adipose ACE-2 is rarely available. Considering that, ACE-2 is believed to be the receptor responsible for cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, a better understanding of its regulation is desirable. We therefore characterized the modulation of subcutaneous adipose ACE-2 mRNA expression during weight loss and the impact of ACE-2 expression on weight loss induced short- and long-term improvements of glucose metabolism. METHODS: 143 subjects (age > 18; BMI  27 kg/m(2)) were analyzed before and after a standardized 12-week dietary weight reduction program. Afterwards subjects were randomized to a 12-month lifestyle intervention or a control group (Maintain-Adults trial). Insulin sensitivity (IS) was estimated by HOMA-IR (as an estimate of liver IS) and ISI(Clamp) (as an estimate of skeletal muscle IS). ACE-2 mRNA expression (ACE-2(AT)) was measured in subcutaneous adipose tissue before and after weight loss. RESULTS: ACE-2(AT) was not affected by obesity, but was reduced in insulin resistant subjects. Weight loss resulted in a decline of ACE-2(AT) (29.0 (20.0C47.9) vs. 21.0 (13.0C31.0); p = 1.6 ? 10(?7)). A smaller reduction of ACE-2 (AT) (ACE-2(AT)) was associated with a larger improvement of ISI(Clamp) (p = 0.013) during weight reduction over 3 months, but not with the extend of weight loss. The degree of changes in insulin resistance were preserved until month 12 and was also predicted by the weight loss induced degree of ACE-2(AT) (p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that subcutaneous adipose ACE-2 expression correlates with insulin sensitivity. Weight loss induced decline of subcutaneous adipose ACE-2 expression might affect short- and long-term improvement of myocellular insulin sensitivity, which might be also relevant in the context of ACE-2 downregulation by SARS-CoV-2.

Data were collected during the year 2020, between April 01 and June 30 in Spain and between July 13 and September 26, in the other countries studied using a self-administered online survey designed for the assessment of sociodemographic, employment, physical activity, health status, and dietary habits changes. Most participants (61.6%), mainly those from Spain, remained constant, without improving or worsening their pattern of food consumption. Among those who changed, a pattern of better eating choices prevailed (22.7%) in comparison with those who changed toward less healthy choices (15.7%). Argentina and Brazil showed the highest proportion of changes toward a healthier pattern of food consumption. Peruvians and Mexicans were less likely to make healthy changes in food consumption (OR: 0.51;95% CI: 0.4-0.6 and OR: 0.69;95% CI: 0.4-0.8, respectively), when compared to Argentinians. Most respondents did not change their pattern of meal consumption, but those who did reduced their consumption of main meals and increased intake of small meals and snacks. Although most participants affirmed to be doing physical activity at home, about one-half reported perception of weight gain. Individuals with alterations in sleep pattern (either by increasing or decreasing sleep time) were more likely to change their diets to a healthier pattern. In contrast, individuals with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and those who reported feeling anxious were more likely to perform changes to a less healthy eating pattern (OR: 1.72;95% CI: 1.2-2.3 and OR: 1.21;95% CI: 1.1-1.4, respectively). In conclusion, although most participants remained constant in their eating habits, lifestyle changes and anxiety feelings were reported. Among those who changed patterns of food consumption, healthier choices prevailed, with differences between countries. However, there were alterations in the distribution of meals, with higher consumption of snacks and small meals.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may increase the risk of population suicide through its effects on a number of well-established suicide risk factors. Observations Prior to the pandemic, many countries were engaging in suicide prevention strategies, and although the overall global burden of suicide deaths has increased, some national efforts were beginning to see positive results. Additionally, the gap between mental health needs and services has been increasing in many nations. With the added physical and mental health, social, and economic burdens imposed by the pandemic, many populations worldwide may experience increased suicide risk. Data and recent events during the first 6 months of the pandemic reveal specific effects on suicide risk. However, increases in suicide rates are not a foregone conclusion even with the negative effects of the pandemic. In fact, emerging suicide data from several countries show no evidence of an increase in suicide during the pandemic thus far. There are actionable steps that policy makers, health care leaders, and organizational leaders can take to mitigate suicide risk during and after the pandemic. Conclusions and Relevance COVID-19 presents a new and urgent opportunity to focus political will, federal investments, and global community on the vital imperative of suicide prevention.

Findings In this survey study of US adults, uninsured rates rose among low-income adults in 4 Southern states (Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas) during the COVID-19 pandemic, but in states with Medicaid expansion, uninsured rate increases were more moderate among Black and Latinx individuals. Nonfinancial barriers to care because of the pandemic were common in all states. Meaning These findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic affected insurance coverage and the ability of low-income people to access health care, but it appears that the presence of Medicaid expansion was protective for Black and Latinx individuals. Importance It is unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated economic downturn have affected insurance coverage and disparities in access to health care among low-income families and people of color in states that have and have not expanded Medicaid. Objective To determine changes in insurance coverage and disparities in access to health care among low-income families and people of color across 4 Southern states and by Medicaid expansion status. Design, Setting, and Participants This random-digit dialing telephone survey study of US citizens ages 19 to 64 years with a family income less than 138% of the federal poverty line in in 4 states (Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas) was conducted from October to December 2020. Using a difference-in-differences design, we estimated changes in outcomes by Medicaid expansion status overall and by race and ethnicity in 2020 (n = 1804) compared with 2018 to 2019 (n = 5710). We also explored barriers to health care and use of telehealth by race and ethnicity. Data analysis was conducted from January 2021 to March 2021. Exposures COVID-19 pandemic and prior Medicaid expansion status. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome was the uninsured rate and secondary outcomes were financial and nonfinancial barriers to health care access. Results Of 7514 respondents (11% response rate;3889 White non-Latinx [51.8%], 1881 Black non-Latinx [25.0%], and 1156 Latinx individuals [15.4%];4161 women [55.4%]), 5815 (77.4%) were in the states with previous expansion and 1699 (22.6%) were in Texas (nonexpansion state). Respondents in the expansion states were older, more likely White, and less likely to have attended college compared with respondents in Texas. Uninsurance rate in 2020 rose by 7.4 percentage points in Texas (95% CI, 2.2-12.6;P = .01) and 2.5 percentage points in expansion states (95% CI, ?1.9 to 7.0;P = .27), with a difference-in-differences estimate for Medicaid expansion of ?4.9% (95% CI, ?11.3 to 1.6;P = .14). Among Black and Latinx individuals, Medicaid expansion was associated with protection against a rise in the uninsured rate (difference-in-differences, ?9.5%;95% CI, ?19.0 to ?0.1;P = .048). Measures of access, including having a personal physician and regular care for chronic conditions, worsened significantly in 2020 in all 4 states, with no significant difference by Medicaid expansion status. Conclusions and Relevance In this survey of US adults, uninsured rates increased among low-income adults in 4 Southern states during the COVID-19 pandemic, but Medicaid expansion states, that association was diminished among Black and Latinx individuals. Nonfinancial barriers to care because of the pandemic were common in all states. This survey study examines changes in insurance coverage and disparities in access to health care among low-income families and people of color across 4 southern states and by Medicaid expansion status before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"COVID-19CRelated Insurance Coverage Changes and Disparities in Access to Care Among Low-Income US Adults in 4 Southern States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused significant devastation globally.

Low- and medium-income countries are more affected economically and socially compared to developed countries due to the lack of a rapid, robust, and affordable testing infrastructure. Furthermore, the high cost of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system, sophisticated user-handling procedure, and high expense of the conventional clinical tests are the root causes of the less accessibility of the testing systems to the users. In this study, a COVID-19 Point-of-Care (POC) ecosystem model is proposed for the low- and medium-income countries (or energy deprived countries) that will facilitate the technological development with locally available fabrication components. In addition, the nontechnological development phases have also been discussed, which encompasses the collaboration among academia, local as well as government bodies, and entrepreneurial ventures. In addition, a hypothetical design of a microfluidic paper-based analytical (?PADs) POC platform is proposed to detect COVID-19 analyte using unprocessed patient-derived saliva, which is a miniaturized form-factor of conventional real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The device contains four major reaction zones, which are sample zone, buffer zone, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) Master Mix zone, Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) zone, and sensor zone. To obtain quicker test results and easier operation, a handheld image acquisition technique is introduced in this study. It is hypothesized that in a remote setting, the proposed design could be used as an initial guideline to develop a POC COVID-19 testing system, which may be simple, easy-to-use, and cost-effective.","output":"Application of microfluidic paper-based analytical device (PAD) to detect COVID-19 in energy deprived countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we address three important challenges related to disease transmissions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, namely, (a) providing an early warning to likely exposed individuals, (b) identifying individuals who are asymptomatic, and (c) prescription of optimal testing when testing capacity is limited. First, we present a dynamic-graph based SEIR epidemiological model in order to describe the dynamics of the disease propagation. Our model considers a dynamic network that accounts for the interactions between individuals over time, such as the ones obtained by manual or automated contact tracing, and uses a diffusion-reaction mechanism to describe the state dynamics. This dynamic graph model helps identify likely exposed/infected individuals to whom we can provide early warnings, even before they display any symptoms and/or are asymptomatic. Moreover, when the testing capacity is limited compared to the population size, reliable estimation of individual's health state and disease transmissibility using epidemiological models is extremely challenging. Thus, estimation of state uncertainty is paramount for both eminent risk assessment, as well as for closing the tracing-testing loop by optimal testing prescription. Therefore, we propose the use of arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Expansion, a popular technique used for uncertainty quantification, to represent the states, and quantify the uncertainties in the dynamic model. This design enables us to assign uncertainty of the state of each individual, and consequently optimize the testing as to reduce the overall uncertainty given a constrained testing budget. These tools can also be used to optimize vaccine distribution to curb the disease spread when limited vaccines are available. We present a few simulation results that illustrate the performance of the proposed framework, and estimate the impact of incomplete contact tracing data.","output":"Dynamic graph and polynomial chaos based models for contact tracing data analysis and optimal testing prescription"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In times of the COVID-19 pandemic, adequate, reliable and timely information becomes even more relevant.

Longitudinal studies are needed to assess whether SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA production persists for a longer time in patients recovered from severe COVID-19 and its lasting symptoms that can have disabling consequences should also be alerted to susceptible hosts. Here, we tracked the anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody levels in a cohort of 88 COVID-19 patients. We found that 52.3% of the patients produced more anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgA than IgG or IgM, and the levels of IgA remained stable during 4C41 days of infection. One of these IgA-dominant COVID-19 patients, concurrently with IgA nephropathy (IgAN), presented with elevated serum creatinine and worse proteinuria during the infection, which continued until seven months post-infection. The serum levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD and total IgA were higher in this patient than in healthy controls. Changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota, increased IgA highly coated bacteria, and elevated concentration of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-18 were indicative of potential involvement of intestinal dysbiosis and inflammation to the systemic IgA level and, consequently, the disease progression.

In particular, the aim is to examine the relationship among the citizens who belong to Generations Y and Z and who represent the future of tourism markets, as tourists and as host communities, in three important receiving countries, namely, Egypt, Portugal and Turkey. Design/methodology/approach: This pilot project gathers data from three important receiving countries located on two continents involving 348 residents from Generations Y and Z. To identify the factors underlying the ''acceptance of restrictions and measures'' and the ''Impacts of the COVID-19 threat on safety perceptions'' a factor analysis was carried out. Notably, Pearson's correlation coefficient and a multiple linear regression analysis allowed to analyze the relationships between the two factors and a Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess the influence of individuals' country of residence. Findings: The results reveal that in general, young generations accepted the measures and restrictions imposed by the respective governments. In addition, the present pandemic has a strong impact on their safety perception in daily lives and future plans to travel. Moreover, results prove that between the three countries there are dissimilarities showing that the countries' situation regarding COVID-19 influences those two dimensions. Research limitations/implications: This study adds to the development of studies on the impacts of health risks in tourism activity, specifically on the safety measures adopted and their impacts on local receiving communities. It shows that the current pandemic is severely affecting the daily lives and plans for the future of citizens and tourists, which is in accordance with previous studies. Practical implications: The outcome of this study paves the way for policy-makers in the tourism industry because it presents experiences from Generations Y and Z members, future customers and tourist products consumers, but also from receiving communities.

Data from baseline measurements showed that only 25% of the charts in the ward had accurate measurements, 20% had correct daily totals and 14% had complete records of all intakes and losses. We collected feedback from nursing staff in the ward on what challenges they faced in using these charts and how best to support them.

Lung perfusion abnormalities have been reported in acute COVID-19 and could be suspected in patients with lingering dyspnea after the acute phase. Objectives To detect pulmonary perfusion disturbances in non-hospitalized post-COVID condition with persistent dyspnea 4-13 months after the disease onset. Methods Non-hospitalized individuals reporting persistent dyspnea after COVID-19 and matched healthy controls were prospectively recruited between October 2020 and May 2021 to undergo pulmonary dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), six-minute walk test, and self-reported scales questionnaires on dyspnea and physical activity. The DCE-MRI perfusion images were quantified into two parametric values: mean time-to-peak (TTP) and TTP ratio. Results Twenty-eight persons with post-COVID condition and persistent dyspnea (mean age 46.5+/-8.0 years, 75% women) and 22 healthy controls (mean age 44.1+/-10.8 years, 73% women) were included. The post-COVID group had higher mean pulmonary TTP (0.43+/-0.04 vs. 0.41+/-0.03, P=0.011) and higher TTP ratio (0.096+/-0.052 vs. 0.068+/-0.027, P=0.032). Notably, post-COVID males had the highest values (mean TTP 0.47+/-0.02, TTP ratio 0.160+/-0.039, P<0.001 for both values compared to male controls and post-COVID females). Correlation between dyspnea and perfusion parameters was demonstrated in the males (r=0.83, P<0.001 for mean TTP; r=0.76, P=0.003 for TTP ratio), but not in females.

Mitigation strategies often disrupt the daily lives of citizens and constrain rights and privileges. Policies intended to contain disease spread have provoked resentment, resistance, and backlash. We examine the extent to which specific COVID-19 policy responses influence the frequency of civil unrest. Combining insights from both grievance and opportunity models of dissent, we contend that pandemic response policies are most likely to lead to unrest when the grievances and opportunities created by disease mitigation strategies reinforce each other. We test our arguments with nuanced information on specific pandemic mitigation policies, combined with geo-located events data on COVID-19-related social unrest activities. We find that policies such as workplace and school closures, which induce intense grievances and reduce the opportunity cost of engaging in collective mobilization, are associated with increases in dissent activities. Policies that restrict opportunities for mobilization, such as restrictions on public transportation, reduce the number of dissent activities. Notably, economic support policies attenuate the effects of workplace closures on dissent. Our results illustrate the varying effects of pandemic mitigation policies on unrest depending on how the grievances they inspire relate to the opportunity they create.","output":"Resisting Lockdown: The Influence of COVID-19 Restrictions on Social Unrest (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic onset, many routine medical activities have been put on hold and this has deeply affected the management of patients with chronic diseases such as obstructive sleep apnea.

Between February and April 2020, the so-called first wave of the pandemic, the overall activity of sleep centers in Europe was reduced by 80%. As the international infection control authorities released guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 outbreak control, many of the national sleep societies provided strategies for a gradual re-opening of sleep facilities.

The mechanism of action is based on the disruption of binding between the RBM and the hACE2 to prevent virus uptake for replication. In this work, we applied in silico approaches to design specific competitive binders for SARS-CoV-2 S-protein receptor binding motif (RBM) by using hACE2 peptidase domain (PD) mutants. Online single point mutation servers were utilised to estimate the effect of PD mutation on the binding affinity with RBM. The PD mutants were then modelled and the binding free energy was calculated. Three PD variants were designed with an increased affinity and interaction with SARS-CoV-2-RBM. It is hope that these designs could serve as the initial work for vaccine/drug development and could eventually interfere the preliminary recognition between SARS-CoV-2 and the host cell.","output":"In silico design of ACE2 mutants for competitive binding of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain with hACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As it has been shown that lopinavir (LPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have in vitro activity against coronaviruses, they were used to treat COVID-19 during the first wave of the epidemic in Lombardy, Italy.

These peptides are bound within the peptide binding cleft of HLA, and together as a complex, are recognised by T cells using their specialised T cell receptors. Within the cleft, the peptide residue side chains bind into distinct pockets. These pockets ultimately determine the specificity of peptide binding. As HLAs are the most polymorphic molecules in humans, amino acid variants in each binding pocket influences the peptide repertoire that can be presented on the cell surface. Here, we review each of the 6 HLA binding pockets of HLA class I (HLA-I) molecules. The binding specificity of pockets B and F are strong determinants of peptide binding and have been used to classify HLA into supertypes, a useful tool to predict peptide binding to a given HLA. Over the years, peptide binding prediction has also become more reliable by using binding affinity and mass spectrometry data. Crystal structures of peptide-bound HLA molecules provide a means to interrogate the interactions between binding pockets and peptide residue side chains.

A nationwide home confinement was declared in our country by beginning of March. Cardiac rehabilitation programs (CRP) had to adapt to new health requirements and the impact of these changes is unknown. Purpose: To analyse the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in improvement of cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) with maximal oxygen consumption uptake (VO2max) and control of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with cardiovascular established disease (coronary heart disease, heart failure or cardiac surgery) included in the phase II of our centre CRP. Methods: 510 consecutive patients were evaluated. A maximal CPET was performed for each patient from the beginning and at the end of phase II of CRP. Enrolled patients were divided in two groups: from March 2019 to March 2020 (before Covid pandemic) and second one, from the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020 until February 2021. Results: 296 patients were studied in preCovid group and 214 patients were studied in Covid group. There were no statistically significant differences between these two groups in reference to cardiovascular risk factors and medical treatment (Figure 1). 82.7% of patients completed a hospital-based program in preCovid group vs 36% in Covid (p=0.001). Comparing the percentage of patients that accomplished the risk factors control targets between pre- and Covid group, statistically significant differences have been seen referring to systolic BP <140mmHg (85.1 vs 95.4%, p=0.001) and cLDL <70 mg/dl (67.2 vs 77.7%, p=0.003). However, in terms of glucose control (fasting blood glucose <110 mg/dl: 78.4 vs 82.2%, p=0.612;HbA1c <7%: 90.7 vs 92.7%, p=0.464) and weight control (BMI: 27.84.69 kg/m2 vs 27.34.07 kg/m2, p=0.299) this could not be established. There were no differences in psychological attention demand (27 vs 23.3%, p=0.695). Statistical differences between two groups were found in terms of VO2max at the beginning phase II CPET (22.77 vs 205 ml/min/kg, p=0.006) and ending phase II CPET (247 vs 216, p=0.001). Nevertheless, no differences were found in the final phase II CPET improvement between both groups (1.44.1 ml/kg/min vs 0.812.9 ml/kg/min;p=0.221) (Figure 2). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 changed our practice from an in-hospital based phase II CRP to a home-based phase II CRP. COVID-19 pandemic had no negative impact in the control of risk factors in our phase II patients. In our experience, despite preCovid phase II patients have a better functional capacity in terms of VO2max, the improvement in VO2max after phase II CRP persists in the SARS-CoV-2 era. This might show that an accurate structure of home-based program could also have great results.

Damaged endothelial cells, which break away from organs and enter the bloodstream to form circulating endothelial cells, were recently reported as putative biomarkers for COVID-19. Modulation of the expression level of sphingosine-1 phosphate via sphingosine kinase activation can control endothelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. As such, it may be possible to obtain a sensitive and specific diagnosis of the severity of COVID-19 by assessing the absolute number and the viable/apoptotic ratio of circulating endothelial cells.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective evaluation of \\"Rainbow Passage\\" voice samples from patients with and without voice disorders. METHODS Participants with (n = 30) and without (n = 23) voice disorders were recorded reading the \\"Rainbow Passage\\". Recordings were played at standardized intensity and distance-to-dictation programs on Apple iPhone 6S?, Apple iPhone 11 Pro?, and Google Voice?. Word recognition scores were calculated as the proportion of correctly transcribed words. Word recognition scores were compared to auditory-perceptual and acoustic measures. RESULTS Mean word recognition scores for participants with and without voice disorders were, respectively, 68.6% and 91.9% for Apple iPhone 6S? (P < .001), 71.2% and 93.7% for Apple iPhone 11 Pro?

Performance of many SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR assays is not entirely known due to the lack of a gold standard. We sought to evaluate the false negative rate (FNR) and sensitivity of our laboratory-developed SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR targeting the envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) genes. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR results at the Public Health Laboratory (Alberta, Canada) from January 21 to April 18, 2020 were reviewed to identify patients with an initial negative rtRT-PCR followed by a positive result on repeat testing within 14 days (defined as discordant results). Negative samples from these discordant specimens were re-tested using three alternate rtRT-PCR assays (targeting the E gene and N1/N2 regions of the nucleocapsid genes) to assess for false negative (FN) results. RESULTS: During the time period specified, 95,919 patients (100,001 samples) were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 49 patients were found to have discordant results including 49 positive and 52 negative swabs. Repeat testing of 52 negative swabs found five FNs (from five separate patients). Assuming 100% specificity of the diagnostic assay, the FNR and sensitivity in this group of patients with discordant testing was 9.3% (95% CI 1.5-17.0%) and 90.7% (95% CI 82.6-98.9%) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Studies to understand the FNR of routinely used assays are important to confirm adequate clinical performance. In this study, most FN results were due to low amounts of SARS-CoV-2 virus concentrations in patients with multiple specimens collected during different stages of infection.

Design/Methodology/Approach: Industry 4.0 leads to the mass introduction of cyber-physical systems in production, to the automation of most of the production processes, to the endowment of devices with artificial intelligence and the introduction of many other modern technologies. Biotechnology is an integral part of Industry 4.0, which involves a rapid breakthrough in the research of medicines, diagnostic methods, finding new vaccines, creating the ways to protect human organisms and biosystems, and creating artificially modified biological microorganisms. The demand for biotechnology creates the need to create and improve the legal framework for biotechnological developments. The authors used the methods of systematic analysis and comparative legal analysis to identify and consider the existing problems of the legal regulation of biotechnology in Russia. Findings: biotechnology implies significant changes in various spheres of societys activity, including a positive modification of the medical sphere, due to the wide spread of new methods of personalized medicine, and an increase in the efficiency of treatment. The issue of recognizing the increased harmfulness of certain objects or activities in relation to such areas of biotechnology as the energy waste management, biofuel production, bioenergy engineering, the prevention and elimination of environmental pollution, bioengineering, breeding technology, production of electrical energy from biomaterials, etc. remains unresolved. The liability for causing harm by activities that create increased danger, due to the inability of a person to fully control it, is one of the gaps in the current civil law regulation. The justification and assessment of recognizing certain specific types of biotechnology as a source of increased danger have yet to be objectively justified by the doctrinal basis, judicial practice and the regulations. Originality/Value: it is concluded that the high prospects of the theoretical biotechnological developments cause the need for their legalization and legislative regulation. Based on the danger, harmfulness and uncontrollability of viruses, any activity related to viruses, from their creation to the work of medical staff to treat an infected person, is recommended to be recognized as a source of increased danger. The definition of the source of increased danger is given, and the criteria for classifying an object as a source of increased danger are called. The identified criteria are compared with the characteristic features of biotechnological objects. It is suggested that the activities associated with the risk of infection with infectious diseases be considered a priori as a source of increased danger. The inability of a person to control the spread of viruses, including infection, harmfulness and increased probability of causing harm, prove the need for a separate indication in the legislation of this source and the adoption of appropriate measures for any activity in which a person is directly exposed to the contact with infection and the threat of infection and spread of the disease.","output":"Biotechnology as a Type of Converged Technologies in Industry 4.0 and a Source of Increased Danger in Civil Law of the Russian Federation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Distance correlation is a new class of multivariate dependence coefficients applicable to random vectors of arbitrary and not necessarily equal dimension.

The whole idea was to prevent intubation, since mortality rates are very high in intubated COVID19 patients. tPA is associated with <1% risk of fatal bleed. In this unprecedented pandemic with high mortality rates, thrombolysis could be an effective and safe option in carefully selected critically ill patients of COVID19.","output":"Successful use of tPA for thrombolysis in COVID related ARDS: a case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To investigate the optimal contact time and concentration for viricidal activity of oral preparation of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) against SARS-CoV-2 ('corona virus') to mitigate the risk and transmission of the virus in the dental practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) USA-WA1/2020 strain, virus stock was tested against oral antiseptic solutions consisting of aqueous povidone-iodine (PVP-I) as the sole active ingredient. The PVP-I was tested at diluted concentrations of 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5%. Test media without any virus was added to 2 tubes of the compounds to serve as toxicity and neutralization controls. Ethanol (70%) was tested in parallel as a positive control, and water only as a negative control. The test solutions and virus were incubated at room temperature (22  2 C) for time periods of 15 and 30 seconds. The solution was then neutralized by a 1/10 dilution in minimum essential medium (MEM) 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 g/mL gentamicin. Surviving virus from each sample was quantified by standard end-point dilution assay and the log reduction value (LRV) of each compound compared to the negative (water) control was calculated. RESULTS: PVP-I oral antiseptics at all tested concentrations of 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5%, completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 within 15 seconds of contact. The 70% ethanol control group was unable to completely inactivate SARS-CoV-2 after 15 seconds of contact, but was able to inactivate the virus at 30 seconds of contact. CONCLUSIONS: PVP-I oral antiseptic preparations rapidly inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro. The viricidal activity was present at the lowest concentration of 0.5 % PVP-I and at the lowest contact time of 15 seconds. This important finding can justify the use of preprocedural oral rinsing with PVP-I (for patients and health care providers) may be useful as an adjunct to personal protective equipment, for dental and surgical specialties during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Rapid In-Vitro Inactivation of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Using Povidone-Iodine Oral Antiseptic Rinse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Significant research has shown that UV-C exposure is an effective disinfectant for a range of bacteria and viruses, including coronaviruses. As such, a UV-C treatment in combination with a chemical wipe, such as EPA hydrogen peroxide, is a common cleaning protocol in a medical setting, and such disinfection protocols have gained in importance during the current COVID-19 pandemic due to the need to reuse PPE. However, given the substantial increase in patient volume, the quantity of materials requiring disinfection exceeds the UV-C equipment throughput capabilities at many medical facilities. Therefore, there is a need for a UV-C disinfection system that can be rapidly deployed. In response to this demand, we designed, constructed, and validated a UV-C disinfection system from readily accessible components;specifically, a plastic bin, UV-C light bulb and conventional light housing. To further improve the performance, the interior of the tub was spray-painted with chrome paint, forming a low quality-factor (Q) Fabry-Perot optical cavity. As part of this work, a set of modular design criteria which allows for flexibility in component selection without degradation of UV-C dose performance is established. This flexibility is critical given the current fluctuating availability of source materials.

Apart from genetic and physiological factors, this variability in drug response could also be attributed to epigenetic mechanisms. The microRNAs (miRNAs) are key epigenetic markers that play an important role in pathogenesis and drug response. Several studies have shown that miRNAs are implicated in regulating the expression of various genes involved in drug metabolism and transport. In a conventional clinical setup, it is extremely difficult to distinguish the role of miRNA in pathogenesis and drug response as it is difficult to obtain drug na?ve patients. To resolve this issue, we aimed to identify the role of antipsychotic drug treatment in inducing miRNA expression under an in vitro condition using a hepatic cell line. A liver cell line was treated with a maximum tolerable drug dosage model for haloperidol, clozapine in monotherapy, and their combination in polytherapy. Genome-wide miRNA profiling was performed using 60,000 miRNA probes in the microarray format in different treatment groups. Several miRNAs were observed to be differentially expressed impacting the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics, and epigenomics properties of antipsychotic drug treatment. Interestingly, some of these miRNA expression patterns were similar to reported miRNA observations on schizophrenia pathogenesis. This study unravels the potential role of miRNAs in the mechanism of action of the antipsychotic drug and could also reflect in drug-induced side effects.

Other aims were to report and evaluate the utility of clinical investigations performed, and describe any effect of treatment before referral on temperature at presentation and ability to make a diagnosis. METHODS Clinical records of cats with pyrexia (?39.2C) documented at least twice were retrospectively reviewed. Cases were assigned to disease categories (infectious, inflammatory, immune-mediated, neoplastic, miscellaneous and no diagnosis [pyrexia of unknown origin, PUO]) based on diagnosis. The overall value of clinical investigations was assessed by classifying them as 'enabling', 'assisting' or 'no assistance' in achieving each diagnosis. The effect of treatment before referral was assessed for any association with temperature at presentation and ability to make a diagnosis (PUO vs other disease categories). RESULTS One hundred and six cases were identified. The most common cause of pyrexia was feline infectious peritonitis (22 cats, 20.8%) and the largest disease category was infectious (41/106, 38.7%). Inflammatory conditions were found in 19 (17.9%) cats, neoplasia in 13 (12.3%), miscellaneous causes in 11 (10.4%) and immune-mediated disease in six (5.7%). No diagnosis was reached in 16 (15.0%) cats, often despite extensive diagnostic investigations. Cytology and histopathology most often 'enabled' or 'assisted' in obtaining a diagnosis. Most cats (91, 85.8%) received treatment before referral, with antimicrobial treatment given to 87 (82.1%). Prior treatment before referral was not associated with temperature at presentation nor with success in establishing a diagnosis.

We aimed to assess the association between COVID-19 policy restrictions and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this longitudinal analysis, we combined daily policy stringency data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker with psychological distress scores and life evaluations captured in the Imperial College London-YouGov COVID-19 Behaviour Tracker Global Survey in fortnightly cross-sections from samples of 15 countries between April 27, 2020, and June 28, 2021. The mental health questions provided a sample size of 432 642 valid responses, with an average of 14 918 responses every 2 weeks. To investigate how policy stringency was associated with mental health, we considered two potential mediators: observed physical distancing and perceptions of the government's handling of the pandemic. Countries were grouped on the basis of their response to the COVID-19 pandemic as those pursuing an elimination strategy (countries that aimed to eliminate community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within their borders) or those pursuing a mitigation strategy (countries that aimed to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission). Using a combined dataset of country-level and individual-level data, we estimated linear regression models with country-fixed effects (ie, dummy variables representing the countries in our sample) and with individual and contextual covariates. Additionally, we analysed data from a sample of Nordic countries, to compare Sweden (that pursued a mitigation strategy) to other Nordic countries (that adopted a near-elimination strategy). FINDINGS: Controlling for individual and contextual variables, higher policy stringency was associated with higher mean psychological distress scores and lower life evaluations (standardised coefficients =0014 [95% CI 0005 to 0023] for psychological distress; =C0010 [C0015 to C0004] for life evaluation). Pandemic intensity (number of deaths per 100 000 inhabitants) was also associated with higher mean psychological distress scores and lower life evaluations (standardised coefficients =0016 [0008 to 0025] for psychological distress; =C0010 [C0017 to C0004] for life evaluation). The negative association between policy stringency and mental health was mediated by observed physical distancing and perceptions of the government's handling of the pandemic. We observed that countries pursuing an elimination strategy used different policy timings and intensities compared with countries pursuing a mitigation strategy. The containment policies of countries pursuing elimination strategies were on average less stringent, and fewer deaths were observed. INTERPRETATION: Changes in mental health measures during the first 15 months of the COVID-19 pandemic were small. More stringent COVID-19 policies were associated with poorer mental health. Elimination strategies minimised transmission and deaths, while restricting mental health effects.

However, conventional solvent extraction involves the excessive use of organic solvents, costly equipment, and tedious operation. These limitations of conventional extraction methods could be prospectively overcome by the carotenoidCpectin hydrocolloidal complexation. The complexation of lycopene and pectin was efficiently promoted in an aqueous environment, resulting in the colloidal complexes that can be subsequently recovered by sedimentation or centrifugation. In this study, the potential of carotenoidCpectin complexation on tomato pomace containing carotenoids and pectin was evaluated. Tomato pomace is a rich source of lycopene, -carotene as well as pectin, making it suitable as the raw material for the carotenoid extraction. The extraction of carotenoid and pectin from tomato pomace was optimized using response surface methodology. The maximum recovery was 9.43 mg carotenoid fractions/100 g tomato pomace, while the purity of carotenoid-rich fractions was 92%. The antioxidant capacity of carotenoids extracted from the complexation method was found to be higher than that from the solvent extraction method. Moreover, extraction yield and antioxidant capacity of carotenoid obtained from the carotenoidCpectin complexation were comparable to that from solvent extraction. The carotenoidCpectin complexation is a promising green approach to valorize agro by-products for the extraction of valuable carotenoids.","output":"Extraction of Carotenoids from Tomato Pomace via Water-Induced Hydrocolloidal Complexation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The hallmark of severe COVID-19 is an uncontrolled inflammatory response, resulting from poorly understood immunological dysfunction.

These Tregs showed a distinct transcriptional signature, with overexpression of several suppressive effectors, but also proinflammatory molecules like interleukin (IL)-32, and a striking similarity to tumor-infiltrating Tregs that suppress antitumor responses. Most marked during acute severe disease, these traits persisted somewhat in convalescent patients. A screen for candidate agents revealed that IL-6 and IL-18 may individually contribute different facets of these COVID-19Clinked perturbations.

In the current study, we sought to determine the estimated time to recovery for vascular surgery procedures delayed due to COVID-19 in a regional health system METHODS: Utilizing data from a 35-hospital regional vascular surgical collaborative consisting of all hospitals performing vascular surgery in the state of Michigan, a 35-hospital regional health collaborative consisting of all hospitals completing vascular surgery procedures within the state of Michigan, we estimated delayed surgical cases for adults undergoing carotid endarterectomy, carotid stenting, endovascular and open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and lower extremity bypass. We utilized Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models to predict surgical volume in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic and utilized historical data to predict elective surgical recovery time. RESULTS: Median statewide monthly vascular surgical volume for the study period was 439 procedures, with a maximum statewide monthly case volume of 519 procedures. For the month of April 2020, elective vascular surgery procedural volume decreased by approximately 90%. Significant variability was seen in estimated hospital capacity as well as estimated backlogged cases, with the recovery of elective cases estimated to take approximately 8 months. If hospitals across the collaborative share the burden of backlogged cases, the recovery could be shortened to approximately 3 months. CONCLUSION: In this study of vascular surgical volume in a regional health collaborative, elective surgical procedures decreased by 90% resulting in a backlog of over 700 cases. Recovery time if all hospitals in the collaborative share the burden of backlogged cases would be reduced from 8 months to 3 months, underscoring the necessity of regional and statewide policies to minimize patient harm due to delays in recovery for elective surgery.","output":"Modeling the Elective Vascular Surgery Recovery After COVID-19: Implications for Moving Forward"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We identified co-infection with 4 species of mycobacteria in a woman in New York, New York, USA, by using next-generation sequencing.

Collectively, and to a significant extent in partnership with the sun, microbes are the life support system of the biosphere. This necessitates their due consideration in decisions that are taken by individuals and families in everyday life, as well as by individuals and responsible bodies at all levels and stages of community, national and planetary health assessment, planning, and the formulation of pertinent policies. However, unlike other subjects having a pervasive impact upon humankind, such as financial affairs, health, and transportation, of which there is a widespread understanding, knowledge of relevant microbial activities, how they impact our lives, and how they may be harnessed for the benefit of humankind - microbiology literacy - is lacking in the general population, and in the subsets thereof that constitute the decision makers. Choices involving microbial activity implications are often opaque, and the information available is sometimes biased and usually incomplete, and hence creates considerable uncertainty. As a consequence, even evidence-based 'best' decisions, not infrequently lead to unpredicted, unintended, and sometimes undesired outcomes. We therefore contend that microbiology literacy in society is indispensable for informed personal decisions, as well as for policy development in government and business, and for knowledgeable input of societal stakeholders in such policymaking. An understanding of key microbial activities is as essential for transitioning from childhood to adulthood as some subjects currently taught at school, and must therefore be acquired during general education. Microbiology literacy needs to become part of the world citizen job description. To facilitate the attainment of microbiology literacy in society, through its incorporation into education curricula, we propose here a basic teaching concept and format that are adaptable to all ages, from pre-school to high school, and places key microbial activities in the contexts of how they affect our everyday lives, of relevant Grand Challenges facing humanity and planet Earth, and of sustainability and Sustainable Development Goals. We exhort microbiologists, microbiological learned societies and microbiology-literate professionals, to participate in and contribute to this initiative by helping to evolve the basic concept, developing and seeking funding to develop child-friendly, appealing teaching tools and materials, enhancing its impact and, most importantly, convincing educators, policy makers, business leaders and relevant governmental and non-governmental agencies to support and promote this initiative.

RESULTS: Scenarios prescribing PrEP based on criminal justice system involvement reduced HIV transmissions. The NNT ranged from 147 (couples-based scenario) to 300 (recently released scenario). The percentage of the female population covered by PrEP at any one time ranged from 0.14% (couples-based) to 10.8% (CDC-based). CDC-guideline scenarios were consistently less efficient compared to the justice-involved interventions. CONCLUSION: Expanding PrEP for AfricanCAmerican women and their male partners affected by incarceration should be considered in national HIV prevention goals and correctional facilities leveraged as intervention sites. Partner characteristics in the current CDC indications may be more effective and efficient if guidelines considered criminal justice involvement.","output":"Preexposure prophylaxis strategies for AfricanCAmerican women affected by mass incarceration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wireless capsule endoscopy (CE) was introduced in 2000 as a less invasive method to visualize the distal small bowel in adults.

However, the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections is likely to be higher than the confirmed case counts because many infected people have mild or no symptoms, and limitations exist with regard to testing capacity and surveillance systems in Zambia. We aimed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in six districts of Zambia in July, 2020, using a population-based household survey. METHODS: Between July 4 and July 27, 2020, we did a cross-sectional cluster-sample survey of households in six districts of Zambia. Within each district, 16 standardised enumeration areas were randomly selected as primary sampling units using probability proportional to size. 20 households from each standardised enumeration area were selected using simple random sampling. All members of selected households were eligible to participate. Consenting participants completed a questionnaire and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using real-time PCR (rtPCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using ELISA. Prevalence estimates, adjusted for the survey design, were calculated for each diagnostic test separately, and combined. We applied the prevalence estimates to census population projections for each district to derive the estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. FINDINGS: Overall, 4258 people from 1866 households participated in the study. The median age of participants was 182 years (IQR 77-314) and 506% of participants were female. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence for the combined measure was 106% (95% CI 73-139). The rtPCR-positive prevalence was 76% (47-106) and ELISA-positive prevalence was 21% (11-31). An estimated 454 708 SARS-CoV-2 infections (95% CI 312 705-596 713) occurred in the six districts between March and July, 2020, compared with 4917 laboratory-confirmed cases reported in official statistics from the Zambia National Public Health Institute. INTERPRETATION: The estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections was much higher than the number of reported cases in six districts in Zambia. The high rtPCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was consistent with observed community transmission during the study period. The low ELISA-positive SARS-CoV-2 prevalence might be associated with mitigation measures instituted after initial cases were reported in March, 2020. Zambia should monitor patterns of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and promote measures that can reduce transmission.

METHODS The present study was a single-institution retrospective study. Of the 173 obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing gastric bypass surgery between January 2000 and July 2004, 78 patients (45%) were followed for at least 10 years. The control group consisted of 80 diabetic obese patients from the same period with similar body mass index, age, race, and severity of diabetes. The median follow-up was 11 years for both the groups. RESULTS The group undergoing gastric bypass surgery had greater percentage of excess weight loss than the control group-66% versus -1.6%, respectively. Forty-one patients (52.6%) in the surgery group had complete remission of diabetes and 5 (6.4%) had partial remission. Twelve patients (15.4%) had diabetes recurrence after initial remission. No patient in the control group had remission of diabetes. Compared with the control group, the group undergoing gastric bypass surgery had a significantly reduced incidence of microvascular complications-46.3% versus 11.5%, and macrovascular complications-20.3% versus 5%, respectively (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS In this study, we demonstrated that after 10 years of follow-up, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, compared with nonsurgical medical management, resulted in significantly greater weight loss, reduction in hemoglobin A1c, and use of antidiabetic medications, and very importantly a lower incidence of both microvascular and macrovascular complications in obese patients with type 2 diabetes.","output":"Gastric Bypass Surgery Leads to Long-term Remission or Improvement of Type 2 Diabetes and Significant Decrease of Microvascular and Macrovascular Complications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I..

METHODS: We performed a multicentre cohort study among hospitalized (>24 hours) patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from February 22 to April 3 2020, at 11 Italian hospitals. Patients were divided into derivation and validation cohorts according to random sorting of hospitals. SRF was assessed from admission to hospital discharge and was defined as: SpO2<93% with 100% FiO2, respiratory rate (RR)>30bpm, or respiratory distress. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to identify predictors of SRF, -coefficients were used to develop a risk score. Trial Registration NCT04316949. RESULTS: We analyzed 1113 patients (644 derivation, 469 validation cohort). Mean (standard deviation)age was 65.7(15) years, 704 (63.3%) were male. SRF occurred in 189/644 (29%) and 187/469 (40%) patients in derivation and validation cohort, respectively.

The measures often include physical distancing that aims to reduce the number of contacts in the population. Little is known about the actual reduction in number of contacts as a consequence of physical distancing measures. Methods In the Netherlands, a cross-sectional survey was carried out in 2016/2017 in which 8179 participants retrospectively reported the number, age and gender of different persons they had contacted (spoken to in person or touched) during the previous day. The survey was repeated among 2830 of the original participants, using the same questionnaire, in March and April 2020 after physical distancing measures had been implemented. Results The average number of contacts in the community was reduced from on average 12.5 (interquartile range: 2-17) to 3.7 (interquartile range: 0-4) different persons per participant, a reduction of 71% (95% confidence interval: 71-71). The reduction in the number of community contacts was highest for children and adolescents (between 5 and 20 years) and smallest for elderly persons of 80 years and older. The reduction in the effective number of total contacts, measured as the largest eigenvalue of the matrix with community and household contacts, was 62% (95% confidence interval: 48 - 72).

Endovascular treatment has become an alternative to surgical clipping and the primary method of choice. Aim To assess the treatment results of ruptured and unruptured ACoA aneurysms and to assess the incidence of intraprocedural complications and various factors influencing these aspects. Material and methods One hundred and eleven embolizations of ACoA aneurysms (80.7% ruptured and 19.3% unruptured) were retrospectively analysed. The methods of embolization were: coiling, balloon-assisted coiling, stent-assisted coiling. Morphology and dimensions of aneurysms were assessed on 3D digital subtraction angiography (DSA) images. Medical records were analysed for patient's clinical status at admission, intraprocedural complications, follow-up examination and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 1 month after discharge. Results Immediately after the procedure 56.9% of patients had Raymond-Roy Occlusion Classification (RROC) class I, 37.6% class II and 5.5% class III. The overall intraprocedural complication rate was 6.6%. There were significantly more cases of bleeding (p = 0.012) and coil prolapse (p = 0.012) during the procedures ending with higher packing density. Twenty-eight (25.7%) patients died during hospital stay, 27 (96.4%) with ruptured aneurysm. In the follow-up of 41 patients, RROC was the same or improved in 73.2% of cases and recanalization occurred in 26.8%. Six patients with aneurysm recanalization underwent repeat embolization. Conclusions Endovascular embolization of ACoA aneurysms is an effective and safe treatment method. The most powerful factor influencing the incidence of complications is packing density.

We ran a controlled interrupted time series (ITS) using negative binomial regression to compare rates before and during the pandemic. FindingsIn 262,644 individuals, pre-pandemic consultation rates per person-year were 4.35 (4.34-4.36) for migrants and 4.6 (4.59-4.6) for non-migrants (RR:0.94 [0.92-0.96]).

OBJECTIVE: To assess postquarantine transmission risk for various quarantine lengths and potential associations between quarantine strictness and transmission risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study in 4 US universities from September 2020 to February 2021, including 3641 university students and staff who were identified as close contacts to individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Individuals were tested throughout the 10 to 14Cday quarantine, and follow-up testing continued at least weekly throughout the 2020-2021 academic year. EXPOSURES: Strict quarantine, including designated housing with a private room, private bathroom, and meal delivery, vs nonstrict, which potentially included interactions with household members. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Dates of last known exposure, last negative test result, and first positive test result during quarantine. RESULTS: This study included 301 quarantined university students and staff who tested SARS-CoV-2Cpositive (of 3641 quarantined total). These 301 individuals had a median (IQR) age of 22.0 (20.0-25.0) years; 131 (43.5%) identified as female; and 20 (6.6%) were staff. Of the 287 self-reporting race and ethnicity according to university-defined classifications, 21 (7.3%) were African American or Black, 60 (20.9%) Asian, 17 (5.9%) Hispanic or Latinx, 174 (60.6%) White, and 15 (5.2%) other (including multiracial and/or multiethnic).

Searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were conducted on April 7, 2020. Included studies: (1) examined the effect of breaking up prolonged SB in adults with or at elevated risk for T2D and (2) assessed a vascular health outcome, such as blood pressure (BP), flow-mediated dilation (FMD), pulse-wave velocity, or endothelin-1. A total of 20 articles (17 unique studies) were included. Only three studies reported adequate statistical power for the specified vascular outcome. The available evidence suggests that light and moderate intensity activity breaks are effective in acutely lowering BP when compared to prolonged sitting. The small number of studies that included FMD or other vascular outcomes prohibits conclusions regarding the impact of SB breaks on these outcomes. Few studies evaluating the impact of breaking up SB among adults at risk for T2D have included and been adequately powered to examine vascular outcomes, but our preliminary finding, that certain SB breaks improve BP, provides proof-of-concept for this line of inquiry. Future studies should examine both the acute and chronic vascular effects of breaking up SB among individuals most vulnerable to the effects of SB (e.g. older adults, those with T2D), as these individuals are both highly sedentary and at greatest risk of poor health outcomes.

The aim of this review was to systematically explore and synthesise scientific evidence on how women experience and cope with induced abortion. The guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence were used as a framework to review current international and national literature. The researchers made use of Ebsco Discovery Service to search for relevant studies. This was done by employing key concepts and related synonyms. Eleven relevant studies were identified. As the study was exploratory in nature, covering a relatively small selection of studies, heterogeneous in methodology and cultural focus, only a few general trends were highlighted. Not much information was found for women in the South African context. The study found that socio-economic disadvantages and premorbid relationships are important factors that should be better researched, understood and managed in a South African context. Despite many studies on how women experience and cope with induced abortion, the review revealed the need for research related to specific challenges and experiences of South African women.","output":"The experience of and coping with an induced abortion: A rapid review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The complex communities of microbes that constitute the human microbiome are influenced by host and environmental factors. Here, we address how a fundamental aspect of human biology, blood type, contributes to shaping this microscopic ecosystem. Although this question remains largely unexplored, we glean insights from decades of work describing relationships between pathogens and blood type. The bacterial strategies, molecular mechanisms, and host responses that shaped those relationships may parallel those that characterize how blood type and commensals interact. Understanding these nuanced interactions will expand our capacity to analyze and manipulate the human microbiome.","output":"Blood type and the microbiome- untangling a complex relationship with lessons from pathogens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The availability of continuing professional development (CPD) activities does not necessarily translate into good participation by health practitioners. Reasons for low participation include time constraints, cost of some activities, irrelevant material and lack of access. This study aimed to explore the views of medical practitioners working in Eswatini regarding the factors that affect their participation in CPD programmes. METHODS: A qualitative study using seven in-depth semi-structured interviews and three focus group discussions (FGDs) of medical officers working in the public heath sectors in Eswatini was conducted between November 2020 and February 2021. Open-ended questions were used to explore factors that both motivate and demotivate medical officers participation in CPD activities. The interviews and FGDs were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim, the qualitative data were analysed using the thematic approach. RESULTS: The emerging motivating themes described by the participants were: (1) professional responsibility and (2) personal interest and learning need. Whilst the demotivating factors were: (1) non-relevance to clinical practice, (2) cost of participation, (3) lack of reward, and (4) no recognition for staying up-to-date. CONCLUSION: The motivating factors are associated with deep learning and linked well with the principles of adult learning. The demotivating factors found were in keeping with findings from other studies in a variety of countries. It is important for the Medical Council and CPD organisers to be aware of the different motivations and de-motivations for practitioners to engage in CPD to enable them to plan and implement their programmes effectively.","output":"Continuing professional development in Eswatini: Factors affecting medical practitioners participation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease\\\\19 (COVID\\\\19) vaccines are massively administered globally and some adverse events, such as myocarditis, are being reported.
